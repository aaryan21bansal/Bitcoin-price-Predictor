"China has warned the UK not to ""interfere in its domestic affairs"" amid a growing diplomatic row over the recent protests in Hong Kong. Its UK ambassador said relations had been ""damaged"" by comments by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and others backing the demonstrators' actions. Liu Xiaoming said those who illegally occupied Hong Kong's parliament should be ""condemned as law breakers"". The ambassador was later summoned to the Foreign Office over the remarks. A Foreign Office spokesman said Sir Simon McDonald, permanent under secretary and head of the diplomatic service, told the ambassador his comments were ""unacceptable and inaccurate"". Earlier, Prime Minister Theresa May said she had raised concerns with Chinese leaders. Weeks of mass protests in the territory over a controversial extradition bill exploded on Monday, when a group of activists occupied the Legislative Council building for several hours after breaking away from a peaceful protest - raising the colonial-era British flag. Critics say the extradition bill could be used to send political dissidents from Hong Kong to the mainland. Demonstrators have also broadened their demands to include the release of all detained activists and investigations into alleged police violence. In the middle of the demonstrations, Mr Hunt pledged his ""unwavering"" support to the ex-British colony and its citizens' freedoms. Allow Twitter content?

In a series of broadcast interviews and posts on social media, Mr Hunt repeated the message that the protesters should refrain from violence, but urged China to listen to the concerns of the Hong Kong people. Did Hong Kong violence sway public opinion? What graffiti says about Hong Kong's evolving anger Hong Kong protests trample rule of law - China Beijing has made a formal complaint about Mr Hunt, accusing the Conservative leadership contender of ""colonial-era delusions"". But Mr Liu said he was ""disappointed"" by the UK's response. He said the countries' relationship was based on mutual respect and suggested there would be further ""problems"" if the UK did not recognise China's sovereignty over Hong Kong, its ""territorial integrity and principle of non-interference in domestic affairs"". He said it was ""hypocritical"" of UK politicians to criticise the lack of democracy and civil rights in Hong Kong when, under British rule, there had been no elections nor right to protest. The recent unrest, he added, was ""not about freedom but about breaking the law"". The background you need on the Hong Kong protests In response, Mr Hunt said good relations between countries were based on ""honouring the legally binding relationships between them"" - a reference to a 1984 treaty between the UK and China which paved the way for sovereignty over the territory to pass back to Beijing.

The Joint Declaration, signed by Margaret Thatcher and the then Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, set out how the rights of Hong Kong citizens should be protected in the territory's Basic Law under Chinese rule. Hong Kong has, since 1997, been run by China under a ""one country, two systems"" arrangement guaranteeing it a level of economic autonomy and personal freedoms not permitted on the mainland. The ambassador gave the British government both barrels at his press conference earlier. What's fascinating is there was no pretence, no attempt to gloss this over at all. This was visceral and system-wide. This is merely the British side of things, the same message is coming from Beijing and Hong Kong too. There is definite push-back from the whole Chinese machine. The British are so infuriated that they've summoned the ambassador almost immediately to give him a dressing down. What was a war of words now risks becoming a substantial issue between the two countries. The Foreign Office has said it continues to make it clear to the Chinese government, both in public and private, that the rights of Hong Kong residents must be fully respected. Speaking on Wednesday, Theresa May said she had raised her concerns directly with Chinese leaders at the recent G20 meeting. ""It is vital that Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and the rights and freedoms set down in the Sino-British joint declaration are respected,"" she told MPs. Successive UK governments have heralded a ""golden era"" in economic relations with China, with growing levels of trade and foreign investment. But critics say this has come at the expense of turning a blind eye to human rights violations in China and Beijing's increasing economic nationalism.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Nick Beake inside the Legislative Council after protests in 2019 On Monday night, protesters in Hong Kong broke into the parliamentary building, smashing metal shutters and breaking glass. They ransacked the main chamber of the Legislative Council - known in Hong Kong as LegCo - in what Chief Executive Carrie Lam called an ""extreme use of violence"". The group were a small branch of a largely leaderless protest movement sparked by a controversial, now suspended, extradition bill. Hong Kong protests trample rule of law - China Why are there protests in Hong Kong? The protesters were evicted after a few hours, but the graffiti they left behind tells us a lot about the evolving nature of these protests. Hong Kong is a semi-autonomous part of China, and LegCo is where its government sits and bills are debated and passed. Protesters are now showing their anger and frustration through graffiti Central on the main wall of the chamber is the territory's emblem. In English, it says Hong Kong, but in Chinese it reads: ""The Regional Emblem of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China"". The protesters defaced a portion of the emblem bearing the word ""China"", leaving the Hong Kong part of the emblem untouched. Under the Basic Law, in place since Hong Kong was handed back to China by the UK in 1997, Hong Kong is guaranteed a level of autonomy and has freedoms not available in mainland China. It keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system. But critics say this is under threat from an increasingly assertive China. The extradition bill, that would have enabled suspects in Hong Kong to be sent to China, was cited as proof of this, sparking massive protests. In pictures: HK protesters storm parliament Young, radical and ready for tear gas The bill has been suspended - and is unlikely ever to pass. But the defacing of the bill is indicative of the anger many in Hong Kong have towards China. The protesters also draped a colonial-era Hong Kong flag on the podium inside LegCo. It's a sign of Hong Kong's history as a British colony and is being seen as a message to the former colonisers, calling on the UK to hold China to account. The British colonial flag was draped inside the government's legislative council building One Hong Kong journalist said the flag was not a sign, as some have suggested, that the protesters want a return to British rule. ""Whatever the British Hong Kong flag means today, Beijing wouldn't be pleased to see it. And that might have been the point of putting it in front of the world's cameras,"" said Inkstone editor Alan Wong on Twitter. Hong Kong profile This black banner which was installed over the podium reads: ""There are no rioters, only a tyranny."" ""There are no rioters, only a tyranny"", reads this sign The Hong Kong governmentdescribed violent clashes on 12 June between protesters and police as a riot- something else that has angered the demonstrators. The term rioting is a serious one, it's an offence punishable by up to 10 years in jail. Protesters want the government to drop this term. The phrase ""Hong Kong's sunflower"" can also be seen on the walls. ""Hong Kong's Sunflower"" It's a reference to theSunflower Movement protests that took place in Taiwan in 2014when a controversial trade agreement led students and activists to occupy Taiwan's parliament. They were protesting against what they said was a sign of Beijing's growing influence over Taiwan - the same thing they say is happening in Hong Kong right now. References to the police being ""dogs"" were sprayed repeatedly on these glass doors and elsewhere. The phrase ""dog officers"" can be seen scrawled all over the glass doors Protesters have frequently described the city's police force as ""lapdogs"" of the government, occasionally of Beijing too. It was 12 June that proved to be a turning point in the relationship between the police and the people. It first started out as another protest, but protesters and police officers soon clashed on the streets. Protesters were seen throwing items at police, who responded by spraying tear gas and firing rubber bullets. This video can not be played Joshua Wong: Why activists broke into parliament Footage has been circulating showing some officers dragging protesters and beating them with batons. Human Rights Watch called it a ""well-documented use of excessive force against peaceful protesters"". Protesters have been demanding an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality. But there have also beenlarge demonstrations in support of the Hong Kong police. The police commissioner has rejected allegations of excessive force, saying many police officers have been injured in the unrest. A slogan sprayed on one of the columns in the Legislative Council reads: ""It was you who taught me peaceful marches did not work."" Allow Twitter content?

It appears to be directed at Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, who despite protests of up to a million people prior to 12 June, had remained adamant that the extradition bill would not be suspended. Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts Young and unhappy in Hong Kong The government later backed down and suspended the bill, and Ms Lam indicated that it would likely not pass. However the bill has been perceived as being part of a wider agenda that aims to move Hong Kong further down a path of becoming a fully ""Chinese city"", without its unique freedoms. What was the Umbrella Movement about? Is this proof Hong Kong's 'Umbrella Protests' failed? The Chinese characters for ""freedom"" - sprayed on this screen in LegCo - sum up why people in Hong Kong say they are protesting. This simply reads 'Freedom' Under a deal struck with Britain that saw Hong Kong return to China in 1997, the city was guaranteed to enjoy ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"" for 50 years. The Basic Law ends in 2047, and what happens to Hong Kong's autonomy after that is unclear, which is fuelling the protesters' sense of urgency.

" By Ashley John-Baptiste A row of council houses photographed from the front on a sunny day A row of council houses photographed from the front on a sunny day Joanne has lived in Wythenshawe for half a century. She lives on the estate with her partner Nelly and their son in the Benchill neighbourhood. Joanne Joanne Their house is semi-detached, with pastel-coloured render covering the exterior and a red tiled roof. There are a couple of satellite dishes. In the concrete front garden the family car is parked. Light floods the living room. There is an imposing fireplace, topped with a mirror. “I love the fireplace,” says Joanne. “I’m proud that I put it in myself.” She owns the house but it hasn’t always belonged to her. Until 2005 she rented it from the council. The improvements are worth it, she thinks. “My dad used to tell me - that when I close my front door, my house is my castle. I have to make my space comfortable.” Her work has maximised the space. “I’ve taken out the kitchen toilet and have made a larder for my jars in its place.” A sign in the kitchen reads: “Joanne’s Kitchen: Where friends meet and hearts warm.” But her favourite place is the back garden. Filled with lush plants and bushes,  and dotted with stone features, the garden has a narrow pathway that curves through a patch of neatly trimmed grass. It’s a tranquil space and testament to two things - the pride former tenants take in their houses and the century-old spirit of the garden city. Joanne with her partner Nelly Joanne with her partner Nelly Joanne moved to the area when she was seven, with her parents and six siblings. She still remembers people telling stories about the early days of Wythenshawe. “It felt like the countryside, I was told. There were horses in the fields - much more of a green belt than what it’s now become.” Wythenshawe is one of the oldest council estates in the UK and was one of the largest. But it has had to endure criticism over the years. In 2007, when Conservative leader David Cameron wanted to highlight the issue of anti-social behaviour, he went to Wythenshawe. A photograph of a hooded youth pointing his fingers like a gun was widely used in newspapers.  Parts of the comedy Shameless were filmed in Wythenshawe, and last year a Channel 5 documentary was criticised for highlighting sensationalist comments about the area. One person said: “To be beaten to death on the way to buy a pint of milk from the shops would be quite commonplace.” There was annoyance locally at the negative portrayal. But these views aren’t just restricted to Wythenshawe. This is a sharp stigma affecting many estates across the UK. Joanne has been on both sides of a divide in perception. “When you tell people you own your own home - they approve. If you don’t they look down on you. It’s terrible if they find out you live in council housing,” says Joanne. Joanne's view is one that I can relate to. I once feared what people would think of me. Having grown up in foster care in south-east London for most of my childhood - I left the care system at 18. I had to bid for council flats. I can still recall the shame and unease and the overwhelming anxiety - wondering what people would think of me for living in a council flat. Despite the hardship of growing up in care and being shunted between five different foster homes and care homes – I was fortunate to gain a place at Cambridge University to study history. Ashley John-Baptiste Ashley John-Baptiste One of my biggest fears about going to such an elite university, full of privilege, was - what would people think of me for living in a council flat? As a result of my inner fear, I shied away from talking about home. While I couldn’t pinpoint where attitudes stemmed from or why they existed - I was always paranoid about what people would think of me for living in a council home. As a result, I avoided telling people. The stigma that many tenants now feel is a long way away from the original spirit that drove the construction of council houses. Wythenshawe and dozens of estates around the country were born out of an extraordinary change 100 years ago - a vision of how housing should be in a country recovering from a cataclysm.

As a result, I avoided telling people. The stigma that many tenants now feel is a long way away from the original spirit that drove the construction of council houses. Wythenshawe and dozens of estates around the country were born out of an extraordinary change 100 years ago - a vision of how housing should be in a country recovering from a cataclysm. On 23 November 1918, less than a fortnight after the end of World War One, Prime Minister David Lloyd George set out his vision. “What is our task? To make Britain a fit country for heroes to live in. “There are millions of men who will come back. Let us make this a land fit for such men to live in. There is no time to lose.” The era of the council home started with an influx of returning soldiers, sailors and airmen and the feeling they should not return to the slums of the pre-war era. There was broad support for lower-density housing built on cheaper, rural land. There had been public housing in Britain in the 19th Century built by philanthropists, charitable trusts and councils. But the end of World War One saw the first concerted nationwide effort for public house construction. Standards were to be improved. Towards the end of the war, the architect and MP Sir John Tudor Walters and a committee of experts were asked by the government to create a blueprint for housing for working-class people. One of the experts was Raymond Unwin, an architect and planner who had been a major figure in the garden city movement. The committee’s 1918 report was hugely influential. The experts had investigated virtually every aspect of housing. “Medical opinion is unanimous as to the importance of allowing plenty of sunshine to penetrate into the rooms,” the report said. It recommended a general distance of 70ft between rows of houses facing each other. There would be 12 houses to an acre in urban areas and eight in rural areas. One of the biggest questions the committee addressed was whether houses needed parlours - a room in addition to the living room and scullery (kitchen). “The desire for the parlour or third room is remarkably widespread among both urban and rural workers,” the report said.  “Witnesses state that the parlour is needed to enable the older members of the family to hold social intercourse with their friends without interruption from the children, that it is required in cases of sickness in the house, as a quiet room for convalescent members of the family… that it is needed for the youth of the family in order that they might meet their friends.” Walters thought there should be parlours in a large proportion of houses in all schemes but without reducing the size of the other rooms. The ceilings in the houses would be 8ft high on average. (That's slightly higher than the typical standard in the UK today - 2.4m or 7ft 10in.) The smallest houses without parlours would be well over 800 sq ft and the largest with parlours would be over 1,100 sq ft. Even in the smaller houses, the smallest bedroom would be 8 x 8ft. Walters demanded basic standards and facilities. These new houses would each have a bath, and three bedrooms. 1929: Becontree in Essex was one of the first council estates in England 1929: Becontree in Essex was one of the first council estates in England The committee had created a series of templates for houses that councils could use as a starting point. They were to be pleasant to live in but economical with materials and labour. The committee’s work helped inspire the 1919 Housing and Town Planning Act. Known as the Addison Act, after the then minister of health, the new legislation provided councils with subsidies to build houses in areas where there was high demand. Manchester was one of the cities that desperately needed new housing. In March 1920, town planner Patrick Abercrombie identified Wythenshawe as the only undeveloped land suitable for building a housing estate close to the city. It was intended to be a garden city, separated from Manchester by a stretch of green belt. In December that year, the Corporation of Manchester decided to purchase 2,500 acres of land. 1930: Construction in Wythenshawe 1930: Construction in Wythenshawe Building started in earnest after 1931 when Wythenshawe was redesignated as part of Manchester. By 1945 its Royal Oak, Benchill and Sharston neighbourhoods had an estimated combined population of 21,000. As estates like Wythenshawe developed across the country they significantly altered the landscape of British housing. The Becontree estate near Barking was started in 1921 and saw the building of 25,000 houses by 1935. According to social historian John Boughton, council houses were initially for the more affluent working classes. They were far from slum housing. “They had a sense of being respectable and of higher status; for those with larger, steady incomes.” Even with fluctuating grants, council building continued throughout the interwar period but it wasn’t until after World War Two that council housing moved to its next stage. Bombing had left the country needing hundreds of thousands more homes. 1937: Aerial view of Wythenshawe 1937: Aerial view of Wythenshawe Clement Attlee’s post-war Labour government built more than a million homes, 80% of which were council houses. With resources tight there were cheaper solutions employed. Prefabs - factory built, single storey, temporary bungalows - were expected to last for only 10 years, but they proved popular with many residents. Some prefabs lasted decades beyond their planned lifespan. Wythenshawe had its share. “We called them the tin houses,” says Joanne. “Anytime it rained, you’d hear a lot of noise.” In addition to prefabs, a new form of construction was pioneered - Precast Reinforced Concrete (PRC). These houses were quick and cheap to build and intended to last much longer than the prefabs. 1949: Post-WW2 construction in Wythenshawe 1949: Post-WW2 construction in Wythenshawe  Joanne lives in a PRC. “This is a concrete house,” she says glancing around her living room. “The bedrooms could have been designed better though; they are too small... [the] staircase too narrow.”  Slum clearance continued in the 1950s with the Conservatives in power. Over the next couple of decades millions were uprooted from cramped, rundown inner-city terraces and rehoused in purpose-built new towns or in flats in high-rise blocks. Many families had their first indoor toilet. Joanne still vividly remembers hers. “I got my first indoor toilet when I moved to Wythenshawe with my family in the 1970s. It was posh. We didn’t have to go outside in the dark. We were delighted.” The way working-class Britons lived had changed. By the end of the 1970s there were nearly 6.5 million council homes - but another change was coming. Manchester was one of the cities that desperately needed new housing.

They were knee jerk responses to the war. Not thought out.’ In addition to prefabs, a new form of construction was pioneered - Pre-cast Reinforced Concrete (PRC).

The house effectively came with the job. “It was a sunshine house. You had two massive windows at the front and at the back. Our bedroom, which I shared with three of my siblings, would get flooded with light in the morning. “I remember moving here and having a garden to play in - that was the first thing I noticed. We shared it with our neighbours,” she smiles with fondness. Joanne holds a photo of her father Joanne holds a photo of her father The house had three bedrooms, but with six siblings, Joanne got used to sharing. “I loved that house. I especially loved my bedroom. I decorated it myself - in pink flowered wallpaper and blooms. I also had a lot of cat pictures and Man City posters. “I remember the living room wallpaper too. It was a print which had a butterfly design. I also remember my mum trying to be ultra modern at the time by hanging plates on the walls.” Joanne’s family might have expected to continue renting the house for some time but the general election in 1979 changed the future of council housing. One of the defining policies of Margaret Thatcher’s time in office was quickly introduced - right to buy. Council house sales were a key policy for Margaret Thatcher's government Council house sales were a key policy for Margaret Thatcher's government The 1980 Housing Act gave secure tenants of three years or more in England and Wales the right to buy their council house or flat with a large discount on the market value. The act also provided for 100% mortgages. Not long after it came into force, Joanne’s parents bought their council home in Wythenshawe for £7,000. “At the time it was really exciting. People got huge discounts.” The policy was welcomed by many council tenants - between 1980 and 1998, 1.3 million council homes were sold at discount in England. It was particularly popular in London and the south. In Greater Manchester, which includes Wythenshawe, 52,000 council homes were sold off. Supporters of right to buy saw it as a chance for aspirational working-class people to own their own homes and improve their life prospects. “They still live in that house now,” says Joanne, “and they often mentioned that buying their council home meant they’d have something to leave behind for the rest of us.” But, while the idea had been floated by Labour in the past, and had been Conservative policy since 1974, it came to be intensely controversial. Labour leader Michael Foot predicted it would lead to a dangerous depletion in council housing stock. For later critics - it was at its essence a policy which squandered public assets, distorted house prices and ultimately helped lead to the housing crisis. Joanne feels the reduction in council house stock is still being felt today. “We really do need more council homes now - everything’s becoming private around here. My disabled daughter had to wait eight years to get a council house in the area.” Joanne’s 25-year-old son, who is a plasterer, still lives with her because he can’t get a council home in the area. He also cannot afford to rent privately. “He’s probably gonna have to move to Bolton,” she says. During the time many council homes were being bought by residents, fewer homes were also being built. And despite the initial enthusiasm for right to buy among many working-class people, attitudes grew increasingly divided over the scheme. This is something Joanne relates to. “It was a good idea at the start but it soon changed the vibe around here. The new home owners in Wythenshawe eventually began looking down on the ‘the council house scum’ and vice versa. “When my parents bought their council home, they automatically became snobs in the eyes of many council tenants. Right to buy divided Wythenshawe - right to buy has definitely fed into the stigma. “When you think right to buy, you straight away think of someone who cares about their life and works hard; when you think council tenant - you think scrounger. This just isn’t true though.” For the supporters of right to buy it was a massive landmark in the drive towards a property-owning country. In his biography of Margaret Thatcher,Charles Moore wrote: “It produced huge political loyalty to Mrs Thatcher, often from people who had never voted Conservative before… By 1983, it would become commonplace for people, mainly from the upper working class, to declare ‘Maggie got me my house’. ” But social historian John Boughton believes right to buy helped create “residualisation”. Most of the people who bought their homes were the better off residents. The remaining tenants were increasingly the poorer families. “Council housing became housing of last resort [as opposed to] what it used to be - housing for the affluent working class.” The 1980s led to a shift in the public’s view. “This period marked the low point of public perception - it was stigmatised and seen as poor housing, slum housing,” says Boughton.  Clare’s life in Wythenshawe spans more than four decades. Four different council houses. Three children. Her whole life has been spent in this council estate on the southern edge of Manchester. “I grew up here; went to school here; worked here for a while. My kids were born and baptised here.” Wythenshawe in the 1970s Wythenshawe in the 1970s Clare’s house is a three-bedroom terrace that’s typical for her part of Wythenshawe - layered by red bricks and a black tiled roof. A small chimney pokes out halfway along the roof, with a little black satellite perched on top. Spliced into the red bricks are white PVC windows. There’s some ivy on the front of the house. The front garden is big enough for her to park her red Citroen and keep two black bins. Neatly trimmed, lush green bushes line the side of her house. The 42-year-old moved there after her husband suddenly died of a brain haemorrhage in 2009. “I met my Derek in 1997 - just three months after I had my first kid. He grew up in Salford but eventually moved onto the estate. “We met at the Wythenshawe Civic Centre. He asked me for a drink. “He was a black, Jamaican man; just lovely. In the 90s, you didn’t get a lot of mixed couples round here. It was very white back then, but we were on the same wavelength,” she says. Clare's late husband Derek died suddenly in 2009 Clare's late husband Derek died suddenly in 2009 “Derek doted on the kids. He loved them to pieces. He was just 42 when he died. It was really sudden. “I had to move. I just couldn’t stand the thought of staying in the home he once lived in. It was a horrible time for me and the kids.” After deciding she wanted to stay in Wythenshawe, Clare did a council house swap. Clare’s street is full of red-brick semis just like hers - only the colours of the front doors break the symmetry. Wythenshawe retains plenty of greenery. Many houses look out onto large green open spaces. It’s in the spirit of the garden city movement that built Wythenshawe in the countryside nearly 100 years ago. But the vision that built it has dissipated over the years. “I can’t recall a time in my life when people didn’t look down on us because of where we live. Was there ever such a time?” says Clare. Even though she has come across old photos and stories of Wythenshawe, it’s almost incomprehensible to Clare that her estate could have ever been seen as a desirable place to live in by people from outside the area. “If you’re from here, you love Wythenshawe heart and soul, but people from outside see us as scum.  Even the cab drivers don’t like dropping people off here. “Even as a kid, growing up around here was looked down upon,” says Clare. The media plays a part in creating a negative image of council house tenants, Joanne believes. “There is always good and bad wherever you live. There are a lot of good people around here too – people just don’t get to see it.” Months before the Duchess of Cambridge visited a primary school in Wythenshawe in 2013, the playground of the school was vandalised and set alight. It received widespread media coverage. “There was nothing positive being shown of our area when the duchess visited,” claims Joanne. “The papers made out as if she was coming to visit hell. “The media gives people the impression that none of us work and that we are all scroungers. Most people in Wythenshawe work. Even some single parents do. “Women round here are tough and hard working. People don’t hear about that.”  1970: Welshpool Close, Wythenshawe 1970: Welshpool Close, Wythenshawe Clare shares Joanne’s view. “The stigma of council housing has been there for years and years. I’ve even had colleagues in the past make digs about where I come from; or sometimes it’s a subtle look that you pick up.” While Clare is undoubtedly proud of her home, she admits that at times, she feels the pervasive attitude that regards living on an estate like hers as negative; something that’s a bit shameful and unaspirational. But despite this, she seems resilient. “At the end of the day - I work. What other people think doesn’t bother me.” Four decades ago councils were responsible for 40% of new houses. By 2017 that had fallen to just 2%. Right to buy and the transfer of council properties to housing associations meant a depletion in stock. Most social housing in England now belongs to housing associations - 2.5 million as opposed to 1.6 million council homes. But there are still some who believe that councils could play a big role in tackling the housing crisis, just as they did a century ago. At the tail end of 2018, Prime Minister Theresa May announced that the borrowing cap that had hampered councils from building in large numbers was being lifted. She said the stigma about council houses was wrong. She regretted the fact that tenants could “feel marginalised and overlooked, and are ashamed to share the fact that their home belongs to a housing association or local authority”. “On the outside, many people in society - including too many politicians - continue to look down on social housing and, by extension, the people who call it their home.” The need is obvious. AnIpsos Mori surveyfor the Chartered Institute of Housing found 60% of people supported the construction of new social housing in their area. Not everybody agrees that councils and housing associations should drive a new wave of housebuilding. There are many who think that changing the planning system and reducing bureaucracy would let private builders produce many more houses and flats. But whatever the solution, what is clear is that in 2019, the UK faces a shortage of houses and a crisis. Just as it did in 1919.  ",Negative,0.00019772611
"Marie Anderson has been recommended for the role of Police Ombudsman Marie Anderson has been recommended to take over as Northern Ireland's Police Ombudsman when the role becomes free later this year. Mrs Anderson is currently Northern Ireland's Public Services Ombudsman, a position she has held since April 2016. Current ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, was appointed in 2012 and will finish his seven-year tenure in July 2019. A law passed last year gives the secretary of state power to appoint the position. Commissioner would welcome more powers NI investigation into PIP benefits planned Secretary of State Karen Bradley said: ""My absolute priority is to see the restoration of the executive at the earliest opportunity. ""In the absence of an executive, it is vital that we ensure stability and continuity for this important public appointment."" PSNI Chief Constable George Hamilton said Mrs Anderson brings ""a wealth of experience to the role"". ""I recognise the importance of the role of the office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and the public confidence that the independent investigation of complaints against police carried out by the office can bring,"" he said. ""It is an essential part of the mechanisms by which the PSNI can be held to account and I am confident PSNI will engage positively with the new Police Ombudsman in the future."" The post comes with an annual salary of Â£134,841. During his time in office, Dr Michael Maguire has been involved in a number of high-profile cases. In September 2017,Dr Maguire contacted more than 100 familiesto say a squeeze on resources meant Troubles legacy complaints could not be proceeded with. He said some of the inquiries could take up to 20 years to complete. In November 2018, a judge rejected an application to quash his reportinto the Loughinisland killings. In June 2016, Dr Maguire ruled there had been collusion betweensome police officers and the gunmen. Last year, the secretary of state passed a law through the Commons thatgave UK government ministers the power to make some public appointmentsto the NI Policing Board, the Probation Board and the Police Ombudsman. The role of the Police Ombudsman in Northern Ireland is to investigate complaints against the police. It has a staff of more than 150 and received a budget of Â£9.3m in the last financial year.

"China has warned the UK not to ""interfere in its domestic affairs"" amid a growing diplomatic row over the recent protests in Hong Kong. Its UK ambassador said relations had been ""damaged"" by comments by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and others backing the demonstrators' actions. Liu Xiaoming said those who illegally occupied Hong Kong's parliament should be ""condemned as law breakers"". The ambassador was later summoned to the Foreign Office over the remarks. A Foreign Office spokesman said Sir Simon McDonald, permanent under secretary and head of the diplomatic service, told the ambassador his comments were ""unacceptable and inaccurate"". Earlier, Prime Minister Theresa May said she had raised concerns with Chinese leaders. Weeks of mass protests in the territory over a controversial extradition bill exploded on Monday, when a group of activists occupied the Legislative Council building for several hours after breaking away from a peaceful protest - raising the colonial-era British flag. Critics say the extradition bill could be used to send political dissidents from Hong Kong to the mainland. Demonstrators have also broadened their demands to include the release of all detained activists and investigations into alleged police violence. In the middle of the demonstrations, Mr Hunt pledged his ""unwavering"" support to the ex-British colony and its citizens' freedoms. Allow Twitter content?

In a series of broadcast interviews and posts on social media, Mr Hunt repeated the message that the protesters should refrain from violence, but urged China to listen to the concerns of the Hong Kong people. Did Hong Kong violence sway public opinion? What graffiti says about Hong Kong's evolving anger Hong Kong protests trample rule of law - China Beijing has made a formal complaint about Mr Hunt, accusing the Conservative leadership contender of ""colonial-era delusions"". But Mr Liu said he was ""disappointed"" by the UK's response. He said the countries' relationship was based on mutual respect and suggested there would be further ""problems"" if the UK did not recognise China's sovereignty over Hong Kong, its ""territorial integrity and principle of non-interference in domestic affairs"". He said it was ""hypocritical"" of UK politicians to criticise the lack of democracy and civil rights in Hong Kong when, under British rule, there had been no elections nor right to protest. The recent unrest, he added, was ""not about freedom but about breaking the law"". The background you need on the Hong Kong protests In response, Mr Hunt said good relations between countries were based on ""honouring the legally binding relationships between them"" - a reference to a 1984 treaty between the UK and China which paved the way for sovereignty over the territory to pass back to Beijing.

The Joint Declaration, signed by Margaret Thatcher and the then Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, set out how the rights of Hong Kong citizens should be protected in the territory's Basic Law under Chinese rule. Hong Kong has, since 1997, been run by China under a ""one country, two systems"" arrangement guaranteeing it a level of economic autonomy and personal freedoms not permitted on the mainland. The ambassador gave the British government both barrels at his press conference earlier. What's fascinating is there was no pretence, no attempt to gloss this over at all. This was visceral and system-wide. This is merely the British side of things, the same message is coming from Beijing and Hong Kong too. There is definite push-back from the whole Chinese machine. The British are so infuriated that they've summoned the ambassador almost immediately to give him a dressing down. What was a war of words now risks becoming a substantial issue between the two countries. The Foreign Office has said it continues to make it clear to the Chinese government, both in public and private, that the rights of Hong Kong residents must be fully respected. Speaking on Wednesday, Theresa May said she had raised her concerns directly with Chinese leaders at the recent G20 meeting. ""It is vital that Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and the rights and freedoms set down in the Sino-British joint declaration are respected,"" she told MPs. Successive UK governments have heralded a ""golden era"" in economic relations with China, with growing levels of trade and foreign investment. But critics say this has come at the expense of turning a blind eye to human rights violations in China and Beijing's increasing economic nationalism.

"Despite the backlog, there are no plans to relax MOT rules More than 2,000 motorists across Northern Ireland failed to turn up for their MOT tests in June, despite public anger over test backlogs. There were 2,300 missed appointments last month, according to the Department for Infrastructure. At Â£30.50 per car per test, that is a potential loss to drivers of more than Â£70,000. It comes as some motorists argue that backlogs mean they cannot book a slot before their MOT certificate expires. Sunday openings to clear MOT backlog No MOT diesel test run in NI for 12 years To tackle the tests backlog, the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) opened 2,000 Sunday MOT slots on 16 and 23 June.  June 20192,300 appointments were missed 2018-19About 1.09 million  tests were carried out Same year32,000 customers did not attend MOT tests More vehicle examiners have been recruited and reminder letters are being sent out earlier to deal with the waits. In the first three months of this year alone, 7,300 vehicles failed to turn up for a booked test - 3.4% higher than the equivalent period in 2018. A DVA spokesperson said that in 2018-19 financial year, 32,000 customers did not attend their MOT appointments. In cash terms, ""no-show"" drivers have poured a potential Â£976,000 down the drain. The DVA conducted just over 1.09 million vehicle tests in 2018-19, an increase of 1.8% on the year before and the highest figure on record. In a statement, the DVA encouraged customers to book their vehicle test online as soon as they receive a reminder notice. ""We would ask that customers either attend their pre-booked appointments or cancel them to allow others to make use of the appointment,"" a spokesperson said. Despite discussions between police and the DVA about relaxing the rules to ease the situation, the department said it was not considering offering motorists exemptions from the MOT test at this stage. Northern Ireland has different rules around MOTs than the rest of the UK. A test is required on a car's fourth birthday in NI, rather than the third birthday elsewhere in the UK. In Northern Ireland, tests must be carried out at a specific MOT testing site operated by the DVA, whereas in Britain, tests can be conducted by approved private operators in commercial premises, such as garages.

"This video can not be played The train hit the men while they were on the tracks near Margam Two rail workers who died after being hit by a passenger train were wearing ear defenders and may not have heard it coming, police say. The men, aged 58, from North Cornelly, and 64, from Kenfig Hill, were struck near Margam by the Swansea to London Paddington train at about 10:00 BST. The pair were pronounced dead at the scene and a third person was treated for shock, but was not injured. Network Rail said it was ""shocked and distressed"" by the incident. British Transport Police (BTP) Supt Andy Morgan said: ""Following a number of urgent enquiries into this tragic incident, it has been established that the three people were railway workers who were working on the lines at the time. ""The initial stages of the investigation suggest that the two men who died had been wearing ear defenders at the time, tragically, could not hear the passenger train approaching. ""We have a number of officers who remain in the area and we are continuing to work alongside the Rail Accident Investigation Branch to understand the full circumstances of what happened in the moments before this incredibly sad, fatal collision."" Rail investigator warned of 'too many near misses' Bill Kelly, Network Rail's route managing director for Wales, added: ""We are fully cooperating with the British Transport Police and Rail Accident Investigation Branch. ""Our thoughts are with the families of our colleagues and our members of staff who will be affected by this tragic loss, and we will provide all the support we can."" Police and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch are investigating The tragedy happened just three months after theRail Accident Investigation Branch warnedthere were ""too many near misses in which railway workers have had to jump for their lives"". In 2018 there was one death on the mainline railway and 6,641 injuries, of which 164 were major. Great Western Railway (GWR) said about 180 passengers were on the train at the time of the incident. One passenger said a party of school children were on board, and they had had to shut the blinds in the carriage to prevent them seeing what was happening outside. The train has since been moved and the line reopened just before 21:00 but GWR said replacement bus services will continue to operate to supplement trains between Swansea and Cardiff Central stations. The company said in a statement: ""Everyone at GWR is incredibly saddened to learn that two railway colleagues lost their lives this morning, when they were struck by the 0929 service from Swansea to London Paddington. ""We have offered our full assistance to the British Transport Police, the Rail Accident Investigation Branch, and Network Rail as they seek to understand the circumstances which led to this tragic accident."" Passengers started being evacuated from the train around three hours after the crash and were put on buses to Port Talbot and Cardiff. One passenger who was on board the train said: ""This happened shortly after we left Port Talbot Parkway. We didn't hear anything at all. We weren't even aware an incident had taken place until the train manager made an announcement."" Stephen Lester could see ""devastated"" rail staff out of the window Stephen Lester, who was also on board, said: ""[I] looked out of the window and saw people standing around looking at the floor. ""They were devastated that one or maybe two of their colleagues was under the train."" He said the blinds had to be pulled down as there were secondary school children from Swansea in the carriage. A teacher travelling with around 30 pupils said they had been on a trip to London, adding that rail staff had been ""absolutely amazing"". This video can not be played Passengers on the train which killed two rail workers describe how events unfolded Arriving at Port Talbot Parkway, passenger Auriel Griffiths from Cimla, Neath Port Talbot, said:  ""It was a bit of an experience reallyâ¦ thank God the train didn't turn over."" She had been travelling to visit a relative in hospital when the incident happened. She said staff on the train had been ""very good"". ""They kept coming along and giving us information, coffee and water,"" she said. Describing the moment the train came to a standstill, she said: ""It just sort of stopped. I didn't feel a bang or anythingâ¦ ""People got killed, that's worse than being inconvenienced isn't itâ¦ I feel upset about it."" Robert Jones praised the train staff for their handling of the incident Fellow passenger Robert Jones, from Neath, who was travelling with his wife, said it had seemed as if the train was stopping because of the works which were going on. ""There was no sound, there was no particular judder, there was no commotion. ""Quite soon after the announcement was made that a major incident had occurred,"" he said, adding two further announcements were made explaining what had happened. ""It became evident that it was a tragedy."" Mr Jones said it was difficult in the hours that followed, knowing people had lost lives, but said: ""Every single passenger in my coach dealt with it in the most remarkable way. They accepted the situation that there would be a delay and the staff were just unbelievable all round."" About 180 passengers were on the train at the time of the incident, Great Western Railway said The Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash called for a suspension of all similar works by Network Rail ""until the facts were established"" following the ""shocking news"". His counterpart at the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association, Manuel Cortes, said it was not acceptable for people to ""go out to work and end up losing their lives"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn spoke about the incident at Prime Minister's Questions. He said: ""I'm sure the whole house will want to express their condolences to the families of those rail workers who were hit and killed by a train this morning in Port Talbot."" UK and Welsh ministers expressed their condolences after the fatal crash Prime Minister Theresa May said she shared his sentiments. Speaking in the Senedd, Welsh government deputy transport minister Lee Waters said the government and the assembly was ""deeply shocked"", adding: ""It's hard to understand how this could have happened this morning just 20 or so miles away from us."" UK Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said there would be an investigation into how the accident happened, adding: ""I will ensure lessons are learned"". He said he was ""deeply saddened"" and sent his condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of the workers. Two ambulances as well as vehicles from the Hazardous Area Response Team and Wales Air Ambulance were sent to the scene Wales' Transport Secretary Ken Skates tweeted: ""Deeply shocked by the news about the tragic incident involving railway workers near Margam this morning, and my thoughts are with the families of those involved.""

"The two Tory leadership candidates have been challenged to bring forward plans to tackle the social care crisis in England if they become prime minister. A committee of peers has called for an immediate Â£8bn cash increase and a move to a free, NHS-based system. Jeremy Hunt has pledged more council funding and an opt-out insurance system for people to save for future care. Boris Johnson said everyone deserved ""security and dignity in their old age"". Meanwhile, councils say the government's delayed plans on elderly care should be published by September at the latest. Ministers say they have responded to growing pressure on the system with extra money for residential care, providing Â£650m this year. But the demand posed by an ageing society and the number of those living with debilitating and degenerative conditions, such as dementia, has put a huge strain on resources. Councils 'completely in the dark' over funding Will social care ever be addressed? Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn? BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said that, while both Tory leadership candidates had made the issue a priority, successive governments had ducked away from far-reaching changes, daunted by the costs and political risks involved. The new plan, putforward by the Lords Economic Affairs Committee,external, was much more ambitious than any of the ideas mooted so far, he said. The report focuses on social care in England only - the area is a devolved issue in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It says residential care should be free at the point of delivery, modelled on the NHS. While individuals would still have to pay for their accommodation, there would be no costs for non-medical care. The cross-party committee says the system should be paid for through general taxation, estimating the cost to be about Â£7bn a year. Some of the cash, the peers say, could come from the Â£20bn increase in NHS funding by 2023 agreed by the government last year. Social care for the elderly covers non-medical needs such as help with washing, dressing and eating. In England and Northern Ireland, everyone with income and assets worth more than Â£23,250 has to pay for support. Below that threshold, they contribute to the cost - with the amount paid based on means-testing of both savings and income. In Wales the asset threshold is Â£50,000, having increased from the previous limit of Â£40,000 inApril this year,external. In Scotland, free nursing care is available to adults who have been assessed by the local authority as needing that service. The Conservatives dropped plans in 2017 to make people receiving care at home liable for the full cost if they were worth at least Â£100,000 following a political outcry. Theresa May was accused of trying to introduce a ""dementia tax"" by charities and pensioner groups who said people would no longer be able to pass their homes down to their children if property values were taken into account when calculating care costs. Mr Hunt, who has described transforming care for the elderly as one of his ""social missions"", said a 10-year plan was needed to put the system on a sustainable financial footing. He has said if he enters No 10 he will introduce a personal insurance scheme to allow people to save for care costs in old age, similar to the way pensions work. He has said the system should be automatic, but people should be able to opt out. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hunt said people should be ""encouraged and incentivised"" to save for their own care. He added that greater integration of social care with the NHS was required so those with needs were not ""pushed from pillar to post between one system and another"". ""The other thing we need to is more money for local councils. I accept that there are funding difficulties"", he added. Mr Johnson said he had two priorities for social care: Ensuring no-one is evicted from their home to pay for care, and that everybody has security and dignity in their old age.

"The two Tory leadership candidates have been challenged to bring forward plans to tackle the social care crisis in England if they become prime minister. A committee of peers has called for an immediate Â£8bn cash increase and a move to a free, NHS-based system. Jeremy Hunt has pledged more council funding and an opt-out insurance system for people to save for future care. Boris Johnson said everyone deserved ""security and dignity in their old age"". Meanwhile, councils say the government's delayed plans on elderly care should be published by September at the latest. Ministers say they have responded to growing pressure on the system with extra money for residential care, providing Â£650m this year. But the demand posed by an ageing society and the number of those living with debilitating and degenerative conditions, such as dementia, has put a huge strain on resources. Councils 'completely in the dark' over funding Will social care ever be addressed? Reality Check: Is the NHS boost Â£84bn or Â£20bn? BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said that, while both Tory leadership candidates had made the issue a priority, successive governments had ducked away from far-reaching changes, daunted by the costs and political risks involved. The new plan, putforward by the Lords Economic Affairs Committee,external, was much more ambitious than any of the ideas mooted so far, he said. The report focuses on social care in England only - the area is a devolved issue in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It says residential care should be free at the point of delivery, modelled on the NHS. While individuals would still have to pay for their accommodation, there would be no costs for non-medical care. The cross-party committee says the system should be paid for through general taxation, estimating the cost to be about Â£7bn a year. Some of the cash, the peers say, could come from the Â£20bn increase in NHS funding by 2023 agreed by the government last year. Social care for the elderly covers non-medical needs such as help with washing, dressing and eating. In England and Northern Ireland, everyone with income and assets worth more than Â£23,250 has to pay for support. Below that threshold, they contribute to the cost - with the amount paid based on means-testing of both savings and income. In Wales the asset threshold is Â£50,000, having increased from the previous limit of Â£40,000 inApril this year,external. In Scotland, free nursing care is available to adults who have been assessed by the local authority as needing that service. The Conservatives dropped plans in 2017 to make people receiving care at home liable for the full cost if they were worth at least Â£100,000 following a political outcry. Theresa May was accused of trying to introduce a ""dementia tax"" by charities and pensioner groups who said people would no longer be able to pass their homes down to their children if property values were taken into account when calculating care costs. Mr Hunt, who has described transforming care for the elderly as one of his ""social missions"", said a 10-year plan was needed to put the system on a sustainable financial footing. He has said if he enters No 10 he will introduce a personal insurance scheme to allow people to save for care costs in old age, similar to the way pensions work. He has said the system should be automatic, but people should be able to opt out. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hunt said people should be ""encouraged and incentivised"" to save for their own care. He added that greater integration of social care with the NHS was required so those with needs were not ""pushed from pillar to post between one system and another"". ""The other thing we need to is more money for local councils. I accept that there are funding difficulties"", he added. Mr Johnson said he had two priorities for social care: Ensuring no-one is evicted from their home to pay for care, and that everybody has security and dignity in their old age. Asked if he could push forward with his plans without a Brexit deal agreed, he said: ""We can get going on it right away if I am luckily enough to be elected. ""But this is something that will take time to work through. It is politically controversialâ¦ but we have got to do something.""

"PC Tim Andrews pointed out Khuram Butt as the ringleader to armed police officers A police officer has told an inquest how he shouted at armed police to shoot the ringleader in the final moments of the 2017 London Bridge attack. PC Tim Andrews pointed at Khuram Butt and shouted ""shoot him!"" after an armed response vehicle pulled up beside him. He had been on duty with PC Bartosz Tchorzewski when reports came in of a van hitting pedestrians on the bridge. He had thought it was a drink-drive incident until he saw men carrying knives. Eight died in the attack. In just 10 minutes, Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, ploughed down pedestrians on the bridge and brought chaos to Borough Market, carrying knives and wearing fake suicide belts. As well as the eight who died, 48 people were seriously injured. All three men were finally shot dead in Stoney Street, bringing the attack to an end. An inquest is taking place at the Old Bailey into the deaths of the attackers who were killed by armed police officers. It is expected to go on for three weeks and, under law, must be heard by a jury. At the hearing, jurors heard evidence from Antonio Filis, the last person to be attacked. He said he had no idea what was going on before one of the knifemen stared at him and came over. ""I raised my hands in defence and shouted something along the lines of 'oi, what are you doing?'. ""I felt a blow on my head. At first I thought it was a bottle but I had no idea it was a knife. ""I remember seeing two more people coming towards me. ""I felt I was being pushed around so I found myself on the ground curled up with my hands over my head."" He then described hearing what sounded to him like fireworks going off in quick succession as the three men were shot. After the attack, a police officer helped him to the Globe pub where he realised he had been stabbed in the body as well as the head. Giving evidence, PC Andrews told how he and his colleagues had tried to chase down the attackers, first running towards Bedale Street where members of the public were pointing and shouting: ""They've gone down there."" As the officers walked down Middle Road, they came across the three men, the court heard. ""Butt had a football shirt on and he was standing with two knives in either hand,"" PC Andrews said. ""The other two gentlemen... were in dark clothes also with knives. ""Then it dawned on me it was probably a terrorist attack. I pressed my emergency button and asked for emergency assistance, firearms support."" By Daniel Sandford, BBC home affairs correspondent Among the early morning bustle of Borough Market - porters wheeling barrows of vegetables, tourists being shown one of London's most atmospheric spots - a group of people emerged clutching maps and photographs. It was the chief coroner and the jury from the inquest into the deaths of the London Bridge attackers. His Honour Judge Lucraft QC showed the jurors the narrow streets and alleys, saying he wanted them to get an impression of what the place was like. They saw some of the pubs and bars where Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba stabbed their victims. Then they examined the spot where the three men were shot dead by armed police, and the spot where the officers' armed response vehicle had rolled into tables and chairs. In his hurry to get out, the armed officer who was driving had not put the handbrake on. The officers, who were in plain clothes and armed only with batons, backed away but were chased by the three men. PC Andrews said his partner was hit by a missile but by the time they got back to Bedale Street the attackers had disappeared so they resumed their search. He said they found Butt in nearby Stoney Street with the other two, repeatedly stabbing a man. ""We started to close them down to assist the gentleman,"" he added. He said he was about 10 metres away when an armed response vehicle pulled up and a firearms officer got out of the passenger door, holding his firearm. ""I was pointing at Butt shouting, 'shoot him! shoot him!'"" PC Andrews said. ""Butt started to close the officer down. The officer pulled the weapon up and shot him a number of times."" PC Andrews said Butt had been running at the police marksman with ""hands raised in a threatening manner"". He said the officer had shouted ""armed police"" before opening fire. Butt fell to the ground and the officer shouted to PC Andrews ""cuff him, cuff him"", jurors were told. He said: ""He was making some noises and moving slightly. I put the cuffs straight on. I looked down and could see a bomb belt around his waist."" PC Andrews said that at the time he thought it was real and shouted that everyone needed to get back. PC Ian Rae, another officer at the scene, told jurors his attention was drawn to the other attackers who had been shot. He said: ""I ran over to the one that was moving because I knew he had an IED (improvised explosive device) strapped to him by that time. I could see it."" He went to handcuff the man but an armed officer screamed at him to get out of the way, he said. Rudi Thirion, who had been holding the Wheatsheaf pub door shut as the attackers tried to force their way in, told jurors he heard screams of ""drop your weapons, get to the ground"". He said the knifemen were ""definitely in attacking mode"" as they ran towards the blue police lights. ""I saw two of them get shot. I did not see the third one get shot. I must have ducked down to take cover,"" he added. The inquest continues.

"All 157 passengers and crew were killed when flight ET302 went down shortly after take-off Boeing is giving $100m (Â£80m) to help families affected by the two crashes of the company's 737 Max planes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. The payment, stretching over several years, is independent of lawsuits filed in the wake of the disasters, which together killed 346 people. The money will support education and living expenses for families and community programmes, Boeing said. Lawyers for victims' families dismissed the move. The loss of Ethiopian Airlines' flight ET302 in March was the second fatal accident involving a 737 Max in the space of five months. A near identical aircraft, owned by the Indonesian carrier Lion Air, went down in the sea off Jakarta in October 2018. Crash investigators have focussed on the aircraft's control system and Boeing has been working with regulators to roll out a software upgrade. The top-selling 737 Max has been grounded worldwide since March, with no date when the aircraft might be cleared to fly again. Boeing hit by new 737 Max problem Hero pilot 'knows 737 crash fight for life' Boeing said in a statement on Wednesday that the ""funds will support education, hardship and living expenses for impacted families, community programs, and economic development in impacted communities. Boeing will partner with local governments and non-profit organizations to address these needs. This initial investment will be made over multiple years."" Dennis Muilenburg, the chairman and chief executive, added: ""We at Boeing are sorry for the tragic loss of lives in both of these accidents and these lives lost will continue to weigh heavily on our hearts and on our minds for years to come. ""The families and loved ones of those on board have our deepest sympathies, and we hope this initial outreach can help bring them comfort,"" he said. Nomi Husain, a Texas-based lawyer representing some of the families of victims of ET 302, said Boeing's payment ""doesn't come anywhere close to compensating the families for what has been taken from them"". He told the BBC's transport correspondent Tom Burridge that ""some of our clients are not interested in financial compensation at this point"" and that Boeing ""put profit over safety to get their number-one selling plane to market"" - a claim the planemaker strongly denies. Mr Husain has so far filed seven cases on behalf of families, with some of those lawsuits seeking damages of $276m. He estimated that about 50 lawsuits had so far been filed by victims' families. Some families are waiting for further information about the technical causes of the crashes and how regulators cleared the 737 Max to fly before deciding on legal action, he said. But many others just want the truth, he added. Meanwhile, Robert Clifford, who is representing 23 families, said: ""This type of offer so early in the litigation process is unprecedented.

"Russell Crowe starred in the 2000 Ridley Scott movie, Gladiator Netflix has announced it's taking a long-term lease on Shepperton Film Studios near London. Its plan is to create a dedicated UK production hub, including 14 sound stages, workshops and office space at the site owned by the Pinewood Group. Major films including Gladiator, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Mamma Mia!: Here We Go Again have used the facilities. Filming on Netflix's action film The Old Guard, starring Charlize Theron, is already underway at the studio. The deal, believed to be in place for 10 years, will see the Netflix production hub take up 435,000 square feet of the studios. The financial details have not been disclosed by either company. Over the past year, 40 Netflix originals and co-productions have been created across Britain, including Sex Education in Wales, Outlaw King in Scotland and The Crown at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire. Oscar-winner Olivia Colman takes over as the Queen in the next series of The Crown Ted Sarandos, the chief content officer for Netflix said the studio ""has been synonymous with world class film for nearly a century"". ""We're incredibly proud to be part of that heritage,"" he went on. ""This investment will ensure that British creators and producers have first rate production facilities and a world stage for their work."" The creative industries in Britain are growing much faster than the rest of the economy. This means they will be central to the country's future after Brexit. If you talk to the streaming giants, they say that the cheap pound, exceptional calibre of producers and writers, and huge appetite for English-language productions together make this country a hugely attractive proposition. As a result, there is a chronic shortage of studio space in Britain. When demand vastly exceeds supply, prices rise. When prices rise, the poor are priced out. It follows that while a giant like Netflix - the biggest company in film and television anywhere in the world today - says they want studio space at Shepperton, they get it. But for the smaller companies desperate for facilities where their creative impulses can flow, there is still not nearly enough usable space. Eventually, this will get built, as part of an investment-in-infrastructure programme. In the meantime, the marriage of Netflix and Shepperton - one of the most storied names in all cinema - shows that when the best of the new and the best of the old come together, Britain is the location. At some point, politicians will notice, and look to take advantage. Pinewood group chairman, Paul Golding, added the deal with Netflix was part of a wider Â£500m expansion which will see them build an additional 22 sound stages (16 at Shepperton and six at Pinewood), thus ""enabling us to host even more productions.""

"US political heavyweight Mitch McConnell has waded into the ""racist trainer"" row with a call for Nike to reverse a decision to halt sales. ""I'll make the first order,"" the Republican Senate majority leader promised if Nike changes its mind. The special-edition Fourth-of July trainer features an old US flag that some people say has racist overtones. Mr McConnell said ""I think we've got a problem"" if some ""Americans find the American flag controversial"". The sportswear giant withdrew the trainer, featuring the Revolutionary War-era Betsy Ross flag, following complaints that it represented an era of slavery. Although the origins and meaning are disputed, the flag was adopted by the American Nazi Party and other extremist groups. Sportsman, activist and Nike-sponsored Colin Kaepernick was widely reported as one of those who said it was inappropriate, although he has yet to comment publicly. Nike's decision sparked a huge backlash from conservative America and the governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, ordered the cancellation a $1m grant to help the company build a factory in the state. Speaking in Kentucky, Mr McConnell told reporters: ""I hope Nike either releases these shoes or some other shoe maker picks up the flag, puts it on a pair of shoes and starts selling it. I'll make the first order. ""If we're in a political environment where the American flag has become controversial to Americans, I think we've got a problem."" The trainers are selling for more than $2,000 on secondary websites The heels of the trainers were decorated with the flag, known for its circular arrangement of 13 stars representing the 13 original colonies of the US. The shoes, which had already been shipped to retailers, are selling on the StockX online marketplace for more than $2,000. Nike has asked retailers to return the stock. Texas Senator Ted Cruz also dismissed Nike's move as unpatriotic, writing in a series of tweets that the shoe giant ""only wants to sell sneakers to people who hate the American flag"". ""Yep, I own lots of @Nike I've been a life-long customer, since I was kid. But they've now decided their shoes represent snide disdain for the American flag,"" he said. ""Since they don't want my business anymore, I wont buy any more."" In an editorial, the Wall Street Journal,externalsaid that ""no flag of the United States is a symbol of oppression and racism"" and that the row was ""another sign of our current political insanity"". But social media was equally full of comments backing Nike and criticising the firm for thinking the flag was appropriate. Last year Mr Kaepernick, a former NFL star, became the face of Nike's advertisement marking the 30th anniversary of the company's ""Just Do It"" slogan. The former American football quarterback had previously sparked a furore by kneeling during the national anthem before games to protest against police violence against African-Americans. US President Donald Trump said he had shown ""disrespect"" to the US flag. Many consumers said they would never buy Nike again after it adopted Mr Kaepernick, and social media featured pictures of people burning their trainers. But in the following three months, Nike reported a rise in sales. Matt Powell, senior industry adviser at the research and consultancy group NPD, said Nike would probably also find support among its core consumers this time. ""I think it's important to understand who Nike's core demographic is here. They're really focused on teens and looking at the commentary on Twitter and so forth, I don't see a lot of teens coming out with a negative attitude here,"" he said.

"PC Tim Andrews pointed out Khuram Butt as the ringleader to armed police officers A police officer has told an inquest how he shouted at armed police to shoot the ringleader in the final moments of the 2017 London Bridge attack. PC Tim Andrews pointed at Khuram Butt and shouted ""shoot him!"" after an armed response vehicle pulled up beside him. He had been on duty with PC Bartosz Tchorzewski when reports came in of a van hitting pedestrians on the bridge. He had thought it was a drink-drive incident until he saw men carrying knives. Eight died in the attack. In just 10 minutes, Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, ploughed down pedestrians on the bridge and brought chaos to Borough Market, carrying knives and wearing fake suicide belts. As well as the eight who died, 48 people were seriously injured. All three men were finally shot dead in Stoney Street, bringing the attack to an end. An inquest is taking place at the Old Bailey into the deaths of the attackers who were killed by armed police officers. It is expected to go on for three weeks and, under law, must be heard by a jury. At the hearing, jurors heard evidence from Antonio Filis, the last person to be attacked. He said he had no idea what was going on before one of the knifemen stared at him and came over. ""I raised my hands in defence and shouted something along the lines of 'oi, what are you doing?'. ""I felt a blow on my head. At first I thought it was a bottle but I had no idea it was a knife. ""I remember seeing two more people coming towards me. ""I felt I was being pushed around so I found myself on the ground curled up with my hands over my head."" He then described hearing what sounded to him like fireworks going off in quick succession as the three men were shot. After the attack, a police officer helped him to the Globe pub where he realised he had been stabbed in the body as well as the head. Giving evidence, PC Andrews told how he and his colleagues had tried to chase down the attackers, first running towards Bedale Street where members of the public were pointing and shouting: ""They've gone down there."" As the officers walked down Middle Road, they came across the three men, the court heard. ""Butt had a football shirt on and he was standing with two knives in either hand,"" PC Andrews said. ""The other two gentlemen... were in dark clothes also with knives. ""Then it dawned on me it was probably a terrorist attack. I pressed my emergency button and asked for emergency assistance, firearms support."" By Daniel Sandford, BBC home affairs correspondent Among the early morning bustle of Borough Market - porters wheeling barrows of vegetables, tourists being shown one of London's most atmospheric spots - a group of people emerged clutching maps and photographs. It was the chief coroner and the jury from the inquest into the deaths of the London Bridge attackers. His Honour Judge Lucraft QC showed the jurors the narrow streets and alleys, saying he wanted them to get an impression of what the place was like. They saw some of the pubs and bars where Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba stabbed their victims. Then they examined the spot where the three men were shot dead by armed police, and the spot where the officers' armed response vehicle had rolled into tables and chairs. In his hurry to get out, the armed officer who was driving had not put the handbrake on. The officers, who were in plain clothes and armed only with batons, backed away but were chased by the three men. PC Andrews said his partner was hit by a missile but by the time they got back to Bedale Street the attackers had disappeared so they resumed their search. He said they found Butt in nearby Stoney Street with the other two, repeatedly stabbing a man. ""We started to close them down to assist the gentleman,"" he added. He said he was about 10 metres away when an armed response vehicle pulled up and a firearms officer got out of the passenger door, holding his firearm. ""I was pointing at Butt shouting, 'shoot him! shoot him!'"" PC Andrews said. ""Butt started to close the officer down. The officer pulled the weapon up and shot him a number of times."" PC Andrews said Butt had been running at the police marksman with ""hands raised in a threatening manner"". He said the officer had shouted ""armed police"" before opening fire. Butt fell to the ground and the officer shouted to PC Andrews ""cuff him, cuff him"", jurors were told. He said: ""He was making some noises and moving slightly. I put the cuffs straight on. I looked down and could see a bomb belt around his waist."" PC Andrews said that at the time he thought it was real and shouted that everyone needed to get back. PC Ian Rae, another officer at the scene, told jurors his attention was drawn to the other attackers who had been shot. He said: ""I ran over to the one that was moving because I knew he had an IED (improvised explosive device) strapped to him by that time. I could see it."" He went to handcuff the man but an armed officer screamed at him to get out of the way, he said. Rudi Thirion, who had been holding the Wheatsheaf pub door shut as the attackers tried to force their way in, told jurors he heard screams of ""drop your weapons, get to the ground"". He said the knifemen were ""definitely in attacking mode"" as they ran towards the blue police lights. ""I saw two of them get shot. I did not see the third one get shot. I must have ducked down to take cover,"" he added. The inquest continues.

"This video can not be played Torrential rain lashes Japan More than one million people across the Japanese island of Kyushu have been ordered to evacuate, amid warnings of landslides and floods brought on by heavy rain. Authorities urged residents in parts of Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures to move to safety immediately. One elderly woman in Kagoshima city died after a mudslide hit her home. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told residents of the cities to ""take steps to protect their lives"". Kagoshima prefecture has asked Japan's self-defence forces to help,externalwith the relief efforts, Governor Satoshi Mitazono reportedly said. The entire populations of Kagoshima city, Kirishima and Aira were ordered to leave. Another 930,000 people in the south of the island were also advised to move. But by 1600 local time (0700 GMT), the country's Fire and Disaster Management Agency reportedly said fewer than 4,000 people had been evacuated. Weather officials say 1,000mm (39in) of rain has fallen on Kyushu island since Friday, and Japan's Meteorological Agency forecasts the rains will continue into next week. A further 350mm of rain is expected in the southern part of the island and 300mm in the northern part by Thursday morning, with some areas predicted to get more than 80mm of rain every hour. The agency said a month's rainfall could hit parts of Kyushu in just 24 hours. The island of Shikoku is also forecast to receive up to 250mm of rain in the same period. The rainy front is expected to hang over the entire Japanese archipelago until Saturday. Last July about 200 people died in western Japan in the country's worst flooding disaster in decades. It was the highest death toll caused by rainfall in Japan since 1982. About two million people were evacuatedand more than 70,000 emergency workers were deployed after the heavy rain caused floods and landslides in the region.

"This video can not be played The train hit the men while they were on the tracks near Margam Two rail workers who died after being hit by a passenger train were wearing ear defenders and may not have heard it coming, police say. The men, aged 58, from North Cornelly, and 64, from Kenfig Hill, were struck near Margam by the Swansea to London Paddington train at about 10:00 BST. The pair were pronounced dead at the scene and a third person was treated for shock, but was not injured. Network Rail said it was ""shocked and distressed"" by the incident. British Transport Police (BTP) Supt Andy Morgan said: ""Following a number of urgent enquiries into this tragic incident, it has been established that the three people were railway workers who were working on the lines at the time. ""The initial stages of the investigation suggest that the two men who died had been wearing ear defenders at the time, tragically, could not hear the passenger train approaching. ""We have a number of officers who remain in the area and we are continuing to work alongside the Rail Accident Investigation Branch to understand the full circumstances of what happened in the moments before this incredibly sad, fatal collision.""

The train has since been moved and the line reopened just before 21:00 but GWR said replacement bus services will continue to operate to supplement trains between Swansea and Cardiff Central stations. The company said in a statement: ""Everyone at GWR is incredibly saddened to learn that two railway colleagues lost their lives this morning, when they were struck by the 0929 service from Swansea to London Paddington.

A further 350mm of rain is expected in the southern part of the island and 300mm in the northern part by Thursday morning, with some areas predicted to get more than 80mm of rain every hour. The agency said a month's rainfall could hit parts of Kyushu in just 24 hours. The island of Shikoku is also forecast to receive up to 250mm of rain in the same period. The rainy front is expected to hang over the entire Japanese archipelago until Saturday. Last July about 200 people died in western Japan in the country's worst flooding disaster in decades. It was the highest death toll caused by rainfall in Japan since 1982. About two million people were evacuatedand more than 70,000 emergency workers were deployed after the heavy rain caused floods and landslides in the region.

"England into their first World Cup semi-final since 1992 England dominant in the field - wickets shared around and two batsmen run out Bairstow top-scores with 106 in England's 305-8 Bairstow and Roy share 123-run stand for first wicket Black Caps fight back with ball - England slipping from 194-1 Amy Lofthouse and Matthew Henry Right, that's us done for the day. Stephan Shemilt's match report isover hereand the Test Match Special podcast will be available to download very soon. We'll be back tomorrow for Afghanistan v West Indies. Until then... Big call from Michael Vaughan... Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special If England win the next two tosses then I think they will win the World Cup. If they are in a chase I doubt whether they can play the right intelligent cricket under pressure of a chase. Can they win four tosses on the trot? Of course you can. England captain Eoin Morgan:""I thought we were outstanding today. It started with the two boys at the top of the order. They set a good solid platform playing in the manner they do. Jonny getting his hundred was match winning. ""The wicket did change after the 25th over and it did slow up. It was difficult to score. Every batsman found that so to have so many on the board was encouraging. It was about trying to get as close to 300 as possible."" On whether England will always look to bat first: ""I think we can do both. If the wicket dictates that 300 is par we can do both. It is about assessing the wicket and if it will get worse. ""All of the wickets in the tournament have got slower and lower so batting first has been the theme of the tournament. If that continues we will continue to bat first."" Jeremy ConeyEx-New Zealand captain on BBC Test Match Special New Zealand are overcome with lassitude at the moment, I have never seen a New Zealand team look like they do, there is a decline, there is a lack of skill and lack of intent. I have seen lack of skill before but not lack of intent. It feels like a lifetime ago, but it was Jonny Bairstow's incredible century that set up this crushing win for England. More from Kane Williamson:""There's been so much to learn from and I think the most important thing is to look at where we need to be as a group, from an individual perspective. The guys are all working really hard. There's been a lot of learning curves. Going ahead, touch wood, hopefully it all works out and we are in the semi-final but in some ways, it starts again. We haven't played our best cricket yet."" Text 81111 By winning the toss, is Eoin Morgan a contender for man of the match? David DM England coach Trevor Bayliss:""It is always good to get to the semi-finals - that is the business end of this completion and that was our first aim. We have got there on the back of two very good games. ""Against Sri Lanka we didn't play the way we normally play. The way we batted in the first half of the innings put the pressure on the guys at the back end. We were still affected by that going into the Australia game but had good chat before the India game."" On whether they will always want to bat first:""We will make that decision when we look at the wicket. The way this tournament is going, there is more pressure in the World Cup but the wickets have been quite as flat as they have been. We won 14 out of the last 17 batting second before the tournament so we are happy to do anything."" Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special England have dealt with it very well. To deal with India when 95% of the crowd are all with India and the way they played here, they have got all that belief back. If England had lost the toss this could have been a tricky day so the toss has been very important and whatever the meeting they had after losing to Australia they have got to get that mentality again. BBC Test Match Special England fast bowler Mark Wood:""It was like a quarter-final and I'm delighted we managed to qualify and show what we are made of. It was a special day to play at my home ground and nice to get the key wicket, maybe fortunate."" On the Kane Williamson run out:""I've got such tiny hands, he doesn't know how unlucky he is that I managed to get something on it! He's the glue, like Joe Root for us, he's one of the best players I have ever bowled at so to get him out without having to bowl at him I'm very happy with."" Allow Twitter content?

New Zealand captain Kane Williamson:""There are a lot of variables in these games and the margins on the scoreboard have looked big but for us it is important we look at it for what it is. We definitely need to be better moving forward. England did get the best of the conditions but they were the better team. They outplayed us in all facets. The conditions didn't decide the result. Full credit to the way England played today."" Andy ZaltzmanTest Match Special statistician The absolute key for Pakistan is to win the toss because if they bowl first - even if they bowl Bangladesh out for nought they couldn't overtake on run-rate. They have to bat first and score 480, then bowl out Bangladesh for 160, they need to win by about 320 runs. England batsman Jonny Bairstow:""I am really pleased. We knew these two games were must win to give ourselves the best opportunity of reaching the semi-final. We knew the performances in the last couple of games weren't up to scratch. To play the way we have and hopefully keep it going into the semis is pleasing . ""We have got a couple days off. It will be really important that the guys get away and refresh and rest up. ""People will be sore after two grueling games. Then we meet up and go again."" Stephan ShemiltBBC Sport at Chester-le-Street Remember the Gareth Southgate song from last summer?

This is England's first time in the World Cup semi-finals since 1992. Which, coincidentally, is the year I was born. Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special They should have a good night, they have made the semi-finals and they have got plenty of breathing space so they should celebrate and enjoy it together. The amount of pressure they are under at a home World Cup - they have delivered. I have faith in New Zealand. Blind faith, maybe, but I think a week away, a chance to regroup... And the same goes for England, actually. They've beaten India once already at Edgbaston. They can definitely do it again. Â© 2025 BBC.

"5G could be used as a replacement for fixed home broadband as well as offering new services such as virtual reality Vodafone has become the second UK mobile operator to turn on its 5G network, offering faster speeds and the opportunity for new services. The network is going live in seven UK cities, including Cardiff, London, Manchester and Glasgow. Making a success of the service could be crucial to the firm which has seen financial losses and customer complaints in recent years. 5G networks offer more capacity than 4G with speeds up to 100 times faster. It could also help support new technologies such as artificial intelligence, the internet of things, robotics, connected cities and self-driving cars. The three other cities to benefit are Birmingham, Bristol and Liverpool. Twelve additional towns and cities will follow later this year - Birkenhead, Blackpool, Bournemouth, Guildford, Newbury, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Reading, Southampton, Stoke-on-Trent, Warrington and Wolverhampton. Vodafone is the first UK provider to offer 5G roaming in Germany, Spain and Italy. Business director of Vodafone UK, Anne Sheehan, said: ""5G is a game-changer for the economy and UK businesses. We are committed to helping our customers take advantage of this technology by making it widely available in the UK and through roaming.  We want to help UK businesses become global leaders and 5G will play an important role in achieving that aim."" Vodafone is offering three pricing options for SIM only: Unlimited Max: Â£30 per month, giving users unlimited mobile access at speeds as fast as the device and the network will allow. Vodafone Unlimited: Â£26 per month and offering speeds of up to 10 Mbps (megabits per second) Vodafone Unlimited Lite: Â£23 per month and offers speeds of up to 2 Mbps Tariffs that are structured by data speed are ""a first for the UK"" said mobile analyst Kester Mann, of research firm CCS Insight. As such, Vodafone will need to explain this to customers who are ""only just beginning to understand the value of megabytes and gigabytes"". The total cost of a 5G Samsung Galaxy S10 and two-year contract is Â£1,637 ($2,062) for Vodafone's cheapest advertised tariff. To encourage small businesses to take up 5G services, Vodafone is offering a series of new plans that give business customers access to unlimited data and 5G at the same price as 4G. 5G is finally here. So what does it offer? EE launches 5G network Rival Three plans to roll out 5G in August with services from O2 coming in the autumn. ""After a hotly contested battle with Vodafone, EE claimed the honour of switching on the UK's first 5G network, in May 2019. However, the reality is that being first means little to consumers and the initial launches this summer represent only the first few tentative steps in a marathon 5G journey ahead,"" said Mr Mann. ""The real winners in 5G will only become apparent several years down the line."" The UK has put itself at the top of the leader board with its swift adoption of the technology. ""In 2012, the UK was only the 53rd nation to launch 4G behind places such as Guam, Azerbaijan and Kiribati. Now, with all four networks planning to switch on 5G in 2019 it moves from laggard to leader,"" said Mr Mann. All the UK's operators continue to use Huawei's equipment despite controversy surrounding the Chinese telecoms firm. If the UK government decides it is no longer safe to rely on having it as part of the network, the operators would be forced to strip out its kit and replace it.

"China has warned the UK not to ""interfere in its domestic affairs"" amid a growing diplomatic row over the recent protests in Hong Kong. Its UK ambassador said relations had been ""damaged"" by comments by Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and others backing the demonstrators' actions. Liu Xiaoming said those who illegally occupied Hong Kong's parliament should be ""condemned as law breakers"". The ambassador was later summoned to the Foreign Office over the remarks. A Foreign Office spokesman said Sir Simon McDonald, permanent under secretary and head of the diplomatic service, told the ambassador his comments were ""unacceptable and inaccurate"". Earlier, Prime Minister Theresa May said she had raised concerns with Chinese leaders. Weeks of mass protests in the territory over a controversial extradition bill exploded on Monday, when a group of activists occupied the Legislative Council building for several hours after breaking away from a peaceful protest - raising the colonial-era British flag. Critics say the extradition bill could be used to send political dissidents from Hong Kong to the mainland. Demonstrators have also broadened their demands to include the release of all detained activists and investigations into alleged police violence. In the middle of the demonstrations, Mr Hunt pledged his ""unwavering"" support to the ex-British colony and its citizens' freedoms. Allow Twitter content?

Did Hong Kong violence sway public opinion? What graffiti says about Hong Kong's evolving anger Hong Kong protests trample rule of law - China Beijing has made a formal complaint about Mr Hunt, accusing the Conservative leadership contender of ""colonial-era delusions"". But Mr Liu said he was ""disappointed"" by the UK's response. He said the countries' relationship was based on mutual respect and suggested there would be further ""problems"" if the UK did not recognise China's sovereignty over Hong Kong, its ""territorial integrity and principle of non-interference in domestic affairs"". He said it was ""hypocritical"" of UK politicians to criticise the lack of democracy and civil rights in Hong Kong when, under British rule, there had been no elections nor right to protest. The recent unrest, he added, was ""not about freedom but about breaking the law"". The background you need on the Hong Kong protests In response, Mr Hunt said good relations between countries were based on ""honouring the legally binding relationships between them"" - a reference to a 1984 treaty between the UK and China which paved the way for sovereignty over the territory to pass back to Beijing.

The Joint Declaration, signed by Margaret Thatcher and the then Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, set out how the rights of Hong Kong citizens should be protected in the territory's Basic Law under Chinese rule. Hong Kong has, since 1997, been run by China under a ""one country, two systems"" arrangement guaranteeing it a level of economic autonomy and personal freedoms not permitted on the mainland. The ambassador gave the British government both barrels at his press conference earlier. What's fascinating is there was no pretence, no attempt to gloss this over at all. This was visceral and system-wide. This is merely the British side of things, the same message is coming from Beijing and Hong Kong too. There is definite push-back from the whole Chinese machine. The British are so infuriated that they've summoned the ambassador almost immediately to give him a dressing down. What was a war of words now risks becoming a substantial issue between the two countries. The Foreign Office has said it continues to make it clear to the Chinese government, both in public and private, that the rights of Hong Kong residents must be fully respected. Speaking on Wednesday, Theresa May said she had raised her concerns directly with Chinese leaders at the recent G20 meeting. ""It is vital that Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and the rights and freedoms set down in the Sino-British joint declaration are respected,"" she told MPs. Successive UK governments have heralded a ""golden era"" in economic relations with China, with growing levels of trade and foreign investment. But critics say this has come at the expense of turning a blind eye to human rights violations in China and Beijing's increasing economic nationalism.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Fans are accusing TikTok creators of exploiting them for cash Video-sharing app TikTok says it is ""sorry"" that some children and other young people have felt pressured into sending money to their favourite influencers on the app. TikTok lets fans send their favourite videomakers ""digital gifts"", which can cost up to Â£48.99. A BBC investigation found influencers promising to share their phone numbers with fans in exchange for the gifts. TikTok said it would strengthen its policies and guidelines but did not explain exactly how. Claire (not her real name) told BBC News she regretted spending Â£100 to obtain her favourite TikTok star's phone number - and he had never answered his phone. Claire, 12, who lives in the north-west of England, sent TikTok star Sebastian Moy a Â£48.99 ""drama queen"" gift to show her appreciation for his videos. Sebastian Moy has 3.8 million fans on TikTok And when he had asked for another one in exchange for his personal phone number, she said she was swept up in the moment. The US-based video-maker has 3.8 million fans on TikTok and has not broken any of the app's rules. He has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment. TikTok is the fastest-growing social media app, with about 500 million regular users, although the company doesn't disclose its userbase. It's estimated to have been downloaded more than a billion times on app stores. The app lets people post 15-second videos. It is known for clips of teenagers lip-syncing and dancing to the latest trending music. The ""drama queen"" gift The company says it is most popular with 16- to 24-year-olds but there is evidence that many users are under 13, which is against the app's rules. The firm has alreadybeen fined $5.7m (Â£4.5m) by a US regulator after being accused of collecting under-13s' personal detailswithout their parents' consent. And on Tuesday, the UK's Information Commissioner revealed she had also launched an inquiry into whether the app was doing enough to safeguard its youngest users. ""We do have an active investigation into TikTok right now, so you can watch that space,"" said Elizabeth Denham. Videomakers with more than 1,000 followers are allowed to broadcast live on the platform. It is during these live streams that fans can send digital gifts to show their appreciation. Gifts appear as on-screen animations and cost between 5p and Â£48.99. The app's biggest stars can earn thousands of pounds in one live stream. TikTok declined to say how much of that money it kept - but several influencers told the BBC they took home 50% of all gift revenue earned. Over 10 weeks, the BBC monitored dozens of live streams in which the app's stars asked fans for gifts. In exchange, they promised shoutouts on their live streams, said they would follow back fans on social media or offered to make ""duets"", which allow users to collaborate with TikTok stars in a split-screen video. This video can not be played WATCH: What is TikTok? One creator promised to talk to a fan on Instagram ""for a week"" and was given three gifts worth a total of Â£147. Some creators routinely offered personal messaging details and phone numbers in exchange for gifts. The BBC also found a group who scoured the app for people giving gifts and then contacted them directly asking for money in exchange for ""likes"" and ""follows"". Stephanie Barbour, from Toronto, found her 11-year-old daughter had run up a bill for $400 (Â£240). ""I was shocked when I found out what the money was spent on,"" she said. ""I said to my daughter, 'So you don't actually get anything for it?' and she said, 'No.' ""Adults should know better. And even other teenagers should know better - that you do not ask children for money."" Another TikTok fan, Kelly, told the BBC she had spent Â£500-Â£600 of her own money on digital gifts. She no longer sends them because she feels she was exploited. ""I understand people need to make money these days off social media but I just think it's force-fed down young people's throats that they need to pay money to get attention or feel appreciated,"" Kelly said. Rhys, 20 said he had spent more than Â£1,000 without realising it. ""Gifting on TikTok is a little bit like gambling,"" he said ""It gets addictive. I really didn't see anything wrong with it at the time but now I don't think it's worth it. ""I have nothing to show for it. It was my personal choice but I do think there should be some sort of age restriction or timeout function."" The BBC contacted several of the TikTok stars seen using such techniques but most of them did not reply. The Neffati brothers The Neffati brothers have amassed 2.5 million followers in just six months on the platform. The 25-year-old Polish twins who live in Blackburn, Lancashire, are famous for their dancing and comedy sketches. They offer to follow back fans in exchange for a ""drama queen"" gift, worth Â£49 and promise to write fans' names on their heads if they send multiple gifts. They told the BBC that they had only started offering perks in exchange for gifts because they had been receiving them regularly. They said they were simply following the lead of other creators on the platform and that most of the fans that sent gifts were about 30 years old. But they said they did feel guilty when they received gifts from young fans. ""We don't like it when our gifters are young, so basically we ask them if their parents know about it,"" they said. ""But we can't stop them. We can't stop it. We are going live not only for the money but we are going on the live to get more audience."" Rhia, from south Wales, and has 2.5 million fans thanks to her creative video-editing skills. Rhia posts creative videos She said her average fan was about 10 to 14 years old and they were always happy with the perks she offered in exchange for gifts. But she also feels uncomfortable when she receives several gifts from very young followers. And she would like to see stricter age limits on gifting. ""It would give us peace of mind as creators,"" she told the BBC. ""It would make you feel more ethical because taking money from children is not a good way to earn a living really."" Livestream gifting originated in China - where TikTok's owner Bytedance is based. The practice is far more popular there. Professional ""cam girls"" earn huge amounts from their audiences. In the West, tipping has become more common especially on gaming platforms such as Twitch. However, the rapid rise of TikTok is testing the business model like never before. TikTok declined to answer specific questions but told the BBC it was investigating digital gifting. In a statement, it said: ""We do not tolerate behaviours that are deceptive in nature and we are sorry to hear some of the users' experiences. ""We recognise there is always room for improvements in terms of making guidelines and information more accessible, clear and easy-to-understand for all users. ""We value your feedback and will further strengthen our policies and product features."" The company gave no details on what policies or community guidelines it would change. Alessandro Bogliari, from the Influencer Marketing Factory, said there was wider pressure on TikTok to make changes. ""These sorts of stories are not good for a social network that is becoming popular with brands and marketers,"" he said. ""The app has major potential but there is clearly work to do to improve things. ""I think more parental-control features would be a good idea and some sort of cap on the amount users can gift per day or per livestream. ""They could also make the guidelines more clear and ban the use of certain terms that 'hard sell' to users."" Video app TikTok fails to remove online predators What is TikTok?

"England into their first World Cup semi-final since 1992 England dominant in the field - wickets shared around and two batsmen run out Bairstow top-scores with 106 in England's 305-8 Bairstow and Roy share 123-run stand for first wicket Black Caps fight back with ball - England slipping from 194-1 Amy Lofthouse and Matthew Henry Right, that's us done for the day. Stephan Shemilt's match report isover hereand the Test Match Special podcast will be available to download very soon. We'll be back tomorrow for Afghanistan v West Indies. Until then... Big call from Michael Vaughan... Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special If England win the next two tosses then I think they will win the World Cup. If they are in a chase I doubt whether they can play the right intelligent cricket under pressure of a chase. Can they win four tosses on the trot? Of course you can. England captain Eoin Morgan:""I thought we were outstanding today. It started with the two boys at the top of the order. They set a good solid platform playing in the manner they do. Jonny getting his hundred was match winning. ""The wicket did change after the 25th over and it did slow up. It was difficult to score. Every batsman found that so to have so many on the board was encouraging. It was about trying to get as close to 300 as possible."" On whether England will always look to bat first: ""I think we can do both. If the wicket dictates that 300 is par we can do both. It is about assessing the wicket and if it will get worse. ""All of the wickets in the tournament have got slower and lower so batting first has been the theme of the tournament. If that continues we will continue to bat first."" Jeremy ConeyEx-New Zealand captain on BBC Test Match Special New Zealand are overcome with lassitude at the moment, I have never seen a New Zealand team look like they do, there is a decline, there is a lack of skill and lack of intent. I have seen lack of skill before but not lack of intent. It feels like a lifetime ago, but it was Jonny Bairstow's incredible century that set up this crushing win for England. More from Kane Williamson:""There's been so much to learn from and I think the most important thing is to look at where we need to be as a group, from an individual perspective. The guys are all working really hard. There's been a lot of learning curves. Going ahead, touch wood, hopefully it all works out and we are in the semi-final but in some ways, it starts again. We haven't played our best cricket yet."" Text 81111 By winning the toss, is Eoin Morgan a contender for man of the match? David DM England coach Trevor Bayliss:""It is always good to get to the semi-finals - that is the business end of this completion and that was our first aim. We have got there on the back of two very good games. ""Against Sri Lanka we didn't play the way we normally play. The way we batted in the first half of the innings put the pressure on the guys at the back end. We were still affected by that going into the Australia game but had good chat before the India game."" On whether they will always want to bat first:""We will make that decision when we look at the wicket. The way this tournament is going, there is more pressure in the World Cup but the wickets have been quite as flat as they have been. We won 14 out of the last 17 batting second before the tournament so we are happy to do anything."" Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special England have dealt with it very well. To deal with India when 95% of the crowd are all with India and the way they played here, they have got all that belief back. If England had lost the toss this could have been a tricky day so the toss has been very important and whatever the meeting they had after losing to Australia they have got to get that mentality again. BBC Test Match Special England fast bowler Mark Wood:""It was like a quarter-final and I'm delighted we managed to qualify and show what we are made of. It was a special day to play at my home ground and nice to get the key wicket, maybe fortunate."" On the Kane Williamson run out:""I've got such tiny hands, he doesn't know how unlucky he is that I managed to get something on it! He's the glue, like Joe Root for us, he's one of the best players I have ever bowled at so to get him out without having to bowl at him I'm very happy with."" Allow Twitter content?

We definitely need to be better moving forward. England did get the best of the conditions but they were the better team. They outplayed us in all facets. The conditions didn't decide the result. Full credit to the way England played today."" Andy ZaltzmanTest Match Special statistician The absolute key for Pakistan is to win the toss because if they bowl first - even if they bowl Bangladesh out for nought they couldn't overtake on run-rate. They have to bat first and score 480, then bowl out Bangladesh for 160, they need to win by about 320 runs. England batsman Jonny Bairstow:""I am really pleased. We knew these two games were must win to give ourselves the best opportunity of reaching the semi-final. We knew the performances in the last couple of games weren't up to scratch. To play the way we have and hopefully keep it going into the semis is pleasing . ""We have got a couple days off. It will be really important that the guys get away and refresh and rest up.

Michael VaughanEx-England captain on BBC Test Match Special They should have a good night, they have made the semi-finals and they have got plenty of breathing space so they should celebrate and enjoy it together. The amount of pressure they are under at a home World Cup - they have delivered. I have faith in New Zealand. Blind faith, maybe, but I think a week away, a chance to regroup... And the same goes for England, actually. They've beaten India once already at Edgbaston. They can definitely do it again. Â© 2025 BBC.

"5G could be used as a replacement for fixed home broadband as well as offering new services such as virtual reality Vodafone has become the second UK mobile operator to turn on its 5G network, offering faster speeds and the opportunity for new services. The network is going live in seven UK cities, including Cardiff, London, Manchester and Glasgow. Making a success of the service could be crucial to the firm which has seen financial losses and customer complaints in recent years. 5G networks offer more capacity than 4G with speeds up to 100 times faster. It could also help support new technologies such as artificial intelligence, the internet of things, robotics, connected cities and self-driving cars. The three other cities to benefit are Birmingham, Bristol and Liverpool. Twelve additional towns and cities will follow later this year - Birkenhead, Blackpool, Bournemouth, Guildford, Newbury, Portsmouth, Plymouth, Reading, Southampton, Stoke-on-Trent, Warrington and Wolverhampton. Vodafone is the first UK provider to offer 5G roaming in Germany, Spain and Italy. Business director of Vodafone UK, Anne Sheehan, said: ""5G is a game-changer for the economy and UK businesses. We are committed to helping our customers take advantage of this technology by making it widely available in the UK and through roaming.  We want to help UK businesses become global leaders and 5G will play an important role in achieving that aim."" Vodafone is offering three pricing options for SIM only: Unlimited Max: Â£30 per month, giving users unlimited mobile access at speeds as fast as the device and the network will allow. Vodafone Unlimited: Â£26 per month and offering speeds of up to 10 Mbps (megabits per second) Vodafone Unlimited Lite: Â£23 per month and offers speeds of up to 2 Mbps Tariffs that are structured by data speed are ""a first for the UK"" said mobile analyst Kester Mann, of research firm CCS Insight. As such, Vodafone will need to explain this to customers who are ""only just beginning to understand the value of megabytes and gigabytes"". The total cost of a 5G Samsung Galaxy S10 and two-year contract is Â£1,637 ($2,062) for Vodafone's cheapest advertised tariff. To encourage small businesses to take up 5G services, Vodafone is offering a series of new plans that give business customers access to unlimited data and 5G at the same price as 4G. 5G is finally here. So what does it offer? EE launches 5G network Rival Three plans to roll out 5G in August with services from O2 coming in the autumn. ""After a hotly contested battle with Vodafone, EE claimed the honour of switching on the UK's first 5G network, in May 2019. However, the reality is that being first means little to consumers and the initial launches this summer represent only the first few tentative steps in a marathon 5G journey ahead,"" said Mr Mann. ""The real winners in 5G will only become apparent several years down the line."" The UK has put itself at the top of the leader board with its swift adoption of the technology. ""In 2012, the UK was only the 53rd nation to launch 4G behind places such as Guam, Azerbaijan and Kiribati. Now, with all four networks planning to switch on 5G in 2019 it moves from laggard to leader,"" said Mr Mann. All the UK's operators continue to use Huawei's equipment despite controversy surrounding the Chinese telecoms firm. If the UK government decides it is no longer safe to rely on having it as part of the network, the operators would be forced to strip out its kit and replace it.

"Despite the backlog, there are no plans to relax MOT rules More than 2,000 motorists across Northern Ireland failed to turn up for their MOT tests in June, despite public anger over test backlogs. There were 2,300 missed appointments last month, according to the Department for Infrastructure. At Â£30.50 per car per test, that is a potential loss to drivers of more than Â£70,000. It comes as some motorists argue that backlogs mean they cannot book a slot before their MOT certificate expires. Sunday openings to clear MOT backlog No MOT diesel test run in NI for 12 years To tackle the tests backlog, the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) opened 2,000 Sunday MOT slots on 16 and 23 June.  June 20192,300 appointments were missed 2018-19About 1.09 million  tests were carried out Same year32,000 customers did not attend MOT tests More vehicle examiners have been recruited and reminder letters are being sent out earlier to deal with the waits. In the first three months of this year alone, 7,300 vehicles failed to turn up for a booked test - 3.4% higher than the equivalent period in 2018. A DVA spokesperson said that in 2018-19 financial year, 32,000 customers did not attend their MOT appointments. In cash terms, ""no-show"" drivers have poured a potential Â£976,000 down the drain. The DVA conducted just over 1.09 million vehicle tests in 2018-19, an increase of 1.8% on the year before and the highest figure on record. In a statement, the DVA encouraged customers to book their vehicle test online as soon as they receive a reminder notice. ""We would ask that customers either attend their pre-booked appointments or cancel them to allow others to make use of the appointment,"" a spokesperson said. Despite discussions between police and the DVA about relaxing the rules to ease the situation, the department said it was not considering offering motorists exemptions from the MOT test at this stage. Northern Ireland has different rules around MOTs than the rest of the UK. A test is required on a car's fourth birthday in NI, rather than the third birthday elsewhere in the UK. In Northern Ireland, tests must be carried out at a specific MOT testing site operated by the DVA, whereas in Britain, tests can be conducted by approved private operators in commercial premises, such as garages.

"Outsourcing giant Serco has been fined Â£19.2m for fraud and false accounting over its electronic tagging service for the Ministry of Justice (MoJ). The fine is part of a deferred prosecution deal with the Serious Fraud Office, which will end an investigation that began in 2013. Serco had been understating how profitable the contract had been in its reporting to the MoJ. Back in 2013 the company paid Â£70m in compensation to the government. On top of the fine, Serco paid Â£3.7m in costs. The firm said it was ""mortified"" its UK subsidiary Serco Geografix had overcharged to tag criminals. ""Serco apologised unreservedly at the time, and we do so again,"" the firm's chief executive Rupert Soames said. He added that the management and culture of Serco ""have changed beyond all recognition"" since 2013. In 2013 Serco and fellow outsourcing group G4S faced allegations of charging the government for electronically monitoring people who were either dead, in jail, or had left the country. Serco lost its contract to tag criminals in the UK in late 2013. It said it has taken ""significant steps"" to try to reform, including strengthening its bidding, contract management, internal audit and management assurance processes. No board members or senior executives that were in post at the time still work for the group. The Financial Reporting Council also launched an investigation in June 2016 into Serco's auditor, Deloitte, at the time of the offences.

"This video can not be played People gathered outside the detention centre after the air strike An attack which killed more than 44 migrants at a detention centre outside the Libyan capital could constitute a war crime, a UN official said. At least 130 people were injured in the attack, which the Libyan government blamed on an air strike by forces loyal to a warlord, General Khalifa Haftar. Gen Haftar's forces accuse the government side of shelling the centre. Most of the dead are believed to be sub-Saharan Africans who were attempting to reach Europe from Libya. Thousands of migrants are being held in government-run detention centres in Libya. The location of the centre attacked on Tuesday and the information that it housed civilians had been passed to all parties in Libya's conflict, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, said. ""This attack may, depending on the precise circumstances, amount to a war crime,"" she said. It was the second time the shelter was hit, she added. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was was ""outraged"" by the reports and called for an independent investigation ""to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice"". Late on Wednesday, the UN Security Council held a meeting behind closed doors, but was unable to agree on a statement condemning the air strike, after the US said it needed approval from Washington before it could sign it, the AFP news agency reports. It was unclear why this approval was not forthcoming, but the Security Council meeting ended without issuing a statement. Libya has been torn by violence and division since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011. Who is Libya's military warlord Khalifa Haftar? Why is Libya so lawless? Libya country profile A hangar housing migrants at the Tajoura Detention Centre, which houses 600 migrants, reportedly took a direct hit. Women and children were among the victims, Guma El-Gamaty, a member of the UN-backed political dialogue group, told BBC World Service. An official in the Libyan health ministry, Doctor Khalid Bin Attia, described the carnage for the BBC after attending the scene: ""People were everywhere, the camp was destroyed, people are crying here, there is psychological trauma, the lights cut off. ""We couldn't see the area very clear but just when the ambulance came, it was horrible, blood is everywhere, somebody's guts in pieces."" The UN issued a stark warning in May thatthose living in the Tajoura centre should be moved,externalimmediately out of harm's way. ""The risks are simply unacceptable at this point,"" the UN refugee agency said. By Sebastian Usher, Arab affairs editor The UN and aid agencies have been warning that a tragedy like this has been all but inevitable as the renewed fighting in and around Tripoli has put migrants held in detention camps directly in the line of fire. The plight of migrants was already desperate, prey to human traffickers and militias. The UN has said that the airstrike on Tajoura shows that the EU policy of sending people trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe back to Libya must be ended. It's been successful in radically cutting the numbers of those getting into Europe by that route â although others have since opened up. But humanitarian agencies say the human cost is too high. With General Khalifa Haftar's assault on Tripoli stalled, the chances are that his forces may resort to indiscriminate attacks that could endanger civilian lives further. But the militias who hold the migrants in such appalling conditions, so close to what is now a frontline, must also take a share of the blame for what has happened. The UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, accused the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) of carrying out an air strike on the centre. The ""heinous crime"" was ""premeditated"" and ""precise"", it said. In Libya migrants are rounded up and held in government-run centres The LNA - led by Gen Haftar - was fighting government forces in the area where the strike happened. It had announced on Monday that it would start heavy air strikes on targets in Tripoli after ""traditional means"" of war had been exhausted. The LNA said its warplanes had bombed a pro-government camp near the centre and pro-government forces had fired shells in response, hitting the migrant centre by accident. A spokesman for the UN refugee agency, Charlie Yaxley, said it could not confirm who was behind the attack on the centre. In a subsequent statement, the head of the UN Mission in Libya, Ghassan Salama, was quoted as saying: ""This attack clearly could constitute a war crime,external, as it killed by surprise innocent people whose dire conditions forced them to be in that shelter."" No authority has full control over Libya and the country is extremely unstable, torn between several political and military factions, the two most important of which are led by Prime Minister Sarraj and Gen Haftar. Gen Haftar started an offensive against the government in April. This video can not be played Libya crisis: The fight for Tripoli explained from the frontline The general has been active in Libyan politics for more than four decades and was one of Gadaffi's close allies until a dispute in the late 1980s forced him to live in exile in the US. After returning to Libya when the uprising began in 2011, he built up a power base in the east and has won some support from France, Egypt and the UAE. Libyans have mixed feelings towards him due to his past association with Gadaffi and US connections, but do credit him for driving Islamist militants out of much of the city of Benghazi and its surroundings. People-smuggling gangs have flourished in Libya's political chaos, charging desperate migrants from sub-Saharan Africa thousands of dollars per head. This video can not be played Women and children are being held in camps close to fierce fighting in Libya Human rights groups have highlighted the poor conditions at the detention centres where many migrants end up as the EU works with the Libyan coastguard to intercept migrant boats. Italy, one of the main landing points for migrants from Libya, has taken a hard-line stance of closing its ports to humanitarian rescue boats, accusing them of aiding people smugglers. Instead,it wants to return any migrants found in open waterto Libya - where most end up in detention centres. Following Italy's objections, the wider EU proposed a compromise solution of setting up EU ""assessment centres"" in countries like Libya, whereapplications for asylum could be processed on foreign soilin a bid to break up the smuggling operations. Such a move was resisted by Libyan officials. As things stand, migrants are not treated with consideration when it comes to housing them, said Leonard Doyle, spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration in Geneva. ""This detention centre is right beside a militia workshop that's been targeted in the past and it's been hit by shrapnel,"" he said. ""Migrants who are trying to get to Europe get picked up typically by the Libyan coastguard. They're brought back to land and then they're brought usually by bus to any of up to 60 detention centres around the city. It's really not a good situation.""

Sunday openings to clear MOT backlog No MOT diesel test run in NI for 12 years To tackle the tests backlog, the Driver and Vehicle Agency (DVA) opened 2,000 Sunday MOT slots on 16 and 23 June.  June 20192,300 appointments were missed 2018-19About 1.09 million  tests were carried out Same year32,000 customers did not attend MOT tests More vehicle examiners have been recruited and reminder letters are being sent out earlier to deal with the waits. In the first three months of this year alone, 7,300 vehicles failed to turn up for a booked test - 3.4% higher than the equivalent period in 2018. A DVA spokesperson said that in 2018-19 financial year, 32,000 customers did not attend their MOT appointments. In cash terms, ""no-show"" drivers have poured a potential Â£976,000 down the drain. The DVA conducted just over 1.09 million vehicle tests in 2018-19, an increase of 1.8% on the year before and the highest figure on record. In a statement, the DVA encouraged customers to book their vehicle test online as soon as they receive a reminder notice. ""We would ask that customers either attend their pre-booked appointments or cancel them to allow others to make use of the appointment,"" a spokesperson said. Despite discussions between police and the DVA about relaxing the rules to ease the situation, the department said it was not considering offering motorists exemptions from the MOT test at this stage. Northern Ireland has different rules around MOTs than the rest of the UK. A test is required on a car's fourth birthday in NI, rather than the third birthday elsewhere in the UK. In Northern Ireland, tests must be carried out at a specific MOT testing site operated by the DVA, whereas in Britain, tests can be conducted by approved private operators in commercial premises, such as garages.

"""Sorry to interrupt the game,"" comes the Welsh lilt of the sports bar owner in Washington DC, speaking on a microphone to the crowds glued to the USA v England game at the start of the second half. ""But someone's left their fish and chips on the bar - and it's been 20 minutes. No one likes cold fish and chips."" They could be forgiven for being so engrossed in the action that they forgot to eat - at times it seemed like people were even forgetting to breathe as the teams battled it out for a place in the World Cup final. The venue, aptly (for the US fans, as it turned out) called Lucky Bar, is packed to capacity with red, white and blue ahead of the kickoff. That's despite the fact it is 15:00 local time on a blazing hot Tuesday afternoon. A few England fans are showing their colours by wearing Three Lions on their shirts, but there are many, many more Americans - in some cases, their friends or partners, delighting in ribbing each other during the game. Lionesses 'left hearts and souls' on pitch USA beats England 2-1 Brit Richard Lindley, who has lived in the US for nine years, says: ""When we found out England was playing the USA, we took the day off work to be here. I feel horribly outnumbered though."" ""We're going to see if our marriage lasts the game, But we have an agreement that we're not going to gloat, no matter what,"" promises his American wife Ridley Williams with a smile. Richard Lindley was supporting England while his wife supported the USA ""I'm surprised there are so many people here,"" she adds. ""But surprised in a good way. It's great to support this team, but we need to support them too financially [referring to their fight with US Soccer for pay equality with the men's team]. From a US perspective, the women are way better than the men so it just doesn't make sense. ""The women's game is so much more popular. Basically, the US backs the women because they're winners. ""And it's wonderful also for young girls to be able to look up to someone who looks like you."" Many of the people in the bar admit they wouldn't have turned up if the US men's team was playing. Christine Nawrot and Stephen Ikin react to a tense moment during the match Christine Nawrot says: ""There's no way this bar would be so full. But I like that it's not just women supporting the game - it's a real cross-section."" Her English partner Stephen Ikin adds: ""I've never taken much notice of the women's team before. Here in America, football's seen more as a women's sport. It was kind of amazing at the last game to see a guy with a female jersey on, with the name of a female player on the back."" He may well have been talking about Kelly Stephenson, who is wearing a shirt bearing the name of Kelley O'Hara, teamed with a pair of star-spangled banner shorts. Kelly Stephenson bought his shirt online during the USA's first match of the tournament ""We were here at the bar for the first game,"" he says. ""I was on the phone at half-time, ordering this jersey. And then I decided to book tickets to France, and went to their Chile game. ""I love this team. This group of women have great personalities and support fantastic causes. They're a great unit. ""I'm borderline obsessed."" [This indeed becomes obvious as he pauses to watch the goal replays at half-time, not wanting to miss a second]. Beers and tears for England fans Kelly Stephenson and Cate Behles transfixed by the match Jim Grieco, visiting from New Jersey, fixed his schedule so he could catch the match. ""We're all very proud of them. I'm so happy to see such a large crowd here,"" he says. Anne Lumpkin, who played football at college level, is watching with a group of friends, all in their USA shirts. ""It's fun to watch with other people who share your passion for the game and the country,"" she says. ""And it's fun with it being 4 July soon, which makes it more exciting."" ""And it helps with the excitement to be playing England as it's such a big name,"" adds her friend Colton Hotary. Harry Weiss, with his head in his hands, works in the USA but is from England ""England-America is such a classic game,"" says Harry Weiss, originally from the UK but living in the US. ""And it's about seeing great teams playing a great sport - I think people respect that."" Fans were concerned Megan Rapinoe wasn't playing, with Gaites Layton - there with her friends to watch the game - saying: ""I'm really hoping she's OK for the final. I think she's awesome and gives such a great voice to the sport."" The passion ran high during the match, with polite applause at first for England from the US fans turning to shouts of ""VAR!"" and ""are you kidding me?"" as the minutes ticked away. Two women watch a dramatic moment during the World Cup semi-final ""This team definitely has the potential to go all the way,"" says Cate Behles. ""I've supported the team since the last women's World Cup, and it's just got bigger and bigger."" When, in short succession, England miss a penalty and then Millie Bright is sent off, there are loud cheers and chants of ""USA! USA!"", any pretence of friendly rivalry having completely dissipated. And at the final whistle, the place erupts, finally letting out its collected breath. Gaites Layton, right with her hands up, celebrating the US win Sarah Parkinson says she is enjoying ""haranguing"" her English girlfriend, away in South Africa, over text message. ""Yeah it's been nasty back and forth for the last few minutes,"" she grins. ""It was a brilliant game. ""It's time for the world to recognise not just the degree of skill, but the degree of soul women's teams are bringing to the game, and elevate it to beyond where it's been."" Her friend Alex Krensky, visiting from Wisconsin, admits: ""I'm not usually into sports. But it was so powerful being in a space with so many women there, seeing them be so excited and inspired."" And Ridley Williams, consoling her husband over the result, says with a smile: ""Nope, still not gloating!""

"Day started with culture questions followed by attorney general questions Urgent questions on role of Serco in the justice system and Work Capability Assessments Business statement Transport Committee statement on local roads funding and maintenance Backbench business debate on ending the sale of new petrol and diesel cars General debate on assisted dying Adjournment debate on NHS procurement Coming up... House of CommonsParliament The day has started with questions to Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Ministers. Shortly after 10:00 BST, the attorney general will take questions from MPs. Then, there are two urgent questions. The first is on the role of Serco in the justice system, this question is being asked by shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon. The second UQ comes from former shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams and is on the review of social security claimant deaths since 2010, and whether or not these were supplied to reviewers of Work Capability Assessment. Then, MPs will hear the business statement for upcoming business in the Commons. After, there'll be a statement from the Transport Committee on local roads funding and maintenance. This will be followed by a backbench business debate on ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars. After that, a general debate on assisted dying. Finally, the day will close with an adjournment debate on NHS procurement. House of LordsParliament The House of Lords votes by 245 to 99 to set up a joint parliamentary committee to examine the possible impact of a no-deal Brexit. That means the government has been comprehensively defeated. The motion will now go to the Commons for consideration. House of LordsParliament Crossbencher and writer of Article 50 Lord Kerr of Kinlochard says that if the UK leaves without a deal on October 31st, then there is ""no prospect"" of a ""gradual transition"". ""I think everyone now accepts that the decision to start the Article 50 process was a revocable position,"" he starts, but adds that ""there is no ladder back up the cliff"" if the UK leaves without a deal, and the UK will have to rejoin the EU as a new member. He warns that EU countries will ""insist"" on concessions from the UK if it were to leave without a deal, as it changes the UK's negotiating position. ""Life will be a little harder...if the rules of the game change,"" he states. ""Were we to resile"" on the Â£39bn exit bill ""we will be defeated,"" he says, adding a warning that the EU will not agree to any changes to the backstop. House of LordsParliament Leader of the Liberal Democrat peers Lord Newby says ""Europe's voice is the only powerful one"" advocating policies which the UK agrees with at the G20, he states. ""The economic cost"" of the UK leaving ""far outweighs"" the net contribution to the EU, he adds. He describes no deal as a ""Tory virility symbol"". He says that only 28% of the population want a no-deal Brexit, and only 8% of 18-24 year olds want one. House of LordsParliament Labour members of the House of Lords are calling for an independent report into the effects of a no-deal exit from the European Union. Labour leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith of Basildon, asks if the government is confident that the UK has the capacity to cope with no deal from day one. She warns that the Health and Safety Executive would have to take over the regulation of chemicals, a capacity it has never dealt with before. She says business groups are warning the government that the ""shock would be felt for generations to come"". ""Politicians should tell the truth,"" she says, rather than just following what people want. ""Surely it is right for Parliament to be fully informed and engaged?"" she adds, It would be ""disturbingly undemocratic"" for the UK to leave the EU as a result of proroguing Parliament, which she describes as a ""coward's way out"". ""We cannot accept marching towards the cliff-edge"" without government transparency, she states. House of CommonsParliament The Commons has now moved on to their debate on Income Tax regulations. This will be followed by debates on dangerous drugs and whistleblowing. The Commons will close debate today on schools in Winchester. House of CommonsParliament In response to Rory Stewart, the shadow international development secretary Dan Carden asked if the UK can ensure a safe passage for civilians wishing to leave Idlib, Syria. He pointed to estimates which suggest as many as 700,000 refugees could try to leave the province which is one of the last strongholds of rebel and jihadist groups in the country. Mr Carden also expressed concern about ""the arbitrary way in which Iraqi authorities are conducting trials of alleged jihadi collaborators"". In his reply, Mr Stewart said the ""only real way in which we going to be able to resolve these problems is through a political settlement."" However he added that achieving such a settlement would be ""unbelievably difficult"". House of CommonsParliament Mr Stewart tells MPs the ""sudden rise and fall of Islamic State"" carries lessons for the UK and the nations of the world. ""In a context so inherently unpredictable, Britain and its allies need to stand in a state of brace preparing for the unexpected,"" he says. He warns the country needs ""to keep a close eye on countries that seem to be at peace"". He emphasises the importance of ""retaining our linguistic expertise"" and ""nurturing our  relationships with potential coalition partners"". Concluding his speech, he tells MPs the key to future responses will not be the amount of money spent or the number of troops deployed but ""the breadth of our knowledge"". House of CommonsParliament The prime minister concludes her statement and International Development Secretary Rory Stewart begins his. He is giving MPs an update on the campaign against the Islamic State group. House of CommonsParliament Labour's Chris Bryant congratulates Theresa May on the expression she adopted when she met the Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit. ""There was more ice in it than the polar ice cap,"" he says. He notes President Putin gave an interview in which he says ""western style liberalism is obsolete"". ""I hope she pointed out that freedom of speech and freedom of elections is pretty good,"" Mr Bryant says. Theresa May replies: ""Unlike the polar ice cap, on this issue I am not melting."" House of CommonsParliament Lib Dem Leader Sir Vince Cable says the World Trade Organization's mechanism for resolving disputes ""no longer works because the US doesn't recognise it"". He accuses politicians in favour of leaving the EU on WTO rules of wanting to make Britain ""dependent on a very weak and damaged organisation"". Theresa May says she is ""strongly supporting an informal process to reach a solution"". The BBC's Reality Check has made a video explaining difficulties currently faced by the WTO: This video can not be played World Trade: Is Trump undermining a key dispute court? House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford says the SNP view President Trump as ""irresponsible and delusional"" over climate change, adding that Scotland has ""already reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 45% since 1990"". He says the Japanese foreign minister at the G20 warned that a no-deal Brexit could cause Japanese car manufacturers to leave the UK, something he says Theresa May left out from her speech. Mrs May responds that it is in the best interests of the UK to leave the EU with a good deal, and she believes that she has presented a good deal to Parliament. She says that whenever the UK government gives Scotland more powers, they do not use these new powers and instead come back to Westminster and say ""please may we have some more"".

House of CommonsParliament On climate change, Theresa May says she has expressed her disappointment that the US pulled out of the climate change deal but adds that the other G20 members ""held fast"" to the Paris Agreement. ""We're showing the lead,"" she says. She notes that Mr Corbyn ""didn't welcome"" the gender balance in the EU nominations and concludes her reply by attacking Labour's position on Brexit. House of CommonsParliament Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says ""there is little progress to commemorate"" on changes made in the G20 over the past 20 years. He warns that this latest summit did not make the necessary changes on climate change. He warns that ""this is a threat to the security of us all, all over the planet"". ""It is the responsibility of the G20 to lead efforts to combat climate change."" He asks why 97% of UK aid in developing countries goes to projects which are supporting fossil fuels. He asks what actions are being taken to ensure that the Paris Climate Accord can survive President Trump's refusal to commit to the agreement. Mr Corbyn goes on to ask for Theresa May to release the report she has ""repressed"" which shows the Saudi government's funding of terrorism. And he welcomes those who have been nominated for the roles in the European Union, asking whether Mrs May believes her successor should go back to the British people to get Brexit resolved. House of CommonsParliament After PMQs, the Labour MP Carolyn Harris raised an emotional point of order. The Swansea MP has been campaigning for a number of years for the introduction of a fund to support parents with the cost of their child's funeral. Ms Harris has been calling for this since she had to take out a loan to pay for her own child's funeral. The children's funeral fund will be up and running from 23 July and Ms Harris used the point of order to thank everyone in involved in getting it started. She was close to tears as she told MPs that the fund is a legacy for her son - Martin. ""From the bottom of my heart, thank you,"" she said. Speaker John Bercow said the MP's ""sheer passion and integrity"" was an example to all. The prime minister also added a few words, telling Ms Harris that she had taken ""her personal sadness"" and ""put it to good benefit for families up and down the country"". House of CommonsParliament Theresa May continues to list the candidates for European Union top jobs who will be voted on by the Parliament in the coming weeks. She says that the new faces have a wide range of experience and knowledge and that there is a good gender balance among the candidates. ""Once we leave the European Union we will need to agree the details of our future relationship,"" but ""that will be a matter for my successor to take forward,"" she says. German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen has been chosen to replace Jean-Claude Juncker and EU Commission president, while Christine Lagarde, the French current head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has been nominated as the first woman to lead the European Central Bank (ECB). Belgian liberal Prime Minister Charles Michel has been chosen to replace European Council President Donald Tusk. House of CommonsParliament Theresa May says that at the G20 there were discussions on the biggest issues facing the world. She said that Britain will ""always stand by the global rules"" to ensure peace and stability. There is a need for working to ensure that the world is carbon neutral by 2050, she says, as G20 countries account for 80% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. ""It remains disappointing that the United States continues to opt out on a critical global issue,"" she says. She adds that the UK continues to work on ensuring that a crisis centre can work with social media companies when terrorist atrocities are being streamed live online. She states that the government is pushing for a ""reformed and strengthened"" World Trade Organization. ""Escalation is in no-one's interest"" in the tensions between Iran and the Gulf countries, she adds. She says she wants to see Iran ""uphold its obligations"" on the nuclear deal. PMQs House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Steve Reed raises thestabbing of his constituent Kelly Mary Fauvrelle. He says the police believe it may have been a random act  and says the government's actions on knife crime ""isn't working"". Theresa May replies ""we were all shocked when we saw this terrible act"". ""We need to look at how young people do not feel the need to carry knives and to ensure we deal with the criminal gangs and the drugs that lie behind these terrible acts,"" she says.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Fans are accusing TikTok creators of exploiting them for cash Video-sharing app TikTok says it is ""sorry"" that some children and other young people have felt pressured into sending money to their favourite influencers on the app. TikTok lets fans send their favourite videomakers ""digital gifts"", which can cost up to Â£48.99. A BBC investigation found influencers promising to share their phone numbers with fans in exchange for the gifts. TikTok said it would strengthen its policies and guidelines but did not explain exactly how. Claire (not her real name) told BBC News she regretted spending Â£100 to obtain her favourite TikTok star's phone number - and he had never answered his phone. Claire, 12, who lives in the north-west of England, sent TikTok star Sebastian Moy a Â£48.99 ""drama queen"" gift to show her appreciation for his videos. Sebastian Moy has 3.8 million fans on TikTok And when he had asked for another one in exchange for his personal phone number, she said she was swept up in the moment. The US-based video-maker has 3.8 million fans on TikTok and has not broken any of the app's rules. He has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment. TikTok is the fastest-growing social media app, with about 500 million regular users, although the company doesn't disclose its userbase. It's estimated to have been downloaded more than a billion times on app stores. The app lets people post 15-second videos. It is known for clips of teenagers lip-syncing and dancing to the latest trending music. The ""drama queen"" gift The company says it is most popular with 16- to 24-year-olds but there is evidence that many users are under 13, which is against the app's rules. The firm has alreadybeen fined $5.7m (Â£4.5m) by a US regulator after being accused of collecting under-13s' personal detailswithout their parents' consent. And on Tuesday, the UK's Information Commissioner revealed she had also launched an inquiry into whether the app was doing enough to safeguard its youngest users. ""We do have an active investigation into TikTok right now, so you can watch that space,"" said Elizabeth Denham. Videomakers with more than 1,000 followers are allowed to broadcast live on the platform. It is during these live streams that fans can send digital gifts to show their appreciation. Gifts appear as on-screen animations and cost between 5p and Â£48.99. The app's biggest stars can earn thousands of pounds in one live stream. TikTok declined to say how much of that money it kept - but several influencers told the BBC they took home 50% of all gift revenue earned. Over 10 weeks, the BBC monitored dozens of live streams in which the app's stars asked fans for gifts. In exchange, they promised shoutouts on their live streams, said they would follow back fans on social media or offered to make ""duets"", which allow users to collaborate with TikTok stars in a split-screen video. This video can not be played WATCH: What is TikTok? One creator promised to talk to a fan on Instagram ""for a week"" and was given three gifts worth a total of Â£147. Some creators routinely offered personal messaging details and phone numbers in exchange for gifts. The BBC also found a group who scoured the app for people giving gifts and then contacted them directly asking for money in exchange for ""likes"" and ""follows"". Stephanie Barbour, from Toronto, found her 11-year-old daughter had run up a bill for $400 (Â£240). ""I was shocked when I found out what the money was spent on,"" she said. ""I said to my daughter, 'So you don't actually get anything for it?' and she said, 'No.' ""Adults should know better. And even other teenagers should know better - that you do not ask children for money."" Another TikTok fan, Kelly, told the BBC she had spent Â£500-Â£600 of her own money on digital gifts. She no longer sends them because she feels she was exploited. ""I understand people need to make money these days off social media but I just think it's force-fed down young people's throats that they need to pay money to get attention or feel appreciated,"" Kelly said. Rhys, 20 said he had spent more than Â£1,000 without realising it. ""Gifting on TikTok is a little bit like gambling,"" he said ""It gets addictive. I really didn't see anything wrong with it at the time but now I don't think it's worth it. ""I have nothing to show for it. It was my personal choice but I do think there should be some sort of age restriction or timeout function."" The BBC contacted several of the TikTok stars seen using such techniques but most of them did not reply. The Neffati brothers The Neffati brothers have amassed 2.5 million followers in just six months on the platform. The 25-year-old Polish twins who live in Blackburn, Lancashire, are famous for their dancing and comedy sketches. They offer to follow back fans in exchange for a ""drama queen"" gift, worth Â£49 and promise to write fans' names on their heads if they send multiple gifts. They told the BBC that they had only started offering perks in exchange for gifts because they had been receiving them regularly. They said they were simply following the lead of other creators on the platform and that most of the fans that sent gifts were about 30 years old. But they said they did feel guilty when they received gifts from young fans. ""We don't like it when our gifters are young, so basically we ask them if their parents know about it,"" they said. ""But we can't stop them. We can't stop it. We are going live not only for the money but we are going on the live to get more audience."" Rhia, from south Wales, and has 2.5 million fans thanks to her creative video-editing skills. Rhia posts creative videos She said her average fan was about 10 to 14 years old and they were always happy with the perks she offered in exchange for gifts. But she also feels uncomfortable when she receives several gifts from very young followers. And she would like to see stricter age limits on gifting. ""It would give us peace of mind as creators,"" she told the BBC. ""It would make you feel more ethical because taking money from children is not a good way to earn a living really."" Livestream gifting originated in China - where TikTok's owner Bytedance is based. The practice is far more popular there. Professional ""cam girls"" earn huge amounts from their audiences. In the West, tipping has become more common especially on gaming platforms such as Twitch. However, the rapid rise of TikTok is testing the business model like never before. TikTok declined to answer specific questions but told the BBC it was investigating digital gifting. In a statement, it said: ""We do not tolerate behaviours that are deceptive in nature and we are sorry to hear some of the users' experiences. ""We recognise there is always room for improvements in terms of making guidelines and information more accessible, clear and easy-to-understand for all users. ""We value your feedback and will further strengthen our policies and product features."" The company gave no details on what policies or community guidelines it would change. Alessandro Bogliari, from the Influencer Marketing Factory, said there was wider pressure on TikTok to make changes. ""These sorts of stories are not good for a social network that is becoming popular with brands and marketers,"" he said. ""The app has major potential but there is clearly work to do to improve things. ""I think more parental-control features would be a good idea and some sort of cap on the amount users can gift per day or per livestream. ""They could also make the guidelines more clear and ban the use of certain terms that 'hard sell' to users."" Video app TikTok fails to remove online predators What is TikTok?

"The government is announcing a ""road map"" aimed at tackling inequality faced by women from school to retirement. Women and Equalities Minister Penny Mordaunt said women take an ""economic hit"" at each life stage and are ""more likely to end up financially fragile"". She wants to look at barriers to equality including employment rights and workplace sexual harassment. She also said abortion rules in Northern Ireland were ""incompatible with a person's human rights"". Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland, and a termination is only permitted if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Is equal pay actually possible? Ms Mordaunt said the issue was devolved, but added that she expected the UK government to act following an expected court ruling on the subject. ""If government did not act, Parliament would,"" she added.  ""I think paucity of care that women have endured in Northern Ireland is the most appalling thing and it must change."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4, she said women, on average, enter the workplace with higher qualifications and ""worked very hard, but earn less and save less"". The road map sets out ""eight key issues"" including gender imbalances in certain industries and occupations and attitudes in schools. ""What this does is actually track a woman throughout the course of her life and at each stage of that life, the hit that she takes, usually the economic hit, which means that she's more likely to end up financially fragile, with fewer choices than the average person in society,"" Ms Mordaunt said. ""Women are 50% more likely to be in low pay and trapped in low pay for decades."" Stars tell world leaders poverty is sexist Most firms pay men more than women What is the gender pay gap? The minister said a consultation on sexual harassment in the workplace would be launched next week - and would include proposals on making employers responsible when a member of staff was harassed by another employee. She also said she wanted to end paternity leave discrimination, make a better childcare offer, ensure pension pots were taken into account in divorces and introduce employment rights for carers. The minister acknowledged that ""many have asked for paid leave for carers"" adding: ""The reason why these things haven't emerged is because we need more pressure from the Cabinet Office."" The CEO of the Chartered Management Institute, Ann Francke, said the road map was ""ambitious, comprehensive and collaborative"", and ""well-executed, it is a potential game changer"". Caroline Waters, deputy chairwoman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said gender inequality in Britain was ""deeply entrenched"" and there could be no ""quick fixes"". ""We urge concerted action across government to address all the barriers that continue to hold women back from achieving their full potential."" But Sarah Green, co-director of End Violence Against Women, said the proposals were ""little tweaks when what is needed is quite a big cultural shift still in our workplaces"". ""We need to do something fundamental as shifting the responsibility for preventing sexual harassment at work fundamentally from the individual employee to the employer.""

"This video can not be played Torrential rain lashes Japan More than one million people across the Japanese island of Kyushu have been ordered to evacuate, amid warnings of landslides and floods brought on by heavy rain. Authorities urged residents in parts of Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures to move to safety immediately. One elderly woman in Kagoshima city died after a mudslide hit her home. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told residents of the cities to ""take steps to protect their lives"". Kagoshima prefecture has asked Japan's self-defence forces to help,externalwith the relief efforts, Governor Satoshi Mitazono reportedly said. The entire populations of Kagoshima city, Kirishima and Aira were ordered to leave. Another 930,000 people in the south of the island were also advised to move. But by 1600 local time (0700 GMT), the country's Fire and Disaster Management Agency reportedly said fewer than 4,000 people had been evacuated. Weather officials say 1,000mm (39in) of rain has fallen on Kyushu island since Friday, and Japan's Meteorological Agency forecasts the rains will continue into next week. A further 350mm of rain is expected in the southern part of the island and 300mm in the northern part by Thursday morning, with some areas predicted to get more than 80mm of rain every hour. The agency said a month's rainfall could hit parts of Kyushu in just 24 hours. The island of Shikoku is also forecast to receive up to 250mm of rain in the same period. The rainy front is expected to hang over the entire Japanese archipelago until Saturday. Last July about 200 people died in western Japan in the country's worst flooding disaster in decades. It was the highest death toll caused by rainfall in Japan since 1982. About two million people were evacuatedand more than 70,000 emergency workers were deployed after the heavy rain caused floods and landslides in the region.

"This video can not be played People gathered outside the detention centre after the air strike An attack which killed more than 44 migrants at a detention centre outside the Libyan capital could constitute a war crime, a UN official said. At least 130 people were injured in the attack, which the Libyan government blamed on an air strike by forces loyal to a warlord, General Khalifa Haftar. Gen Haftar's forces accuse the government side of shelling the centre. Most of the dead are believed to be sub-Saharan Africans who were attempting to reach Europe from Libya. Thousands of migrants are being held in government-run detention centres in Libya. The location of the centre attacked on Tuesday and the information that it housed civilians had been passed to all parties in Libya's conflict, the UN's High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, said. ""This attack may, depending on the precise circumstances, amount to a war crime,"" she said. It was the second time the shelter was hit, she added. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres said he was was ""outraged"" by the reports and called for an independent investigation ""to ensure that the perpetrators are brought to justice"". Late on Wednesday, the UN Security Council held a meeting behind closed doors, but was unable to agree on a statement condemning the air strike, after the US said it needed approval from Washington before it could sign it, the AFP news agency reports. It was unclear why this approval was not forthcoming, but the Security Council meeting ended without issuing a statement. Libya has been torn by violence and division since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011. Who is Libya's military warlord Khalifa Haftar? Why is Libya so lawless? Libya country profile A hangar housing migrants at the Tajoura Detention Centre, which houses 600 migrants, reportedly took a direct hit. Women and children were among the victims, Guma El-Gamaty, a member of the UN-backed political dialogue group, told BBC World Service. An official in the Libyan health ministry, Doctor Khalid Bin Attia, described the carnage for the BBC after attending the scene: ""People were everywhere, the camp was destroyed, people are crying here, there is psychological trauma, the lights cut off. ""We couldn't see the area very clear but just when the ambulance came, it was horrible, blood is everywhere, somebody's guts in pieces."" The UN issued a stark warning in May thatthose living in the Tajoura centre should be moved,externalimmediately out of harm's way. ""The risks are simply unacceptable at this point,"" the UN refugee agency said. By Sebastian Usher, Arab affairs editor The UN and aid agencies have been warning that a tragedy like this has been all but inevitable as the renewed fighting in and around Tripoli has put migrants held in detention camps directly in the line of fire. The plight of migrants was already desperate, prey to human traffickers and militias. The UN has said that the airstrike on Tajoura shows that the EU policy of sending people trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe back to Libya must be ended. It's been successful in radically cutting the numbers of those getting into Europe by that route â although others have since opened up. But humanitarian agencies say the human cost is too high. With General Khalifa Haftar's assault on Tripoli stalled, the chances are that his forces may resort to indiscriminate attacks that could endanger civilian lives further. But the militias who hold the migrants in such appalling conditions, so close to what is now a frontline, must also take a share of the blame for what has happened. The UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, accused the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) of carrying out an air strike on the centre. The ""heinous crime"" was ""premeditated"" and ""precise"", it said. In Libya migrants are rounded up and held in government-run centres The LNA - led by Gen Haftar - was fighting government forces in the area where the strike happened. It had announced on Monday that it would start heavy air strikes on targets in Tripoli after ""traditional means"" of war had been exhausted. The LNA said its warplanes had bombed a pro-government camp near the centre and pro-government forces had fired shells in response, hitting the migrant centre by accident. A spokesman for the UN refugee agency, Charlie Yaxley, said it could not confirm who was behind the attack on the centre. In a subsequent statement, the head of the UN Mission in Libya, Ghassan Salama, was quoted as saying: ""This attack clearly could constitute a war crime,external, as it killed by surprise innocent people whose dire conditions forced them to be in that shelter."" No authority has full control over Libya and the country is extremely unstable, torn between several political and military factions, the two most important of which are led by Prime Minister Sarraj and Gen Haftar. Gen Haftar started an offensive against the government in April. This video can not be played Libya crisis: The fight for Tripoli explained from the frontline The general has been active in Libyan politics for more than four decades and was one of Gadaffi's close allies until a dispute in the late 1980s forced him to live in exile in the US. After returning to Libya when the uprising began in 2011, he built up a power base in the east and has won some support from France, Egypt and the UAE. Libyans have mixed feelings towards him due to his past association with Gadaffi and US connections, but do credit him for driving Islamist militants out of much of the city of Benghazi and its surroundings. People-smuggling gangs have flourished in Libya's political chaos, charging desperate migrants from sub-Saharan Africa thousands of dollars per head. This video can not be played Women and children are being held in camps close to fierce fighting in Libya Human rights groups have highlighted the poor conditions at the detention centres where many migrants end up as the EU works with the Libyan coastguard to intercept migrant boats. Italy, one of the main landing points for migrants from Libya, has taken a hard-line stance of closing its ports to humanitarian rescue boats, accusing them of aiding people smugglers. Instead,it wants to return any migrants found in open waterto Libya - where most end up in detention centres. Following Italy's objections, the wider EU proposed a compromise solution of setting up EU ""assessment centres"" in countries like Libya, whereapplications for asylum could be processed on foreign soilin a bid to break up the smuggling operations. Such a move was resisted by Libyan officials. As things stand, migrants are not treated with consideration when it comes to housing them, said Leonard Doyle, spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration in Geneva. ""This detention centre is right beside a militia workshop that's been targeted in the past and it's been hit by shrapnel,"" he said. ""Migrants who are trying to get to Europe get picked up typically by the Libyan coastguard. They're brought back to land and then they're brought usually by bus to any of up to 60 detention centres around the city. It's really not a good situation.""

"This video can not be played WATCH: Fans are accusing TikTok creators of exploiting them for cash Video-sharing app TikTok says it is ""sorry"" that some children and other young people have felt pressured into sending money to their favourite influencers on the app. TikTok lets fans send their favourite videomakers ""digital gifts"", which can cost up to Â£48.99. A BBC investigation found influencers promising to share their phone numbers with fans in exchange for the gifts. TikTok said it would strengthen its policies and guidelines but did not explain exactly how. Claire (not her real name) told BBC News she regretted spending Â£100 to obtain her favourite TikTok star's phone number - and he had never answered his phone. Claire, 12, who lives in the north-west of England, sent TikTok star Sebastian Moy a Â£48.99 ""drama queen"" gift to show her appreciation for his videos. Sebastian Moy has 3.8 million fans on TikTok And when he had asked for another one in exchange for his personal phone number, she said she was swept up in the moment. The US-based video-maker has 3.8 million fans on TikTok and has not broken any of the app's rules. He has not responded to the BBC's requests for comment. TikTok is the fastest-growing social media app, with about 500 million regular users, although the company doesn't disclose its userbase. It's estimated to have been downloaded more than a billion times on app stores. The app lets people post 15-second videos. It is known for clips of teenagers lip-syncing and dancing to the latest trending music. The ""drama queen"" gift The company says it is most popular with 16- to 24-year-olds but there is evidence that many users are under 13, which is against the app's rules. The firm has alreadybeen fined $5.7m (Â£4.5m) by a US regulator after being accused of collecting under-13s' personal detailswithout their parents' consent. And on Tuesday, the UK's Information Commissioner revealed she had also launched an inquiry into whether the app was doing enough to safeguard its youngest users. ""We do have an active investigation into TikTok right now, so you can watch that space,"" said Elizabeth Denham. Videomakers with more than 1,000 followers are allowed to broadcast live on the platform. It is during these live streams that fans can send digital gifts to show their appreciation. Gifts appear as on-screen animations and cost between 5p and Â£48.99. The app's biggest stars can earn thousands of pounds in one live stream. TikTok declined to say how much of that money it kept - but several influencers told the BBC they took home 50% of all gift revenue earned. Over 10 weeks, the BBC monitored dozens of live streams in which the app's stars asked fans for gifts. In exchange, they promised shoutouts on their live streams, said they would follow back fans on social media or offered to make ""duets"", which allow users to collaborate with TikTok stars in a split-screen video. This video can not be played WATCH: What is TikTok? One creator promised to talk to a fan on Instagram ""for a week"" and was given three gifts worth a total of Â£147. Some creators routinely offered personal messaging details and phone numbers in exchange for gifts. The BBC also found a group who scoured the app for people giving gifts and then contacted them directly asking for money in exchange for ""likes"" and ""follows"". Stephanie Barbour, from Toronto, found her 11-year-old daughter had run up a bill for $400 (Â£240). ""I was shocked when I found out what the money was spent on,"" she said. ""I said to my daughter, 'So you don't actually get anything for it?' and she said, 'No.' ""Adults should know better. And even other teenagers should know better - that you do not ask children for money."" Another TikTok fan, Kelly, told the BBC she had spent Â£500-Â£600 of her own money on digital gifts. She no longer sends them because she feels she was exploited. ""I understand people need to make money these days off social media but I just think it's force-fed down young people's throats that they need to pay money to get attention or feel appreciated,"" Kelly said. Rhys, 20 said he had spent more than Â£1,000 without realising it. ""Gifting on TikTok is a little bit like gambling,"" he said ""It gets addictive. I really didn't see anything wrong with it at the time but now I don't think it's worth it. ""I have nothing to show for it. It was my personal choice but I do think there should be some sort of age restriction or timeout function."" The BBC contacted several of the TikTok stars seen using such techniques but most of them did not reply. The Neffati brothers The Neffati brothers have amassed 2.5 million followers in just six months on the platform. The 25-year-old Polish twins who live in Blackburn, Lancashire, are famous for their dancing and comedy sketches. They offer to follow back fans in exchange for a ""drama queen"" gift, worth Â£49 and promise to write fans' names on their heads if they send multiple gifts. They told the BBC that they had only started offering perks in exchange for gifts because they had been receiving them regularly. They said they were simply following the lead of other creators on the platform and that most of the fans that sent gifts were about 30 years old. But they said they did feel guilty when they received gifts from young fans. ""We don't like it when our gifters are young, so basically we ask them if their parents know about it,"" they said. ""But we can't stop them. We can't stop it. We are going live not only for the money but we are going on the live to get more audience."" Rhia, from south Wales, and has 2.5 million fans thanks to her creative video-editing skills. Rhia posts creative videos She said her average fan was about 10 to 14 years old and they were always happy with the perks she offered in exchange for gifts. But she also feels uncomfortable when she receives several gifts from very young followers. And she would like to see stricter age limits on gifting. ""It would give us peace of mind as creators,"" she told the BBC. ""It would make you feel more ethical because taking money from children is not a good way to earn a living really."" Livestream gifting originated in China - where TikTok's owner Bytedance is based. The practice is far more popular there. Professional ""cam girls"" earn huge amounts from their audiences. In the West, tipping has become more common especially on gaming platforms such as Twitch. However, the rapid rise of TikTok is testing the business model like never before. TikTok declined to answer specific questions but told the BBC it was investigating digital gifting. In a statement, it said: ""We do not tolerate behaviours that are deceptive in nature and we are sorry to hear some of the users' experiences. ""We recognise there is always room for improvements in terms of making guidelines and information more accessible, clear and easy-to-understand for all users. ""We value your feedback and will further strengthen our policies and product features."" The company gave no details on what policies or community guidelines it would change. Alessandro Bogliari, from the Influencer Marketing Factory, said there was wider pressure on TikTok to make changes. ""These sorts of stories are not good for a social network that is becoming popular with brands and marketers,"" he said. ""The app has major potential but there is clearly work to do to improve things. ""I think more parental-control features would be a good idea and some sort of cap on the amount users can gift per day or per livestream. ""They could also make the guidelines more clear and ban the use of certain terms that 'hard sell' to users."" Video app TikTok fails to remove online predators What is TikTok?

"Day started with culture questions followed by attorney general questions Urgent questions on role of Serco in the justice system and Work Capability Assessments Business statement Transport Committee statement on local roads funding and maintenance Backbench business debate on ending the sale of new petrol and diesel cars General debate on assisted dying Adjournment debate on NHS procurement Coming up... House of CommonsParliament The day has started with questions to Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Ministers. Shortly after 10:00 BST, the attorney general will take questions from MPs. Then, there are two urgent questions. The first is on the role of Serco in the justice system, this question is being asked by shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon. The second UQ comes from former shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams and is on the review of social security claimant deaths since 2010, and whether or not these were supplied to reviewers of Work Capability Assessment. Then, MPs will hear the business statement for upcoming business in the Commons. After, there'll be a statement from the Transport Committee on local roads funding and maintenance. This will be followed by a backbench business debate on ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars. After that, a general debate on assisted dying. Finally, the day will close with an adjournment debate on NHS procurement. House of LordsParliament The House of Lords votes by 245 to 99 to set up a joint parliamentary committee to examine the possible impact of a no-deal Brexit. That means the government has been comprehensively defeated. The motion will now go to the Commons for consideration. House of LordsParliament Crossbencher and writer of Article 50 Lord Kerr of Kinlochard says that if the UK leaves without a deal on October 31st, then there is ""no prospect"" of a ""gradual transition"". ""I think everyone now accepts that the decision to start the Article 50 process was a revocable position,"" he starts, but adds that ""there is no ladder back up the cliff"" if the UK leaves without a deal, and the UK will have to rejoin the EU as a new member. He warns that EU countries will ""insist"" on concessions from the UK if it were to leave without a deal, as it changes the UK's negotiating position. ""Life will be a little harder...if the rules of the game change,"" he states. ""Were we to resile"" on the Â£39bn exit bill ""we will be defeated,"" he says, adding a warning that the EU will not agree to any changes to the backstop. House of LordsParliament Leader of the Liberal Democrat peers Lord Newby says ""Europe's voice is the only powerful one"" advocating policies which the UK agrees with at the G20, he states. ""The economic cost"" of the UK leaving ""far outweighs"" the net contribution to the EU, he adds. He describes no deal as a ""Tory virility symbol"". He says that only 28% of the population want a no-deal Brexit, and only 8% of 18-24 year olds want one. House of LordsParliament Labour members of the House of Lords are calling for an independent report into the effects of a no-deal exit from the European Union. Labour leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith of Basildon, asks if the government is confident that the UK has the capacity to cope with no deal from day one. She warns that the Health and Safety Executive would have to take over the regulation of chemicals, a capacity it has never dealt with before.

House of CommonsParliament In response to Rory Stewart, the shadow international development secretary Dan Carden asked if the UK can ensure a safe passage for civilians wishing to leave Idlib, Syria. He pointed to estimates which suggest as many as 700,000 refugees could try to leave the province which is one of the last strongholds of rebel and jihadist groups in the country. Mr Carden also expressed concern about ""the arbitrary way in which Iraqi authorities are conducting trials of alleged jihadi collaborators"". In his reply, Mr Stewart said the ""only real way in which we going to be able to resolve these problems is through a political settlement."" However he added that achieving such a settlement would be ""unbelievably difficult"". House of CommonsParliament Mr Stewart tells MPs the ""sudden rise and fall of Islamic State"" carries lessons for the UK and the nations of the world. ""In a context so inherently unpredictable, Britain and its allies need to stand in a state of brace preparing for the unexpected,"" he says.

He emphasises the importance of ""retaining our linguistic expertise"" and ""nurturing our  relationships with potential coalition partners"".

"Day started with culture questions followed by attorney general questions Urgent questions on role of Serco in the justice system and Work Capability Assessments Business statement Transport Committee statement on local roads funding and maintenance Backbench business debate on ending the sale of new petrol and diesel cars General debate on assisted dying Adjournment debate on NHS procurement Coming up... House of CommonsParliament The day has started with questions to Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Ministers. Shortly after 10:00 BST, the attorney general will take questions from MPs. Then, there are two urgent questions. The first is on the role of Serco in the justice system, this question is being asked by shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon. The second UQ comes from former shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams and is on the review of social security claimant deaths since 2010, and whether or not these were supplied to reviewers of Work Capability Assessment. Then, MPs will hear the business statement for upcoming business in the Commons. After, there'll be a statement from the Transport Committee on local roads funding and maintenance. This will be followed by a backbench business debate on ending the sale of petrol and diesel cars. After that, a general debate on assisted dying. Finally, the day will close with an adjournment debate on NHS procurement. House of LordsParliament The House of Lords votes by 245 to 99 to set up a joint parliamentary committee to examine the possible impact of a no-deal Brexit. That means the government has been comprehensively defeated. The motion will now go to the Commons for consideration. House of LordsParliament Crossbencher and writer of Article 50 Lord Kerr of Kinlochard says that if the UK leaves without a deal on October 31st, then there is ""no prospect"" of a ""gradual transition"". ""I think everyone now accepts that the decision to start the Article 50 process was a revocable position,"" he starts, but adds that ""there is no ladder back up the cliff"" if the UK leaves without a deal, and the UK will have to rejoin the EU as a new member. He warns that EU countries will ""insist"" on concessions from the UK if it were to leave without a deal, as it changes the UK's negotiating position. ""Life will be a little harder...if the rules of the game change,"" he states. ""Were we to resile"" on the Â£39bn exit bill ""we will be defeated,"" he says, adding a warning that the EU will not agree to any changes to the backstop. House of LordsParliament Leader of the Liberal Democrat peers Lord Newby says ""Europe's voice is the only powerful one"" advocating policies which the UK agrees with at the G20, he states. ""The economic cost"" of the UK leaving ""far outweighs"" the net contribution to the EU, he adds. He describes no deal as a ""Tory virility symbol"". He says that only 28% of the population want a no-deal Brexit, and only 8% of 18-24 year olds want one. House of LordsParliament Labour members of the House of Lords are calling for an independent report into the effects of a no-deal exit from the European Union. Labour leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith of Basildon, asks if the government is confident that the UK has the capacity to cope with no deal from day one. She warns that the Health and Safety Executive would have to take over the regulation of chemicals, a capacity it has never dealt with before. She says business groups are warning the government that the ""shock would be felt for generations to come"". ""Politicians should tell the truth,"" she says, rather than just following what people want. ""Surely it is right for Parliament to be fully informed and engaged?"" she adds, It would be ""disturbingly undemocratic"" for the UK to leave the EU as a result of proroguing Parliament, which she describes as a ""coward's way out"".

"The government is announcing a ""road map"" aimed at tackling inequality faced by women from school to retirement. Women and Equalities Minister Penny Mordaunt said women take an ""economic hit"" at each life stage and are ""more likely to end up financially fragile"". She wants to look at barriers to equality including employment rights and workplace sexual harassment. She also said abortion rules in Northern Ireland were ""incompatible with a person's human rights"". Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland, and a termination is only permitted if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health. Is equal pay actually possible? Ms Mordaunt said the issue was devolved, but added that she expected the UK government to act following an expected court ruling on the subject. ""If government did not act, Parliament would,"" she added.  ""I think paucity of care that women have endured in Northern Ireland is the most appalling thing and it must change."" Speaking to BBC Radio 4, she said women, on average, enter the workplace with higher qualifications and ""worked very hard, but earn less and save less"". The road map sets out ""eight key issues"" including gender imbalances in certain industries and occupations and attitudes in schools. ""What this does is actually track a woman throughout the course of her life and at each stage of that life, the hit that she takes, usually the economic hit, which means that she's more likely to end up financially fragile, with fewer choices than the average person in society,"" Ms Mordaunt said. ""Women are 50% more likely to be in low pay and trapped in low pay for decades."" Stars tell world leaders poverty is sexist Most firms pay men more than women What is the gender pay gap? The minister said a consultation on sexual harassment in the workplace would be launched next week - and would include proposals on making employers responsible when a member of staff was harassed by another employee. She also said she wanted to end paternity leave discrimination, make a better childcare offer, ensure pension pots were taken into account in divorces and introduce employment rights for carers. The minister acknowledged that ""many have asked for paid leave for carers"" adding: ""The reason why these things haven't emerged is because we need more pressure from the Cabinet Office."" The CEO of the Chartered Management Institute, Ann Francke, said the road map was ""ambitious, comprehensive and collaborative"", and ""well-executed, it is a potential game changer"". Caroline Waters, deputy chairwoman of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said gender inequality in Britain was ""deeply entrenched"" and there could be no ""quick fixes"". ""We urge concerted action across government to address all the barriers that continue to hold women back from achieving their full potential."" But Sarah Green, co-director of End Violence Against Women, said the proposals were ""little tweaks when what is needed is quite a big cultural shift still in our workplaces"". ""We need to do something fundamental as shifting the responsibility for preventing sexual harassment at work fundamentally from the individual employee to the employer.""

"This video can not be played Torrential rain lashes Japan More than one million people across the Japanese island of Kyushu have been ordered to evacuate, amid warnings of landslides and floods brought on by heavy rain. Authorities urged residents in parts of Kagoshima and Miyazaki prefectures to move to safety immediately. One elderly woman in Kagoshima city died after a mudslide hit her home. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has told residents of the cities to ""take steps to protect their lives"". Kagoshima prefecture has asked Japan's self-defence forces to help,externalwith the relief efforts, Governor Satoshi Mitazono reportedly said. The entire populations of Kagoshima city, Kirishima and Aira were ordered to leave. Another 930,000 people in the south of the island were also advised to move. But by 1600 local time (0700 GMT), the country's Fire and Disaster Management Agency reportedly said fewer than 4,000 people had been evacuated. Weather officials say 1,000mm (39in) of rain has fallen on Kyushu island since Friday, and Japan's Meteorological Agency forecasts the rains will continue into next week. A further 350mm of rain is expected in the southern part of the island and 300mm in the northern part by Thursday morning, with some areas predicted to get more than 80mm of rain every hour. The agency said a month's rainfall could hit parts of Kyushu in just 24 hours. The island of Shikoku is also forecast to receive up to 250mm of rain in the same period. The rainy front is expected to hang over the entire Japanese archipelago until Saturday. Last July about 200 people died in western Japan in the country's worst flooding disaster in decades. It was the highest death toll caused by rainfall in Japan since 1982. About two million people were evacuatedand more than 70,000 emergency workers were deployed after the heavy rain caused floods and landslides in the region.

"This video can not be played People gathered outside the detention centre after the air strike An attack has killed up to 40 migrants at a detention centre on the outskirts of the Libyan capital Tripoli, government officials say. Some 80 people were injured at the centre, which the UN-backed government says was hit by an air strike. Anti-government forces led by warlord Gen Khalifa Haftar have accused government forces of bombarding it. Most of the dead are believed to be Africans, attempting to reach Europe on clandestine sea crossings from Libya. Who is Libya's military warlord Khalifa Haftar? Why is Libya so lawless? Libya country profile Thousands of migrants are stopped and held in government-run detention centres. The country has been torn by violence and division since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011. Some 120 migrants were inside a hangar at the Tajoura Detention Centre which took a direct hit on Tuesday evening, emergency services spokesman Osama Ali told AFP news agency. Tajoura is believed to house some 600 migrants. Women and children were among those hit, Guma El-Gamaty, a member of the UN-backed political dialogue group, told BBC World Service. An official in the Libyan health ministry, Doctor Khalid Bin Attia, described the carnage for the BBC after attending the scene: ""People were everywhere, the camp was destroyed, people are crying here, there is psychological trauma, the lights cut off. ""We couldn't see the area very clear but just when the ambulance came, it was horrible, blood is everywhere, somebody's guts in pieces."" The UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, accused the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) of carrying out an air strike on the centre. The ""heinous crime"" was ""premeditated"" and ""precise"", it said. The LNA - led by Gen Haftar - was fighting government forces in the area where the strike happened. It had announced on Monday that it would start heavy air strikes on targets in Tripoli after ""traditional means"" of war had been exhausted. The LNA said its warplanes had bombed a pro-government camp near the centre and pro-government forces had fired shells in response, hitting the migrant centre by accident. A spokesman for the UN refugee agency, Charlie Yaxley, said it could not confirm who was behind the attack on the centre, Reuters news agency reports. No authority has full control over Libya and the country is extremely unstable, torn between several political and military factions, the two most important of which are led by Prime Minister Sarraj and Gen Haftar. Gen Haftar started an offensive against the government in April. This video can not be played BBC correspondent Feras Kilani reports from Tripoli in April The general has been active in Libyan politics for more than four decades and was one of Gaddafi's close allies until a dispute in the late 1980s forced him to live in exile in the US. After returning to Libya when the uprising began in 2011, he built up a power base in the east and has won some support from France, Egypt and the UAE. Libyans have mixed feelings towards him due to his past association with Gaddafi and US connections, but do credit him for driving Islamist militants out of much of the city of Benghazi and its surroundings. People-smuggling gangs have flourished in Libya's political chaos, charging desperate migrants from sub-Saharan Africa thousands of dollars per head. This video can not be played Women and children are being held in camps close to fierce fighting in Libya Human rights groups have highlighted the poor conditions at the detention centres where many migrants end up as the EU works with the Libyan coastguard to intercept migrant boats. Leonard Doyle, spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration in Geneva, said migrants were not treated with consideration when it came to housing them. ""This detention centre is right beside a militia workshop that's been targeted in the past and it's been hit by shrapnel,"" he said. ""Migrants who are trying to get to Europe get picked up typically by the Libyan coastguard. They're brought back to land and then they're brought usually by bus to any of up to 60 detention centres around the city. It's really not a good situation."" Did you witness the attack?

"This video can not be played Tesco boss Dave Lewis says the impact on shoppers of a no-deal Brexit is still uncertain. Planning for the new Brexit deadline is ""more difficult"" because the supply network will be full of Christmas stock, Tesco's boss has warned. Dave Lewis told the BBC that the new deadline of the end of October  meant there would be ""less capacity"" for stockpiling longer-life items. A no-deal Brexit could mean tariffs and delays at the border that interrupt supplies of some food, he said. But Mr Lewis said leaving the EU could also provide opportunities for the UK. Mr Lewis said the supermarket chain had bought extra stock of long-life items in preparation for 29 March - when the UK was initially expected to leave the EU - but said it would be harder to make similar preparations this time round. ""We'll do whatever is practical depending on how things develop between now and then. ""But the challenge will always be those things which are shorter life  - fresh produce. That's what the UK imports quite a lot of,"" he said. He said the impact on shoppers of a no-deal Brexit was still uncertain. ""Empty shelves depends on what no-deal means. If there's a problem at the border, if there's a problem with tariffs then there could be interruption. ""If as part of no deal there is no tariff, there is no problem. We could be absolutely fine,"" he said. The UK currently imports about half of the food it eats, but Mr Lewis said Brexit could be a good time to ""take stock"". ""It may be a good time for the UK to... decide, actually: what food do we want to eat, with what impact on health, with what impact on the environment. ""Having a food strategy for the country would be a very good outcome."" Other key challenges facing the supermarket giant are demands for healthy eating, cutting waste and plastic-free packaging. Mr Lewis admitted companies ""don't ever do enough"" to cut plastic use. While Tesco has removed plastics where it can and introduced the option for customers to bring their own packaging, he said getting rid of it completely would require huge changes across the supply chain which would involve ""9,000 suppliers across 35,000 products"". He warned getting rid of packaging protection for loose goods could mean they were more likely to be damaged, creating more waste, and ultimately higher prices. ""We can't change everything tomorrow, it's not practical,"" he said.

"This video can not be played The train hit the men while they were on the tracks near Margam Two rail workers who died after being hit by a passenger train were wearing ear defenders and may not have heard it coming, police say. The men, aged 58, from North Cornelly, and 64, from Kenfig Hill, were struck near Margam by the Swansea to London Paddington train at about 10:00 BST. The pair were pronounced dead at the scene and a third person was treated for shock, but was not injured. Network Rail said it was ""shocked and distressed"" by the incident. British Transport Police (BTP) Supt Andy Morgan said: ""Following a number of urgent enquiries into this tragic incident, it has been established that the three people were railway workers who were working on the lines at the time. ""The initial stages of the investigation suggest that the two men who died had been wearing ear defenders at the time, tragically, could not hear the passenger train approaching. ""We have a number of officers who remain in the area and we are continuing to work alongside the Rail Accident Investigation Branch to understand the full circumstances of what happened in the moments before this incredibly sad, fatal collision."" Rail investigator warned of 'too many near misses' Bill Kelly, Network Rail's route managing director for Wales, added: ""We are fully cooperating with the British Transport Police and Rail Accident Investigation Branch. ""Our thoughts are with the families of our colleagues and our members of staff who will be affected by this tragic loss, and we will provide all the support we can."" Police and the Rail Accident Investigation Branch are investigating The tragedy happened just three months after theRail Accident Investigation Branch warnedthere were ""too many near misses in which railway workers have had to jump for their lives"". In 2018 there was one death on the mainline railway and 6,641 injuries, of which 164 were major. Great Western Railway (GWR) said about 180 passengers were on the train at the time of the incident. One passenger said a party of school children were on board, and they had had to shut the blinds in the carriage to prevent them seeing what was happening outside. The train has since been moved and the line reopened just before 21:00 but GWR said replacement bus services will continue to operate to supplement trains between Swansea and Cardiff Central stations. The company said in a statement: ""Everyone at GWR is incredibly saddened to learn that two railway colleagues lost their lives this morning, when they were struck by the 0929 service from Swansea to London Paddington. ""We have offered our full assistance to the British Transport Police, the Rail Accident Investigation Branch, and Network Rail as they seek to understand the circumstances which led to this tragic accident."" Passengers started being evacuated from the train around three hours after the crash and were put on buses to Port Talbot and Cardiff. One passenger who was on board the train said: ""This happened shortly after we left Port Talbot Parkway. We didn't hear anything at all. We weren't even aware an incident had taken place until the train manager made an announcement."" Stephen Lester could see ""devastated"" rail staff out of the window Stephen Lester, who was also on board, said: ""[I] looked out of the window and saw people standing around looking at the floor. ""They were devastated that one or maybe two of their colleagues was under the train."" He said the blinds had to be pulled down as there were secondary school children from Swansea in the carriage. A teacher travelling with around 30 pupils said they had been on a trip to London, adding that rail staff had been ""absolutely amazing"". This video can not be played Passengers on the train which killed two rail workers describe how events unfolded Arriving at Port Talbot Parkway, passenger Auriel Griffiths from Cimla, Neath Port Talbot, said:  ""It was a bit of an experience reallyâ¦ thank God the train didn't turn over."" She had been travelling to visit a relative in hospital when the incident happened. She said staff on the train had been ""very good"". ""They kept coming along and giving us information, coffee and water,"" she said. Describing the moment the train came to a standstill, she said: ""It just sort of stopped. I didn't feel a bang or anythingâ¦ ""People got killed, that's worse than being inconvenienced isn't itâ¦ I feel upset about it."" Robert Jones praised the train staff for their handling of the incident Fellow passenger Robert Jones, from Neath, who was travelling with his wife, said it had seemed as if the train was stopping because of the works which were going on. ""There was no sound, there was no particular judder, there was no commotion. ""Quite soon after the announcement was made that a major incident had occurred,"" he said, adding two further announcements were made explaining what had happened. ""It became evident that it was a tragedy."" Mr Jones said it was difficult in the hours that followed, knowing people had lost lives, but said: ""Every single passenger in my coach dealt with it in the most remarkable way. They accepted the situation that there would be a delay and the staff were just unbelievable all round."" About 180 passengers were on the train at the time of the incident, Great Western Railway said The Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash called for a suspension of all similar works by Network Rail ""until the facts were established"" following the ""shocking news"". His counterpart at the Transport Salaried Staffs' Association, Manuel Cortes, said it was not acceptable for people to ""go out to work and end up losing their lives"".

He said: ""I'm sure the whole house will want to express their condolences to the families of those rail workers who were hit and killed by a train this morning in Port Talbot."" UK and Welsh ministers expressed their condolences after the fatal crash Prime Minister Theresa May said she shared his sentiments. Speaking in the Senedd, Welsh government deputy transport minister Lee Waters said the government and the assembly was ""deeply shocked"", adding: ""It's hard to understand how this could have happened this morning just 20 or so miles away from us."" UK Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said there would be an investigation into how the accident happened, adding: ""I will ensure lessons are learned"". He said he was ""deeply saddened"" and sent his condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of the workers.

"This video can not be played People gathered outside the detention centre after the air strike An attack has killed up to 40 migrants at a detention centre on the outskirts of the Libyan capital Tripoli, government officials say. Some 80 people were injured at the centre, which the UN-backed government says was hit by an air strike. Anti-government forces led by warlord Gen Khalifa Haftar have accused government forces of bombarding it. Most of the dead are believed to be Africans, attempting to reach Europe on clandestine sea crossings from Libya. Who is Libya's military warlord Khalifa Haftar? Why is Libya so lawless? Libya country profile Thousands of migrants are stopped and held in government-run detention centres. The country has been torn by violence and division since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011. Some 120 migrants were inside a hangar at the Tajoura Detention Centre which took a direct hit on Tuesday evening, emergency services spokesman Osama Ali told AFP news agency. Tajoura is believed to house some 600 migrants. Women and children were among those hit, Guma El-Gamaty, a member of the UN-backed political dialogue group, told BBC World Service. An official in the Libyan health ministry, Doctor Khalid Bin Attia, described the carnage for the BBC after attending the scene: ""People were everywhere, the camp was destroyed, people are crying here, there is psychological trauma, the lights cut off. ""We couldn't see the area very clear but just when the ambulance came, it was horrible, blood is everywhere, somebody's guts in pieces."" The UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), led by Prime Minister Fayez al-Sarraj, accused the self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) of carrying out an air strike on the centre. The ""heinous crime"" was ""premeditated"" and ""precise"", it said. The LNA - led by Gen Haftar - was fighting government forces in the area where the strike happened. It had announced on Monday that it would start heavy air strikes on targets in Tripoli after ""traditional means"" of war had been exhausted. The LNA said its warplanes had bombed a pro-government camp near the centre and pro-government forces had fired shells in response, hitting the migrant centre by accident. A spokesman for the UN refugee agency, Charlie Yaxley, said it could not confirm who was behind the attack on the centre, Reuters news agency reports. No authority has full control over Libya and the country is extremely unstable, torn between several political and military factions, the two most important of which are led by Prime Minister Sarraj and Gen Haftar. Gen Haftar started an offensive against the government in April. This video can not be played BBC correspondent Feras Kilani reports from Tripoli in April The general has been active in Libyan politics for more than four decades and was one of Gaddafi's close allies until a dispute in the late 1980s forced him to live in exile in the US. After returning to Libya when the uprising began in 2011, he built up a power base in the east and has won some support from France, Egypt and the UAE. Libyans have mixed feelings towards him due to his past association with Gaddafi and US connections, but do credit him for driving Islamist militants out of much of the city of Benghazi and its surroundings. People-smuggling gangs have flourished in Libya's political chaos, charging desperate migrants from sub-Saharan Africa thousands of dollars per head. This video can not be played Women and children are being held in camps close to fierce fighting in Libya Human rights groups have highlighted the poor conditions at the detention centres where many migrants end up as the EU works with the Libyan coastguard to intercept migrant boats. Leonard Doyle, spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration in Geneva, said migrants were not treated with consideration when it came to housing them. ""This detention centre is right beside a militia workshop that's been targeted in the past and it's been hit by shrapnel,"" he said. ""Migrants who are trying to get to Europe get picked up typically by the Libyan coastguard. They're brought back to land and then they're brought usually by bus to any of up to 60 detention centres around the city. It's really not a good situation."" Did you witness the attack?

"This video can not be played Tesco boss Dave Lewis says the impact on shoppers of a no-deal Brexit is still uncertain. Planning for the new Brexit deadline is ""more difficult"" because the supply network will be full of Christmas stock, Tesco's boss has warned. Dave Lewis told the BBC that the new deadline of the end of October  meant there would be ""less capacity"" for stockpiling longer-life items. A no-deal Brexit could mean tariffs and delays at the border that interrupt supplies of some food, he said. But Mr Lewis said leaving the EU could also provide opportunities for the UK. Mr Lewis said the supermarket chain had bought extra stock of long-life items in preparation for 29 March - when the UK was initially expected to leave the EU - but said it would be harder to make similar preparations this time round. ""We'll do whatever is practical depending on how things develop between now and then. ""But the challenge will always be those things which are shorter life  - fresh produce. That's what the UK imports quite a lot of,"" he said. He said the impact on shoppers of a no-deal Brexit was still uncertain. ""Empty shelves depends on what no-deal means. If there's a problem at the border, if there's a problem with tariffs then there could be interruption. ""If as part of no deal there is no tariff, there is no problem. We could be absolutely fine,"" he said. The UK currently imports about half of the food it eats, but Mr Lewis said Brexit could be a good time to ""take stock"". ""It may be a good time for the UK to... decide, actually: what food do we want to eat, with what impact on health, with what impact on the environment. ""Having a food strategy for the country would be a very good outcome."" Other key challenges facing the supermarket giant are demands for healthy eating, cutting waste and plastic-free packaging. Mr Lewis admitted companies ""don't ever do enough"" to cut plastic use. While Tesco has removed plastics where it can and introduced the option for customers to bring their own packaging, he said getting rid of it completely would require huge changes across the supply chain which would involve ""9,000 suppliers across 35,000 products"". He warned getting rid of packaging protection for loose goods could mean they were more likely to be damaged, creating more waste, and ultimately higher prices. ""We can't change everything tomorrow, it's not practical,"" he said.
