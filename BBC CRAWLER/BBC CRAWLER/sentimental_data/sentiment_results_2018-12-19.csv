"Fiona Onasanya was issued a speeding ticket a week after she was elected as MP An MP has been found guilty of perverting the course of justice by lying to police about who was behind the wheel of a speeding car. Peterborough MP Fiona Onasanya denied she was driving her car when it was caught doing 41mph in a 30mph zone in Thorney, Cambridgeshire, in July 2017. The 35-year-old Labour MP was convicted in an Old Bailey retrial. A Labour Party spokesman said she had been ""administratively suspended"" and has called for her to resign. He added: ""The Labour Party is deeply disappointed in Fiona Onasanya's behaviour. It falls well below what is expected of politicians. She should now resign."" The MP's brother Festus Onasanya, 33, previously pleaded guilty to three counts of perverting the course of justice. The pair will be sentenced on a date yet to be set. The MP's Nissan Micra was caught by a speed camera in Thorney After the verdict, the judge Mr Justice Stuart-Smith said: ""This is not going to be easy, not to give any indication one way or the other [about sentencing]."" During her retrial, after a previous jury failed to reach a verdict, the court was told the MP's Nissan Micra car was caught near Peterborough just after 22:00 BST on 24 July last year. She received a Notice of Intended Prosecution (NIP) that required her to state whether she was driving the car at the time or to identify who was. The authorities were told the family's former lodger Aleks AntipowÂ had been behind the wheel, but inquiries revealed he had been in Russia visiting his family at the time. A fake address and telephone number were also provided, which the prosecution said would make Mr Antipow ""untraceable to the police"" and the ""true driver"" would escape prosecution. Festus Onasanya pleaded guilty to three counts of perverting the course of justice The MP's former communications manager Dr Christian DeFeo came forward during the first trial to give evidence against her, after his wife forwarded him a local newspaper article about the case. He said she visited their house, a short distance from the speed camera in Thorney, on the evening of 24 July and that she arrived and left alone. The court heard Onasanya's mobile phone was being used in the vicinity of the speed camera at the time of the offence. She claimed to the jury that her brother ""would have had to be driving me"" and added: ""I don't use my phone when driving"". This will be a blow to the Labour Party - Fiona was one of their rising stars. She was quickly promoted to the whip's office and said she had ambitions to be the first black Prime Minister, but it would seem her career with the Labour Party is now over. The verdict does not necessarily mean there will be a by-election, but if she is sentenced to more than a year imprisonment, even if it is suspended, it will automatically trigger a by-election. If it is less than a year that would trigger a recall petition which means if 10% of all her constituents sign a petition there would have to be a by-election. If that did not happen, in theory she could continue sitting as an independent MP, but that seems unlikely. MP in speeding case lied, says ex-aide MP speeding case 'became about lying' MP's brother admits lying to police Onasanya had been elected as an MP six weeks before the speeding offence took place, but stood down as a Labour whip in November. She told the court she had been working from a Westminster corridor during her early weeks as an MP and was deluged by thousands of emails. When she received the NIP over the speeding offence she said she had left it at her mother's home in Cambridge for whoever borrowed her car because she assumed she had been in London. She had also been admitted to hospital for a relapse of multiple sclerosis while being pursued for the NIP and said she was ""probably not in the best head space"" at the time.

"Another Brexit referendum will become a ""plausible"" way forward if there is deadlock in Parliament, Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has said. She told ITV's Peston show while she did not personally support another vote, the case for one would grow if MPs could not agree another solution. She said she hoped MPs would back Theresa May's deal with the EU next month but it would be ""very difficult"". The PM says the UK must be ready to leave without a deal if it is rejected. Mrs May has repeatedly ruled out holding another referendum, saying it was the government's duty to implement the result of the 2016 Brexit vote. A Downing Street source said the government was ""very clear we are 100% opposed"" to another referendum. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but an agreement on the terms of its withdrawal and a declaration on future relations will only come into force if the UK and EU Parliaments approve it. Brexit: A really simple guide EU reveals no-deal Brexit plans 'Horrified' firms urge action on Brexit The Commons vote was due to be held earlier this month but the PM postponed it once it became clear it would be defeated by a large margin. She has since sought to gain further assurances from EU leaders to allay MPs' concerns. Ms Rudd told Robert Peston she could not be sure MPs would back the deal. She suggested arguments for another referendum would come into play if they did not and if they rejected other options. ""I have said I don't want a People's Vote or referendum in general but if parliament absolutely failed to reach a consensus I could see there would be a plausible argument for it,"" she said. ""Parliament has to reach a majority on how it is going to leave the EU. If it fails to do so, I can see the argument for taking it back to the people again as much as it would distress many of my colleagues."" If Mrs May's deal is rejected, the default position is for the UK to leave in March unless the government seeks to extend the Article 50 negotiating process or Parliament intervenes to stop it happening. Ms Rudd, who has likened the idea of a no-deal exit to a car crash, said it was imperative that MPs ""find a way of getting a deal through Parliament"". Please upgrade your browser To that end, she said she backed the idea of testing the will of Parliament through a series of ""indicative"" votes on ""Plan B"" options should MPs reject the PM's agreement. ""It would flush out where... the majority is,"" she said. ""So people who hold onto the idea of one option or another would see there is no majority and so they will need to move to their next preference. ""We will hopefully be able to find where the compromise and the consensus is."" Speaking on the same programme, Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said talk of another referendum was ""hypothetical"" at this stage and would represent a ""failure"" by Parliament. She accused the prime minister of trying to scare MPs into backing her deal by delaying the vote on it to the latest possible date. Earlier on Wednesday, the European Commission announced a series of temporary measures designed to reduce the economic impact if the UK was to leave without a comprehensive legally-binding agreement. But it made clear that it could not counter all the problems it expects. The Republic of Ireland,externalhas given more details of its own no-deal contingency planning, saying the risk of the UK leaving without an agreement was ""very real"". It warns of potentially ""severe macroeconomic, trade and sectoral impacts"" for Ireland as well as ""significant gaps"" in policing and judicial co-operation. In such a scenario, it said its priorities would be to uphold the Common Travel Area between the UK and Ireland, ensure there is no return of physical checks on the border between the Republic and Northern Ireland and ensure the ""best possible outcome"" in terms of trade. The UK has allocated a further Â£2bn in funding to government departments to prepare for the possibility and has urged businesses to put their own no-deal plans in motion.

"Washington DC's top prosecutoris suing Facebookinthe first significant US move to punish the firm for its role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine filed the lawsuit on Wednesday,said the Washington Post,external. It accused Facebook of allowing the wholesale scraping of personal data on tens of millions of users. The action adds to a number of regulatory investigations, following a year of privacy and security missteps. A Facebook spokesperson told the BBC: ""We're reviewing the complaint and look forward to continuing our discussions with attorneys general in DC and elsewhere."" Facebook's data-sharing deals exposed As well as this lawsuit, Facebook is being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice. In the UK,the company was fined Â£500,000 over the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the maximum fine the British data regulator could impose. Bigger trouble may arise from the Irish data protection regulator, which is investigating Facebook for multiple admissions of security flaws, in what is being seen as the first major test of Europeâs new privacy rules as dictated by the General Data Protection Regulation. According to the Post, the DC attorney generalâs action could be amended to include more recent data security admissions,including more revelations published on Wednesday by the New York Times,external.

"Among visitors to the school on Wednesday were the Turkish consul and the mayor of Rotterdam Students, teachers and families in the Dutch city of Rotterdam have expressed their shock after a 16-year-old pupil was shot dead in the grounds of her college. Humeyra Ãz was attacked in the bike-shed at Rotterdam's Design College shortly after her lessons finished on Tuesday afternoon. A 31-year-old man has been arrested. The girl's friends said she had broken up with him some time ago and had complained of being threatened by him. Police confirmed that she knew the suspect but did not give further details. The college has some 300 students and some of them were in the bike shed at the time of the shooting and saw what happened. Both the victim and suspect were described as members of the Dutch-Turkish community, and Turkish consul Aytac Yilmaz visited the school on Wednesday. Fellow pupils struggled to take in the killing, while parents were concerned about safety. ""She was a lovely, pretty, clever girl,"" a schoolfriend told Dutch media. ""We're still really scared. How could it happen?"" College chairman Marc Otto said he was unable to talk about any threats made against the victim as it was part of the police inquiry, but insisted that safety at the school was not in question. ""This is about someone older who suddenly comes into a school - this isn't a prison,"" he said. Rotterdam Mayor Ahmed Aboutaleb said the attack should not be considered as a school shooting but involved a deranged man who could have carried out the attack anywhere. Once the Christmas holidays were over, he said, he hoped things could return to normal. US student stabbed to death in Rotterdam Humeyra Ãz had got to know the suspect, identified as Bekir E, via Facebook two years ago and had ended their relationship on the site too, Dutch media said. ""Her family even went to talk to his family. They said she was too young,"" a cousin told the Volkskrant website. ""But he kept harassing and threatening her."" Friends said her father would take her to school because of the threats made against her. The cousin said the family had filed a complaint against Bekir E around a year ago and that he had recently been given a two-year jail term. Public prosecutors have confirmed that the suspect was convicted recently and was under the supervision of the probation service, but did not specify the charge.

"Mr Perepilichnyy had been working with an anti-corruption campaigner before his death The death of a Russian businessman who collapsed while running near his Surrey home in 2012 was down to natural causes, a coroner has ruled. Alexander Perepilichnyy is thought to have suffered sudden arrhythmic death syndrome, the Old Bailey inquest heard. The 44-year-old millionaire had been helping to expose alleged organised crime in Russia. Coroner Nicholas Hilliard QC discounted claims he was poisoned and said there was ""no direct evidence"" of murder. The mystery of the Russian whistleblower He ruled Mr Perepilichnyy died of sudden arrhythmic death syndrome - or Sads - a heart condition which claims between 800 and 1,500 lives in the UK each year. Giving a narrative verdict, the coroner said: ""I do not think I can completely eliminate all possibility he was poisoned, although I regard it unlikely on all the evidence I have heard... ""I'm satisfied that I can properly and safely conclude that it is more likely than not he had died from natural causes."" The inquest heard Mr Perepilichnyy gave his occupation as an industrialist and was worth more than Â£50m. He moved to the UK with his family in 2010 after a spell in Switzerland and was living on the exclusive St George's Hill estate in Weybridge. He may have suffered from food poisoning while on a trip to Paris with an ex-girlfriend in the days before his death on 10 November 2012, but the coroner said this was not a contributory factor. Mr Hilliard said the death was not initially treated as suspicious by police at the scene because no-one reported any ill effects or concerns. As a result there was a ""significant lost opportunity"" for police to investigate. Bill Browder, who had been working with Mr Perepilichnyy, spoke to reporters after the verdict A forensic post-mortem examination did not take place until 18 days after Mr Perepilichnyy died and his stomach contents were thrown away before it could be tested for poison. Mr Hilliard said there was also only a ""limited search of the scene so any potentially incriminating evidence was missed"". But the coroner rejected the possibility secret intelligence could hold clues to his death, saying that while he had seen sensitive information related to the case, none of it added to the evidence heard in open court. The inquest heard Mr Perepilichnyy had faced threats in the months before his death and had taken out millions of pounds in life insurance. He had been helping anti-corruption campaigner Bill Browder, who runs investment company Hermitage Capital Management, expose a $230m (Â£180m) money-laundering scheme. Speaking after the verdict, Mr Browder said: ""The judge was working on a puzzle with only 20% of the pieces because of the Surrey Police incompetence in investigating."" Det Ch Supt John Boshier accepted ""organisational failings were made in the early stage"" but said the verdict supported the conclusion reached by his officers in 2013. He said: ""No evidence of third-party involvement in Mr Perepilichnyy's death was found."" The coroner said he received a letter from the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism unit saying they are ""not conducting an investigation into Mr Perepilichnyy's death"" at the hands of a ""hostile"" agent. By Duncan Leatherdale, BBC News Courtroom two at the Old Bailey erupted with laughter, for pharmacologist Robin Ferner had just hit the nail on the head. ""Clarity,"" he told the 15th and penultimate day of the inquest, ""is not something that is manifest in the case."" It was something of an understatement. Since Alexander Perepilichnyy's death in 2012, questions and speculation have raged. Was it a natural death? Or was he poisoned because of his status as a whistleblower helping expose a multi-million pound fraud in Russia? Clarity is what Coroner Nicholas Hilliard QC was seeking.

"This video can not be played MPs called for an apology amid heated scenes in the House of Commons Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has denied calling Theresa May a ""stupid woman"" during Prime Minister's Questions. He was asked to make a statement to MPs after facing Tory calls to apologise for the alleged insult. Mr Corbyn said he was ""opposed to the use of sexist and misogynist language in any form"" and insisted he had actually said ""stupid people"". Commons Speaker John Bercow said he had not seen the alleged incident and all MPs had to be taken at their word. But Conservative MPs said they did not believe Mr Corbyn's explanation and repeated calls for an apology from him. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict Mr Corbyn told the Commons: ""During prime minister's question time today, I referred to those who I believe were seeking to turn a debate about the national crisis facing our country into a pantomime as 'stupid people'."" ""Mr Speaker I did not use the words 'stupid woman' about the prime minister or anyone else,"" he added. Conservative MP Rachel Maclean responded to his statement by saying: ""Read my lips - I don't believe him."" The Speaker said he had reviewed television footage of Mr Corbyn's alleged insult, which had not been picked up by the microphones, and it was ""easy to see why the leader of the opposition's words might be construed as 'stupid woman'."" He had also consulted a ""lip speaker"", who are employed to interpret lip movements in court rooms and other settings when a lip reader can't get close enough, who had lent weight to that view but had not been conclusive. This video can not be played MPs on Corbyn denial: Andrea Leadsom, Rachel Maclean, Vicky Ford and Laura Pidcock ""Nobody can be 100% certain, that includes professional lip readers. But I will naturally take, and would be expected to take, the word of any right honourable or honourable member. ""It's reasonable to expect the House to do the same."" He added that Mr Corbyn had been ""seated at the time and not addressing the House"" so his words had not been ""on the record"". Mr Bercow was separately accused by Tory MP Vicky Ford of calling her a ""stupid woman"" on an earlier occasion, as MPs turned the spotlight on the Speaker's own conduct. The Speaker told Ms Ford she had not raised this point with him before, adding: ""I refute it 100%"" Tory MPs and ministers seek to show the speaker the clip on their phones Commons leader Andrea Leadsom had earlier reminded Mr Bercow of his failure to apologise to her for calling her a ""stupid woman"" during an incident earlier this year. Mr Bercow said he had already dealt with that matter. Mrs Leadsom said viewers and MPs would ""draw their own conclusions"" after Mr Corbyn's statement. But Tory MP Desmond Swayne said criticising MPs for ""what they might say under their breath"" was moving ""into the realm of thought crime"". And Labour MP Laura Pidcock said using the Commons chamber in this way was ""absolutely pathetic"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Theresa May tells Mr Corbyn ""look behind you"" Mr Corbyn had clashed with the prime minister over her Brexit deal, calling her decision last week to delay a vote on it a ""deeply cynical manoeuvre"" from a ""failing"" prime minister. Mrs May hit back at Mr Corbyn, saying he had not tabled his promised no-confidence motion, and had then tabled one that was ineffective. ""I know it's the... pantomime season,"" she told MPs, ""is he going to put a confidence vote? Oh yes he is,"" she said, prompting backbench Tories MPs to chant ""oh no he isn't"". Continuing the pantomime theme, she told the Labour leader ""look behind you - they are not impressed and neither is the country"". Mr Corbyn could be seen saying something under his breath in response. Asked about what he had allegedly said by Tory MP Paul Scully, Mrs May said ""I think that everybody in this House,"" particularly on the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote, should be encouraging women to get involved in politics and ""should use appropriate language"". This video can not be played Theresa May: Did Jeremy Corbyn say ""stupid woman"" or ""stupid people""? Former minister Sir Patrick McLoughlin used a point of order to accuse Mr Corbyn of having ""muttered"" that Theresa May was a ""stupid woman"". Cries of ""shame"" and ""disgraceful"" were heard from the Tory benches at this point. Sir Patrick added: ""Would it not be appropriate for him to come back into this chamber and apologise?"" The row continued after Prime Minister's Questions, with a string of female Conservative MPs joining in with calls for an apology. Former minister Anna Soubry suggested Mr Bercow would be more inclined to take action if the words had been uttered by a Conservative frontbencher at a female Labour MP. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played About 10,000 passengers were affected overnight on Wednesday as flights were unable to take off or land Tens of thousands of passengers have been disrupted by drones flying over one of the UK's busiest airports. Gatwick's runway has been shut since Wednesday night, as devices have been repeatedly flying over the airfield. Sussex Police said it was not terror-related but a ""deliberate act"" of disruption, using ""industrial specification"" drones. About 110,000 passengers on 760 flights were due to fly on Thursday. Disruption could last ""several days"". An airline source told the BBC flights were currently cancelled until at least 19:00 GMT. The airport advised that the runway would not open ""until it was safe to do so"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has confirmed the Army has been called in to support Sussex Police. He said: ""The armed forces have a range of unique capabilities and this isn't something we would usually deploy but we are there to assist and do everything we can so that they are in a position to open the airport at the earliest opportunity."" Those due to travel have been told tocheck the status of their flight,external, while Easyjet told its passengers not to go to Gatwick if their flights have been cancelled. Gatwick Airport: Live updates The shutdown started just after 21:00 on Wednesday, when two drones were spotted flying ""over the perimeter fence and into where the runway operates from"". The runway briefly reopened at 03:01 on Thursday but was closed again about 45 minutes later amid ""a further sighting of drones"". The airport said at about 12:00 a drone had been spotted ""in the last hour"". Gatwick chief operating officer Chris Woodroofe said: ""The police are looking for the operator and that is the way to disable the drone."" He said police had not wanted to shoot the devices down because of the risk from stray bullets. He said it remained unsafe to reopen the airport after the drone had been spotted too close to the runway. Mr Woodroofe said: ""If we were to reopen today we will first repatriate passengers who are in the wrong place which could take several days."" Armed police were seen at the airfield More than 20 police units from two forces are searching for the perpetrator, who could face up to five years in jail. Supt Justin Burtenshaw, head of armed policing for Sussex and Surrey, described attempts to catch whoever was controlling the drones as ""painstaking"" because it was ""a difficult and challenging thing to locate them"". ""Each time we believe we get close to the operator, the drone disappears; when we look to reopen the airfield, the drone reappears,"" he said. About 10,000 passengers were affected overnight on Wednesday and Gatwick said 110,000 people were due to either take off or land at the airport on Thursday. Incoming planes were diverted to other airports including London Heathrow, Luton, Birmingham, Manchester,Cardiff, Glasgow, Paris and Amsterdam. Crowds of travellers spent the morning waiting inside Gatwick's terminal for updates, while others reported being stuck on grounded planes for hours. A Gatwick spokeswoman said extra staff had been brought in and the airport was ""trying their best"" to provide food and water to those who needed it. About 11,000 people are stuck at the airport, Mr Woodroofe said. A number of flights bound for Gatwick were diverted to other airports overnight, including seven to Luton, 11 to Stansted and five to Manchester. Other flights have landed at Cardiff, Birmingham and Southend. The Civil Aviation Authority said it considered this event to be an ""extraordinary circumstance"", and therefore airlines were not obligated to pay any financial compensation to passengers.

It is illegal to fly a drone within 1km of an airport or airfield boundary and flying above 400ft (120m) - which increases the risk of a collision with a manned aircraft - is also banned. Endangering the safety of an aircraft is a criminal offence which can carry a prison sentence of five years. The number of aircraft incidents involving drones has grown dramatically in the past few years. In 2013 there were zero incidents, compared to almost 100 last year. Civilian drones have grown popular as their price has fallen. Technological improvement has meant components are smaller, faster and cheaper than ever before. The UK Airprox Board assesses incidents involving drones and keeps a log of all reports. In one incident last year, for example, a pilot flying over Manchester saw a red ""football-sized"" drone passing down the left hand side of the aircraft. In another, a plane leaving Glasgow narrowly missed a drone. The pilot, in that case, said the crew only had three seconds of warning and there was ""no time to take avoiding action"".

"A group of children from a school in Stevenage were among those to be sent to the Fairbridge school in Molong, Australia The UK government has agreed to pay compensation to thousands of Britons who were sent abroad as children under a resettlement scheme. Between 1945-70, around 4,000 children were sent to institutions in the Commonwealth. Some were beaten, raped and forced to do manual labour - sometimes resulting in lifelong emotional problems. The Department for Health said it accepted the scheme was ""fundamentally flawed"". In March, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA)said the government should compensate all 2,000 former migrants still alive within 12 months. The abuse scandal of the British children sent abroad Around two dozen victims have since died but their relatives will be able to claim compensation on their behalf. In 2010, then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown apologised on behalf of the government for sending British children abroad, describing it as a ""shameful episode"" in Britain's history. The Department of Health said it would set up the compensation scheme as quickly as possible. The government was previously criticised for itslack of speedin setting up a service to offer financial compensation for victims. The IICSA found children suffered sexual and emotional abuse, as well as forced labour. Some were also wrongly told they were orphans, depriving them of the opportunity of meeting their birth parents. Victims suffered lifelong emotional and psychological problems as a result. This video can not be played ""I lost everything I ever had"" - Rex Wade was one of the last children to be sent away The resettlement scheme saw children from deprived backgrounds who were often already in social care - some as young as three years old -sent away with the promise of a better life. After World War Two, 3,000 children were sent to Australia, 559 to New Zealand, 329 to Canada and 276 to then-Southern Rhodesia. Many ended up in austere and at-times brutal religious institutions. Overseen by government, and managed by charities and the church, it was part of a longstanding policy aimed at easing the strain on UK orphanages and strengthening the British population abroad.

"Der Spiegel said it was working to establish the full extent of the scandal German news magazine Der Spiegel has sacked an award-winning staff writer after accusing him of inventing details and quotes in numerous stories. Claas Relotius ""falsified articles on a grand scale and even invented characters"", Der Spiegel said. Among the articles in question are major features that had been nominated for or won awards, the magazine added. Relotius, 33, admitted deceiving readers in some 14 stories published in Der Spiegel, the magazine said. In a statement on Wednesday,the German publication said it was working to establish the full extent of Relotius' ""fabrications"",externalafter a colleague who worked with him on a story raised suspicions about his reporting. After initially denying the allegations, Relotius confessed last week to inventing entire passages of text in several instances, Der Spiegel says. In some articles, he is said to have included individuals he had never met or spoken to, ""telling their stories or quoting them"". ""By his own admission, there are at least 14 articles,"" the magazine said, adding: ""Could that figure actually be considerably higher?"" Der Spiegel said the reporter's actions were committed ""intentionally"" and ""methodically"". IGN sacks writer amid plagiarism controversy ABC boss quits over political interference claims An investigation into a story by Relotius about immigration and the US-Mexican border revealed that he had fabricated information about seeing a hand-painted sign in a town in Minnesota that read: ""Mexicans Keep Out."" Fraudulent information appeared in other stories including one about inmates at the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay and another about the US NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Relotius, who joined the publication as a freelancer in 2011, told the magazine he regretted his actions and was deeply ashamed. He has written some 60 articles for the magazine, many of which he has said are accurate. The Hamburg-based publication, which has apologised to its readers, said it was ""shocked"" by the revelations, describing them as ""a low point in Spiegel's 70-year history"".

"Mr Powell says gradual rate increases are the best way to balance risks The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates again, in spite of warnings from Donald Trump against the move. Officials at the US central bank voted to lift the Fed's key interest rate by 0.25%, to a target range of 2.25%-2.5%. But they also said future increases could come at a slower pace amid concerns about global growth. It comes after the US president on Tuesday warned the Fed against making ""yet another mistake"" in raising rates, urging it instead to ""feel the market"". He also urged the bank not to wind down a multi-billion dollar stimulus programme brought in after the financial crisis. Mr Trump - who appointed the Fed's chairman, Jerome Powell - has repeatedly blamed the central bank for unsettled markets and dismissed analysts who cite other factors, such as rising trade tariffs. But his remarks have put pressure on the Fed, as presidents generally avoid criticising the bank publicly, for fear of politicising the institution. Allow Twitter content?

At a press conference on Wednesday, Mr Powell defended the Fed's independence, saying that political pressure played ""no role whatsoever"" in its discussions or decisions. He added that the Fed had no plans to change its ongoing reduction of its portfolio of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. The bank has been gradually raising the benchmark rate since 2015, moving the US away from the ultra-low rates put in place during the financial crisis to spur economic activity. Wednesday's decision, which was widely expected, marked the ninth increase since 2015 and the fourth this year. However, the moves have made borrowing more expensive, contributing to slowdowns in some sectors, such as housing. And with economic growth expected to slow, some worry that further increases risk stifling economic activity. On Wednesday, officials did cut their forecasts for economic growth in 2019 to 2.3%, down from the 2.5% they anticipated in September. And estimates released by the bank showed most Fed members expect two rate increases in 2019 - not three, as previously forecast. It follows a downturn in US financial markets and concerns about slowing growth in the US and abroad. However, Mr Powell said the strength of the US economy - which is expected to grow about 3% this year - justified another rate rise, despite recent ""cross currents"" that have weakened the outlook. ""We think this move was appropriate for what is a very healthy economy,"" he said. ""Policy at this point does not need to be accommodative."" In its official statement, the Fed also said increases to its benchmark rate would help the US economy sustain its expansion, keeping the unemployment rate low and inflation near 2%. Shares sank after the announcement, reversing earlier gains. The Dow and S&P 500 closed about 1.5% lower, while the Nasdaq fell than 2%. In Asia, Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 was down 2.5% in early afternoon trade on Thursday, following Wall Street's lead. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and South Korea's KOSPI index were both down more than 1%, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was down 0.85% in very late afternoon trade there. Analysts said investors might have been hoping for stronger signs from the Fed that it would raise rates more slowly in the future. ""Given the stock market declines and negative international economic news - recognised in the statement - this still points to quite a bit of confidence at the Fed in the ability of the US economy to withstand a few more rate hikes,"" said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings.

"This video can not be played The home secretary sidesteps a question about immigration targets Tens of thousands of low-skilled migrants could come to the UK to work for up to a year underproposed new post-Brexit immigration rules.,external The measure, which would last until 2025, is intended to protect parts of the economy reliant on overseas labour. The idea was described as ""shocking"" by campaign group Migration Watch. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the new system would be based on UK needs rather than where migrants were from and show the UK ""open for business"". Unveiling what he said would be the biggest shake-up of immigration policy for 40 years, Mr Javid said that while there was no ""specific target"" for reducing numbers coming into the UK, net migration would come down to ""sustainable levels"". Reality Check: How has immigration changed since the referendum? UK migration steady despite EU arrivals dip Call to scrap high-skilled migrants cap The much-delayed White Paper - a document setting out proposed new laws before they are formalised in a government bill - also includes: Scrapping the current cap on the number of skilled workers such as doctors or engineers from the EU and elsewhere A consultation on a minimum salary requirement of Â£30,000 for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas Visitors from the EU will not need visas Plans to phase in the new system from 2021 Mr Javid said the proposals would enable the UK to exercise control over its borders and ""deliver on the clear instruction"" of the British people when they voted to leave the EU. The ending of free movement from Europe is a key part of Mrs May's Brexit deal, although any replacement system is set to be part of post-Brexit trade talks. The government says lower-skilled and unskilled migrants will not routinely be able to come to the UK and settle permanently. However, as a ""transitional measure"", people from ""low-risk countries"" in Europe and further afield will be able to come to the UK, without a job offer, and seek work for up to a year. The scheme is designed to fill vacancies in sectors such as construction and social care which are heavily dependent on EU labour and which ministers fear could struggle to adapt when free movement ends. There will be a ""cooling off period"" after a year, meaning people will be expected to leave at that point and not to apply again for a further 12 months. Ministers say applicants, who will have to pay a fee and not get access to public funds, will not be able to switch to any other migration scheme. It is understood that the numbers being admitted this way would be ""similar"" to the 170,000 workers from outside the European Economic Area currently in low or unskilled roles. The government said it reserved the right to tighten the criteria or impose numerical caps prior to a review in 2025 but campaigners for lower migration said the plans were ""astonishing"". Migration Watch said there was no way of making sure people left after a year and the immigration figures, which do not include people in the UK for less than a year, could be distorted as a result. ""It is shocking that the government should have caved in so completely to the demands of industry while ignoring the strong public desire to get immigration down,"" said its chair Lord Green. ""The chief winners will be business, as they exploit the bonanza of a huge new pool of labour from around the world while continuing to avoid their responsibility to the public to recruit and train up local talent."" The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The White Paper was trailed as creating an immigration system based on ""skills"". The delay in publication was partly down to a dispute between ministers over a possible Â£30,000 salary threshold for skilled workers. But it's the plan to create a route into Britain for unskilled or low-skilled workers which is likely to prove particularly controversial. The document says the reason for the route is that some sectors have built up a ""reliance"" on such staff from the EU and require a ""period of time"" to adjust to the end of freedom of movement. But the new scheme will be in place until at least 2025; it'll be open to those in other ""low-risk"" countries, not just the EU; and there is currently no numerical cap. It raises the prospect that the immigration system the government is designing is as much about ensuring there's a flow of unskilled labour, as it is about skilled workers. The White Paper introduces a new visa route for skilled migrants, from Europe and beyond. It accepts a recommendation from the independent Migration Advisory Committee to scrap the current limit of 20,700 on workers classed as high-skilled coming to the UK using ""Tier 2"" visas. Tier 2 is the name for general work visas for people from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland who have been offered a skilled job in the UK. Eligible professions include nurses and doctors. UK firms 'fearful' for future migration system Immigration: Who should we let in after Brexit? There will be a consultation about the salary threshold of Â£30,000 for skilled worker visas, amid opposition to such a cap from business and some cabinet members. The Â£30,000 minimum earnings rulealready applies,externalto non-EU workers in most Tier 2 visa cases but could also apply to migrants from the EU. Extending it to skilled migrants could affect the NHS's ability to recruit the staff it needs, the body representing NHS trusts has warned. NHS Providers deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery told Today: ""We are deeply concerned about what is going to happen. High skills does not equal high pay. ""You have got starting salaries for nurses at Â£23,000 - also for paramedics, midwives. Junior doctors starting salaries at Â£27,000, healthcare assistants at Â£17,000, all coming in way below that Â£30,000 cap. ""It is not just health workers, it is social care as well. We have to remember where the skills lay. They lay in those staff under Â£30,000."" The document also suggests the changes could have a negative economic impact, reducing annual output, or GDP, by between 0.4% and 0.9% by 2025. During a BBC interview, Mr Javid repeatedly declined to say whether the government's target of reducing net migration - the difference between the numbers of people leaving the UK for at least a year and those moving to the UK for at least a year - to less than 100,000 would still apply after Brexit. But, at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May confirmed the government was sticking to the ""tens of thousands"" ambition. For Labour, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the government had ""disgracefully labelled workers on less than Â£30,000 as low-skilled"" when ""our economy and public services are kept ticking by this majority of workers"". ""The government is not, as it wrongly claims, using a skills-based criteria to meet the needs of our economy and our society. ""It is using an income-based system which allows derivatives traders free movement but which excludes nurses, social care workers and other professions in which we have severe skills or labour shortages."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the government's plans would be ""devastating for the Scottish economy"" because ""our demographics make it essential that we attract people to live and work here"". Business groups said the salary threshold would need to be lower than Â£30,000 and warned the proposals could ""tie the hands"" of employers Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""Employers are hugely concerned that the complexity and cost associated with new immigration rules will impact their ability to invest and grow at a time when many areas are facing near-full employment."" Currently, someone is eligible to apply for a ""Tier 2"" general work visa - which can last for up to five years - if they are from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland. They must also have been offered a high-skilled job in the UK - which is any profession ranked at level six and above on a list called the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) - and which has not been filled by a UK worker. The high-skilled category includes a range of professions such as doctors, nurses, musicians, aircraft pilots, brokers, paramedics, librarians, journalists, food inspectors, probation officers, social workers, surveyors, architects, lawyers, and some teachers. In most cases, the migrant will need to be earning at least Â£30,000 per year (or Â£20,800 for new entrants), or the ""appropriate rate"" for their job if that figure is higher. Some professions, like nurses, are exempt. People who do jobs which the UK needs - on the shortage occupation list - are also eligible to apply for the Tier 2 visa, even if the job is less highly-skilled and ranked at RQF level four.

"This video can not be played About 10,000 passengers were affected overnight on Wednesday as flights were unable to take off or land Tens of thousands of passengers have been disrupted by drones flying over one of the UK's busiest airports. Gatwick's runway has been shut since Wednesday night, as devices have been repeatedly flying over the airfield. Sussex Police said it was not terror-related but a ""deliberate act"" of disruption, using ""industrial specification"" drones. About 110,000 passengers on 760 flights were due to fly on Thursday. Disruption could last ""several days"". An airline source told the BBC flights were currently cancelled until at least 19:00 GMT. The airport advised that the runway would not open ""until it was safe to do so"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has confirmed the Army has been called in to support Sussex Police. He said: ""The armed forces have a range of unique capabilities and this isn't something we would usually deploy but we are there to assist and do everything we can so that they are in a position to open the airport at the earliest opportunity."" Those due to travel have been told tocheck the status of their flight,external, while Easyjet told its passengers not to go to Gatwick if their flights have been cancelled. Gatwick Airport: Live updates The shutdown started just after 21:00 on Wednesday, when two drones were spotted flying ""over the perimeter fence and into where the runway operates from"". The runway briefly reopened at 03:01 on Thursday but was closed again about 45 minutes later amid ""a further sighting of drones"". The airport said at about 12:00 a drone had been spotted ""in the last hour"". Gatwick chief operating officer Chris Woodroofe said: ""The police are looking for the operator and that is the way to disable the drone."" He said police had not wanted to shoot the devices down because of the risk from stray bullets. He said it remained unsafe to reopen the airport after the drone had been spotted too close to the runway. Mr Woodroofe said: ""If we were to reopen today we will first repatriate passengers who are in the wrong place which could take several days."" Armed police were seen at the airfield More than 20 police units from two forces are searching for the perpetrator, who could face up to five years in jail. Supt Justin Burtenshaw, head of armed policing for Sussex and Surrey, described attempts to catch whoever was controlling the drones as ""painstaking"" because it was ""a difficult and challenging thing to locate them"". ""Each time we believe we get close to the operator, the drone disappears; when we look to reopen the airfield, the drone reappears,"" he said. About 10,000 passengers were affected overnight on Wednesday and Gatwick said 110,000 people were due to either take off or land at the airport on Thursday. Incoming planes were diverted to other airports including London Heathrow, Luton, Birmingham, Manchester,Cardiff, Glasgow, Paris and Amsterdam. Crowds of travellers spent the morning waiting inside Gatwick's terminal for updates, while others reported being stuck on grounded planes for hours. A Gatwick spokeswoman said extra staff had been brought in and the airport was ""trying their best"" to provide food and water to those who needed it. About 11,000 people are stuck at the airport, Mr Woodroofe said. A number of flights bound for Gatwick were diverted to other airports overnight, including seven to Luton, 11 to Stansted and five to Manchester. Other flights have landed at Cardiff, Birmingham and Southend. The Civil Aviation Authority said it considered this event to be an ""extraordinary circumstance"", and therefore airlines were not obligated to pay any financial compensation to passengers. Alex Neill, from consumer rights group Which?, said people ""may still be entitled to meals, refreshments, hotel accommodation or transfers"". Flights were diverted to other airports, including Paris and Amsterdam, following the runway closure Kasia Jaworska told the BBC she was travelling from Glasgow to Gatwick with her boyfriend when her flight was diverted to Luton. She said she thought it was ""strange"" that two drones had led to the closure of the airport. ""You would imagine there would be better security in place and emergency action for something like that,"" she said.

It is illegal to fly a drone within 1km of an airport or airfield boundary and flying above 400ft (120m) - which increases the risk of a collision with a manned aircraft - is also banned. Endangering the safety of an aircraft is a criminal offence which can carry a prison sentence of five years. The number of aircraft incidents involving drones has grown dramatically in the past few years. In 2013 there were zero incidents, compared to almost 100 last year. Civilian drones have grown popular as their price has fallen. Technological improvement has meant components are smaller, faster and cheaper than ever before. The UK Airprox Board assesses incidents involving drones and keeps a log of all reports. In one incident last year, for example, a pilot flying over Manchester saw a red ""football-sized"" drone passing down the left hand side of the aircraft.

"This video can not be played About 10,000 passengers were affected overnight on Wednesday as flights were unable to take off or land Tens of thousands of passengers have been disrupted by drones flying over one of the UK's busiest airports. Gatwick's runway has been shut since Wednesday night, as devices have been repeatedly flying over the airfield. Sussex Police said it was not terror-related but a ""deliberate act"" of disruption, using ""industrial specification"" drones. About 110,000 passengers on 760 flights were due to fly on Thursday. Disruption could last ""several days"". An airline source told the BBC flights were currently cancelled until at least 19:00 GMT. The airport advised that the runway would not open ""until it was safe to do so"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has confirmed the Army has been called in to support Sussex Police. He said: ""The armed forces have a range of unique capabilities and this isn't something we would usually deploy but we are there to assist and do everything we can so that they are in a position to open the airport at the earliest opportunity."" Those due to travel have been told tocheck the status of their flight,external, while Easyjet told its passengers not to go to Gatwick if their flights have been cancelled. Gatwick Airport: Live updates The shutdown started just after 21:00 on Wednesday, when two drones were spotted flying ""over the perimeter fence and into where the runway operates from"". The runway briefly reopened at 03:01 on Thursday but was closed again about 45 minutes later amid ""a further sighting of drones"". The airport said at about 12:00 a drone had been spotted ""in the last hour"". Gatwick chief operating officer Chris Woodroofe said: ""The police are looking for the operator and that is the way to disable the drone."" He said police had not wanted to shoot the devices down because of the risk from stray bullets. He said it remained unsafe to reopen the airport after the drone had been spotted too close to the runway. Mr Woodroofe said: ""If we were to reopen today we will first repatriate passengers who are in the wrong place which could take several days."" Armed police were seen at the airfield More than 20 police units from two forces are searching for the perpetrator, who could face up to five years in jail. Supt Justin Burtenshaw, head of armed policing for Sussex and Surrey, described attempts to catch whoever was controlling the drones as ""painstaking"" because it was ""a difficult and challenging thing to locate them"". ""Each time we believe we get close to the operator, the drone disappears; when we look to reopen the airfield, the drone reappears,"" he said. About 10,000 passengers were affected overnight on Wednesday and Gatwick said 110,000 people were due to either take off or land at the airport on Thursday. Incoming planes were diverted to other airports including London Heathrow, Luton, Birmingham, Manchester,Cardiff, Glasgow, Paris and Amsterdam. Crowds of travellers spent the morning waiting inside Gatwick's terminal for updates, while others reported being stuck on grounded planes for hours. A Gatwick spokeswoman said extra staff had been brought in and the airport was ""trying their best"" to provide food and water to those who needed it. About 11,000 people are stuck at the airport, Mr Woodroofe said. A number of flights bound for Gatwick were diverted to other airports overnight, including seven to Luton, 11 to Stansted and five to Manchester. Other flights have landed at Cardiff, Birmingham and Southend. The Civil Aviation Authority said it considered this event to be an ""extraordinary circumstance"", and therefore airlines were not obligated to pay any financial compensation to passengers. Alex Neill, from consumer rights group Which?, said people ""may still be entitled to meals, refreshments, hotel accommodation or transfers"". Flights were diverted to other airports, including Paris and Amsterdam, following the runway closure Kasia Jaworska told the BBC she was travelling from Glasgow to Gatwick with her boyfriend when her flight was diverted to Luton. She said she thought it was ""strange"" that two drones had led to the closure of the airport. ""You would imagine there would be better security in place and emergency action for something like that,"" she said. Christopher Lister, who had been returning from Kiev, posted a picture of people sleeping ""on every seat and across the floors"" on board his flight.

It is illegal to fly a drone within 1km of an airport or airfield boundary and flying above 400ft (120m) - which increases the risk of a collision with a manned aircraft - is also banned. Endangering the safety of an aircraft is a criminal offence which can carry a prison sentence of five years. The number of aircraft incidents involving drones has grown dramatically in the past few years. In 2013 there were zero incidents, compared to almost 100 last year. Civilian drones have grown popular as their price has fallen. Technological improvement has meant components are smaller, faster and cheaper than ever before. The UK Airprox Board assesses incidents involving drones and keeps a log of all reports. In one incident last year, for example, a pilot flying over Manchester saw a red ""football-sized"" drone passing down the left hand side of the aircraft. In another, a plane leaving Glasgow narrowly missed a drone. The pilot, in that case, said the crew only had three seconds of warning and there was ""no time to take avoiding action"".

"Around 2,000 US troops are believed to be stationed in Syria The Trump administration says US troops are being withdrawn from Syria, after the president said the Islamic State (IS) group had been ""defeated"".

Israel said it had been told the US had ""other ways to have influence in the area"" but would ""study the timeline [of the withdrawal], how it will be done and of course the implications for us"". Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on state-controlled Channel One TV that the US decision could result in ""genuine, real prospects for a political settlement"" in Syria. Pulling troops out of Syria had long been promised by President Trump. But the announcement may have taken some of his own officials by surprise. Last week Brett McGurk, special presidential envoy for the global coalition to defeat IS, told reporters at the state department: ""Nobody is saying that [IS fighters] are going to disappear. Nobody is that naive. So we want to stay on the ground and make sure that stability can be maintained in these areas."" The state department abruptly cancelled Wednesday's daily briefing after the withdrawal was announced. One of Mr Trump's supporters, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who sits on the armed services committee, called it a ""huge Obama-like mistake"". In a series of tweets, he said IS was ""not defeated"",external, and warned withdrawing US troops puts ""our allies, the Kurds, at risk"". Turkey this week said it was preparing to launch an operation against a Kurdish militia in northern Syria, which has been an ally of the US in its fight against IS. A UK government spokesman said these developments ""do not signal the end of the Global Coalition or its campaign"" against IS, and the UK will ""remain committed"" to ensure IS' ""enduring defeat"". ""Much remains to be done and we must not lose sight of the threat they pose,"" the UK statement said. ""As the situation on the ground develops, we will continue to discuss how we achieve these aims with our Coalition partners, including the US."" Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent President Trump's decision reverses the official lines of both the Pentagon and the State Department and it places Washington's Kurdish allies in greater jeopardy. US ground operations in north-eastern Syria involve some 2,000 troops, maybe more, and a network of bases and air strips has been established. But to what strategic end? IS is well on the way to being defeated. Syria's President Assad remains in place. If the goal now is to contain Iran or Russia's rising influence in the region then 2,000 troops strung out across a vast swathe of territory may be too small a force to do this. Their presence though does give the US ""skin in the game"". And many will see this decision as yet another indication of the chaos and uncertainty surrounding US policy towards this crucial region. US troops have largely been stationed in the Kurdish region in northern Syria. A partnership with an alliance of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, is credited with playing a major role in the virtual elimination of IS after it overran large swathes of Syria four years ago, imposing brutal rule on almost eight million people in the country and neighbouring Iraq. Why the battle for northern Syria matters Who are the Kurds? However, the militant group has not disappeared entirely. A recent US report said there were still as many as 14,000 IS militants in Syria and even more in neighbouring Iraq - and there is a fear they will shift to guerrilla tactics in an attempt to rebuild their network. But the partnership between the US and the Kurds has enraged neighbouring Turkey, which views the Kurdish YPG militia - the main fighting force in the SDF - as an extension of a banned Kurdish group fighting for autonomy in Turkey. On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country might soon start a new military operation against the YPG in Syria. Mr Erdogan added that he had discussed his plan with Mr Trump by telephone and that he had given a ""positive response"". The US announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to sell $3.5bn in missiles to Turkey to ""increase the defensive capabilities of the Turkey military to guard against hostile aggression and shield Nato allies who might train and operate within Turkey's borders"". Russia said on Wednesday it would continue with its own sale of an advanced missile defence system to Turkey. In addition to the northern deployment, US forces are also helping fight IS in the last pocket of territory it controls in the south-east of the country.

"The case centres around former Uber drivers James Farrar (left) and Yaseen Aslam Uber has lost an appeal against a ruling that its drivers should be treated as workers rather than self-employed. In 2016 a tribunal ruled drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam were Uber staff and entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage. That ruling has now been upheld by the Court of Appeal. But Uber pointed out that one of the three judges backed its case and said it would appeal to the Supreme Court. Mr Farrar, who is chairman of the United Private Hire Drivers branch of the IWGB union, said: ""I am delighted today's ruling brings us closer to the ending Uber's abuse of precarious workers made possible by tactics of contract trickery, psychological manipulation and old-fashioned bullying."" He added that he was dismayed that implementation of worker status for drivers was being further delayed while Uber seeks yet another appeal. ""This is nothing more than a cynical ploy to delay inevitable changes to its business model while it pursues a record breaking $120bn stock market flotation,"" Mr Farrar said. ""It's time for Uber to come clean with all its stakeholders and abide by the decision of the courts."" The GMB union said that Uber should ""just accept the verdict"", after losing three times in a row. Prior to this, the Employment Tribunalruled in November 2017that it was upholding its original decision. Uber drivers on strike in London in October demanding employment rights, an end to unfair dismissals, a rise in fares and a reduction of commission ""This is the perfect early Christmas present for GMB's Uber members, but this case is about the wider 'gig economy' too,"" said the GMB's general secretary Tim Roache. ""Employers are on notice that they can't just run rough shod over working people to put more on the bottom line for shareholders."" Uber has been granted permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. The firm said it was encouraged that one of the appeal judges said that Uber's argument was ""neither unrealistic nor artificial"", but in accordance with a well-recognised business model in the private hire car industry. ""Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades, long before our app existed,"" an Uber spokesperson said. ""Drivers who use the Uber app make more than the London Living Wage and want to keep the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive. ""If drivers were classified as workers they would inevitably lose some of the freedom and flexibility that comes with being their own boss."" However, law firm Gowling WLG expects the Supreme Court to uphold the decision. ""Yet another court confirms that the more a brand seeks to control the activities of the people that deliver that brand's services to the public, the less likely those people are to be self-employed,"" said Jonathan Chamberlain, partner at Gowling. ""The law will probably always remain uncertain in this area, despite the governments promise of reform, but the direction of travel is clear. I expect the Supreme Court to uphold this judgement, but we shall see.""

"Der Spiegel said it was working to establish the full extent of the scandal German news magazine Der Spiegel has sacked an award-winning staff writer after accusing him of inventing details and quotes in numerous stories. Claas Relotius ""falsified articles on a grand scale and even invented characters"", Der Spiegel said. Among the articles in question are major features that had been nominated for or won awards, the magazine added. Relotius, 33, admitted deceiving readers in some 14 stories published in Der Spiegel, the magazine said. In a statement on Wednesday,the German publication said it was working to establish the full extent of Relotius' ""fabrications"",externalafter a colleague who worked with him on a story raised suspicions about his reporting. After initially denying the allegations, Relotius confessed last week to inventing entire passages of text in several instances, Der Spiegel says. In some articles, he is said to have included individuals he had never met or spoken to, ""telling their stories or quoting them"". ""By his own admission, there are at least 14 articles,"" the magazine said, adding: ""Could that figure actually be considerably higher?"" Der Spiegel said the reporter's actions were committed ""intentionally"" and ""methodically"". IGN sacks writer amid plagiarism controversy ABC boss quits over political interference claims An investigation into a story by Relotius about immigration and the US-Mexican border revealed that he had fabricated information about seeing a hand-painted sign in a town in Minnesota that read: ""Mexicans Keep Out."" Fraudulent information appeared in other stories including one about inmates at the US military prison at Guantanamo Bay and another about the US NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Relotius, who joined the publication as a freelancer in 2011, told the magazine he regretted his actions and was deeply ashamed. He has written some 60 articles for the magazine, many of which he has said are accurate. The Hamburg-based publication, which has apologised to its readers, said it was ""shocked"" by the revelations, describing them as ""a low point in Spiegel's 70-year history"".

The state department abruptly cancelled Wednesday's daily briefing after the withdrawal was announced. One of Mr Trump's supporters, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who sits on the armed services committee, called it a ""huge Obama-like mistake"". In a series of tweets, he said IS was ""not defeated"",external, and warned withdrawing US troops puts ""our allies, the Kurds, at risk"". Turkey this week said it was preparing to launch an operation against a Kurdish militia in northern Syria, which has been an ally of the US in its fight against IS. A UK government spokesman said these developments ""do not signal the end of the Global Coalition or its campaign"" against IS, and the UK will ""remain committed"" to ensure IS' ""enduring defeat"". ""Much remains to be done and we must not lose sight of the threat they pose,"" the UK statement said. ""As the situation on the ground develops, we will continue to discuss how we achieve these aims with our Coalition partners, including the US."" Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent President Trump's decision reverses the official lines of both the Pentagon and the State Department and it places Washington's Kurdish allies in greater jeopardy. US ground operations in north-eastern Syria involve some 2,000 troops, maybe more, and a network of bases and air strips has been established. But to what strategic end? IS is well on the way to being defeated. Syria's President Assad remains in place. If the goal now is to contain Iran or Russia's rising influence in the region then 2,000 troops strung out across a vast swathe of territory may be too small a force to do this. Their presence though does give the US ""skin in the game"". And many will see this decision as yet another indication of the chaos and uncertainty surrounding US policy towards this crucial region. US troops have largely been stationed in the Kurdish region in northern Syria. A partnership with an alliance of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, is credited with playing a major role in the virtual elimination of IS after it overran large swathes of Syria four years ago, imposing brutal rule on almost eight million people in the country and neighbouring Iraq. Why the battle for northern Syria matters Who are the Kurds? However, the militant group has not disappeared entirely. A recent US report said there were still as many as 14,000 IS militants in Syria and even more in neighbouring Iraq - and there is a fear they will shift to guerrilla tactics in an attempt to rebuild their network. But the partnership between the US and the Kurds has enraged neighbouring Turkey, which views the Kurdish YPG militia - the main fighting force in the SDF - as an extension of a banned Kurdish group fighting for autonomy in Turkey. On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country might soon start a new military operation against the YPG in Syria. Mr Erdogan added that he had discussed his plan with Mr Trump by telephone and that he had given a ""positive response"". The US announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to sell $3.5bn in missiles to Turkey to ""increase the defensive capabilities of the Turkey military to guard against hostile aggression and shield Nato allies who might train and operate within Turkey's borders"". Russia said on Wednesday it would continue with its own sale of an advanced missile defence system to Turkey. In addition to the northern deployment, US forces are also helping fight IS in the last pocket of territory it controls in the south-east of the country.

"A group of children from a school in Stevenage were among those to be sent to the Fairbridge school in Molong, Australia The UK government has agreed to pay compensation to thousands of Britons who were sent abroad as children under a resettlement scheme. Between 1945-70, around 4,000 children were sent to institutions in the Commonwealth. Some were beaten, raped and forced to do manual labour - sometimes resulting in lifelong emotional problems. The Department for Health said it accepted the scheme was ""fundamentally flawed"". In March, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA)said the government should compensate all 2,000 former migrants still alive within 12 months. The abuse scandal of the British children sent abroad Around two dozen victims have since died but their relatives will be able to claim compensation on their behalf. In 2010, then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown apologised on behalf of the government for sending British children abroad, describing it as a ""shameful episode"" in Britain's history. The Department of Health said it would set up the compensation scheme as quickly as possible. The government was previously criticised for itslack of speedin setting up a service to offer financial compensation for victims. The IICSA found children suffered sexual and emotional abuse, as well as forced labour. Some were also wrongly told they were orphans, depriving them of the opportunity of meeting their birth parents. Victims suffered lifelong emotional and psychological problems as a result. This video can not be played ""I lost everything I ever had"" - Rex Wade was one of the last children to be sent away The resettlement scheme saw children from deprived backgrounds who were often already in social care - some as young as three years old -sent away with the promise of a better life. After World War Two, 3,000 children were sent to Australia, 559 to New Zealand, 329 to Canada and 276 to then-Southern Rhodesia. Many ended up in austere and at-times brutal religious institutions. Overseen by government, and managed by charities and the church, it was part of a longstanding policy aimed at easing the strain on UK orphanages and strengthening the British population abroad.

"Facebook has been caught on the back foot again over its data privacy practices, following an investigation by the New York Times. The newspaper has disclosed fresh details,externalabout ways the social network shared access to users' data with other tech firms, including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix, Spotify and Yandex. In some cases, the other companies have said they were not even aware they had special access. Facebookhas defended its behaviour,external. It said it never gave others access to personal data without people's permission and had seen no evidence that the data had been misused. However, it has acknowledged again that it should have prevented third parties being able to tap into users' data, after publicly announcing that it had ended the privilege for security reasons. Examples given by the NYT include allowing others' products the ability to read users' private messages and to see the names, contact details and activities of their friends. Facebook's handling of the matter has drawn criticism, including tweets from its own former chief security officer Alex Stamos, who has called on it to disclose more details about what special access it provided to whom.

The latest revelations follow a series of scandals including the Cambridge Analytica data harvest, incitement to violence in Myanmar, also known as Burma, evidence of Russian and Iranian meddling in the US elections, and several data-exposing bugs. Russia 'meddled in all big social media' around US election New Facebook bug exposed millions of photos Facebook defends Mark Zuckerberg's exposed emails Facebook fined Â£500,000 for Cambridge Analytica scandal These have undermined public confidence in Facebook, led to calls for new regulations and prompted demands for a leadership rethink. ""We have to seriously challenge the claim by Facebook that they are not selling user data,"" commented Damian Collins MP, chair of the UK Parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. ""They may not be letting people take it away by the bucket load, but they do reward companies with access to data that others are denied, if they place a high value on the business they do together. This is just another form of selling."" The Irish Data Protection Commission, which takes the lead on Facebook in the EU, has issued a brief statement: ""We are aware of the media reporting from earlier today. We are currently assessing what next steps, if any, are required."" Some believe Mark Zuckerberg should allow someone else to be appointed Facebook's chairman or chairwoman Facebook, as ever, thinks it's being unfairly picked on. Indeed, as recently as this week, former security boss Alex Stamos described the Cambridge Analytica scandal as an overreaction. With its statement on Wednesday, Facebook took the same tone it has since this whole mess began in March: users gave consent, everybody knew, nothing to see here. For added cheekiness, its statementlinked to a piece in the New York Times from 2010 that seemed to reference,externalat least one of the features revealed in this latest investigation. But what Facebook underestimates, continually, is the extent to which this year has produced a ""data-awakening"" among the general public, and how now is the time for the company to lay it all out on the table. If I was a Facebook employee, or shareholder, I'd be telling Mark Zuckerberg: ""It's time to be completely open about who has or had access to data."" That's the only way to stop 2019 being like 2018: a drip-drip of headlines that have eroded Facebook's reputation, perhaps irreparably. The NYT bases its analysis on hundreds of pages of documents and dozens of interviews, the full details of which it has not shared. In total, it said the social network had special arrangements with more than 150 companies to share its members' personal data. Most of these, it said, were other tech firms, but the list also included online retailers, car-makers and media organisations, including the NYT itself, among others. Of the examples given it reported: Microsoft's Bing search engine was able to see the names of ""virtually all"" Facebook users' friends without those friends' consent in order to personalise the results it showed The music-streaming service Pandora and film review platform Rotten Tomatoes also had access to friends' information in order to customise their results Apple devices could access the contact numbers and calendar entries of users even if they had disabled all sharing in their Facebook settings. Moreover, it said Apple's devices did not need to alert users to the fact they were seeking data from Facebook Netflix, Spotify and the Royal Bank of Canada were able to read, write and delete users' private messages and see all participants on a chat thread Russian search provider Yandex was allowed to index users' identities from public pages and posts to improve its search results after Facebook stopped other applicants from continuing the activity Yahoo could view live feeds of friends' posts Sony, Microsoft and Amazon could access members' email addresses via their friends Blackberry and Huawei were among companies that could pull Facebook's data to power their own social media apps Facebook has long maintained that it does not sell its users' data. But the NYT said that one of the arrangements it struck was to get contact lists from Amazon, Yahoo and Huawei, which it used to run its own People You May Know facility. The feature suggests more acquaintances users might want to add to their friends, which helps increase engagement. The firm distinguishes between two different types of relationships it formed. The first type it calls ""integration partnerships"". It defines these as arrangements that allowed others to offer Facebook's features outside of its own app or website. Facebook actually provided along list of such partners to Congress in July,external. It said the arrangement made it possible for other companies to do things like consolidate posts from Facebook, Twitter and other social media providers in a single app, or provide alerts from a range of services via a web browser. Facebook says that the integration partnerships allowed the BlackBerry Hub and other similar services to be possible But it noted that to do this, its members had to have signed into their Facebook accounts to give permission. It added that ""nearly all"" of these partnerships had been shut down in recent months. Facebook refers to the second type of arrangements as being ""instant personalisation"". It said these allowed other apps to see Facebook's private messages so that, for example you could send a song recommendation to a friend without having to leave Spotify's app. The facility also ensured that if you deleted a message within a third-party app, it was also deleted in Facebook. ""No third party was reading your private messages, or writing messages to your friends without your permission,"" added Facebook'sproduct partnership chief Ime Archibong in a blog,external. ""Many news stories imply we were shipping over private messages to partners, which is not correct."" Facebook said that users' public information was also shared so that, for example, you could see what TV shows your friends had watched within Netflix. Facebook said that for the most part, it ended its personalisation partnerships in 2014, but continued in some select cases into 2017. It acknowledged, however, that it had not always withdrawn the application programming interfaces (APIs) that allowed others to tap into its data, as it should have. ""We're in the midst of reviewing all our APIs and the partners who can access them,"" it concluded. Microsoft has issued a brief statement saying: ""Throughout our engagement with Facebook, we respected all user preferences."" The BBC understands it ended its Bing contract with Facebook in February 2016, and the social network's data stopped appearing in its search results at that point. Netflix has said that it stopped taking advantage of its ability to recommend content to members' Facebook friends in 2015 as the service had not been popular. Netflix used to let users send messages to Facebook friends from within its service ""At no time did we access people's private messages on Facebook or ask for the ability to do so,"" it added. Spotify had indicated it was unaware of the degree of access Facebook had provided to it. Apple has also said that it was also not aware of its devices being granted special access. Yahoo said it only tapped into Facebook's data once users had opted in, and did not do so for advertising purposes. Yandex has said its arrangement was limited to users in Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and other Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) countries, and added that it stopped receiving Facebook's data in 2015. Amazon said it only used Facebook's information ""in accordance with our privacy policy"". Part of the issue is that Facebook promised a US regulator - the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) - in 2011 that it would not share user data without explicit consent. Facebook insists it has not breached that pledge, but some privacy experts suggest otherwise. Furthermore, despite Facebook executives claiming to have been transparent over the years about the firm's privacy policy shifts, campaign groups suggest new laws are needed to restrict its activities. ""Time and again Facebook has been unable to clearly and in plain language explain to people how the company is collecting, storing, sharing, and retaining people's data,"" a spokeswoman for Privacy International told the BBC. ""The sheer scope of the Facebook scandals in 2018 alone is mind-boggling and shows that data exploitation is a rampant and systemic."" The other risk is that the more negative stories there are in the press, the more likely users are to quit Facebook and its other apps - including Instagram and WhatsApp - or at least stop sharing personal information with them.

"Mr Perepilichnyy had been working with an anti-corruption campaigner before his death The death of a Russian businessman who collapsed while running near his Surrey home in 2012 was down to natural causes, a coroner has ruled. Alexander Perepilichnyy is thought to have suffered sudden arrhythmic death syndrome, the Old Bailey inquest heard. The 44-year-old millionaire had been helping to expose alleged organised crime in Russia. Coroner Nicholas Hilliard QC discounted claims he was poisoned and said there was ""no direct evidence"" of murder. The mystery of the Russian whistleblower He ruled Mr Perepilichnyy died of sudden arrhythmic death syndrome - or Sads - a heart condition which claims between 800 and 1,500 lives in the UK each year. Giving a narrative verdict, the coroner said: ""I do not think I can completely eliminate all possibility he was poisoned, although I regard it unlikely on all the evidence I have heard... ""I'm satisfied that I can properly and safely conclude that it is more likely than not he had died from natural causes."" The inquest heard Mr Perepilichnyy gave his occupation as an industrialist and was worth more than Â£50m. He moved to the UK with his family in 2010 after a spell in Switzerland and was living on the exclusive St George's Hill estate in Weybridge. He may have suffered from food poisoning while on a trip to Paris with an ex-girlfriend in the days before his death on 10 November 2012, but the coroner said this was not a contributory factor. Mr Hilliard said the death was not initially treated as suspicious by police at the scene because no-one reported any ill effects or concerns. As a result there was a ""significant lost opportunity"" for police to investigate. Bill Browder, who had been working with Mr Perepilichnyy, spoke to reporters after the verdict A forensic post-mortem examination did not take place until 18 days after Mr Perepilichnyy died and his stomach contents were thrown away before it could be tested for poison. Mr Hilliard said there was also only a ""limited search of the scene so any potentially incriminating evidence was missed"". But the coroner rejected the possibility secret intelligence could hold clues to his death, saying that while he had seen sensitive information related to the case, none of it added to the evidence heard in open court. The inquest heard Mr Perepilichnyy had faced threats in the months before his death and had taken out millions of pounds in life insurance. He had been helping anti-corruption campaigner Bill Browder, who runs investment company Hermitage Capital Management, expose a $230m (Â£180m) money-laundering scheme. Speaking after the verdict, Mr Browder said: ""The judge was working on a puzzle with only 20% of the pieces because of the Surrey Police incompetence in investigating."" Det Ch Supt John Boshier accepted ""organisational failings were made in the early stage"" but said the verdict supported the conclusion reached by his officers in 2013. He said: ""No evidence of third-party involvement in Mr Perepilichnyy's death was found."" The coroner said he received a letter from the Metropolitan Police counter-terrorism unit saying they are ""not conducting an investigation into Mr Perepilichnyy's death"" at the hands of a ""hostile"" agent. By Duncan Leatherdale, BBC News Courtroom two at the Old Bailey erupted with laughter, for pharmacologist Robin Ferner had just hit the nail on the head. ""Clarity,"" he told the 15th and penultimate day of the inquest, ""is not something that is manifest in the case."" It was something of an understatement. Since Alexander Perepilichnyy's death in 2012, questions and speculation have raged. Was it a natural death? Or was he poisoned because of his status as a whistleblower helping expose a multi-million pound fraud in Russia? Clarity is what Coroner Nicholas Hilliard QC was seeking.

"The case centres around former Uber drivers James Farrar (left) and Yaseen Aslam Uber has lost an appeal against a ruling that its drivers should be treated as workers rather than self-employed. In 2016 a tribunal ruled drivers James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam were Uber staff and entitled to holiday pay, paid rest breaks and the minimum wage. That ruling has now been upheld by the Court of Appeal. But Uber pointed out that one of the three judges backed its case and said it would appeal to the Supreme Court. Mr Farrar, who is chairman of the United Private Hire Drivers branch of the IWGB union, said: ""I am delighted today's ruling brings us closer to the ending Uber's abuse of precarious workers made possible by tactics of contract trickery, psychological manipulation and old-fashioned bullying."" He added that he was dismayed that implementation of worker status for drivers was being further delayed while Uber seeks yet another appeal. ""This is nothing more than a cynical ploy to delay inevitable changes to its business model while it pursues a record breaking $120bn stock market flotation,"" Mr Farrar said. ""It's time for Uber to come clean with all its stakeholders and abide by the decision of the courts."" The GMB union said that Uber should ""just accept the verdict"", after losing three times in a row. Prior to this, the Employment Tribunalruled in November 2017that it was upholding its original decision. Uber drivers on strike in London in October demanding employment rights, an end to unfair dismissals, a rise in fares and a reduction of commission ""This is the perfect early Christmas present for GMB's Uber members, but this case is about the wider 'gig economy' too,"" said the GMB's general secretary Tim Roache. ""Employers are on notice that they can't just run rough shod over working people to put more on the bottom line for shareholders."" Uber has been granted permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. The firm said it was encouraged that one of the appeal judges said that Uber's argument was ""neither unrealistic nor artificial"", but in accordance with a well-recognised business model in the private hire car industry. ""Almost all taxi and private hire drivers have been self-employed for decades, long before our app existed,"" an Uber spokesperson said. ""Drivers who use the Uber app make more than the London Living Wage and want to keep the freedom to choose if, when and where they drive. ""If drivers were classified as workers they would inevitably lose some of the freedom and flexibility that comes with being their own boss."" However, law firm Gowling WLG expects the Supreme Court to uphold the decision. ""Yet another court confirms that the more a brand seeks to control the activities of the people that deliver that brand's services to the public, the less likely those people are to be self-employed,"" said Jonathan Chamberlain, partner at Gowling. ""The law will probably always remain uncertain in this area, despite the governments promise of reform, but the direction of travel is clear. I expect the Supreme Court to uphold this judgement, but we shall see.""

"You might have seen their strategically self-regarding emails or watched their self-inflating egos in work meetings. But business school researchers have identified a type of employee who manages to look busy and successful, without actually doing anything useful. The productivity study examined 28 UK workplaces and found staff who appeared to be ""highly engaged"". But on closer inspection they were found to be ""self-promoters"" whose lack of effort pushed down overall output. The research, from the Ashridge at Hult International Business School, examined the engagement levels of teams of workers, across seven different employment sectors, such as health, government, transport and not-for-profits. It found some very motivated workers - and some who were plainly disgruntled and disaffected. But about one in five teams was a conundrum - where staff appeared to be very engaged, but where teamwork and productivity were poor. The study found when ""lifting the lid"" on these groups of workers, that they were undermined by staff who were successfully ""gaming the system"" but not really getting anything done. It is all about me - it might undermine teamwork but the self-promoters get rewarded They might constantly appear in a circuit of meetings, or get involved in conversations that were to their own advantage - but apart from playing the corporate culture, it was difficult to see what they actually achieved. In shift work, it could mean stretching out work to fit across the hours with the least effort. These have been labelled the ""pseudo-engaged"" by employment researchers, as opposed to the ""engaged"" and ""disengaged"". Senior researcher Amy Armstrong said such ""selfish"" staff undermined teamwork and damaged productivity - and in a business sense had a negative impact. But she said the pseudo-engaged could often be encouraged by the managerial system. ""They're rewarded for that dysfunctional behaviour,"" said Dr Armstrong. They were more likely to get promotions, better pay and bonuses and to devote even more of their efforts to their own careers - to the detriment of collective productivity. ""It's quite a depressing picture,"" she said. This was often because such staff were ""managing upwards"" by making themselves look good in front of senior managers. Staff who spent their time promoting themselves in meetings were likely to benefit more than colleagues who were doing the work. Such workplaces could outwardly appear to have lots of commitment and support for company goals. But below the surface the researchers found ""low levels of trust and cohesion"" with ""little evidence of collegiality or support for one another"". It can leave other staff feeling stretched and without any sense of ""togetherness"". Dr Armstrong said in such workplaces there can appear to be ""no point to teamwork"" because of the individuals who seem to benefit from their self-promotion.

"Around 2,000 US troops are believed to be stationed in Syria The Trump administration says US troops are being withdrawn from Syria, after the president said the Islamic State (IS) group had been ""defeated"". The Pentagon said it was transitioning to the ""next phase of the campaign"" but did not give details. Some 2,000 troops have helped rid much of north-eastern Syria of IS, but pockets of fighters remain. It had been thought defence officials wanted to maintain a US presence to ensure IS did not rebuild. There are also fears a US withdrawal will cede influence in Syria and the wider region to Russia and Iran. Trump's Syria troop removal prompts questions After the caliphate: What next for IS? Both the Pentagon and the White House statement said the US had started ""returning United States troops home as we transition to the next phase of this campaign"". The Pentagon said it would not provide further details of what that next phase is ""for force protection and operational security reasons"". This video can not be played On board the eye in the sky watching Syria The White House said the US and its allies stood ""ready to re-engage at all levels to defend American interests whenever necessary, and we will continue to work together to deny radical Islamist terrorists territory, funding, support and any means of infiltrating our borders"". President Trump said it was time to bring troops home after their ""historic victories"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Israel said it had been told the US had ""other ways to have influence in the area"" but would ""study the timeline [of the withdrawal], how it will be done and of course the implications for us"". Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on state-controlled Channel One TV that the US decision could result in ""genuine, real prospects for a political settlement"" in Syria. Pulling troops out of Syria had long been promised by President Trump. But the announcement may have taken some of his own officials by surprise. Last week Brett McGurk, special presidential envoy for the global coalition to defeat IS, told reporters at the state department: ""Nobody is saying that [IS fighters] are going to disappear. Nobody is that naive. So we want to stay on the ground and make sure that stability can be maintained in these areas."" The state department abruptly cancelled Wednesday's daily briefing after the withdrawal was announced. One of Mr Trump's supporters, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who sits on the armed services committee, called it a ""huge Obama-like mistake"". In a series of tweets, he said IS was ""not defeated"",external, and warned withdrawing US troops puts ""our allies, the Kurds, at risk"". Turkey this week said it was preparing to launch an operation against a Kurdish militia in northern Syria, which has been an ally of the US in its fight against IS. A UK government spokesman said these developments ""do not signal the end of the Global Coalition or its campaign"" against IS, and the UK will ""remain committed"" to ensure IS' ""enduring defeat"". ""Much remains to be done and we must not lose sight of the threat they pose,"" the UK statement said. ""As the situation on the ground develops, we will continue to discuss how we achieve these aims with our Coalition partners, including the US."" Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent President Trump's decision reverses the official lines of both the Pentagon and the State Department and it places Washington's Kurdish allies in greater jeopardy. US ground operations in north-eastern Syria involve some 2,000 troops, maybe more, and a network of bases and air strips has been established. But to what strategic end? IS is well on the way to being defeated. Syria's President Assad remains in place. If the goal now is to contain Iran or Russia's rising influence in the region then 2,000 troops strung out across a vast swathe of territory may be too small a force to do this. Their presence though does give the US ""skin in the game"". And many will see this decision as yet another indication of the chaos and uncertainty surrounding US policy towards this crucial region. US troops have largely been stationed in the Kurdish region in northern Syria. A partnership with an alliance of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, is credited with playing a major role in the virtual elimination of IS after it overran large swathes of Syria four years ago, imposing brutal rule on almost eight million people in the country and neighbouring Iraq. Why the battle for northern Syria matters Who are the Kurds? However, the militant group has not disappeared entirely. A recent US report said there were still as many as 14,000 IS militants in Syria and even more in neighbouring Iraq - and there is a fear they will shift to guerrilla tactics in an attempt to rebuild their network. But the partnership between the US and the Kurds has enraged neighbouring Turkey, which views the Kurdish YPG militia - the main fighting force in the SDF - as an extension of a banned Kurdish group fighting for autonomy in Turkey. On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country might soon start a new military operation against the YPG in Syria. Mr Erdogan added that he had discussed his plan with Mr Trump by telephone and that he had given a ""positive response"". The US announced on Tuesday that it had agreed to sell $3.5bn in missiles to Turkey to ""increase the defensive capabilities of the Turkey military to guard against hostile aggression and shield Nato allies who might train and operate within Turkey's borders"". Russia said on Wednesday it would continue with its own sale of an advanced missile defence system to Turkey. In addition to the northern deployment, US forces are also helping fight IS in the last pocket of territory it controls in the south-east of the country.

"Santander UK has been fined Â£32.8m by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for ""serious failings"" in dealing with the accounts of deceased customers. Santander did not transfer funds totalling over Â£183m to beneficiaries when it should have done, affecting a total of 40,428 customers directly. And, after it became aware of the issues, the bank failed to disclose the problems to the FCA. Santander said accepted the findings and was ""very sorry"". Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA said that the failings ""took too long to be identified and then far too long to be fixed"". ""To the firm's credit, once these problems were notified to the board and senior management, they were fixed properly and promptly, but recognition of the problem took too long,"" he said. There were weaknesses in how Santander organised and controlled its probate and bereavement processes, the FCA added. This meant that the bank: failed to follow-up on communications with deceased customer representatives, which increased the likelihood of cases not being closed did not effectively identify all the funds it held which formed part of a deceased customer's estate could not determine whether cases had progressed to closure As a result, despite Santander being informed that a customer had died, funds would not be transferred to those who were entitled to them. But Cary Sumpter, a surveyor from Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, says that Santander is still holding onto money from his late aunt's estate. When his aunt died in 2010, his mother and the appointed solicitors spent months telephoning and writing to Santander to release funds from the deceased's bank accounts. ""There was certainly several hundred pounds in one account, and we thought there were other accounts, but we could never find out,"" said Mr Sumpter. ""Santander wouldn't return calls or emails... To this day, that money is still sitting somewhere in the coffers of Santander."" After the BBC highlighted the case, Santander said it would look into the matter. Karl Lenobel was a Holocaust survivor who died in 2004 aged 84, leaving no surviving relatives. His older sister Katherine, a Kindertransport refugee who died in 2001, had worked for Abbey National and had had several bank accounts with the building society, which was later acquired by Santander. Before Karl died, he appointed Geoffrey Greenhouse his solicitor. Karl and his sister wanted to leave their collective savings to children's charities. Mr Greenhouse chased Santander for the accounts details, but says he hit a dead end. Then, 13 years later in 2017, after Santander was already under investigation by the FCA, the bank contacted him to say it was holding Â£120,000. The money was eventually paid, and under pressure from Mr Greenhouse Santander agreed Â£100,000 in compensation for the long delay. The money was finally given to three children's charities, as well as the children of a fellow Holocaust survivor. ""I don't think it was a mistake - the banks did it deliberately,"" Mr Greenhouse said. He said that many people who grew up during and just after the Second World War had opened accounts with building societies that might now be lying dormant. ""I do hope all these relatives of people who have dormant accounts are contacted and they get their money back,"" Mr Greenhouse added. And in instances where deceased customers had several different bank accounts and investments, the bank failed to identify these funds, which meant that those who were entitled to them remained unaware of the existence of those funds. Melinda Giles, partner at Giles Wilson Solicitors, and a representative for private client solicitors on the Law Society Council, told the BBC that similar incidents have occurred at other British banks, because there was ""too much of a relaxed approach"" from many banks to the legal process. ""I have come across errors of judgement by a variety of banks in that they do not insist on a grant of probate to be sure that they are paying the money that belongs to a deceased person to the correct person entitled,"" she said. Santander UK's chief executive Nathan Bostock said: ""We accept the FCA's findings and have fully cooperated with their investigation. ""We have now transferred the majority of customer funds and made significant improvements to our whole probate and bereavement process, ensuring we provide both a sensitive and efficient service to our bereaved customer representatives and those who are managing the estates of people who have passed away.""

"This video can not be played Nick Munday slashed his insurance bill by switching providers Loyalty came at a cost for Nick Munday - a cost that can be calculated at Â£1,250 a year. The 61-year-old had been a home and contents insurance customer with the same provider for 20 years, and was eventually paying Â£2,000 a year. One call querying the cost suggested he could pay a premium to Â£750. Now the UK's competition watchdog has said millions of unsuspecting customers were being exploited by bad practices by firms. It has responded to a so-called super complaint from Citizens Advice which argues that loyal customers are being ""ripped off"" for mobile, broadband, savings, home insurance and mortgage deals. Findings by the Competition and Markets Authority,external(CMA) included year-on-year ""stealth price rises"", costly exit fees, difficulties for customers to cancel contracts or switch providers, and consumers being required to automatically renew a contract. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA said: ""Our work has uncovered a range of problems which leave people feeling ripped off, let down and frustrated. They shouldn't have to be constantly on guard, spending hours searching for or negotiating a good deal, to avoid being trapped into bad value contracts or falling victim to stealth price rises. ""Millions of loyal or vulnerable customers are being taken advantage of each year by firms - and end up paying much more than they should do. This must come to an end."" Readers suggest ways to avoid loyalty premium Consumer loyalty 'rip off' faces probe Insurers 'penalising' loyal customers It backed up Citizens Advice claims that customers who stick with their supplier are losing a total of about Â£4bn a year, the equivalent to an average of Â£877 per person. That cost was higher for Mr Munday. He said his insurance premium with Santander was Â£2,000 a year, having used their services for two decades. When he shopped around, he was quoted a price of Â£469 from another provider. He contacted Santander, which said premiums for new customers could be as little as Â£750. ""It is despicable. They are treating loyal customers really poorly,"" he said. ""Loyalty should be worth something. It would be good if big companies rewarded people accordingly."" He said that putting up premiums each year was ""an easy way for them to make more money"". For him, a saving of Â£100 a month was an important difference. Switching is not always easy, but the government-backedMoney Advice Service,externalhas some tips for consumers: Haggle on deals such as broadband contracts - find out exactly what is being offered elsewhere and ring up your provider, select the ""thinking of leaving"" option, and get through to the retention or disconnection team A pay-as-you-go mobile phone does not require a credit check, so this could be a better option for those with a chequered credit history The mobile phone handset makes the biggest difference to your bill. If you are happy with your handset, or can buy one separately, consider switching to a SIM-only deal When choosing insurance, check more than one price comparison website as they do not all cover the same companies, work out which cover is required, and check if choosing home and contents insurance from the same provider is cheaper Santander said that the cost reflected some claims made on the policy. It said that a renewal notice would have pointed out that he may have received a better deal with another product from Santander or elsewhere. The bank said that if he had wanted a policy that was exactly the same as his current one, it would have cost more than Â£750 even if he was a new customer. ""Santander is constantly working to ensure that our prices are fair and competitive,"" it said. ""We will continue to do this and the Citizens Advice super complaint and recent-announced FCA market review will be a key consideration for us."" Citizens Advice said it knew of a couple aged in their 90s who were paying Â£1,000 a year too much for their home insurance, having been with the same company for six years. It said that was an example of a wider issue. In its complaint, it said problems had been detected in five particular areas: savings accounts mortgages household insurance mobile phone contracts broadband contracts This super complaint requires a response from the CMA which has now been published. Citizens Advice described the CMA's report as a strong response, and said regulators must now follow this up in the deadline for progress of six months set by the CMA. ""The CMA is clear that nothing should be off the table when it comes to tackling the loyalty penalty, including targeted price caps, so we are expecting bold action,"" said Gillian Guy, Citizens Advice chief executive. In the meantime, the insurance and telecoms industries have made changes aimed at reducing the impact of higher charges for loyal customers. UK Finance, which represents banks and lenders, said it was investigating more help for longstanding mortgage customers, and had introduced prompts to make interest rates clear to savers. The CMA said that millions of people had been ""exploited"" as a result of practices in these markets. This ranged from about one million people being affected in the mortgage market to 12 million in the insurance sector. It said vulnerable people, including the elderly and those on low incomes, were most at risk of paying a loyalty penalty. As a result, it has opened a consumer law enforcement investigation in the anti-virus software sector, and warned that it could follow suit in other sectors. It has also outlined various recommendations to regulators and government, including targeted price caps to protect the vulnerable. The watchdog suggested that Ofcom introduces regulation to stop mobile providers charging pay-monthly customers the same rate once they had effectively paid off their handsets at the end of the minimum contract period. Some providers are already following that rule. It added that the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), should ""look closely"" at evidence that insurance firms continually raised prices and take action to prevent people being exploited. This should include considering ""pricing interventions"". How do companies use my loyalty card data? Insurers pledge fairer premiums for long-term customers Mr Coscelli, of the CMA, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""aggressive discounts"" benefitted new customers, but after ""taking a step back"" the picture did not look so good for consumers. ""We like the deals to new customers, we like new companies coming in with new ideas, and they need to have a chance to succeed in new markets,"" he said. ""What we are saying to companies is they need to assess their practices and see whether they are legal, and to decide if they should continue as they do or change some of their approaches."" Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: ""Three quarters of insurance customers benefit from shopping around, but we accept there needs to be a better balance between the deals offered to new consumers and the interests of long-standing customers."" Business Secretary Greg Clark said companies continuing to take advantage of loyal consumers should know that the government would intervene. ""We will publish a comprehensive Consumer White Paper in the first part of next year to ensure markets provide consumers with competitive prices and quality products and services,"" he said.

"MPs debated new figures on homeless deaths in England and Wales They also debated a UN report on the Rohingya refugee crisis in Myanmar Earlier: Andrea Leadsom outlined parliamentary timetable for after Christmas She said MPs' debate on the Brexit deal will resume on January 9th The House of Lords debated Islamophobia in the UK Richard Morris, Sophie Morris and Robbie Hawkins The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. Members of Parliament (MPs) will vote next week on the Brexit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated. House of CommonsParliament With the Commons finished for the day, that's it from us until after Christmas. Today began with questions to trade and equalities ministers, before shadow housing minister Melanie Onn asked an urgent question onnew statisticsabout deaths among homeless people. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom then gave the business statement, repeatedly stressing that MPs will get to vote on the government's Brexit deal in the week beginning January 14. Following that, MPs debated the UN report on the Rohingya refugee crisis, as chosen by the backbench business committee. Parliament returns on Monday 7th of January, do join us then...and have a happy Christmas. Adjournment Debate House of CommonsParliament Bringing the day to the end before MPs head home for Christmas, Labour MP Clive Efford is leading the short adjournment debate. The focus of today's debate is the Source NHS drop-in centre in the Horn Park Estate, which is in Mr Efford's constituency of Eltham, east London. Rohingya refugees UN report debate House of CommonsParliament Bringing the debate to an end, Labour's Rushanara Ali says the focus of the debate has been highlighting the need for a referral to the International Criminal Court She says the minister has ""very ably"" explained the complexities of the issue, but asks ""if not now, when?"" ""We are absolutely determined that the government takes much stronger action and reports back every few months with results, rather than having to go round and round in circles"", she says. ""Genocide cannot be taken lightly. This is why we must act."" Rohingya refugees UN report House of CommonsParliament Foreign Office Minister Mark Field says Bangladesh has shown ""immense generosity"" in hosting so many Rohingya refugees. He says many he has spoken to want to return to Myanmar, as long as they can get guarantees that they won't be persecuted. He says he has told the foreign ministers of Myanmar and Bangladesh that the UK believes not enough is being done to repatriate Rohingya refugees. The UK has so far given Â£129m in assistance, he adds. The government will ""try"" to bring a motion forward at the UN, but there are some ""fundamental strategic difficulties"" which may prevent that, he tells MPs. He says this will be a ""very long journey"" but the UK ""will stay the course"" for the people of Myanmar. Rohingya refugees UN report debate House of CommonsParliament Winding up, shadow foreign office minister Helen Goodman says the government must respond to today's debate ""in full, with action"". She was ""alarmed"" when she heard that discussions had been held between the Bangladesh and Myanmar about repatriation of the Rohingya, in which case she says the main question is: ""are the conditions right for a safe,voluntary and dignified return?"" MPs have today sent a ""resounding no"", she says, and the big question is what should be done now. ""Everything we know about the Myanmar government suggests that we cannot have confidence in an internal inquiry, she says. Labour ""believe that it is now time for a UN Security Council resolution referring Myanmar to the ICC [International Criminal Court]"". She says she understands this is likely to be rejected by other members, but it's important to stand up for what the UK believes. Sanctions should be extended, with assets frozen and individuals travel further restricted, she adds. Rohingya refugees UN report House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Patrick Grady says the Scottish government expects ""all states to comply with human rights law"", and backs EU and US sanctions against Burmese military figures. ""It is clear that further support is needed for the authorities and first responders in Bangladesh,"" he says. He adds that it has been suggested that ""barely half"" of the funding required for these refugee camps has been provided. ""We keep saying it must never happen again, yet, here we are,"" he says, referring to previous instances of such crimes. Rohingya refugees UN report debate House of CommonsParliament DUP MP Jim Shannon says the international community has taken ""woefully insufficient"" action to resolve the crisis or bring the perpetrators of violence to account. ""If there's a war crimes tribunal, I'll be the first person in the queue to give them a good going over"", he says, adding: ""it is absolutely despicable what's been going on."" The British government must push Myanmar to grant the Rohingya citizen rights as soon as possible, he says, requesting to know what has been done on this by the government. He urges the minister to ""take this case to heart"" and to take action, as the UK has a responsibility to do. ""There are hundreds of thousands of people looking towards us, praying for relief"", he adds. There have been discussions throughout this year between Myanmar and Bangladesh about repatriating Rohingya refugees back to Myanmar. Officially, the two countries want to see this process
completed by 2019. A breakthrough came in June, when Myanmar saw progress on
registering all refugees in camps around Rakhine state. Only a tiny number of refugees have so far returned to
Rakhine state, all of them apparently not through official channels. Spokespeople for the Rohingya say that issues on citizenship
need to be addressed before they return. They are also requesting an
international security presence, and proper restitution for their loss - conditions which have so far not been met. Rohingya have continued to cross into Bangladesh during
2018, albeit in smaller numbers. Islamophobia Debate House of LordsParliament Concluding the debate, Conservative peer Lord Sheikh says he is pleased that numerous peers have raised the point that people of other religions ""must stand by the Muslims"". Lord Sheikh says everyone should be accepted in the UK, no matter their faith or race, and that he is pleased that the government has agreed to look into adopting an official definition for Islamophobia. He says it is clear that the issue needs to be researched in more detail, and he hopes the government will do this. The Rohingya, who numbered around one million in Myanmar at the start of 2017, are one of the many ethnic minorities in the country. Rohingya Muslims represent the largest percentage of Muslims in Myanmar, with the majority living in Rakhine state. They have their own language and culture, and say they are descendants of Arab traders and other groups who have been in the region for generations. But the government of Myanmar, a predominantly Buddhist country, denies the Rohingya citizenship and even excluded them from the 2014 census, refusing to recognise them as a people. It sees them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Islamophobia Debate House of LordsParliament Communities Minister Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth says the work of the British Muslims all-party parliamentary group will be being brought forwards in the new year. He says an agreed definition of Islamophobia ""will make things better"", but needs to be thoroughly discussed. The government is teaming schools situated in areas with a particularly diverse range of faiths with each other to ensure a wider education on religion, he says. Lord Bourne says the diversity of the UK should be celebrated, adding that Islamophobia is ""shameful"" and something the government wants to combat. Rohingya refugees UN report debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Imran Hussain - who represents the constituency with the largest number of Rohingya residents in the UK - says the persecution of the Rohingya is not new, but has reached new highs. He calls the treatment of the Rohingya in Myanmar - also known as Burma - is a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". He says Rohingya ""faced murder, their friends and relatives cut down by gunfire, knives and machetes, and whatever else soldiers and thugs could get their hands on"". He says he asked the government to condemn the action in August last year, and ""even today I cannot think of one occasion when the government has condemned it."" Minister Mark Field intervenes to say the government has condemned senior figures of the Burmese military, but ""it's all very well to condemn...we have a range of other actions...condemnation is never enough."" Mr Hussain says the Burmese government must be held to account with the full power of the international community, with the leaders sent to the International Criminal Court. No longer can the UK ""hide from our global responsibilities"", he says. Islamophobia Debate House of LordsParliament Summing up the debate for Labour, Baroness Chakrabarti says ""racism is on the rise"" and Islamophobia is ""too often in particular denied in our politics and media"". She says there is a value in working towards a widely accepted definition of Islamophobia, and thanks the all-party parliamentary group for their work in this area. She tells peers that people ""should be able to criticise Islam"", but that Islamophobia is about a ""hatred for those who practice that faith"". ""Hating someone is not the same as critiquing ideas, and it is completely unacceptable"", she adds. She says that even though Muslims can belong to any race, Islamophobia is ""rooted"" in racism and she therefore supports this part of the group'sdefinition,external. Islamophobia Debate House of LordsParliament Crossbench peer Baroness Afshar says it is regrettable that Islamophobia is emerging in the UK, a country that has welcomed people from all walks of life. She says the UK has been ""pioneering"" in the collaboration of different cultures, quoting the example of fish and chip shops serving curry sauce. Baroness Afshar questions what other steps the government is taking to combat hate crime against Muslims, noting that individuals in her community are being ""demonized in the name of religion"". Rohingya refugees UN report debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Paul Scully says because the Burmese people are largely in favour of the ejection of the Rohingya from their country, the military are able to hide behind ideas of being a popular movement and rule out any criticism as Western propaganda. He says the UK needs to ""cut through"" this and tell the Burmese authorities that whilst ""we will help you in terms of building up the rule of law...we will always, always call you out when you are just breaking in any certain sense of international law and human rights"". It's vital that those responsible are held to account, he says, but also that an end to the conflict can be reached and that the country is able to move on. Islamophobia Debate House of LordsParliament Non-affiliated peer Baroness Uddin says ""knee jerk policy reactions"" threaten the safety of Muslims in many parts of Europe, leading to the ""social exclusion of a whole community"".

Rohingya refugees UN report House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Stephen Twigg, who chairs the international development committee, says the current crisis in Myanmar is the result of ""decades of marginalisation and persecution"" of Rohingya. He says members of his committee were fused entry to Myanmar to see the areas affected. He says when a plan to repatriate refugees was announced in November, ""many of the refugees went and hid in the surrounding forests, at least one committed suicide"". He says that buses arrived at the camp and refugees were offered food to return to Myanmar if they got on the coaches, but the buses returned empty. When refugees return, he says, it must be ""safe, voluntary and dignified"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"A Colgate toothpaste TV advert which promised to ""instantly"" repair teeth has been banned for being ""misleading"". Six complaints about the advert for Colgate Sensitive Repair and Prevent toothpaste wereupheld by the Advertising Standards Authority,external. Parent company Colgate-Palmolive (UK) said the product provided a ""reparative layer on the enamel surface"" when used. It is the ninth Colgate-Palmolive ad to be banned in seven years, five of which were for dental products. The ad, which appeared on UK screens in August this year, claimed to instantly heal sensitive teeth if applied twice a day ""directly with [a] finger for one minute"". Colgate-Palmolive claimed clinical studies showed the product repaired microscopic gaps in tooth enamel and it believed that the advert was clear that the claim referred to the product providing a protective barrier on the teeth in order to relieve pain caused by sensitivity. However, the ASA said that this was not the same as repairing the tooth and concluded the claim that it ""repairs teeth instantly"" was not substantiated. Ban for 'natural contraception' advert KFC and Kellogg's broke junk food ad rules The watchdog ruled the advert must not appear again in its current form and that the company must not make similar claims ""unless they held evidence"" to back them up. It is the latest Colgate-Palmolive advert to be banned by the ASA. In 2014 the company had a commercial banned for suggesting one of its toothbrushes used ""sonic waves"" to clean teeth,which the ASA said was misleading,external. Other Colgate-Palmolive ads to be banned include one that theASA ruled exaggerated how much whiter,externala toothpaste would make the user's teeth and another that featured an endorsement from a woman who said she was a nursebut was actually an actress.,external The BBC has asked Colgate-Palmolive why it has fallen foul of the advertising regulator but has yet to receive a response.

"This video can not be played Nick Munday slashed his insurance bill by switching providers Loyalty came at a cost for Nick Munday - a cost that can be calculated at Â£1,250 a year. The 61-year-old had been a home and contents insurance customer with the same provider for 20 years, and was eventually paying Â£2,000 a year. One call querying the cost suggested he could pay a premium to Â£750. Now the UK's competition watchdog has said millions of unsuspecting customers were being exploited by bad practices by firms. It has responded to a so-called super complaint from Citizens Advice which argues that loyal customers are being ""ripped off"" for mobile, broadband, savings, home insurance and mortgage deals. Findings by the Competition and Markets Authority,external(CMA) included year-on-year ""stealth price rises"", costly exit fees, difficulties for customers to cancel contracts or switch providers, and consumers being required to automatically renew a contract. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA said: ""Our work has uncovered a range of problems which leave people feeling ripped off, let down and frustrated. They shouldn't have to be constantly on guard, spending hours searching for or negotiating a good deal, to avoid being trapped into bad value contracts or falling victim to stealth price rises. ""Millions of loyal or vulnerable customers are being taken advantage of each year by firms - and end up paying much more than they should do. This must come to an end."" Readers suggest ways to avoid loyalty premium Consumer loyalty 'rip off' faces probe Insurers 'penalising' loyal customers It backed up Citizens Advice claims that customers who stick with their supplier are losing a total of about Â£4bn a year, the equivalent to an average of Â£877 per person. That cost was higher for Mr Munday. He said his insurance premium with Santander was Â£2,000 a year, having used their services for two decades. When he shopped around, he was quoted a price of Â£469 from another provider. He contacted Santander, which said premiums for new customers could be as little as Â£750. ""It is despicable. They are treating loyal customers really poorly,"" he said. ""Loyalty should be worth something. It would be good if big companies rewarded people accordingly."" He said that putting up premiums each year was ""an easy way for them to make more money"". For him, a saving of Â£100 a month was an important difference. Switching is not always easy, but the government-backedMoney Advice Service,externalhas some tips for consumers: Haggle on deals such as broadband contracts - find out exactly what is being offered elsewhere and ring up your provider, select the ""thinking of leaving"" option, and get through to the retention or disconnection team A pay-as-you-go mobile phone does not require a credit check, so this could be a better option for those with a chequered credit history The mobile phone handset makes the biggest difference to your bill. If you are happy with your handset, or can buy one separately, consider switching to a SIM-only deal When choosing insurance, check more than one price comparison website as they do not all cover the same companies, work out which cover is required, and check if choosing home and contents insurance from the same provider is cheaper Santander said that the cost reflected some claims made on the policy. It said that a renewal notice would have pointed out that he may have received a better deal with another product from Santander or elsewhere. The bank said that if he had wanted a policy that was exactly the same as his current one, it would have cost more than Â£750 even if he was a new customer. ""Santander is constantly working to ensure that our prices are fair and competitive,"" it said. ""We will continue to do this and the Citizens Advice super complaint and recent-announced FCA market review will be a key consideration for us."" Citizens Advice said it knew of a couple aged in their 90s who were paying Â£1,000 a year too much for their home insurance, having been with the same company for six years. It said that was an example of a wider issue. In its complaint, it said problems had been detected in five particular areas: savings accounts mortgages household insurance mobile phone contracts broadband contracts This super complaint requires a response from the CMA which has now been published. Citizens Advice described the CMA's report as a strong response, and said regulators must now follow this up in the deadline for progress of six months set by the CMA. ""The CMA is clear that nothing should be off the table when it comes to tackling the loyalty penalty, including targeted price caps, so we are expecting bold action,"" said Gillian Guy, Citizens Advice chief executive. In the meantime, the insurance and telecoms industries have made changes aimed at reducing the impact of higher charges for loyal customers. UK Finance, which represents banks and lenders, said it was investigating more help for longstanding mortgage customers, and had introduced prompts to make interest rates clear to savers. The CMA said that millions of people had been ""exploited"" as a result of practices in these markets. This ranged from about one million people being affected in the mortgage market to 12 million in the insurance sector. It said vulnerable people, including the elderly and those on low incomes, were most at risk of paying a loyalty penalty. As a result, it has opened a consumer law enforcement investigation in the anti-virus software sector, and warned that it could follow suit in other sectors. It has also outlined various recommendations to regulators and government, including targeted price caps to protect the vulnerable. The watchdog suggested that Ofcom introduces regulation to stop mobile providers charging pay-monthly customers the same rate once they had effectively paid off their handsets at the end of the minimum contract period. Some providers are already following that rule. It added that the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), should ""look closely"" at evidence that insurance firms continually raised prices and take action to prevent people being exploited. This should include considering ""pricing interventions"". How do companies use my loyalty card data? Insurers pledge fairer premiums for long-term customers Mr Coscelli, of the CMA, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""aggressive discounts"" benefitted new customers, but after ""taking a step back"" the picture did not look so good for consumers. ""We like the deals to new customers, we like new companies coming in with new ideas, and they need to have a chance to succeed in new markets,"" he said. ""What we are saying to companies is they need to assess their practices and see whether they are legal, and to decide if they should continue as they do or change some of their approaches."" Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: ""Three quarters of insurance customers benefit from shopping around, but we accept there needs to be a better balance between the deals offered to new consumers and the interests of long-standing customers."" Business Secretary Greg Clark said companies continuing to take advantage of loyal consumers should know that the government would intervene. ""We will publish a comprehensive Consumer White Paper in the first part of next year to ensure markets provide consumers with competitive prices and quality products and services,"" he said.

"This video can not be played What did we learn from Elon Musk's big reveal? Entrepreneur Elon Musk has unveiled a prototype underground tunnel in Los Angeles which is designed to transport cars at high speed around the city. The tunnel is only a mile (1.6km) long at the moment but the goal is a network to ease chronic traffic congestion. Modified electric cars would be lowered into the tunnel and travel at speeds up to 150mph (240km/h), Mr Musk says. The tunnel has been built by Mr Musk's Boring Company, which boasts state-of-the-art engineering techniques. The weird and wonderful life of Elon Musk Mr Musk, best known as the head of Tesla electric cars and the commercial SpaceX programme, arrived at the launch on Tuesday in a Tesla car modified to work on the ""loop"" system. He was cheered by a small crowd as he emerged from the car at one end of the tunnel bathed in green and blue interior lights. The plan envisages modified cars being lowered into the tunnel network by lifts and then slotted into tracks on the ""loop"". ""The profound breakthrough is very simple: it's the ability to turn a normal car into a passively stable vehicle by adding the deployable tracking wheels, stabilising wheels, so that it can travel at high speed through a small tunnel,"" Mr Musk said. ""The way the loop will work is you will have main arteries that are travelling at 150mph and when you want to go to an exit, you will have an off ramp,"" he added. ""So you can travel the vast majority of your journey without stopping at 150mph and only slow down when you get to your exit, and then automatically transfer from one tunnel to another. It's like a 3D highway system underground basically."" The BBC's Peter Bowes takes a test ride on Elon Musk's LA tunnel It was almost a white knuckle ride. A bumpy two-minute journey in a modified Model X through a concrete tunnel with a blue neon light in the ceiling. We reached a speed of 49mph, although cars will eventually travel at up to 150mph. Elon Musk later explained that the bumpiness was due to problems with a paving machine and that it would be ""as smooth as glass"" eventually. The vehicle was modified by adding two alignment wheels to keep it stable at high speeds and prevent it from hitting the side of the tunnel. Mr Musk said the $200-$300 attachments could eventually be fixed to any fully autonomous electric vehicle, for use in the tunnel. They would not interfere with the vehicle's normal operation. ""We used Tesla vehicles because I run Tesla. What I am going to do? Use someone else's car?"" he asked, smiling. Alana Semuels, of The Atlantic, told the BBC World Service that Mr Musk had yet to unveil the technology that would allow vehicles to travel at such high speeds through the system. ""At first he said we're going have these tunnels and transport people in pods, now he's saying we're going to transport them in cars, so I'm not sure even he knows how it works,"" she said. A modified Tesla electric car was used in the demonstration Mr Musk first unveiled the tunnel plan earlier this year, saying he wanted to alleviate Los Angeles's ""soul-destroying"" traffic congestion. On Tuesday he said his Boring Company had built the tunnel segment for $10m (Â£8m), adding that traditional tunnel-building technology would have cost up to $1bn. The tunnel runs beneath the municipality of Hawthorne, where the Boring Company and SpaceX are both based.

"This video can not be played MPs called for an apology amid heated scenes in the House of Commons Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has denied calling Theresa May a ""stupid woman"" during Prime Minister's Questions. He was asked to make a statement to MPs after facing Tory calls to apologise for the alleged insult. Mr Corbyn said he was ""opposed to the use of sexist and misogynist language in any form"" and insisted he had actually said ""stupid people"". Commons Speaker John Bercow said he had not seen the alleged incident and all MPs had to be taken at their word. But Conservative MPs said they did not believe Mr Corbyn's explanation and repeated calls for an apology from him. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict Mr Corbyn told the Commons: ""During prime minister's question time today, I referred to those who I believe were seeking to turn a debate about the national crisis facing our country into a pantomime as 'stupid people'."" ""Mr Speaker I did not use the words 'stupid woman' about the prime minister or anyone else,"" he added. Conservative MP Rachel Maclean responded to his statement by saying: ""Read my lips - I don't believe him."" The Speaker said he had reviewed television footage of Mr Corbyn's alleged insult, which had not been picked up by the microphones, and it was ""easy to see why the leader of the opposition's words might be construed as 'stupid woman'."" He had also consulted a ""lip speaker"", who are employed to interpret lip movements in court rooms and other settings when a lip reader can't get close enough, who had lent weight to that view but had not been conclusive. This video can not be played MPs on Corbyn denial: Andrea Leadsom, Rachel Maclean, Vicky Ford and Laura Pidcock ""Nobody can be 100% certain, that includes professional lip readers. But I will naturally take, and would be expected to take, the word of any right honourable or honourable member. ""It's reasonable to expect the House to do the same."" He added that Mr Corbyn had been ""seated at the time and not addressing the House"" so his words had not been ""on the record"". Mr Bercow was separately accused by Tory MP Vicky Ford of calling her a ""stupid woman"" on an earlier occasion, as MPs turned the spotlight on the Speaker's own conduct. The Speaker told Ms Ford she had not raised this point with him before, adding: ""I refute it 100%"" Tory MPs and ministers seek to show the speaker the clip on their phones Commons leader Andrea Leadsom had earlier reminded Mr Bercow of his failure to apologise to her for calling her a ""stupid woman"" during an incident earlier this year. Mr Bercow said he had already dealt with that matter. Mrs Leadsom said viewers and MPs would ""draw their own conclusions"" after Mr Corbyn's statement. But Tory MP Desmond Swayne said criticising MPs for ""what they might say under their breath"" was moving ""into the realm of thought crime"". And Labour MP Laura Pidcock said using the Commons chamber in this way was ""absolutely pathetic"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Theresa May tells Mr Corbyn ""look behind you"" Mr Corbyn had clashed with the prime minister over her Brexit deal, calling her decision last week to delay a vote on it a ""deeply cynical manoeuvre"" from a ""failing"" prime minister. Mrs May hit back at Mr Corbyn, saying he had not tabled his promised no-confidence motion, and had then tabled one that was ineffective. ""I know it's the... pantomime season,"" she told MPs, ""is he going to put a confidence vote? Oh yes he is,"" she said, prompting backbench Tories MPs to chant ""oh no he isn't"". Continuing the pantomime theme, she told the Labour leader ""look behind you - they are not impressed and neither is the country"". Mr Corbyn could be seen saying something under his breath in response. Asked about what he had allegedly said by Tory MP Paul Scully, Mrs May said ""I think that everybody in this House,"" particularly on the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote, should be encouraging women to get involved in politics and ""should use appropriate language"". This video can not be played Theresa May: Did Jeremy Corbyn say ""stupid woman"" or ""stupid people""? Former minister Sir Patrick McLoughlin used a point of order to accuse Mr Corbyn of having ""muttered"" that Theresa May was a ""stupid woman"". Cries of ""shame"" and ""disgraceful"" were heard from the Tory benches at this point. Sir Patrick added: ""Would it not be appropriate for him to come back into this chamber and apologise?"" The row continued after Prime Minister's Questions, with a string of female Conservative MPs joining in with calls for an apology. Former minister Anna Soubry suggested Mr Bercow would be more inclined to take action if the words had been uttered by a Conservative frontbencher at a female Labour MP. Allow Twitter content?

"Allegations thatresearch firm Cambridge Analytica misused the data of 50 million peoplehas thrust the issue of data privacy into the spotlight. A huge amount of consumer data is available and - if obtained - is a valuable asset for companies. And customer loyalty cards, while rewarding shoppers with discounts and deals, are one easy way for companies to collect data on a large scale. After the launch of Tesco Clubcard in 1995, many stores have followed suit. Sainsbury's, Waitrose, Co-op, Morrisons, Iceland, Boots and Marks and Spencer are among the retailers which currently offer reward schemes to shoppers. The average UK shopper owns three loyalty cards, according to research by retail analysts TCC Global. But how exactly do retailers use the data provided by the cards in your wallet and should you be concerned? It is well-known that companies use loyalty card data to understand shoppers' habits. This is not new, and many customers understand this is a core part of the reward card relationship. Loyalty card data helps retailers understand people's behaviour and then shape it by targeting advertising and organising products to encourage more sales. In order to get a loyalty card, customers have to register their name, address and date of birth - and sometimes other information. Scanning the reward card at a shop checkout or entering the card number while shopping online allows companies to track purchases and make a link between people shopping in store and on the web. It means retailers can create an accurate picture of when, where and how people do their shopping. Retailers can enrich the data they have collected from reward cards by buying customer data from third-party companies, known as data brokers. These third-party companies amass information from a variety of sources to create ""profiles"" of people with information about habits, patterns and personality. Retailers can then match their loyalty card data to these profiles, producing a clearer picture of shoppers. All organisations processing personal data must comply with data protection law and each company has a data privacy policy. ""This will include details of what data they can collect, how it can be used, and whether (as well as to whom) the data can be sold on,"" Dr Garfield Benjamin from the University of Birmingham's centre for Cyber Security and Privacy explained. ""There is an increasing need for greater transparency in this process - we all click 'agree' to lengthy and often confusing terms and conditions without necessarily being able to understand them."" Although stores will often not pass loyalty scheme data to other parties, they may share customers' information with companies within the same group, which can be global. Some companies may also share the information with their retail partners, who can use it to target their advertising. Nectar, for example, can share data with at least 49 companies including Argos and Easyjet, according to consumer group Which? Data protection law is changing from May, when the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)comes into force- changing the way organisations have to look after our personal data. Campaign group Privacy International said it is concerned about the ""hidden data infrastructure"". ""Loyalty cards are not a new thing, but the volume of data available to advertisers and companies... combined with the bloated nature of companies vying for access to data is resulting in essentially the mass exploitation of people's data,"" the privacy organisation said. It said retailers and third-party companies ""hoover up information from a variety of sources"" to create profiles, wanting to ""know you better than you know yourself"". ""This picture of who you are, what your motivations are, who you want to become, can all be used to nudge you to purchase something or even behave in a certain way."" But Prof Paul Longley, who is one of a group of academics working at the Consumer Data Research Centre, said the so-called ""big data"" can ""definitely be used for the social good"". ""We hear a lot about invasion of individual privacy and people being manipulated by such sources. But new big data sources can be used for the benefit of all,"" he said. ""So, for example, we may use smart meter energy data to enable analysis of fuel poverty, or loyalty card data or smart card data to look at how mobile people are around the country.""

"The insurance industry has pledged to crack down on ""excessive"" differences in premiums for new customers and existing policyholders. The plan aims to iron out some of the controversial big differences between premiums for new and existing clients. The move follows new rules that force firms to display the previous year's premium on renewal notices. The new guidelines apply to home, motor and travel insurance, but not pet or health cover. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the British Insurance Brokers' Association (BIBA) say their Guiding Principles and Action Points should mean ""an improvement in the outcomes for long-standing customers"". The new commitments by ABI and BIBA members include: Not supporting excessive differences between new customer premiums and subsequent renewal premiums that unfairly penalise long-standing customers Members will take action so that customers' tendency to shop around at renewal is not used to lead to excessive pricing differences that unfairly penalise long-standing customers. Firms should make clear in written, online or verbal customer communications that the new customer premium only applies for that year and subsequent renewal premiums may be higher. ABI chairman Andy Briggs said insurers did a ""great job"" for their customers, ""but the renewal market simply doesn't work where loyal customers get charged much more than new customers"". ""Given many consumers expect to get cheaper insurance when they shop around, there is no easy solution,"" he added. ""These new guiding principles and action points are a positive initiative by the ABI and BIBA members to demonstrate that the whole industry recognise this is an important issue that needs to be addressed."" Gareth Shaw of Which? said: ""A review of the unfair practice that sees existing customers charged excessively steeper premiums than new customers is long overdue. We regularly hear from consumers who are paying hundreds of pounds more a year than new customers because they've automatically renewed their cover. ""Insurers must now act with urgency and implement much-needed changes to ensure their customers aren't excessively penalised simply for their loyalty."" Insurers are finally owning up to what customers have been complaining about for years: the more loyal they are, the more they seem to pay. The extra cost can amount to hundreds of pounds a year on a policy. People selling insurance have become addicted to the ruse of offering big discounts to new buyers to keep business moving. If you don't bother to shop around, you end up footing the bill. The problem with today's plan is that it will be left up to individual insurers to decide which prices are excessive and how to narrow the gap. Customers will still need to check what they are paying to make sure they aren't being taken for a ride. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said its research had found that long-standing home insurance customers could pay an average of Â£110 more a year than new customers. The new plan showed the industry ""recognises the scale of this problem and is willing to act responsibly to stop consumers being penalised for their loyalty"", she added. ""The devil, however, will be in the detail - whether this is successful will depend on prices actually coming down for loyal customers,"" she added. ""The industry should also work with the Financial Conduct Authority to collect better data on the scale of this loyalty penalty. Then we can assess whether this unfair practice is being tackled effectively.""

"This video can not be played Nick Munday slashed his insurance bill by switching providers Loyalty came at a cost for Nick Munday - a cost that can be calculated at Â£1,250 a year. The 61-year-old had been a home and contents insurance customer with the same provider for 20 years, and was eventually paying Â£2,000 a year. One call querying the cost suggested he could pay a premium to Â£750. Now the UK's competition watchdog has said millions of unsuspecting customers were being exploited by bad practices by firms. It has responded to a so-called super complaint from Citizens Advice which argues that loyal customers are being ""ripped off"" for mobile, broadband, savings, home insurance and mortgage deals. Findings by the Competition and Markets Authority,external(CMA) included year-on-year ""stealth price rises"", costly exit fees, difficulties for customers to cancel contracts or switch providers, and consumers being required to automatically renew a contract. Andrea Coscelli, chief executive of the CMA said: ""Our work has uncovered a range of problems which leave people feeling ripped off, let down and frustrated. They shouldn't have to be constantly on guard, spending hours searching for or negotiating a good deal, to avoid being trapped into bad value contracts or falling victim to stealth price rises. ""Millions of loyal or vulnerable customers are being taken advantage of each year by firms - and end up paying much more than they should do. This must come to an end."" Readers suggest ways to avoid loyalty premium Consumer loyalty 'rip off' faces probe Insurers 'penalising' loyal customers It backed up Citizens Advice claims that customers who stick with their supplier are losing a total of about Â£4bn a year, the equivalent to an average of Â£877 per person. That cost was higher for Mr Munday. He said his insurance premium with Santander was Â£2,000 a year, having used their services for two decades. When he shopped around, he was quoted a price of Â£469 from another provider. He contacted Santander, which said premiums for new customers could be as little as Â£750. ""It is despicable. They are treating loyal customers really poorly,"" he said. ""Loyalty should be worth something. It would be good if big companies rewarded people accordingly."" He said that putting up premiums each year was ""an easy way for them to make more money"". For him, a saving of Â£100 a month was an important difference. Switching is not always easy, but the government-backedMoney Advice Service,externalhas some tips for consumers: Haggle on deals such as broadband contracts - find out exactly what is being offered elsewhere and ring up your provider, select the ""thinking of leaving"" option, and get through to the retention or disconnection team A pay-as-you-go mobile phone does not require a credit check, so this could be a better option for those with a chequered credit history The mobile phone handset makes the biggest difference to your bill. If you are happy with your handset, or can buy one separately, consider switching to a SIM-only deal When choosing insurance, check more than one price comparison website as they do not all cover the same companies, work out which cover is required, and check if choosing home and contents insurance from the same provider is cheaper Santander said that the cost reflected some claims made on the policy. It said that a renewal notice would have pointed out that he may have received a better deal with another product from Santander or elsewhere. The bank said that if he had wanted a policy that was exactly the same as his current one, it would have cost more than Â£750 even if he was a new customer. ""Santander is constantly working to ensure that our prices are fair and competitive,"" it said. ""We will continue to do this and the Citizens Advice super complaint and recent-announced FCA market review will be a key consideration for us."" Citizens Advice said it knew of a couple aged in their 90s who were paying Â£1,000 a year too much for their home insurance, having been with the same company for six years. It said that was an example of a wider issue. In its complaint, it said problems had been detected in five particular areas: savings accounts mortgages household insurance mobile phone contracts broadband contracts This super complaint requires a response from the CMA which has now been published. Citizens Advice described the CMA's report as a strong response, and said regulators must now follow this up in the deadline for progress of six months set by the CMA. ""The CMA is clear that nothing should be off the table when it comes to tackling the loyalty penalty, including targeted price caps, so we are expecting bold action,"" said Gillian Guy, Citizens Advice chief executive. In the meantime, the insurance and telecoms industries have made changes aimed at reducing the impact of higher charges for loyal customers. UK Finance, which represents banks and lenders, said it was investigating more help for longstanding mortgage customers, and had introduced prompts to make interest rates clear to savers. The CMA said that millions of people had been ""exploited"" as a result of practices in these markets. This ranged from about one million people being affected in the mortgage market to 12 million in the insurance sector. It said vulnerable people, including the elderly and those on low incomes, were most at risk of paying a loyalty penalty. As a result, it has opened a consumer law enforcement investigation in the anti-virus software sector, and warned that it could follow suit in other sectors. It has also outlined various recommendations to regulators and government, including targeted price caps to protect the vulnerable. The watchdog suggested that Ofcom introduces regulation to stop mobile providers charging pay-monthly customers the same rate once they had effectively paid off their handsets at the end of the minimum contract period. Some providers are already following that rule. It added that the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), should ""look closely"" at evidence that insurance firms continually raised prices and take action to prevent people being exploited. This should include considering ""pricing interventions"". How do companies use my loyalty card data? Insurers pledge fairer premiums for long-term customers Mr Coscelli, of the CMA, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""aggressive discounts"" benefitted new customers, but after ""taking a step back"" the picture did not look so good for consumers. ""We like the deals to new customers, we like new companies coming in with new ideas, and they need to have a chance to succeed in new markets,"" he said. ""What we are saying to companies is they need to assess their practices and see whether they are legal, and to decide if they should continue as they do or change some of their approaches."" Huw Evans, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: ""Three quarters of insurance customers benefit from shopping around, but we accept there needs to be a better balance between the deals offered to new consumers and the interests of long-standing customers."" Business Secretary Greg Clark said companies continuing to take advantage of loyal consumers should know that the government would intervene. ""We will publish a comprehensive Consumer White Paper in the first part of next year to ensure markets provide consumers with competitive prices and quality products and services,"" he said.

"Santander UK has been fined Â£32.8m by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for ""serious failings"" in dealing with the accounts of deceased customers. Santander did not transfer funds totalling over Â£183m to beneficiaries when it should have done, affecting a total of 40,428 customers directly. And, after it became aware of the issues, the bank failed to disclose the problems to the FCA. Santander said accepted the findings and was ""very sorry"". Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA said that the failings ""took too long to be identified and then far too long to be fixed"". ""To the firm's credit, once these problems were notified to the board and senior management, they were fixed properly and promptly, but recognition of the problem took too long,"" he said. There were weaknesses in how Santander organised and controlled its probate and bereavement processes, the FCA added. This meant that the bank: failed to follow-up on communications with deceased customer representatives, which increased the likelihood of cases not being closed did not effectively identify all the funds it held which formed part of a deceased customer's estate could not determine whether cases had progressed to closure As a result, despite Santander being informed that a customer had died, funds would not be transferred to those who were entitled to them. But Cary Sumpter, a surveyor from Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, says that Santander is still holding onto money from his late aunt's estate. When his aunt died in 2010, his mother and the appointed solicitors spent months telephoning and writing to Santander to release funds from the deceased's bank accounts. ""There was certainly several hundred pounds in one account, and we thought there were other accounts, but we could never find out,"" said Mr Sumpter. ""Santander wouldn't return calls or emails... To this day, that money is still sitting somewhere in the coffers of Santander."" After the BBC highlighted the case, Santander said it would look into the matter. Karl Lenobel was a Holocaust survivor who died in 2004 aged 84, leaving no surviving relatives. His older sister Katherine, a Kindertransport refugee who died in 2001, had worked for Abbey National and had had several bank accounts with the building society, which was later acquired by Santander. Before Karl died, he appointed Geoffrey Greenhouse his solicitor. Karl and his sister wanted to leave their collective savings to children's charities. Mr Greenhouse chased Santander for the accounts details, but says he hit a dead end. Then, 13 years later in 2017, after Santander was already under investigation by the FCA, the bank contacted him to say it was holding Â£120,000. The money was eventually paid, and under pressure from Mr Greenhouse Santander agreed Â£100,000 in compensation for the long delay. The money was finally given to three children's charities, as well as the children of a fellow Holocaust survivor. ""I don't think it was a mistake - the banks did it deliberately,"" Mr Greenhouse said. He said that many people who grew up during and just after the Second World War had opened accounts with building societies that might now be lying dormant.

"Santander UK has been fined Â£32.8m by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for ""serious failings"" in dealing with the accounts of deceased customers. Santander did not transfer funds totalling over Â£183m to beneficiaries when it should have done, affecting a total of 40,428 customers directly. And, after it became aware of the issues, the bank failed to disclose the problems to the FCA. Santander said accepted the findings and was ""very sorry"". Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA said that the failings ""took too long to be identified and then far too long to be fixed"". ""To the firm's credit, once these problems were notified to the board and senior management, they were fixed properly and promptly, but recognition of the problem took too long,"" he said. There were weaknesses in how Santander organised and controlled its probate and bereavement processes, the FCA added. This meant that the bank: failed to follow-up on communications with deceased customer representatives, which increased the likelihood of cases not being closed did not effectively identify all the funds it held which formed part of a deceased customer's estate could not determine whether cases had progressed to closure As a result, despite Santander being informed that a customer had died, funds would not be transferred to those who were entitled to them. But Cary Sumpter, a surveyor from Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, says that Santander is still holding onto money from his late aunt's estate. When his aunt died in 2010, his mother and the appointed solicitors spent months telephoning and writing to Santander to release funds from the deceased's bank accounts. ""There was certainly several hundred pounds in one account, and we thought there were other accounts, but we could never find out,"" said Mr Sumpter. ""Santander wouldn't return calls or emails... To this day, that money is still sitting somewhere in the coffers of Santander."" After the BBC highlighted the case, Santander said it would look into the matter. Karl Lenobel was a Holocaust survivor who died in 2004 aged 84, leaving no surviving relatives. His older sister Katherine, a Kindertransport refugee who died in 2001, had worked for Abbey National and had had several bank accounts with the building society, which was later acquired by Santander. Before Karl died, he appointed Geoffrey Greenhouse his solicitor. Karl and his sister wanted to leave their collective savings to children's charities. Mr Greenhouse chased Santander for the accounts details, but says he hit a dead end. Then, 13 years later in 2017, after Santander was already under investigation by the FCA, the bank contacted him to say it was holding Â£120,000. The money was eventually paid, and under pressure from Mr Greenhouse Santander agreed Â£100,000 in compensation for the long delay. The money was finally given to three children's charities, as well as the children of a fellow Holocaust survivor. ""I don't think it was a mistake - the banks did it deliberately,"" Mr Greenhouse said. He said that many people who grew up during and just after the Second World War had opened accounts with building societies that might now be lying dormant. ""I do hope all these relatives of people who have dormant accounts are contacted and they get their money back,"" Mr Greenhouse added. And in instances where deceased customers had several different bank accounts and investments, the bank failed to identify these funds, which meant that those who were entitled to them remained unaware of the existence of those funds.

"This video can not be played What did we learn from Elon Musk's big reveal? Entrepreneur Elon Musk has unveiled a prototype underground tunnel in Los Angeles which is designed to transport cars at high speed around the city. The tunnel is only a mile (1.6km) long at the moment but the goal is a network to ease chronic traffic congestion. Modified electric cars would be lowered into the tunnel and travel at speeds up to 150mph (240km/h), Mr Musk says. The tunnel has been built by Mr Musk's Boring Company, which boasts state-of-the-art engineering techniques. The weird and wonderful life of Elon Musk Mr Musk, best known as the head of Tesla electric cars and the commercial SpaceX programme, arrived at the launch on Tuesday in a Tesla car modified to work on the ""loop"" system. He was cheered by a small crowd as he emerged from the car at one end of the tunnel bathed in green and blue interior lights. The plan envisages modified cars being lowered into the tunnel network by lifts and then slotted into tracks on the ""loop"". ""The profound breakthrough is very simple: it's the ability to turn a normal car into a passively stable vehicle by adding the deployable tracking wheels, stabilising wheels, so that it can travel at high speed through a small tunnel,"" Mr Musk said. ""The way the loop will work is you will have main arteries that are travelling at 150mph and when you want to go to an exit, you will have an off ramp,"" he added. ""So you can travel the vast majority of your journey without stopping at 150mph and only slow down when you get to your exit, and then automatically transfer from one tunnel to another. It's like a 3D highway system underground basically."" The BBC's Peter Bowes takes a test ride on Elon Musk's LA tunnel It was almost a white knuckle ride. A bumpy two-minute journey in a modified Model X through a concrete tunnel with a blue neon light in the ceiling. We reached a speed of 49mph, although cars will eventually travel at up to 150mph. Elon Musk later explained that the bumpiness was due to problems with a paving machine and that it would be ""as smooth as glass"" eventually. The vehicle was modified by adding two alignment wheels to keep it stable at high speeds and prevent it from hitting the side of the tunnel. Mr Musk said the $200-$300 attachments could eventually be fixed to any fully autonomous electric vehicle, for use in the tunnel. They would not interfere with the vehicle's normal operation. ""We used Tesla vehicles because I run Tesla. What I am going to do? Use someone else's car?"" he asked, smiling. Alana Semuels, of The Atlantic, told the BBC World Service that Mr Musk had yet to unveil the technology that would allow vehicles to travel at such high speeds through the system. ""At first he said we're going have these tunnels and transport people in pods, now he's saying we're going to transport them in cars, so I'm not sure even he knows how it works,"" she said. A modified Tesla electric car was used in the demonstration Mr Musk first unveiled the tunnel plan earlier this year, saying he wanted to alleviate Los Angeles's ""soul-destroying"" traffic congestion. On Tuesday he said his Boring Company had built the tunnel segment for $10m (Â£8m), adding that traditional tunnel-building technology would have cost up to $1bn. The tunnel runs beneath the municipality of Hawthorne, where the Boring Company and SpaceX are both based.

"You might have seen their strategically self-regarding emails or watched their self-inflating egos in work meetings. But business school researchers have identified a type of employee who manages to look busy and successful, without actually doing anything useful. The productivity study examined 28 UK workplaces and found staff who appeared to be ""highly engaged"". But on closer inspection they were found to be ""self-promoters"" whose lack of effort pushed down overall output. The research, from the Ashridge at Hult International Business School, examined the engagement levels of teams of workers, across seven different employment sectors, such as health, government, transport and not-for-profits. It found some very motivated workers - and some who were plainly disgruntled and disaffected. But about one in five teams was a conundrum - where staff appeared to be very engaged, but where teamwork and productivity were poor. The study found when ""lifting the lid"" on these groups of workers, that they were undermined by staff who were successfully ""gaming the system"" but not really getting anything done. It is all about me - it might undermine teamwork but the self-promoters get rewarded They might constantly appear in a circuit of meetings, or get involved in conversations that were to their own advantage - but apart from playing the corporate culture, it was difficult to see what they actually achieved. In shift work, it could mean stretching out work to fit across the hours with the least effort. These have been labelled the ""pseudo-engaged"" by employment researchers, as opposed to the ""engaged"" and ""disengaged"". Senior researcher Amy Armstrong said such ""selfish"" staff undermined teamwork and damaged productivity - and in a business sense had a negative impact. But she said the pseudo-engaged could often be encouraged by the managerial system. ""They're rewarded for that dysfunctional behaviour,"" said Dr Armstrong. They were more likely to get promotions, better pay and bonuses and to devote even more of their efforts to their own careers - to the detriment of collective productivity. ""It's quite a depressing picture,"" she said. This was often because such staff were ""managing upwards"" by making themselves look good in front of senior managers. Staff who spent their time promoting themselves in meetings were likely to benefit more than colleagues who were doing the work. Such workplaces could outwardly appear to have lots of commitment and support for company goals. But below the surface the researchers found ""low levels of trust and cohesion"" with ""little evidence of collegiality or support for one another"". It can leave other staff feeling stretched and without any sense of ""togetherness"". Dr Armstrong said in such workplaces there can appear to be ""no point to teamwork"" because of the individuals who seem to benefit from their self-promotion.

"A Colgate toothpaste TV advert which promised to ""instantly"" repair teeth has been banned for being ""misleading"". Six complaints about the advert for Colgate Sensitive Repair and Prevent toothpaste wereupheld by the Advertising Standards Authority,external. Parent company Colgate-Palmolive (UK) said the product provided a ""reparative layer on the enamel surface"" when used. It is the ninth Colgate-Palmolive ad to be banned in seven years, five of which were for dental products. The ad, which appeared on UK screens in August this year, claimed to instantly heal sensitive teeth if applied twice a day ""directly with [a] finger for one minute"". Colgate-Palmolive claimed clinical studies showed the product repaired microscopic gaps in tooth enamel and it believed that the advert was clear that the claim referred to the product providing a protective barrier on the teeth in order to relieve pain caused by sensitivity. However, the ASA said that this was not the same as repairing the tooth and concluded the claim that it ""repairs teeth instantly"" was not substantiated. Ban for 'natural contraception' advert KFC and Kellogg's broke junk food ad rules The watchdog ruled the advert must not appear again in its current form and that the company must not make similar claims ""unless they held evidence"" to back them up. It is the latest Colgate-Palmolive advert to be banned by the ASA. In 2014 the company had a commercial banned for suggesting one of its toothbrushes used ""sonic waves"" to clean teeth,which the ASA said was misleading,external.

"This video can not be played The home secretary sidesteps a question about immigration targets Tens of thousands of low-skilled migrants could come to the UK to work for up to a year underproposed new post-Brexit immigration rules.,external The measure, which would last until 2025, is intended to protect parts of the economy reliant on overseas labour. The idea was described as ""shocking"" by campaign group Migration Watch. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the new system would be based on UK needs rather than where migrants were from and show the UK ""open for business"". Unveiling what he said would be the biggest shake-up of immigration policy for 40 years, Mr Javid said that while there was no ""specific target"" for reducing numbers coming into the UK, net migration would come down to ""sustainable levels"". Reality Check: How has immigration changed since the referendum? UK migration steady despite EU arrivals dip Call to scrap high-skilled migrants cap The much-delayed White Paper - a document setting out proposed new laws before they are formalised in a government bill - also includes: Scrapping the current cap on the number of skilled workers such as doctors or engineers from the EU and elsewhere A consultation on a minimum salary requirement of Â£30,000 for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas Visitors from the EU will not need visas Plans to phase in the new system from 2021 Mr Javid said the proposals would enable the UK to exercise control over its borders and ""deliver on the clear instruction"" of the British people when they voted to leave the EU. The ending of free movement from Europe is a key part of Mrs May's Brexit deal, although any replacement system is set to be part of post-Brexit trade talks. The government says lower-skilled and unskilled migrants will not routinely be able to come to the UK and settle permanently. However, as a ""transitional measure"", people from ""low-risk countries"" in Europe and further afield will be able to come to the UK, without a job offer, and seek work for up to a year. The scheme is designed to fill vacancies in sectors such as construction and social care which are heavily dependent on EU labour and which ministers fear could struggle to adapt when free movement ends. There will be a ""cooling off period"" after a year, meaning people will be expected to leave at that point and not to apply again for a further 12 months. Ministers say applicants, who will have to pay a fee and not get access to public funds, will not be able to switch to any other migration scheme. It is understood that the numbers being admitted this way would be ""similar"" to the 170,000 workers from outside the European Economic Area currently in low or unskilled roles. The government said it reserved the right to tighten the criteria or impose numerical caps prior to a review in 2025 but campaigners for lower migration said the plans were ""astonishing"". Migration Watch said there was no way of making sure people left after a year and the immigration figures, which do not include people in the UK for less than a year, could be distorted as a result. ""It is shocking that the government should have caved in so completely to the demands of industry while ignoring the strong public desire to get immigration down,"" said its chair Lord Green. ""The chief winners will be business, as they exploit the bonanza of a huge new pool of labour from around the world while continuing to avoid their responsibility to the public to recruit and train up local talent."" The BBC's home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The White Paper was trailed as creating an immigration system based on ""skills"". The delay in publication was partly down to a dispute between ministers over a possible Â£30,000 salary threshold for skilled workers. But it's the plan to create a route into Britain for unskilled or low-skilled workers which is likely to prove particularly controversial. The document says the reason for the route is that some sectors have built up a ""reliance"" on such staff from the EU and require a ""period of time"" to adjust to the end of freedom of movement. But the new scheme will be in place until at least 2025; it'll be open to those in other ""low-risk"" countries, not just the EU; and there is currently no numerical cap. It raises the prospect that the immigration system the government is designing is as much about ensuring there's a flow of unskilled labour, as it is about skilled workers. The White Paper introduces a new visa route for skilled migrants, from Europe and beyond. It accepts a recommendation from the independent Migration Advisory Committee to scrap the current limit of 20,700 on workers classed as high-skilled coming to the UK using ""Tier 2"" visas. Tier 2 is the name for general work visas for people from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland who have been offered a skilled job in the UK. Eligible professions include nurses and doctors. UK firms 'fearful' for future migration system Immigration: Who should we let in after Brexit? There will be a consultation about the salary threshold of Â£30,000 for skilled worker visas, amid opposition to such a cap from business and some cabinet members. The Â£30,000 minimum earnings rulealready applies,externalto non-EU workers in most Tier 2 visa cases but could also apply to migrants from the EU. Extending it to skilled migrants could affect the NHS's ability to recruit the staff it needs, the body representing NHS trusts has warned. NHS Providers deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery told Today: ""We are deeply concerned about what is going to happen. High skills does not equal high pay. ""You have got starting salaries for nurses at Â£23,000 - also for paramedics, midwives. Junior doctors starting salaries at Â£27,000, healthcare assistants at Â£17,000, all coming in way below that Â£30,000 cap. ""It is not just health workers, it is social care as well. We have to remember where the skills lay. They lay in those staff under Â£30,000."" The document also suggests the changes could have a negative economic impact, reducing annual output, or GDP, by between 0.4% and 0.9% by 2025. During a BBC interview, Mr Javid repeatedly declined to say whether the government's target of reducing net migration - the difference between the numbers of people leaving the UK for at least a year and those moving to the UK for at least a year - to less than 100,000 would still apply after Brexit. But, at Prime Minister's Questions, Theresa May confirmed the government was sticking to the ""tens of thousands"" ambition. For Labour, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the government had ""disgracefully labelled workers on less than Â£30,000 as low-skilled"" when ""our economy and public services are kept ticking by this majority of workers"". ""The government is not, as it wrongly claims, using a skills-based criteria to meet the needs of our economy and our society. ""It is using an income-based system which allows derivatives traders free movement but which excludes nurses, social care workers and other professions in which we have severe skills or labour shortages."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the government's plans would be ""devastating for the Scottish economy"" because ""our demographics make it essential that we attract people to live and work here"". Business groups said the salary threshold would need to be lower than Â£30,000 and warned the proposals could ""tie the hands"" of employers Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""Employers are hugely concerned that the complexity and cost associated with new immigration rules will impact their ability to invest and grow at a time when many areas are facing near-full employment."" Currently, someone is eligible to apply for a ""Tier 2"" general work visa - which can last for up to five years - if they are from outside the European Economic Area and Switzerland. They must also have been offered a high-skilled job in the UK - which is any profession ranked at level six and above on a list called the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF) - and which has not been filled by a UK worker. The high-skilled category includes a range of professions such as doctors, nurses, musicians, aircraft pilots, brokers, paramedics, librarians, journalists, food inspectors, probation officers, social workers, surveyors, architects, lawyers, and some teachers. In most cases, the migrant will need to be earning at least Â£30,000 per year (or Â£20,800 for new entrants), or the ""appropriate rate"" for their job if that figure is higher. Some professions, like nurses, are exempt. People who do jobs which the UK needs - on the shortage occupation list - are also eligible to apply for the Tier 2 visa, even if the job is less highly-skilled and ranked at RQF level four.

"The European Commission says it has started to implement its preparations for a no-deal Brexit - in case the UK leaves the EU without a plan. It has announced temporary measures to try to reduce the impact, but says it cannot counter all the problems it expects. As PM Theresa May's proposed exit plan flounders in Parliament, both sides are preparing for what they see as the worst-case situation. The UK has allocated Â£2bn ($2.5bn) in funding to government departments. The European Commission's measures are designed to limit disruption,externalin certain key areas, such as finance and transport, if Brexit goes ahead in March without a deal. ""These measures will not - and cannot - mitigate the overall impact of a 'no-deal' scenario,"" it said in a statement. ""This is an exercise in damage limitation,"" added commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis in a news conference, saying a contingency plan was necessary ""given the continued uncertainty in the UK"". The commission's 14 measures cover legislation that will aim to ensure some continuity. They address eight sectors, taking in issues such as transport and customs, data protection, animal health and plants, climate policy and key financial products. Among other things, the measures would temporarily allow: Flightsfrom the UK into and overflying the EU to be allowed for 12 months to ensure ""basic connectivity"" Hauliers to carryfreight by roadinto the EU for a nine-month period without having to apply for permits UKfinancial services regulations- in a limited number of areas such as derivatives trading - to be recognised as equivalent to the EU's for one or two years The commission has also urged its 27 remaining member states to take a ""generous"" approach to the residency rights of UK citizens in the EU following a no-deal Brexit, ""provided that this approach is reciprocated by the UK"". The Commission says these measures should not compare with EU membership, or the transition period on offer in the Withdrawal Agreement - which the UK Parliament has yet to vote on. Deal or no deal - how are EU countries preparing? Post-Brexit UK immigration system unveiled Brussels says the arrangements will be strictly time-limited, and will be ended without any consultation with the UK.

They are to protect EU member states from the more catastrophic aspects of Brexit if no deal is reached, our correspondent explains. Visas will not be required for UK citizens to spend short periods in EU countries, the commission said. For stays of over 90 days, a residence permit or a long-stay visa will be required. Member states have been told to take all necessary legislative and administrative measures so that temporary residence documents can be issued by the withdrawal date. UK citizens who have lived in an EU state for a period of more than five years must be granted, subject to certain conditions, long-term resident status, the commission said. This demonstrates where the EU has a limited remit. The proposals on UK citizens living in EU countries rely on the governments concerned because it involves areas of national - not European - power.

By Adam Fleming, Brussels correspondent The EU has been slightly more generous than expected in its planning for a no-deal Brexit. Its proposal that British truckers can carry on trucking in the EU for nine months before they have to apply for scarce international permits will be welcomed by the industry. Some of the measures will also be in place for longer than previously suggested. For example, the bare-bones aviation legislation will last until March 2020, not December 2019. Some of the measures recognising the UK's financial regulations as equivalent to the EU's will continue for up to two years. Brussels isn't doing this out of the goodness of its heart. This is the product of calculation of what is in its interests and which vulnerabilities need to be protected. And the European Commission is clearly concerned about countries doing their own deals with the UK, hence a plea not to. But the message from Brussels is clear: the deal that's on offer is way, way, way better than no deal at all. The European Commission's initial guidance on the issue was published in November. It committed to publishing its draft version by the end of 2018, allowing for eight weeks of consultation, as required by EU treaties. The issue is heating up because Mrs May's proposed deal, which was agreed with the EU, has so far failed to gain enough support in the UK Parliament, which will vote on it next month. The deadline for leaving is now 100 days away. On Tuesday, the cabinet said it had decided to ""ramp up"" preparations for a no-deal Brexit.

"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scored 126 goals in 11 seasons as a United player Manchester United have named former player Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as caretaker manager until the end of the season, a day after sacking Jose Mourinho. Solskjaer spent 11 seasons at Old Trafford, scoring the winning goal in the 1999 Champions League final. The 45-year-old takes over with United sixth in the Premier League. ""Manchester United is in my heart and it's brilliant to be coming back in this role,"" said the Norwegian. ""This is an opportunity I had to take. ""I'm really looking forward to working with the very talented squad we have, the staff and everyone at the club."" What can Man Utd expect from Solskjaer? Mourinho will not comment on Man Utd out of 'deepest respect' Why Man Utd need a director of football - and is Mitchell the ideal candidate? Title winners to 'rotten to the core' - where did it all go wrong for Man Utd? Ole Gunnar Solskjaer (left), celebrating with fellow Norwegians Henning Berg (centre) and Ronny Johnsen, won six Premier League titles, two FA Cups and the 1999 Champions League at Manchester United Solskjaer, who earlier this month signed a new deal as manager of Norwegian club Molde, will be joined by Mike Phelan, who returns as first-team coach having previously worked alongside Sir Alex Ferguson. Michael Carrick and Kieran McKenna, both part of Mourinho's coaching staff, will continue to work under Solskjaer. Solskjaer's first match in charge will be against Cardiff - where he endured an ill-fated spell as manager - on Saturday. He was relegated from the Premier League with the Bluebirds during an eight-month spell as manager in 2014, then sacked after a poor start to the Championship campaign. United will look to appoint a permanent boss at the end of the season. ""Ole is a club legend with huge experience, both on the pitch and in coaching roles,"" said Ed Woodward, United's executive vice-chairman. ""His history at Manchester United means he lives and breathes the culture here and everyone at the club is delighted to have him and Mike Phelan back. ""We are confident they will unite the players and the fans as we head into the second half of the season.""

The club appeared to inadvertently announce his arrival 12 hours earlier, when a video featuring Solskjaer scoring the winner in the Champions League final against Bayern Munich in 1999 was briefly on their official website. It led to Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg welcomed Solskjaer's appointment on social media, writing: ""Great day for Norwegian football. Good luck keeping control of the Red Devils."" She later deleted the tweet. Molde's 2018 season has finished for the winter and does not restart until March. United's statement announcing Solskjaer's arrival as caretaker manager made no mention of whether or not he will return to Molde when the Premier League season ends. But the Norwegian club stressed they were only ""lending"" Solskjaer to United, indicating they expect him to return to his previous role. ""This is a big opportunity for Molde FK, we think it will be developing and helping to put Molde further on the football card,"" Oystein Neerland, the club's chief executive officer, said. Solskjaer is in his second spell as Molde manager after returning to the club, little over a year after he was sacked by Cardiff, in October 2015. In his first spell, Solskjaer led the club to their first Norwegian title in 2011, going on to retain the trophy in the following season. Former Manchester United midfielderDarren Fletcherdescribed his old team-mate Solskjaer as a ""smiling assassin"", who is a ""lovely fella"" but can deliver some ""cutting words"" in the dressing room. ""He'd let people know when they weren't doing things that were expected of them and he's been at the club with a lot of big characters,"" said the Stoke midfielder, speaking to BBC Radio 5 live before the appointment was confirmed. ""But United shouldn't really be appointing an interim manager. There is a real concern that you could have two seasons of rebuilding again, which is a real worry, and Manchester United should never be in this position. It's mismanagement from the top level."" Former Leicester City and Wales midfielderRobbie Savage,who was a youth player at United, said it was a ""shambles"" that the club would take Solskjaer from Molde. He said: ""Is this where United are really at? Solskjaer is a legend and the fans still sing his name, but, really, the biggest club in the world appointing an interim boss who manages Molde?"" Solskjaer's appointment is welcomed by his former Norway team-mate John Arne Riise Dafydd Pritchard, BBC Sport Wales At times, Solskjaer's scattergun approach in the transfer market gave the impression he was indulging in a real-life version of Football Manager, the computer game he said he had enjoyed playing before making the actual move to the dugout. Given that track record, if Solskjaer is to take the reins at United, it will be interesting to see how much influence chief executive Ed Woodward will allow the Norwegian when the transfer window reopens in January.

"It was made in 1946 but It's A Wonderful Life has been voted Britain's most popular Christmas film. It beat Christmas comedy Elf starring Will Ferrell to the top spot in a survey of more than 7,000 people by RadioTimes.com. Other favourites in the top five include Love Actually, The Muppet Christmas Carol and Home Alone. It's A Wonderful Life is a classic festive feel-good film about a man who has devoted his life to helping others. But when he tries to take his own life a guardian angel stops him and shows him the value of his life. The film was directed by Frank Capra and was nominated for five Oscars, including best picture. Love Actually came in 4th on the list Action film Die Hard came in sixth place. There's always a fierce debate about whether Die Hard is really a Christmas film. Bruce Willis plays an off-duty cop who walks barefoot through broken glass to stop a group of German terrorists - not exactly a traditional Christmas vibe. But it is set on Christmas Eve, and who doesn't enjoy watching an action classic with the family and a box of chocs? It's fair to say the debate will probably continue for years to come. Most of the Harry Potter films show Christmas in some way as they're all set over the course of a school year, but they're not strictly Christmas movies. But the first film in the series, the Philosopher's Stone, does make it into the top 20 of this list. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

"The UK risks ""sleepwalking"" into becoming a cashless society with millions of people disadvantaged as a result, a study has concluded. Banknotes and coins are a necessity for eight million people, according to the Access to Cash study. The report, authored by ex-financial ombudsman Natalie Ceeney, said a cash-free society would create problems for those in debt or living in rural areas. Last year, debit cards overtook cash as the UK's most popular payment method. Debit card payments more popular than cash New Â£50 bank note 'must recognise ethnic minorities' Cash use has halved in the past 10 years, with notes and coins now handed over in three in every 10 transactions. Cash use is forecast to halve again in the next decade. ""As cash use continues to fall, we need to safeguard the use of cash for those who need it, and at the same time work hard to ensure that everyone can participate in this digital economy,"" Ms Ceeney said. Her report was paid for by cash machine network operator Link, but was independent from it. Arber Rozhaja believes going cashless has not harmed his business at all After yet another break-in at south London pub the Crown and Anchor, Arber Rozhaja decided enough was enough. Burglars were after cash lying around after lock-up, but what if there was never any cash on site at all? Mr Rozhaja, operations director at the pub's parent firm, London Village Inns, calculated the volume of cash transactions and was bowled over. ""Somewhere in the region of 10-13% of the total revenue would be cash and the rest was card,"" he says. So in October, the Crown and Anchor went fully cashless. Read more: The bar where your cash is worthless In some sectors, cash is still used frequently. Some 74% of people use cash to give to charity and window cleaners are paid with notes and coins in 85% of cases. More generally, there are various risks highlighted in the report from a cashless society. They include: Struggles in rural communities where alternative ways of paying would be affected by poor broadband or mobile connectivity Difficulties for some people with physical or mental health problems who find it hard to use digital services Rising debt levels, owing to budgeting being easier with cash Lost independence for those who use cash as a lifeline when in difficult or abusive relationships Higher prices for those who are unable to benefit from online services or direct debits Ron Delnevo, executive director for the European ATM Industry Association, said: ""The UK public remain heavily committed to cash use and this must be respected by all payment market participants, however disappointing that might be for their narrow commercial interests."" UK Finance, which represents banks, said that a mix of different ways to pay was vital for consumers. ""Our own research shows that while cash usage is declining, it will still be the second most common payment method in 10 years' time,"" said Eric Leenders, from UK Finance. ""Maintaining access to cash is vital to ensure no customer is left behind.

"This video can not be played Pods can build trust with rough sleepers, the man who came up with the concept says Emergency pods could be a useful tool to help people sleeping rough, a homeless charity has said. The pods in Newport provide individual, portable, insulated shelter with a key coded door. Charity The Wallich said it would welcome more like them, but the project has been turned down for a Welsh Government grant. The government said it was investing more than Â£30m in tackling homelessness over two years. Wayne Evelyn, 39, became homeless 10 years ago when his relationship broke down. Hotel steps in to give rooms to homeless over Christmas Harry Redknapp will give jam roly polys to homeless Being pregnant while homeless changed my life ""There's no end to the places I've slept,"" he said. ""I was staying awake walking the streets, I was scared to go into hostels sometimes because things get stolen, and what little you have got you don't want to lose - when you're homeless what little you have got, means double to you."" Mr Evelyn said he still managed to make it to his shifts at a bakery, but the stress of not having a home led to a confrontation with someone he was staying with and he was jailed after admitting grievous bodily harm. ""I'm very sorry for what happened,"" he said. ""I wish I could apologise for what I've done every day. I'm glad that I've done all these [anger management] courses and I've learned how to be a part of society now. Wayne Evelyn struggled to manage some living situations due to anxiety ""The only reason it happened is because I was homeless - if I wasn't homeless I'd never have ended up in jail."" Mr Evelyn also found it difficult to manage some living situations due to anxiety, which he now has medication for. ""The majority of the time if they offer you a place, you must accept it,"" he said. ""But sometimes you see things that happen, you get scared and you don't trust anyone. When you suffer with anxiety it's difficult to be around people you don't know."" But Mr Evelyn added if the pods had existed, he would have used them. ""If you're in a place where you can open the door and you can shut the door, you feel safe,"" he said. The Amazing Grace Spaces project is seeking alternative funding, and Stuart Johnson said the idea came after years of working in night shelters and asking those sleeping rough what they wanted. ""Our vision is for people to stay overnight - to reach people who find it hard to engage because they've been on the streets so long,"" he said. The pods are made from timber and fibreglass, with a chemical toilet, a bed and a phone charger powered by a solar panel ""With this, because they need a code to access it, they come back to you - you build up a trust, they can trust you, you can trust them and then help them and see how they want to move forward."" Lindsay Cordery-Bruce, chief executive of The Wallich, said: ""They're definitely a useful tool, we'd welcome more of them - but the support has to be in place so that it doesn't just become somewhere else where somebody feels excluded. ""I think there's a misconception about homelessness out there we're talking about buildings, when we're actually talking about exclusion. ""The evidence and the science on this is really clear, it's about how we engage the person, rather than what sort of pod space or bed space we offer them. ""How we meet people in their own environment where they're comfortable, how we take services to them is the key to solving homelessness, rather than expecting people to navigate complex systems."" The Welsh Government said: ""We will continue to work with Newport City Council and other partners to prioritise the most effective appropriate projects to support people to move off the street and into longer term housing solutions."" It was announced on Wednesday that an extra Â£1.34m over winter - including Â£25,000 for every local authority and specific funding for Cardiff, Swansea, Newport and Wrexham as they are the four areas with the most complex rough sleeping issues.

" It was 1 April 2018 - Easter weekend - and Xu Yanjun was amid the bustling bars and restaurants in the Sainte Catherine district of Brussels, not far from the Grand Place. He had flown into Amsterdam and then driven into Belgium for the first part of his European holiday. But he was no tourist, according to the US authorities. Place Sainte-Catherine, Brussels Xu had allegedly come to meet an American employee of GE Aviation - a specialist on aircraft engine design. The company had spent decades and millions of dollars developing composite materials which allowed lighter, sturdier and cheaper fan blades and cases inside engines. Xu was expecting the American to hand over secrets, according to a US indictment. That was because, the US authorities allege, Xu was a spy for the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS). But he was in for a surprise. Rather than an American contact, he was greeted by Belgian police, acting on an international arrest warrant issued by the FBI. Xu Yanjun, shortly after his arrest Xu’s alleged plot to steal secrets began in March 2017. An American employee of GE Aviation, which supplies engines for both commercial airliners and the military, received an email from someone at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronomic (NUAA), according to Xu’s US indictment. Would the engineer like to come for “an exchange” to China? His travel expenses would be paid. By May 2017 - the indictment says - it was suggested the employee give a highly technical report on GE’s new signature material for engines. The employee headed over to China for a week and gave his talk on 2 June. While there he met Xu, whose real job was in the Ministry of State Security (MSS) as deputy division director of the sixth bureau of Jiangsu Province, according to the indictment. But he allegedly gave the engineer a business card which said he was Qu Hui and worked at an organisation promoting science and technology. He explained he was paying for the engineer’s hotel and meals and there was also a $3,500 fee for the talk. The pair kept in touch - the indictment says - and more material was sent over. It seemed increasingly clear that the employee was being asked to hand over sensitive company information. In February 2018, the engineer sent over a presentation. On the first page was a company logo and a warning that the contents belonged to GE and were confidential. Xu allegedly continued to send questions. There is a telling exchange of messages in the indictment. The engineer said the requests involved commercial secrets. Xu said they could discuss this in person. He said the engineer should copy a file directory from his company computer. But the file directory had been doctored to remove sensitive information. By this time, GE Aviation had discovered what was going on. The engineer - who has not been charged - was co-operating with GE and law enforcement. Xu did not know his supposed contact was working against him. He allegedly wanted a hard drive full of data to be brought to a meeting in Europe. “If we are going to do business together, this won’t be the last time, right?” he said. On 1 April Xu was in Belgium and the net closed tight. The US claims his job was to obtain technical information from aviation and aerospace companies in the US and Europe. According to the indictment, since 2013 he had been working with Chinese universities and institutions to identify and target specific engineers with the secrets China needed, passing on the data to government, academia and companies. Xu’s American lawyer declined to comment, but the Chinese Foreign Ministry is reported as saying the case was a “pure fabrication”. In February 2018, the engineer sent over a presentation.

Xu’s American lawyer declined to comment, but the Chinese Foreign Ministry is reported as saying the case was a “pure fabrication”. Xu is alleged to have worked with individuals at NUAA, a university linked to the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. It is one of the top engineering universities in China and collaborates with Chinese aircraft manufacturers. NUAA confirmed that Xu was a part-time postgraduate student, but echoed the Foreign Ministry dismissal of the allegations. “Our school is the contributor and legal user of intellectual property. We’ve always respected and safeguarded intellectual property and never support intellectual property theft.” The National University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA), Nanjing In April 2014, Xu discussed plans to get hold of materials related to a military aerial refuelling aircraft, the indictment alleges. He is also alleged to have sent documents to a contact thought to be associated with a Chinese company involved in making engine parts. An engineer from another company sent a paper on drone technology to Xu who allegedly forwarded it to the NUAA. Xu spent six months in custody before being extradited to the US. He was charged with conspiring and attempting to commit economic espionage and theft of trade secrets. The trial is likely to happen next year. Xu denies any wrongdoing. “The impact to GE Aviation is minimal thanks to early detection, our advanced systems and internal processes, and our partnership with law enforcement,"" the company said in a statement. Xu’s case is an unprecedented act - the extradition of an alleged intelligence officer for economic espionage. But it is being seen as part of an increasing campaign by Washington to confront China. The US says Xu’s case is emblematic of China’s plan - intelligence officials working hand-in-glove with Chinese companies to steal technical secrets from the West and then use them to advance their own economy. “From a perspective of threat against United States national security and our interests, [the] Chinese is number one by far,” says Bill Evanina, a former FBI official who is now director of the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center which co-ordinates the defence of America against foreign spies. Bill Evanina: “From a perspective of threat against United States national security and our interests, Chinese is number one by far” Xu’s case is not the only one to involve aviation. In another case revealed just weeks after, a group of intelligence officers and hackers were charged. They were also alleged to be linked to the Jiangsu branch of the MSS. In this case, dealing with events from November 2013, a Chinese spy is alleged to have met the Chinese employee of a French aerospace company with an office in Suzhou. “I’ll bring the horse to you tonight,” the spy had communicated in advance, according to the detailed US indictment, suggesting they should pretend to bump into each other at a restaurant. “This way we don’t need to meet in Shanghai.” The horse was code for Trojan horse malware which was to be used to infect the company’s computers. On 25 January 2014, the employee placed a USB stick into a computer at the French company. “The horse was planted this morning,” he texted the Chinese intelligence officer later that day, according to the US indictment. The next month, the company’s computers “beaconed”, contacting a web domain controlled by Chinese hackers. That came to the attention of the US which informed French intelligence. They contacted the company, which began to investigate. But the hackers had an advantage. Another employee - an IT worker - at the company in China was working with them, it is alleged. Text messages were exchanged with the hackers and within hours the web domain being used was deleted to cover their tracks, according to the US indictment. The US alleges that from 2010-15 this group - led by a Chinese intelligence officer - worked with employees in China to steal sensitive data related to a turbofan engine used in commercial airliners. None of the accused, who are all based in China, are likely to be brought to trial. The indictments are part of a strategy by the US to put information into the public domain about Chinese activity in order to put pressure on Beijing. What is clear from both stories is that for all the talk of cyber espionage, people still matter. Individuals within companies can - knowingly or unknowingly - provide secrets. So how does Chinese intelligence identify people to target? On 1 November 2017, a search was carried out in Ohio at the home of Ji Chaoqun. Ji was born in China but came to the US in August 2013 to study for a masters in electrical engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. In 2016, he enlisted in the US Army reserves. Ji Chaoqun The US alleges that Ji was asked to provide biographical data and background checks on eight engineers, all of whom were American citizens born in Taiwan or China. All worked or were recently retired from jobs in science and technology - some of them in aerospace. Seven of the eight worked or had worked for US defence contractors with security clearance. Ji is said to have tried to cover his tracks by calling the documents “Midterm Test Questions” when he sent them back to his Chinese contacts. In February and May 2018, Ji met two people who said they were linked to Chinese intelligence. They were, in fact, undercover FBI officers. Ji explained that he had been approached at a recruitment fair in China, according to the indictment. He had later been asked to purchase background checks on individuals. A lawyer representing Ji declined to comment, but previous reports indicated Ji denied the charges. There has been a lot of coverage of Chinese cyber attacks but the insider threat is often more dangerous than remote hacking, US officials say. Chinese intelligence is “prolific” at targeting people over social media sites like Linkedin, Evanina claims. “If you look at it from a perspective of the intelligence service it's a low-risk, high-yield ability to send out 30,000 or 40,000  emails and get 20, 30, 40 people respond and say, ‘I have that technology. I can come over to the presentation.’ It's a very, very successful use for them.” A year ago the German security service warned that 10,000 Germans had been contacted by fake profiles disguised as head-hunters, consultants, think-tankers or scholars who were actually Chinese intelligence agents. Chinese spies are believed to be targeting UK secrets - but the British government has been far less willing to speak out about it. Those working in national security in the UK confirm privately that they see the same range of activity as in the US. But while there have been a string of indictments in America and statements from senior figures in the Trump administration, the UK government so far has been far less vocal. US officials privately say they want the UK to take a tougher line but so far British officials have been careful. There are indications that the UK might be prepared to become more vocal on some forms of Chinese activity as Washington presses its allies for joint action. The US is currently reported to be planning a new wave of indictments and possibly sanctions against China over its espionage. “There has been a long history of intellectual property theft, for example from UK universities and major engineering companies, by hackers linked to the Chinese state,” says Robert Hannigan, who ran GCHQ, Britain’s communications intelligence agency, from 2014-17. “The UK’s response has been low key - successive governments have wanted to avoid confrontation with China and in any case the UK does not have the global law enforcement reach which underpins US indictments against China and other countries on cyber.” In the UK, there have been fewer indictments or court cases although there is one case currently under police investigation. British security officials are particularly concerned about universities being targeted for research and intellectual property. The concern is that they are a soft target for economic espionage either through individuals being invited to China, agents arriving in the West as students and returning with intellectual property, or even potentially through exploitation of formal partnerships between the universities. One major UK engineering company is working with a university on research on advanced materials. The university is also working with the Chinese government. The company ensures the rooms they use are regularly swept for listening devices. The National University of Defense Technology (NUDT) in Changsha is one of China’s top universities. Run jointly by the defence ministry and the education ministry, and with close ties to the People’s Liberation Army, it has been at the leading edge of the country’s space and super-computer programme. It also works closely with Western universities. National University of Defense Technology, Changsha The BBC found a number of UK universities listed on a database as collaborating with the NUDT on a series of academic papers. Much of the collaboration appears to involve aerospace and aviation. There is no suggestion that these collaborations involve espionage or anything untoward but the level of co-operation worries some of those who study Chinese influence. “Collaboration between the United Kingdom and NUDT is highly concerning. UK universities are estimated to have trained hundreds of scientists from NUDT as part of the Chinese military's efforts to leverage foreign civilian expertise for military ends,” argues Alex Joske, an Australian researcher who has studied the subject. “At the moment, there appears to be little oversight of these engagements.” But there is a scheme in place to help universities avoid risk - theAcademic Technology Approval Scheme(ATAS) - and it is run by the UK government. Much of the threat, Evanina says, comes from people who are not spies per se. “They use scientists, engineers, businessmen. They can come here, ingrain themselves in the organisation, be part of a culture, work on a significant project, classified or unclassified, and be in a position to obtain that data for nefarious reasons, and send it back.” Of course, all countries use espionage. The UK and US both carry out espionage against China and its companies. But Western officials argue there is a difference in the way China operates. They say that China has an over-arching strategy to target commercial information specifically to support its companies, which are often linked to the state. This is something they say their spies do not do. China denies that it is engaged in a massive programme of secret stealing. ""US actions have damaged China's rights and interests, undermined China-US mutual trust and cast a shadow over China-US relations,"" a Chinese Foreign Ministry official has said of recent US accusations. ""We urge the US to immediately stop its misguided comments and actions."" The Trump administration is determined to push back on Chinese espionage. It has pursued a strategy in recent months of indicting Chinese individuals, like Xu. Other indictments have alleged plots to steal technology involvingsemiconductor chips,foam, and evengenetically engineered rice. Power, money and politics is going east, that’s the political reality we need to adjust to “I can tell you there’s more coming and there’s more out there,” says Bill Evanina. He argues  that China is a greater security threat than Russia. The concern is not just about China using espionage to achieve economic growth but also how the Chinese state increasingly uses its weight to wield influence around the world. It is certainly the case that it is politically useful for the Trump administration to focus on China more than Russia. But if you speak to national security officials they do believe in the urgency of the threat. The campaign to take a tough line on espionage is just part of a wider confrontation about economic power involving trade and technology. Washington wants its allies to stand alongside them in their campaign. Australia has been at the leading edge of the debate over Chinese influence, including in politics and universities. In June it passed new counter-espionage laws which criminalise “covert, deceptive or threatening actions that are intended to interfere with democratic processes or provide intelligence to overseas governments”. The laws are designed to include actions that might have fallen short of previous definitions of espionage. In the UK so far there has been more caution. “Power, money and politics is going east, that’s the political reality we need to adjust to,” the chief of MI6, Alex Younger, said last month. A government spokesman said: “We do not routinely comment on intelligence matters or the detail of any alleged threat we face. The government is alert to the array of potential threats the UK faces and takes national security extremely seriously.” But senior officials in the UK talk about needing a nuanced approach and are wary of being caught in the middle of a damaging slugging match between Washington and Beijing. There is no doubt that if they had to choose between the Trump administration and China they would take America’s side. But they would rather not be faced with such a choice. “We are unsure whether the rise of China is a threat or an opportunity. The truth is that it is both, but navigating that is difficult,” argues Robert Hannigan. In Washington, while many officials believe it is vital to confront this challenge now, others fear China may already have been able to make sufficient strides forward economically to guarantee its influence globally. Even with a crackdown under way, a few privately say that they fear it may already be too late to stop China's plan. Built with Shorthand",Positive,1.0
"The UK inflation rate fell slightly to 2.3% in November, from 2.4% the previous month, driven mainly by a big fall in petrol prices. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) figure for the month was the lowest since March 2017, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Video games prices also fell, but those declines were partly offset by a rise in tobacco prices. The inflation figure was in line with analysts' expectations. ONS head of inflation Mike Hardie said: ""Inflation was little changed as falling petrol prices, thanks to a substantial drop in the cost of crude oil, were offset by rises in tobacco prices following the duty changes announced in the Budget."" Apart from petrol, the biggest downward contribution to the inflation rate came from a variety of recreational and cultural goods and services, principally games, toys and hobbies, and cultural services. In addition to tobacco products, upward pressure was seen in categories including accommodation services and passenger sea transport. The latest inflation figures mean that pay growth is still outstripping inflation, with the most recent figures showing wages rising by 3.3%, excluding bonuses. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation was set to fall sharply in the coming months, led by lower energy prices. ""Accordingly, CPI inflation still looks set to be below the [Bank of England's] 2% target right from the start of 2019 and to average just 1.8% over the course of the year,"" he said. However, he added that he still expected the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to raise interest rates further in 2019, ""as the Committee believes that interest rates still are well below neutral levels and that no spare capacity exists. ""As such, we continue to expect the MPC to increase Bank Rate to 1.25% by the end of next year, from 0.75% currently."" Separate ONS figures showed the average price of a house in the UK rising at its slowest rate since July 2013, up 2.7% on the year. Mr Hardie said: ""House price growth continued to slow with the smallest annual rise seen in over five years, led by price falls across London.""

"You might have seen their strategically self-regarding emails or watched their self-inflating egos in work meetings. But business school researchers have identified a type of employee who manages to look busy and successful, without actually doing anything useful. The productivity study examined 28 UK workplaces and found staff who appeared to be ""highly engaged"". But on closer inspection they were found to be ""self-promoters"" whose lack of effort pushed down overall output. The research, from the Ashridge at Hult International Business School, examined the engagement levels of teams of workers, across seven different employment sectors, such as health, government, transport and not-for-profits. It found some very motivated workers - and some who were plainly disgruntled and disaffected. But about one in five teams was a conundrum - where staff appeared to be very engaged, but where teamwork and productivity were poor. The study found when ""lifting the lid"" on these groups of workers, that they were undermined by staff who were successfully ""gaming the system"" but not really getting anything done. It is all about me - it might undermine teamwork but the self-promoters get rewarded They might constantly appear in a circuit of meetings, or get involved in conversations that were to their own advantage - but apart from playing the corporate culture, it was difficult to see what they actually achieved. In shift work, it could mean stretching out work to fit across the hours with the least effort. These have been labelled the ""pseudo-engaged"" by employment researchers, as opposed to the ""engaged"" and ""disengaged"". Senior researcher Amy Armstrong said such ""selfish"" staff undermined teamwork and damaged productivity - and in a business sense had a negative impact. But she said the pseudo-engaged could often be encouraged by the managerial system. ""They're rewarded for that dysfunctional behaviour,"" said Dr Armstrong. They were more likely to get promotions, better pay and bonuses and to devote even more of their efforts to their own careers - to the detriment of collective productivity. ""It's quite a depressing picture,"" she said. This was often because such staff were ""managing upwards"" by making themselves look good in front of senior managers. Staff who spent their time promoting themselves in meetings were likely to benefit more than colleagues who were doing the work. Such workplaces could outwardly appear to have lots of commitment and support for company goals. But below the surface the researchers found ""low levels of trust and cohesion"" with ""little evidence of collegiality or support for one another"". It can leave other staff feeling stretched and without any sense of ""togetherness"". Dr Armstrong said in such workplaces there can appear to be ""no point to teamwork"" because of the individuals who seem to benefit from their self-promotion.

"The UK inflation rate fell slightly to 2.3% in November, from 2.4% the previous month, driven mainly by a big fall in petrol prices. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) figure for the month was the lowest since March 2017, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Video games prices also fell, but those declines were partly offset by a rise in tobacco prices. The inflation figure was in line with analysts' expectations. ONS head of inflation Mike Hardie said: ""Inflation was little changed as falling petrol prices, thanks to a substantial drop in the cost of crude oil, were offset by rises in tobacco prices following the duty changes announced in the Budget."" Apart from petrol, the biggest downward contribution to the inflation rate came from a variety of recreational and cultural goods and services, principally games, toys and hobbies, and cultural services. In addition to tobacco products, upward pressure was seen in categories including accommodation services and passenger sea transport. The latest inflation figures mean that pay growth is still outstripping inflation, with the most recent figures showing wages rising by 3.3%, excluding bonuses. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said inflation was set to fall sharply in the coming months, led by lower energy prices. ""Accordingly, CPI inflation still looks set to be below the [Bank of England's] 2% target right from the start of 2019 and to average just 1.8% over the course of the year,"" he said. However, he added that he still expected the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to raise interest rates further in 2019, ""as the Committee believes that interest rates still are well below neutral levels and that no spare capacity exists. ""As such, we continue to expect the MPC to increase Bank Rate to 1.25% by the end of next year, from 0.75% currently."" Separate ONS figures showed the average price of a house in the UK rising at its slowest rate since July 2013, up 2.7% on the year. Mr Hardie said: ""House price growth continued to slow with the smallest annual rise seen in over five years, led by price falls across London.""

"Santander UK has been fined Â£32.8m by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for ""serious failings"" in dealing with the accounts of deceased customers. Santander did not transfer funds totalling over Â£183m to beneficiaries when it should have done, affecting a total of 40,428 customers directly. And, after it became aware of the issues, the bank failed to disclose the problems to the FCA. Santander said accepted the findings and was ""very sorry"". Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA said that the failings ""took too long to be identified and then far too long to be fixed"". ""To the firm's credit, once these problems were notified to the board and senior management, they were fixed properly and promptly, but recognition of the problem took too long,"" he said. There were weaknesses in how Santander organised and controlled its probate and bereavement processes, the FCA added. This meant that the bank: failed to follow-up on communications with deceased customer representatives, which increased the likelihood of cases not being closed did not effectively identify all the funds it held which formed part of a deceased customer's estate could not determine whether cases had progressed to closure As a result, despite Santander being informed that a customer had died, funds would not be transferred to those who were entitled to them. But Cary Sumpter, a surveyor from Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, says that Santander is still holding onto money from his late aunt's estate. When his aunt died in 2010, his mother and the appointed solicitors spent months telephoning and writing to Santander to release funds from the deceased's bank accounts. ""There was certainly several hundred pounds in one account, and we thought there were other accounts, but we could never find out,"" said Mr Sumpter. ""Santander wouldn't return calls or emails... To this day, that money is still sitting somewhere in the coffers of Santander."" After the BBC highlighted the case, Santander said it would look into the matter. Karl Lenobel was a Holocaust survivor who died in 2004 aged 84, leaving no surviving relatives. His older sister Katherine, a Kindertransport refugee who died in 2001, had worked for Abbey National and had had several bank accounts with the building society, which was later acquired by Santander. Before Karl died, he appointed Geoffrey Greenhouse his solicitor. Karl and his sister wanted to leave their collective savings to children's charities. Mr Greenhouse chased Santander for the accounts details, but says he hit a dead end. Then, 13 years later in 2017, after Santander was already under investigation by the FCA, the bank contacted him to say it was holding Â£120,000. The money was eventually paid, and under pressure from Mr Greenhouse Santander agreed Â£100,000 in compensation for the long delay. The money was finally given to three children's charities, as well as the children of a fellow Holocaust survivor. ""I don't think it was a mistake - the banks did it deliberately,"" Mr Greenhouse said. He said that many people who grew up during and just after the Second World War had opened accounts with building societies that might now be lying dormant. ""I do hope all these relatives of people who have dormant accounts are contacted and they get their money back,"" Mr Greenhouse added. And in instances where deceased customers had several different bank accounts and investments, the bank failed to identify these funds, which meant that those who were entitled to them remained unaware of the existence of those funds. Melinda Giles, partner at Giles Wilson Solicitors, and a representative for private client solicitors on the Law Society Council, told the BBC that similar incidents have occurred at other British banks, because there was ""too much of a relaxed approach"" from many banks to the legal process. ""I have come across errors of judgement by a variety of banks in that they do not insist on a grant of probate to be sure that they are paying the money that belongs to a deceased person to the correct person entitled,"" she said. Santander UK's chief executive Nathan Bostock said: ""We accept the FCA's findings and have fully cooperated with their investigation. ""We have now transferred the majority of customer funds and made significant improvements to our whole probate and bereavement process, ensuring we provide both a sensitive and efficient service to our bereaved customer representatives and those who are managing the estates of people who have passed away.""

"British business groups have criticised politicians for focusing on in-fighting rather than preparing for Brexit, warning that there is not enough time to prepare for a no-deal scenario. With 100 days to go before the UK leaves the EU, the groups say firms have been ""watching in horror"" at the ongoing rows within Westminster. The cabinet met on Tuesday to ramp up preparations for a no-deal departure. But the groups say the idea that ""no-deal"" can be managed is not credible. In other Brexit developments: The EU is to push ahead with its planning for Brexit, including if there is no deal, with the European Commission set to publish legislation to ensure continuity in some sectors on a temporary basis The SNP and other opposition parties table a vote of no confidence in the UK government -  but it is understood the government only has to give time to motions tabled in the name of the Leader of the Opposition Prime Minister Theresa May is to urge the first ministers of Scotland and Wales toback her Brexit dealat a summit in London The Public Accounts Committee of MPs says the government has not done enough to secure the supply of medical equipment in a no-deal scenario. In a joint statement, the British Chambers of Commerce, the Confederation of British Industry, manufacturers' organisation the EEF, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Institute of Directors said: ""Businesses have been watching in horror as politicians have focused on factional disputes rather than practical steps that business needs to move forward. ""The lack of progress in Westminster means that the risk of a no-deal Brexit is rising."" Brexit: A really simple guide How Europe does second referendums What can New Zealand teach us about Brexit? The government said on Tuesday that it had sent letters to 140,000 businesses, urging them to trigger their no-deal contingency plans as appropriate. It will also distribute 100-page information packs on Friday. CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn has joined her fellow business groups in warning against a disorderly no-deal Brexit on 29 March The five business groups, which represent hundreds of thousands of UK firms, said that because of a lack of progress, the government ""is understandably now in a place where it must step up no-deal planning"". But they say: ""It is clear there is simply not enough time to prevent severe dislocation and disruption in just 100 days. ""This is not where we should be."" The business groups said that instead of investing money and boosting productivity, companies were now having to divert capital for no-deal contingency planning. They also warned: ""There are also hundreds of thousands who have yet to start - and cannot be expected to be ready in such a short space of time."" What is the government spending on Brexit preparations? All you need to know about the backstop Is the NHS finding it hard to get medicines? Some companies told BBC News that they had already taken steps to invest in EU countries because of the uncertainty. Ian McCartney, director of strategy at Wilson Tool, which has opened a branch in Germany, said: ""It's hard to believe in business how messy it is in politics. There's absolutely zero certainty in Westminster."" March is too late for a deal, says sports clothing exporter Shaun Loughlin Sports clothing exporter FreestyleXtreme has opened an office in Romania and is planning to open a warehouse in Germany. Managing director Shaun Loughlin said businesses needed to know there would be a deal ""tomorrow"", not in March. ""This is the last chance, there is not going to be another chance. Once we move, we've moved, we won't be coming back,"" he said. A spokesman for the prime minister said that with just over three months until the UK leaves the European Union, ""we have now reached the point where we need to ramp up these preparations"". Businesses should also be prepared, ""enacting their own no-deal plans as they judge necessary"". The European Commission is publishing the legislation needed to ensure continuity in eight sectors on a temporary basis. Those areas cover data protection, plant and animal health, customs, climate policy, some narrow financial products and the rights of British people living in the European Union. If there is no Brexit deal, these will apply from 29 March until the end of 2019 at the latest. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March after a referendum in 2016. It and the EU have agreed a withdrawal agreement - or ""divorce deal"" - and a political declaration outlining ambition for future talks - but it needs to be agreed by Parliament for it to come into force. A vote by MPs on the deal had been scheduled for 11 December, but Mrs May postponed it until January after it was clear her deal would be rejected, leading to widespread anger in the Commons.

"There is still too much salt in processed meats such as sausages and bacon and ready meals, a Public Health England report suggests. The groups of foods were among those that met none of the average salt targets set by PHE in 2014. But some other foods, including breakfast cereals, baked beans and pizzas, did meet the voluntary targets. The meat industry insisted it was ""playing its part"" in reducing salt in its products. Too much salt can raise your blood pressure, which puts you at increased risk of heart disease and stroke. Most of the salt we eat is already in everyday foods, rather than added at the table. Salt consumption down - but not enough Meat substitutes 'exceeding salt limits' Retailers, manufacturers and restaurants, cafes and pub chains were all asked to meet average and maximum levels of salt per 100g (3.5oz) by 2017 across 28 food categories. PHE found: Meat products - which include items that have been processed with salt but not things such as chicken breast or steak - met none of the average targets and 43% of items contained more than the maximum salt levels Ready meals, soups, biscuits, rice, other cereals and meat alternatives, such as veggie burgers and sausages, also did not meet any of the average targets Breakfast cereals, fat spreads, baked beans, pizzas, cakes, pastries, fruit pies and other pastry-based desserts, pasta, quiche, processed potato products, stocks and gravies did meet the average targets Across all categories, average salt level targets were met for about half of foods consumed in the home in 2017. PHE said ""clear progress"" had been made since work began to reduce salt intakes in 2004 but that further ""realistic but ambitious goals"" were needed. Dr Alison Tedstone, chief nutritionist at PHE, said: ""While we have seen some progress, those that have taken little or no action cannot be excused for their inactivity. ""It is clear that, with the right leadership from industry, further salt reduction in foods continues to be possible."" The foods covered by the targets are the main contributors to dietary salt intakes in adults in the UK and provide about 54% of salt in the diet. Overall, 81% of products consumed in the home had sodium levels at or below their maximum target level. For food eaten out of the home, 71% of products were below maximum target levels. According to the most recent data available, adults in England consume about 8g per day of salt - nearly a gram less than in 2005-06. PHE estimates that bringing that figure down to 6g a day could help to prevent thousands of avoidable deaths. Prof Graham MacGregor, who chairs the campaign group Action on Salt, criticised the level of salt reduction achieved. He said: ""Such poor progress in PHE's attempt to reduce salt intake is a national tragedy. ""This report confirms what we know already - that voluntary targets need comprehensive monitoring and guidance but this has been completely lacking from PHE.""

"If you are on a first date, listen very closely to the sound of your partner's voice because it might reveal if they fancy you, according to researchers. It's not about what your date is saying, but the pitch of their voice. If they lower their pitch, it could be a subtle, subconscious sign they find you attractive, the study, inThe Royal Society Proceedings B,externaljournal, suggests. Experts say it is probably an evolutionary tool to attract a mate. The researchers listened in on 30 speed-daters meeting at a cafe. Each date lasted six minutes, with the men rotating around the tables until they had dated all of the women in the room. Between each interaction, the men and women indicated their preference for the person the had just met - whether they liked them and would want to meet again - marking a ""Yes"" or ""No"" next to the date's name. When the researchers listened back to the conversations, they found that men and women tended to adopt a slightly lower voice during the dates with a partner they fancied. Men also spoke at a lower pitch with women who had received lots of ""Yes"" responses from the other men in the dating room, even if they rated her with a ""No"" themselves. Women, by contrast, lowered their voices only for men they both found attractive themselves and who had been rated highly by the other women in the room too. It'snot the only study,externalto find this phenomenon but it is the first in a real-life setting, says lead researcher Katarzyna Pisanski from the University of Sussex School of Psychology. And although it didn't include a large number of people, the hundreds of dates observed between the participants provided enough data to give a significant result. ""I was a little bit surprised that women also lowered their pitch if they liked a man,"" she said. ""Quite a few studies have shown men tend to favour a higher pitch in women because it is feminine and youthful, while women tend to like men to have deeper voices that are seen as more masculine and linked to testosterone."" Research suggests,externalwomen today speak at a deeper pitch than their mothers or grandmothers. For that work, Cecilia Pemberton, at the University of South Australia, compared archival recordings of women talking in 1945 with recordings taken in the early 1990s. Dr Pisanski said: ""Perhaps things are changing and women are trying to portray other values when they use a lower pitch. ""It might communicate competence, maturity or even dominance."" Lower, quieter speech might also be more intimate. Dr George Fieldman, an evolutionary psychologist and member of the British Psychological Society, said it was possible the competitive situation of speed-dating might have made the women adopt a more dominant pitch of voice to attract a mate. ""If they were on their own with a man, then perhaps they would use a higher pitch,"" he said. ""But when they are in a group situation competing against other women, they might want to keep their pitch lower. It is more discreet. That's my hunch.""

"Allegations thatresearch firm Cambridge Analytica misused the data of 50 million peoplehas thrust the issue of data privacy into the spotlight. A huge amount of consumer data is available and - if obtained - is a valuable asset for companies. And customer loyalty cards, while rewarding shoppers with discounts and deals, are one easy way for companies to collect data on a large scale. After the launch of Tesco Clubcard in 1995, many stores have followed suit. Sainsbury's, Waitrose, Co-op, Morrisons, Iceland, Boots and Marks and Spencer are among the retailers which currently offer reward schemes to shoppers. The average UK shopper owns three loyalty cards, according to research by retail analysts TCC Global. But how exactly do retailers use the data provided by the cards in your wallet and should you be concerned? It is well-known that companies use loyalty card data to understand shoppers' habits. This is not new, and many customers understand this is a core part of the reward card relationship. Loyalty card data helps retailers understand people's behaviour and then shape it by targeting advertising and organising products to encourage more sales. In order to get a loyalty card, customers have to register their name, address and date of birth - and sometimes other information. Scanning the reward card at a shop checkout or entering the card number while shopping online allows companies to track purchases and make a link between people shopping in store and on the web. It means retailers can create an accurate picture of when, where and how people do their shopping. Retailers can enrich the data they have collected from reward cards by buying customer data from third-party companies, known as data brokers. These third-party companies amass information from a variety of sources to create ""profiles"" of people with information about habits, patterns and personality. Retailers can then match their loyalty card data to these profiles, producing a clearer picture of shoppers. All organisations processing personal data must comply with data protection law and each company has a data privacy policy. ""This will include details of what data they can collect, how it can be used, and whether (as well as to whom) the data can be sold on,"" Dr Garfield Benjamin from the University of Birmingham's centre for Cyber Security and Privacy explained. ""There is an increasing need for greater transparency in this process - we all click 'agree' to lengthy and often confusing terms and conditions without necessarily being able to understand them."" Although stores will often not pass loyalty scheme data to other parties, they may share customers' information with companies within the same group, which can be global. Some companies may also share the information with their retail partners, who can use it to target their advertising. Nectar, for example, can share data with at least 49 companies including Argos and Easyjet, according to consumer group Which? Data protection law is changing from May, when the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)comes into force- changing the way organisations have to look after our personal data. Campaign group Privacy International said it is concerned about the ""hidden data infrastructure"". ""Loyalty cards are not a new thing, but the volume of data available to advertisers and companies... combined with the bloated nature of companies vying for access to data is resulting in essentially the mass exploitation of people's data,"" the privacy organisation said. It said retailers and third-party companies ""hoover up information from a variety of sources"" to create profiles, wanting to ""know you better than you know yourself"". ""This picture of who you are, what your motivations are, who you want to become, can all be used to nudge you to purchase something or even behave in a certain way."" But Prof Paul Longley, who is one of a group of academics working at the Consumer Data Research Centre, said the so-called ""big data"" can ""definitely be used for the social good"". ""We hear a lot about invasion of individual privacy and people being manipulated by such sources. But new big data sources can be used for the benefit of all,"" he said. ""So, for example, we may use smart meter energy data to enable analysis of fuel poverty, or loyalty card data or smart card data to look at how mobile people are around the country.""

"Theresa May met the Scottish and Welsh first ministers at Downing Street Prime Minister Theresa May has urged the first ministers of Scotland and Wales to back her Brexit deal. At a Downing Street summit, the leaders of the devolved administrations discussed the UK's impending exit from the European Union. Mrs May said her plan ""delivers for the whole of the UK"", urging others to ""pull together"" behind it. But Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said MPs should study other plans, such as a new Brexit referendum. Members in both the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly have overwhelmingly voted against Mrs May's deal. MPs are set to hold their ""meaningful"" vote on the withdrawal agreement, hammered out with European negotiators, in January 2019. MSPs vote to reject draft Brexit deal Welsh Assembly rejects PM's Brexit deal Ministers from around the UK gathered for the meeting in London on Wednesday afternoon, with Brexit high on the agenda. Mrs May and a team of her ministers were joined by Ms Sturgeon and the newly appointed Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford. There was also discussion of immigration after the governmentpublished a White Paper of its plansfor rules after the UK leaves the EU. Nicola Sturgeon believes Mrs May should look at other options, including a second EU referendum Mrs May has been facing a battle to win support for her Brexit plans, with critics on her own back benches as well as across the opposition. The prime minister said she was ""confident that what we have agreed delivers for the whole of the UK"". She said: ""This deal honours the result of the referendum - taking back control of our money, laws and borders, protecting jobs and livelihoods, and freeing the UK to strike new trade deals with countries around the world. ""That's why it is more important than ever that the devolved administrations get behind this deal and listen to businesses and industry bodies across all four nations who have been clear that it provides the certainty they need."" Following the meeting, Ms Sturgeon said SNP MPs would not be voting for Mrs May's deal, and called on the prime minister to extend the current Brexit deadline of 29 March. She said: ""We have argued that Article 50 should be extended, so that no-deal is absolutely taken off the table and that time is then given for parliament to look at the alternatives to the deal. ""Our preference of course is for another EU referendum, to give people across the UK the opportunity, knowing what they now know after the last two and a half years, to change their minds."" The UK government has set out new proposals for how immigration will be handled post-Brexit Ms Sturgeon also said she had made her views about immigration ""very clear to the prime minister"" at the meeting. She said: ""This paper says that the proposals would reduce EU migration into Scotland by 85%. So it would be devastating for jobs, the economy, for living standards, the income of the country, and it would also deprive us of people who make a big and positive contribution to life in Scotland."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid has argued that the new system would be based on the skills, rather than origin, of migrants and show the UK was ""open for business"". Mr Javid said the plans did not include a ""specific target"" for reducing numbers coming into the UK but would bring net migration down to ""sustainable levels"". Meanwhile, the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Greens tabled a vote of no confidence in the UK government following a meeting on Tuesday evening. The parties want the government to debate the motion before parliament rises for the Christmas recess, but it is thought the government is only obliged to give time to motions tabled in the name of the Leader of the Opposition - Labour's Jeremy Corbyn - who has so far failed to do so. And Chancellor Phillip Hammond has confirmed the Scottish government will be allocated Â£55m for Brexit preparations in 2019/20, as part of its Â£2bn spend. The Welsh Government will receive Â£31m while the Northern Ireland Executive will be granted Â£20m.

"The insurance industry has pledged to crack down on ""excessive"" differences in premiums for new customers and existing policyholders. The plan aims to iron out some of the controversial big differences between premiums for new and existing clients. The move follows new rules that force firms to display the previous year's premium on renewal notices. The new guidelines apply to home, motor and travel insurance, but not pet or health cover. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) and the British Insurance Brokers' Association (BIBA) say their Guiding Principles and Action Points should mean ""an improvement in the outcomes for long-standing customers"". The new commitments by ABI and BIBA members include: Not supporting excessive differences between new customer premiums and subsequent renewal premiums that unfairly penalise long-standing customers Members will take action so that customers' tendency to shop around at renewal is not used to lead to excessive pricing differences that unfairly penalise long-standing customers. Firms should make clear in written, online or verbal customer communications that the new customer premium only applies for that year and subsequent renewal premiums may be higher. ABI chairman Andy Briggs said insurers did a ""great job"" for their customers, ""but the renewal market simply doesn't work where loyal customers get charged much more than new customers"". ""Given many consumers expect to get cheaper insurance when they shop around, there is no easy solution,"" he added. ""These new guiding principles and action points are a positive initiative by the ABI and BIBA members to demonstrate that the whole industry recognise this is an important issue that needs to be addressed."" Gareth Shaw of Which? said: ""A review of the unfair practice that sees existing customers charged excessively steeper premiums than new customers is long overdue. We regularly hear from consumers who are paying hundreds of pounds more a year than new customers because they've automatically renewed their cover. ""Insurers must now act with urgency and implement much-needed changes to ensure their customers aren't excessively penalised simply for their loyalty."" Insurers are finally owning up to what customers have been complaining about for years: the more loyal they are, the more they seem to pay. The extra cost can amount to hundreds of pounds a year on a policy. People selling insurance have become addicted to the ruse of offering big discounts to new buyers to keep business moving. If you don't bother to shop around, you end up footing the bill. The problem with today's plan is that it will be left up to individual insurers to decide which prices are excessive and how to narrow the gap. Customers will still need to check what they are paying to make sure they aren't being taken for a ride. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said its research had found that long-standing home insurance customers could pay an average of Â£110 more a year than new customers. The new plan showed the industry ""recognises the scale of this problem and is willing to act responsibly to stop consumers being penalised for their loyalty"", she added. ""The devil, however, will be in the detail - whether this is successful will depend on prices actually coming down for loyal customers,"" she added. ""The industry should also work with the Financial Conduct Authority to collect better data on the scale of this loyalty penalty. Then we can assess whether this unfair practice is being tackled effectively.""
