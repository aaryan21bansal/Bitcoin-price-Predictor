"UK-based Ryanair pilots have voted to strike in a row over pay and conditions. The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) has announced two walkouts, one from 22-23 August, while the second strike will be from 2-4 September. It said pilots did not want to disrupt people's travel plans but felt they had no choice after ""decades of Ryanair refusing to deal with unions"". But the airline said the ""ill-timed"" strikes would endanger pilot jobs. It comes days after the budget airline warned of job lossesfollowing a 21% fall in quarterly profits, due to higher costs for fuel and staff, and reduced ticket prices. Balpa said its members have many disagreements with the airline, including over pensions, loss of licence insurance, maternity benefits, allowances and pay structure. ""We have had no formal offer from Ryanair and it is imperative that we resolve this dispute urgently to avoid strike action,"" said Balpa's general secretary Brian Strutton. ""No pilot wants to spoil the public's travel plans but at the moment it seems we have no choice."" The union said 72% of its members at the company had taken part in the ballot with 80% of those supporting strike action. However, Ryanair said that fewer than 50% of Ryanair's UK pilots were members of Balpa, and of these, just 57% voted in favour of industrial action. In a letter to Balpa, Ryanair's director of HR strategy and operations Darrell Hughes said senior captains were paid up to Â£180,000 per annum and, because of this, pilot turnover had fallen to zero ""in recent months"". He said: ""At this difficult time for UK pilots facing base cuts and closures, Balpa should be working with Ryanair to save UK pilot jobs, not endanger them through ill-timed and ill-judged disruption of our customers' travel plans, just 10 weeks before the threat of a no-deal Brexit. We remain available for talks at your convenience."" On 31 July, Ryanair bossMichael O'Leary warned staff in a video message to prepare for job cutsin the coming weeks, saying the airline has 900 too many pilots and cabin crew members. He said the two weakest markets were Germany, where Ryanair faced fierce competition on price, and the UK, where there were Brexit uncertainties. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary speaks in a video to staff ""It's been a challenging summer, we're facing into a very difficult winter,"" he said in the video, seen by the BBC. ""I'm sorry to advise you that this means we need to cut our aircraft numbers and our staffing, not just for summer 2020 but also in winter 2019. ""This will result in some base cuts, some base closures, and I'm very sorry to say, some job losses this winter for pilots and cabin crew, at the end of our summer schedule in September and October, and also some immediately after Christmas."" Mr O'Leary blamed planned cuts to flights next summer due to the grounding of its Boeing 737 Max fleet. The 737 Max is grounded worldwide over concerns with its software following two deadly crashes. Mr O'Leary said it been a big factor in the cuts, having delayed the delivery of some 28 planes and having forced the airline to cut flights and close bases. Mr O'Leary also blamed the ""increasing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit in just 12 weeks' time"". ""We're worried this could have quite a damaging effect, particularly on our UK bases and on some of our Irish bases, which are heavily dependent on people travelling between Ireland and the UK,"" he added.

"This video can not be played 'My boyfriend bought me knives' Knife possession offences involving women in England have increased steeply since 2014 - rising by at least 10% every year, police figures show. Some 1,509 offences were recorded in 2018 - an increase of 73% over the last five years - data obtained following freedom of information requests shows. Youth workers say some women carry weapons for gangs as they are less likely to be stopped by police. The Home Office said it funds schemes to help gang-affected women and girls. Figures for England show that between 2014 and 2018 there were more than 5,800 recorded knife possession crimes involving women. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Are more teenagers carrying knives? 'Thousands' of 14-year-olds carry knives The BBC contacted the four police forces in Wales but the figures are incomplete. Police Scotland and Police Northern Ireland figures were unavailable. It comes against a backdrop of rising knife crime nationally and after the number of fatal stabbings in England and Wales was last year thehighest number since records began. Some 1,509 knife possession offences involving women were recorded in 2018 West Midlands Police found a gun, bullets and a knife in a designer handbag after searching a car Data from 38 forces out of 39 in England shows almost a quarter of recorded offences involved girls under the age of 18 - with the youngest aged seven. While London's Metropolitan Police saw the highest number of possession cases involving women, parts of northern England have seen female knife possession crimes increase at a faster rate. London's Metropolitan Police recorded a 52% increase over five years, with a total of 916 recorded offences from 2014 to 2018. During the same time, Merseyside Police saw a 54% rise, to 499 offences, while the number of offences in Greater Manchester doubled, with 95 recorded offences last year. In South Yorkshire there was an 82% rise over five years - with 248 offences involving women. Theresa John regularly carried a knife for 12 years. She said it ""became part of my identity"" on the streets in Essex. ""I used to name my knives. When I was 16 I had one that was like a flick Stanley blade and I used to call it Uncle Stan. Fatal stabbings at record high Who are the first 100 stabbing victims of 2019? ""If anyone asked me 'have you got Unc on you', I'd be like 'yeah'. That was my pet until I was 21."" After a chaotic and difficult childhood, Theresa's life spiralled out of control. In her early 20s she became addicted to heroin and crack cocaine and worked as a prostitute to fund her addiction. Theresa says she regularly carried a knife for 12 years ""I'd either have a knife or a pair of scissors because when I was out working on the streets. There would be different guys who would force you to do stuff. ""I stayed in this lifestyle of crime and madness and just brokenness. I was in a very abusive relationship to the point that my kids were taken into care and at that point I just lost all hope. ""I started taking heroin, I was out on the streets working in prostitution. I used to get in a lot of fights - there was a lot of violence."" One night, the scissors were used as a weapon on her and a man stabbed her in the back of the head. And in 2012, Theresa stabbed her next door neighbour and was sentenced to 10 months in prison for actual bodily harm and possession of a knife. Now 35 years old, she says: ""It was like this mist came over me and I charged at her with the knife, and just stabbed her straight in the top of her head."" Jennifer Blake is a former gang leader from Peckham, in south London, who now works as a community support worker and independent gangs consultant. ""For some women it's a normal thing to have in your bag, like lipstick,"" she says. ""We have got girls that stab, but it's just like the elephant in the room. No-one wants to talk about it because no one knows how to deal with it. ""Everywhere you go you have problems with girls and their identity, their self-worth and those are the vulnerable ones that boys end up picking up."" She says some girls and women from broken homes see street gangs as their family and will do anything to fit it. ""Knife, guns, drugs - they are the couriers for it. They're not going to get stopped by police, and the men know that."" The Home Office said it was investing Â£220m into steering both young men and young women away from violent crime. For female offenders specifically, it supports and funds young people's advocates who work with gang-affected young women and girls in London, Manchester and the West Midlands. A spokesman added: ""We recently announced plans to recruit 20,000 more police officers and empower them to use fair and intelligence-led stop and search, to prevent more young people falling victim to knife crime."" Earlier this year South Yorkshire Police was one of seven forces to receive extra Home Office funding to tackle violent crime. The force's assistant chief constable, Tim Forber, said while knife crime is still predominately a male problem, it is increasingly about ""vulnerability"" rather than gender. ""It's a very small proportion [of women] but it's a worrying proportion - we don't want to see any young people, any women carrying knives in society. ""I don't think it's any more nuanced, than it is for men, it's about vulnerable young people getting drawn into the fringes of organised crime.""

"The team named their grain spirit Atomik ""It's the only bottle in existence - I tremble when I pick it up,"" says Prof Jim Smith, gingerly lifting a bottle of Atomik grain spirit. The ""artisan vodka"", made with grain and water from the Chernobyl exclusion zone, is the first consumer product to come from the abandoned area around the damaged nuclear power plant. The team started the vodka project by growing crops on a farm in the zone. ""Our idea then was [to use that rye grain] to make a spirit,"" they say. The land around the nuclear power plant has been abandoned since the 1986 accident As well as Prof Smith, who is based at the University of Portsmouth, UK, the team behind the spirit is made up of researchers who have worked in the exclusion zone for many years - studying how the land has recovered since the catastrophic nuclear accident in 1986. They hope to use profits from selling it to help communities in Ukraine still affected by the economic impact of the disaster. Chernobyl: The end of a three-decade experiment Hidden lives of Chernobyl's wildlife The people who moved to Chernobyl The team at Bar Swift in Soho, London make the first Atomik martini ""This is no more radioactive than any other vodka,"" says Prof Smith. ""Any chemist will tell you, when you distil something, impurities stay in the waste product. ""So we took rye that was slightly contaminated and water from the Chernobyl aquifer and we distilled it. ""We asked our friends at Southampton University, who have an amazing radio-analytical laboratory, to see if they could find any radioactivity. ""They couldn't find anything - everything was below their limit of detection."" The rye grain grown in the Chernobyl exclusion zone was ""slightly contaminated"" Dr Gennady Laptev, a scientist based at the Ukrainian Hydrometeorological Institute, in Kiev, is also a founding member of the newly created Chernobyl Spirit Company. Speaking to me during a trip to the exclusion zone, where I was following the team as they carried out their environmental research andcrop-growing studies,external, he explained that the rye grain and the resulting spirit show how some of the land could be used productively. ""We don't have to just abandon the land,"" he says. ""We can use it in diverse ways and we can produce something that will be totally clean from the radioactivity."" In part, because a clean, distilled product can be made from contaminated grain. But, according to Prof Smith, this project aims to go beyond making booze with a unique selling point. He hopes the sale of the vodka could provide support to communities around the exclusion zone. Communities around the exclusion zone, such as the town of Narodichi, still struggle with the economic aftermath of the accident In his work in Chernobyl since the 1990s, Prof Smith says he has been struck by how the economic conditions for people in Ukraine have remained stubbornly difficult, while the landscape has slowly recovered. ""There are radiation hotspots [in the exclusion zone] but for the most part contamination is lower than you'd find in other parts of the world with relatively high natural background radiation,"" he says. ""The problem for most people who live there is they don't have the proper diet, good health services, jobs or investment."" The aim of selling Chernobyl artisan vodka and hopefully making a profit, he says, is to enable the team to distribute most of the money to local communities. The rest will be reinvested in the business, although Prof Smith hopes to provide the team with an income to work on their ""social spirit enterprise"" part time. ""Because now,"" Prof Smith adds, ""after 30 years, I think the most important thing in the area is actually economic development, not the radioactivity."" This video can not be played Chernobyl's post-human landscape With the help of the expert team at a cocktail bar in London, I later compare Atomik with a house vodka. ""It's more of a grain spirit than a vodka, so it has much more fruity notes - you can still taste the rye,"" says Sam Armeye, from Bar Swift, in Soho. So what cocktail would Sam make from it? ""Definitely a classic martini but I'd also mix it with champagne,"" he says. With only one bottle produced so far, it will be a while before Atomik martinis are available - but Prof Smith and the team hope to produce 500 bottles this year, selling it initially to the increasing number of tourists who now visit the exclusion zone.

"This video can not be played Whaley Bridge evacuation ""like a disaster movie"" Hundreds of Whaley Bridge residents have been told they can return home, nearly a week after fears over a damaged dam saw them evacuated. About 1,500 residents were removed from their homes on Thursday after the dam at Toddbrook Reservoir was damaged during heavy rain. Emergency services worked to repair the dam wall and lower water to safe levels to allow people to return. Derbyshire Police said it had been an ""unprecedented crisis"". But the immediate danger posed to Whaley Bridge and areas downstream in the Goyt Valley has now passed, according to the force. Cordons on roads into Whaley Bridge were lifted on Wednesday Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Swann said at 13:00 BST on Wednesday the evacuation order for Whaley Bridge and surrounding areas had been lifted. The danger posed by the dam ""which would have destroyed homes and livelihoods, could not be underestimated"", she added. Prime MinisterBoris Johnson tweeted,externalhe was ""pleased to hear"" residents were returning and paid tribute to their ""spirit and patience"". The first person to walk through the cordon, Liz McCann, said: ""We're home. That's what we wanted. We're all safe and we're all together so there's not a problem."" Malcolm Swets wrote a message outside his shop to thank everyone who ""saved Whaley"" The BBC's North of England correspondent Danny Savage said the evacuation ""has taken an emotional toll"" on residents. ""At least two people I talked to were in tears,"" he said. Phil Sharples returns to his house in Whaley Bridge Jennifer Grant, landlady at The Goyt Inn, said she was ""relieved and pleased"" to have been allowed home. ""Thursday seems like a long time ago,"" she said. ""It'll be good to catch up with everyone and hear their stories. We all survived.""

She said: ""I was desperate to get my hair cut because I'm going to a wedding on Saturday and I didn't know where I would go if I didn't come back here. ""So as soon as I realised it was open, I contacted [the hairdresser] and he agreed to come down."" This video can not be played Whaley Bridge bakers: ""It's been emotional, everyone's crying"" Another resident, Bernie Sharples said: ""It's been an upsetting time but it's absolutely fantastic [to be back] - all the authorities, the police, all who helped get us back here - a big thank you to everybody."" Margot Graham, who spoke to the BBC during the emergency when she was briefly allowed back to her house, was in tears as she returned permanently. ""It's very, very emotional. It's an emotion I didn't expect to experience at all,"" she said. Karen Edleston headed straight for a haircut after returning to Whaley Bridge Camilla Dignan, of The Bridge Bakehouse, aims to open on Thursday despite having had to throw most of her existing stock away. She said: ""We got the call [last] Thursday and it was literally just leave it, so it's a bit of a nightmare but we are glad to be back."" Fifty-five households in Horwich End were allowed to return on Tuesday by police after a public meeting. The force and other agencies will help the remaining residents return to their homes on Wednesday, with police staying in the area over the next week ""to help the community and address any concerns"". This video can not be played Whaley Bridge: How events unfolded The Environment Agency (EA) has confirmed measures in place at the dam mean emergency services ""will be able to manage the levels of rain forecast"". But it said further inspections will take place as there is still ""significant"" work to be done to bring the dam to a condition where ""long-term safety can be assured"". Malcolm Swets, manager of Goyt Wines, said he wanted to thank everyone involved in the emergency effort for the ""professional way"" they had gone about their business. He said: ""Everyone's had their problems during the disruption but at the end of the day everybody's safe and nobody got hurt."" Volunteers have set up a hub in the local primary school, offering household necessities, toiletries and snacks. Environment Agency officials are also there to answer questions about work in the area.

Angelica CasasBBC News, El Paso, Texas Political discourse is the last
thing on the minds of most El Pasoans right now. The communityâs loss is a
personal one, and theyâre still trying to resolve how to heal. But President Trumpâs arrival
months after he held a rally in the city, does ignite fear. Local immigration
lawyer Christina Garcia says the rally he held in February left residents
shaken by the arrival of anti-immigrant, Trump supporters. A visit from President Trump
could just add fuel to the fire in an already heartbroken city. As the president makes his way to visit victims, first responders and families in El Paso, US immigration authorities have announced one of the largest Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in years. The raids at food plants in Mississippi saw over 600 mostly Latino workers arrested, local media say. The gunman in El Paso is believed to have carried out the attack that left 22 dead to combat a ""Hispanic invasion"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

His father Gilbert, he added, is a Mexican American who is proud of his roots and has always said America is the greatest nation on earth.

"One source told Newsnight the culling of cattle could start within weeks of a no-deal Brexit Some 45,000 dairy cows could be culled in Northern Ireland, in the event of a no-deal Brexit if new higher tariffs are applied to British milk, senior industry figures have warned. Northern Ireland is particularly vulnerable because about a third of its dairy output is processed in the Republic of Ireland, which would continue to be part of the EU. The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October and one source said the culling of cattle could start within weeks of that date if that happened without the UK and EU agreeing a deal. BBC Newsnighthas been told that officials and ministers from the Department for the Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (Defra), have been warned about the potential for a ""major cull of dairy cattle, but they are not listening"". In a statement Defra said: ""A widespread cull of livestock is absolutely not something that the government anticipates nor is planning for in the event of no-deal. ""We will always back Britain and Northern Ireland's great farmers and make sure that Brexit works for them. ""The government is boosting its preparations to ensure we are fully prepared to leave the EU on 31 October, whatever the circumstances."" 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Food firms want laws relaxed in event of no-deal Gove: EU 'refusing to negotiate' on Brexit But another industry insider told Newsnight that despite their warnings there had been a ""metaphorical shrug of the shoulders from ministers"". It comes after reports on Monday that the prime minister's de facto chief of staff, Dominic Cummings had said all government departments should be""interrogated"" on Brexit planning,externaland raise any issues with No 10 as soon as possible. There are approximately 310,700 dairy cattle in Northern Ireland, and the industry exports between 700 and 800 million litres of milk to the Republic of Ireland each year. At present the average trade price of a litre of British milk is 26p. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, where 19p tariffs could be applied, that price would be pushed up to 45p in the Republic. However, the concerns are not solely based on the introduction of tariffs, which would make British milk expensive. Customs checks and paperwork relating to traceability and standards could add further complications, and crucially it may no longer be legal to mix milk from the north and south. The fear among producers in Northern Ireland is that, if no agreement is reached and traditional trading relationships with the south become difficult, the country will be left with a glut of milk that it will not be able to process or sell. An industry insider said: ""Dairy herds have to be milked, it's not like you can leave the milk in the cows they would bloat up and ultimately die. ""If there is no market, and farmers cannot sell their milk, they could only keep going for a very short period. ""We're talking about hundreds of thousands of litres of milk going to waste, and then the farmers would have no choice but to reduce their herds."" Industry insiders say they arrived at the figure having considered Northern Irish processing plants maximising their output and some milk being sent to other parts of the UK. Dairy farmers in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK could face a further threat if current government plans to apply a 0% tariff on dairy imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit allow foreign milk to enter the UK market at a comparative advantage. Michael Bell, executive director of Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association (NIFDA), said: ""The impact of a no-deal Brexit on food and drink - Northern Ireland's largest industrial sector - will potentially be very severe. ""Given our reliance on EU exports, and the fact that the agri-food sector on the island of Ireland is highly integrated, leaving the European Union without a deal would leave us uniquely exposed. ""Locally, thelack of a Northern Ireland executiveat a time of immense uncertainty for the industry is a major problem. ""The Northern Ireland food industry and the economy as a whole is potentially facing unprecedented difficulty, yet we remain without ministers able to take important decisions and fight our corner. ""I would strongly urge the UK government, and our local politicians, to work together to avoid a no-deal at all costs, before it is too late."" 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Food firms want laws relaxed in event of no-deal What would change with a no-deal Brexit?

"The government is assuming that French preparations for customs and regulatory checks have markedly decreased the anticipated trade disruption from a no-deal Brexit, the BBC has learned. ""Reasonable worst case scenarios"" still anticipate long disruption to about half the freight crossing the Channel. But the assumption, the basis for a lot of the government's no-deal planning, has been upgraded twice recently. The scenarios were told to industry, but kept secret from the public. Last year the government's original ""reasonable worst case scenario"" for no deal was that for three to six months, 75-87% of ""flow"" across the ""short straits"" would be interrupted and forced to join queues on motorways approaching the Channel Tunnel and ports. That assessment assumed that French authorities would check every lorry coming into its country manually. As there had been no talks between authorities, UK officials had to use satellite photographs to estimate the potential for holding and processing facilities around French ports. Brexit: Two can play that game theory What happened to post-Brexit free-trade nirvana? In April this secret assessment, shared with industry via non-disclosure agreements, was improved to 50-70% of freight stopped. This was principally because of the new preparations made on the French side of the border. For example, the Eurotunnel facility for UK freight can check nine lorries at the same time and provides parking for 100 vehicles. In the past few days, the possible disruption to trade flow in the ""short straits"" has been further downgraded to 40-60% of traffic. Better than it was, but still meaning thousands of lorries stuck on motorways in Kent and around Calais, blocking and delaying crucial trade. Even at this improved rate of flow, the available spaces for emergency lorry parking on the M20 and at disused airfields, would fill up over a fortnight, better than the two or three days assumed last year. It is understood that even if the flow rate was 80%, much higher than currently assumed, medicine suppliers say they would require access to emergency freight provision currently being sought by the government again. In reply, a government spokesperson said: ""We are pushing on with all preparations for a no-deal scenario. There are already well-developed plans in place to manage any traffic disruptions in Kent."" Brexit: Two can play that game theory What happened to post-Brexit free-trade nirvana?

"This video can not be played Dash-cam footage showed drivers swerving to avoid William McLean on the East Kilbride Expressway A man has admitted killing a motorcyclist after taking cocaine and driving the wrong way down a South Lanarkshire road. A court heard William McLean, 35, consumed five lines of the drug hours before driving on the East Kilbride Expressway in Blantyre, on 10 November last year. He struck student Allan Nicholson, 24, who died at the scene. A judge at Glasgow's High Court said a jail sentence was almost certain. The court heard McLean, from Cathkin, Glasgowdrove at excessive speed and repeatedly drove into the path of oncoming vehiclesfrom Motherwell Road in Bellshill to the A725 East Kilbride Expressway at Blantyre near the Raith Interchange.. Five drivers were forced to swerve to avoid crashing into him before the fatal collision at 06:40. William McLean struck Allan Nicholson head on after driving the wrong way down the East Kilbride Expressway Prosecutor Alex Prentice QC said Mr Nicholson was studying civil engineering and had left his girlfriend's house that morning to go to work. He said: ""Due to the impact Mr Nicholson was thrown from the motorcycle, landing on the carriageway as the motorbike burst into flames."" McLean's car stopped on the grass verge where motorists heard him say ""What have I done?"" Allan Nicholson died in the crash He fled across the southbound carriageway and attempted to climb a wall, however witnesses chased and detained him until police arrived. Officers asked him who the driver of the Mondeo was and McLean told them ""It was myself."" McLean pled guilty to causing death by dangerous driving. McLean's Ford Mondeo following the crash Defence QC Tony Graham told the court he had been instructed to ""publicly apologise"" to the family and friends of Mr Nicholson. He said: ""Mr McLean's actions that night caused the destruction of a life, but for these actions Mr Nicholson would be enjoying his life today."" Judge Lord Brodie granted McLean bail, but told him: ""The offence to which you pled can only be dealt with properly with the imposition of a custodial sentence."" McLean, who worked as a warehouse manager, had a clean driving licence and one previous conviction from November 2010 for failing to wear a seat belt for which he was fined Â£90. He was banned from driving and will be sentenced on 27 August at the High Court in Edinburgh.

"This video can not be played Richard Leonard: ""I am clear that the Labour Party's position at the moment is opposition to a second independence referendum."" The Scottish Labour leader has hit back at suggestions from shadow chancellor John McDonnell that the party would not oppose an independence referendum. Richard Leonard said he had made clear to Mr McDonnell that there is ""no case"" for a second referendum. He also claimed that the majority of people in Scotland were still opposed to one being held. Mr McDonnell has said a Labour government would not block any request from Holyrood to hold a vote. His comments - which have been heavily criticised by several senior Scottish Labour figures - contradict the party's general election manifesto pledge to rule out a referendum, as well as previous public statements by Mr Leonard. Labour government 'would not block' indyref2 Sturgeon points to 'growing urgency' for independence Mr Leonard told BBC Scotland that Labour's official policy is still to oppose a referendum. He said he had spoken to Mr McDonnell to ""put to him the very clear view that the people of Scotland do not want a second independence referendum and also to remind him that the last independence referendum was supposed to be once in a generation"". Mr Leonard added: ""I was elected 18 months ago directly by the members of the Scottish Labour Party, and one of the parts of the platform I stood on was clear opposition to a second independence referendum. ""So I think it's pretty clear where I stand, it's pretty clear where the membership of the Scottish Labour Party stand and that's the view that we'll be communicating. ""We will be doing everything we can do to make sure it is in the Labour manifesto for the general election, whenever it comes"". Mr Leonard is traditionally seen as a close ally of UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn He also said that, should Labour win a general election, Mr McDonnell would have more pressing priorities to deal with as Chancellor than an independence referendum - such as ""resolving austerity, investing in public services and trying to tackle whatever situation we find ourselves in with Brexit"". An opinion pollpublished on Mondayput support for independence at 52% in Scotland - with 48% opposed - once those who do not know how they would vote were excluded. But Mr Leonard said his stance on a second referendum would only change if the will of the Scottish people was shown to be ""demonstrably"" different from 2014, when voters rejected independence by 55% to 45%. It comes amid speculation that Labour and the SNP are moving towards some form of agreement that would see the parties join forces at Westminster in an attempt to remove Boris Johnson from Downing Street and force a general election. Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdalepredicted in Junethat Mr Corbyn would agree to hold an independence referendum if he needed SNP support to form a government. And Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister and the SNP leader, told the Guardian on Tuesday that her party would ""always want to be part of a progressive alternative to a Tory government"". However, Ms Sturgeon also stressed that she was ""no great fan of Jeremy Corbyn"" and said she ""can't see the SNP going into formal coalition with Labour."" Mr McDonnell has been interviewed in two separate Edinburgh Fringe events Mr McDonnell was being interviewed by LBC broadcaster Iain Dale at the Edinburgh Fringe on Tuesday when he said it would be ""for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish people to decide"" whether a referendum should be held before making a formal request for consent to the ""English parliament"". The shadow chancellor went on to say: ""We would not block something like that. We would let the Scottish people decide. That's democracy. There are other views within the party but that's our view"". A Labour spokesman later insisted that Mr McDonnell was ""clearly not advocating a second independence referendum"" and had ""made clear the huge benefit a UK Labour government will bring for the people of Scotland"". The shadow chancellor repeated his comments about not blocking a referendum during a separate Edinburgh Fringe interview on Wednesday - but said the most important thing was getting a Labour government. He also ruled out a formal electoral pact with the SNP. Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that Mr McDonnell's comments had clearly not been a slip of the tongue. He said it was ""not the first time that senior members of the Labour leadership have come to Scotland and freelanced on this big issue and got it wrong"". Mr Murray appears to have been referring to comments made in the past by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has previously said that a referendumwould be ""absolutely fine""and that he wouldnot rule out granting consentfor one to be held if he becomes prime minister. The MP added: ""This is an issue that is in the grasp of the devolved Scottish Labour Party, and that should be the policy that holds"". Allow Twitter content?

Ms Sturgeon has said she wants to hold a referendum on independence within the next two years - but has said formal consent would need to be granted by Westminster before it happens.

But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson claimed that Mr McDonnell was paving the way for a ""pact with the SNP in order to parachute Jeremy Corbyn into Number 10"". She added: ""The fact is this - Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell would happily sell Scotland down the river if they thought it could give them a sniff of power.

Mayor Dee Margo and Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn greeted Trump and the First Lady as they disembarked. Mark Morgan, the acting commissioner of Customs and Border Patrol was also present. Trump will now visit with first responders, hospital staff, victims and families at the University Medical Center of El Paso, the White House says. Angelica CasasBBC News, El Paso, Texas Political discourse is the last
thing on the minds of most El Pasoans right now. The communityâs loss is a
personal one, and theyâre still trying to resolve how to heal. But President Trumpâs arrival
months after he held a rally in the city, does ignite fear. Local immigration
lawyer Christina Garcia says the rally he held in February left residents
shaken by the arrival of anti-immigrant, Trump supporters. A visit from President Trump
could just add fuel to the fire in an already heartbroken city. As the president makes his way to visit victims, first responders and families in El Paso, US immigration authorities have announced one of the largest Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in years. The raids at food plants in Mississippi saw over 600 mostly Latino workers arrested, local media say. The gunman in El Paso is believed to have carried out the attack that left 22 dead to combat a ""Hispanic invasion"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The president has landed in El Paso amid protests. Lauren TurnerBBC News Tito Anchondo, who lost his brother Andre and sister-in-law Jordan in the shooting at El Paso's Walmart, voiced his support for Trump earlier this week. ""As an American, you need to stand behind the president,"" he told the BBC. He noted there were differing views in his hometown, with Trump supporters and those who back Democrat Beto O'Rourke, but said everyone coexisted happily. His father Gilbert, he added, is a Mexican American who is proud of his roots and has always said America is the greatest nation on earth. Both said they were pleased with Trump's comments in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, and the fact he had expressed his sympathy. ""Mr Trump made a good statement,"" said Gilbert Anchondo. ""He's making reforms and we appreciate it."" Read the full interview: ""Victim's father says he forgives his son's killer."" Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke is speaking at a counter-rally in El Paso. ""We live in a country that is not safe, that refuses to pass laws to end gun violence,"" O'Rourke said. He criticised Trump for ""vilifying"" immigrants. ""That inaction in the face of violence and intolerance will find us, and it did."" Trump is expected to land in El Paso soon. Allow Twitter content?

"The Wagah border crossing is a symbol of the often tense relationship between India and Pakistan Pakistan has announced plans to expel India's top diplomat and suspend trade with its neighbour, deepening a row between the countries over the disputed territory of Kashmir. Indian-administered Kashmir has been on lockdown since the Indian government decided on Monday to strip the region of its special constitutional status. Phone networks and the internet have been cut off since Sunday evening. Tens of thousands of troops have been patrolling the streets. Instances of protest and stone-throwing have been reported, despite the communications blackout and a curfew. What happened in Kashmir and why it matters 'India has betrayed Kashmir' Kashmiris express anger at loss of special status Kashmiris in other parts of the country said that they were unable to get through to their families. Local leaders have also been detained. India and Pakistan - both nuclear-armed states - have fought two wars over Kashmir, most recently clashing in a series of aerial attacks over the territory in February. The Himalayan region of Kashmir is claimed in its entirety by both India and Pakistan, but they each control only parts of it. There is a long-running separatist insurgency on the Indian side, which has led to thousands of deaths over three decades. India accuses Pakistan of supporting insurgents but its neighbour denies this, saying it only gives moral and diplomatic support to Kashmiris who want self-determination. This video can not be played The BBC reports from inside Indian-administered Kashmir Under Article 370 of the Indian constitution, the state of Jammu and Kashmir had special dispensation to make its own laws - the basis for its complex relationship with India for some 70 years. However, the Indian government is now revoking most of Article 370. Pakistan is suspending all trade between the two countries. It is expelling India's high commissioner (the equivalent of an ambassador) from Islamabad. Meanwhile, Pakistan's newly-appointed envoy, Moin-ul-Haq, was yet to start his role but now will not move to Delhi. Prime Minister Imran Khan has ""directed that all diplomatic channels be activated to expose [the] brutal Indian racist regime, design and human rights violations"", a Pakistani government statement said. He also directed the armed forces to remain vigilant. Imran Khan has ordered Pakistan's armed forces to remain vigilant In addition, Pakistan is asking the UN Security Council to consider the dispute. India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since independence from British colonial rule in 1947. Many people in Indian-administered Kashmir do not want it to be governed by India, preferring instead either independence or union with Pakistan. The funerals driving youth to militancy The forgotten victims of the world's highest war The population of the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir is more than 60% Muslim, making it the only state within India where Muslims are in the majority. Many Kashmiris think revoking Article 370 is an attempt to change the territory's demographic character, by allowing non-Kashmiris to buy land there. Before now, Indians from outside the state could be barred from settling or buying property. While the current insurgency began in 1989, violence surged again in 2016, with the death of a young militant leader, Burhan Wani. Last year, more than 500 people were killed - including civilians, security forces and militants - the highest such toll in a decade. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have for a long time wanted to scrap Article 370 - a promise included in their manifesto for elections earlier this year. They argued that Kashmir needed to be put on the same footing as the rest of India. Once returned to power with an increased majority in May, the government lost no time in acting on its pledge. Neighbouring China has strongly opposed India's move to revoke the article, calling it ""unacceptable"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab reportedly said he had spoken to India's foreign minister and ""expressed some of our concerns around the situation and called for calm"". An official at the US State Department meanwhile denied reports the US was informed about India's plans,external. ""Contrary to press reporting, the Indian government did not consult or inform the US Government before moving to revoke Jammu and Kashmir's special constitutional status"", the state department said.

"An escaped cockatiel called Joey was recaptured and handed back to his owner As emergency workers battled through the weekend to stop the damaged dam at Toddbrook Reservoir from collapsing and devastating Whaley Bridge, another major operation was taking place in the town. Hundreds of residents who had been told to leave their homes on Thursday had contacted missing pet organisation Animal Search UK for help to retrieve and feed beloved animals they had left behind. Many pet owners had been at work when the evacuation began and were unable to collect their cats, dogs, rabbits, hamsters and birds. Other animals had been abandoned in the rush to evacuate with only enough food and water to last a day or two. The pet detectives worked their way through a list of worried owners Following discussions with Derbyshire Police, Animal Search UK deployed a team of pet detectives on Saturday morning. Isobel Johnson, from the service, said: ""During the Friday evening and through Saturday and Sunday, we had nearly a thousand calls coming in from residents or people in the local area asking for or offering help."" ""On Saturday morning one of our specialist teams began numerous trips into the 'danger zone' behind police lines to capture, feed and rescue abandoned pets. ""The team conducted 15-minute missions in and out of the area either alongside the owners, or at their request."" Derbyshire Police had imposed a strict 15-minute limit for one person from each household in the exclusion zone to return to attend to pets and grab essential medication. Liaising with officers and worried owners, and against the clock, the pet detectives worked through a list of stricken pets, collecting them or sorting them out with food. Meanwhile, back at the service's Chester base, new calls were coming in all the time. A local Pets At Home store donated food and essentials The organisation usually charges owners a search team call-out fee, but waived the fees due to the extraordinary circumstances. The operation was also supported by the volunteers from the RSPCA's Stockport, East Cheshire and West Derbyshire branch. Retailer Pets at Home also contacted the team to donate food and pet essentials. Ms Johnson said: ""We found many animals were very confused and disorientated with the massive change to their daily lives."" The two-man team arrived at one home to fetch a cockatiel called Joey which had run out of food since his owners evacuated. They found the baffled bird had escaped his cage and faced a race against time to recapture him. Ms Johnson said: ""Ben and Andrew are both highly trained search team members - they were taught by a former police detective. That knowledge certainly came in handy as Joey was safely captured and calmed down by his owners."" Pet detectives spent two days entering the danger zone to fetch pets After two days of reuniting grateful owners with their confused pets, the team left Whaley Bridge on Sunday. ""It really has been the most overwhelming experience for everyone within the team, the kindness of all the people who have volunteered their help has been truly incredible,"" Ms Johnson said. ""The police have been fantastic in giving such a high level of support and understanding of everyone's needs. We couldn't be more grateful."" Before leaving, the team left cat food dotted around the exclusion zone, so any loose felines would not go hungry, and invited any residents whose pets remain missing to get in touch. Charlotte Stonier's dog Coco has been staying with her at a hotel in Buxton Meanwhile, it has been an unusual few days for residents who were able to take their pets with them when they left on Thursday. Charlotte Stonier has been staying at the Palace Hotel in Buxton with her dog Coco.

"This video can not be played Some festival-goers vowed to have a good time despite travelling for twelve hours The Boardmasters festival has been called off just hours before gates were due to open, after warnings the site would be battered by storms. About 55,000 people were expected in Newquay to see headliners Wu-Tang Clan, Florence + The Machine and Foals. Many revellers were already on their way, with crowds now gathered at the town's railway station or searching for somewhere to stay. Organisers said ticket holders would get a full refund. Festival bosses said the forecast was ""too severe"" for the event to go ahead and felt they had no option but to cancel because they ""just could not compromise the safety of our customers"". People were queuing at Newquay railway station on Wednesday after Boardmasters was cancelled Organisers said refunds were available for anyone who bought a ticket via the festival website or an official ticket seller. Fern Jameson said she had received no news on when she would get her refund and said the ""Â£10 booking fees and the Â£10 litter bond"" were not getting refunded. But Taia, who was coming to the festival from Farnborough, said the festival had been ""amazing at keeping us all posted since they made the announcement"". She said she had not heard when the refund would come through, but said it was a ""huge relief"" to hear they would be receiving one. Josh, Jack and Ellis Fitzgerald, from Northampton, say they are now booked in a hotel for three nights but are still ""planning to have a good time"" The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning,externalfor heavy rain and thunderstorms for much of England and Wales on Friday and Saturday, with strong winds forecast for Cornwall.

"The UK food industry has asked the government to waive aspects of competition law to allow firms to co-ordinate and direct supplies with each other after a no-deal Brexit. TheFood and Drink Federation,external(FDF) said it repeatedly asked ministers for clarity on a no-deal scenario. Existing rules prohibit suppliers and retailers discussing supply or pricing. The industry says leaving in the autumn could pose more supply problems than the original Brexit date last March. The FDF, which represents a wide range of food companies and trade associations, said: ""We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year. But we're still waiting."" The boss of one leading retailer told the BBC: ""At the extreme, people like me and people from government will have to decide where lorries go to keep the food supply chain going. And in that scenario we'd have to work with competitors, and the government would have to suspend competition laws."" What is 'no-deal Brexit'? No-deal Brexit: 10 ways it could affect you Brexit: What happens now? The FDF's chief operating officer Tim Rycroft told the BBC that in the event of a no deal, there would be ""selective shortages"" of food that would go on for ""weeks or months"". ""It may be the government is going to come to us and say, 'can't you guys work together to ensure that remote communities or the elderly or children - at risk groups - don't suffer from these shortages',"" he said. ""We're happy to help, but the CMA can fine companies up to 10% of turnover if they are guilty of anti-competitive behaviour. So we wouldn't be able to do that without some pretty cast iron reassurances."" He said the industry had asked for these reassurances at the end of last year, but despite ""support"" from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, they were still waiting. This video can not be played âIâm worried our goods could get stuck at seaâ A government spokesman said: ""The UK will be leaving the EU on 31 October and our top priority is supporting consumers and businesses in their preparations for Brexit. ""We are working closely with the food industry to support preparations as we leave the EU."" There is a precedent for the government or competition authorities to act in this way, with the government pointing to four previous examples of such orders having been made - three in relation to the defence industry (one of which was subsequently repealed), and a fourth made regarding arrangements for the supply of oil and petroleum products. But John Fingleton, the former head of the Office for Fair Trading, warned: ""The last time something like this happened was in relation to dairy prices in 2001 when companies incorrectly thought government words about higher prices for dairy farmers would protect them from competition law. It did not."" As a consequence, supermarkets faced huge fines for price fixing. The cross-party Exiting the EU Committee has warned that a no deal could mean ""damaging consequences"" for sectors such as: Car industry Food industry Services businesses Farming Pharmaceuticals Chemicals Technology Higher education It comes after Domino's Pizza Group said it had spent Â£7m stockpiling ingredients, including tomato sauce, in case a no-deal Brexit disrupts supplies. The company, which imports the tomato sauce for its pizza bases from Portugal, said the probability of shortages of ingredients had increased since March. The FDF said it has repeatedly asked government to direct the CMA to issue a ""letter of comfort"" to the industry that such co-ordination would be considered legal, in the public interest and that the strict letter of the law would not be enforced in this situation. The industry claims that the government, in internal discussions, has played down the impact a no-deal Brexit would have on the overall food supply. One industry member said that a year ago: ""Food was part of the conversation in terms of what to prioritise in a no-deal Brexit"". That has changed with the government now privately acknowledging there may be an impact on price and choice rather than overall availability. The change in date for the UK to leave the European Union from the end of March to the end of October is also causing problems for the food industry as it relies more heavily on Europe for fresh food at this time of year. There is also a lack of warehouse space available for stockpiling. One retailer said that 31 October ""is about the worst day you can pick,"" because warehouse capacity is at 105% in November, versus 75-80% in March. They said that the UK would need 30 massive empty warehouses to store just a week's extra food supply. Lord Haskins, former chairman of Northern Foods, told the BBC: ""The government thinks food will flow normally in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  I have my doubts. ""I think there will be some panic buying, that will create shortages. I am very worried about the supermarkets getting a priority, we have to remember the schools are very important, the NHS is very importantâ¦ restaurants and catering.  All of them have very complex distribution systems. I don't see how that can be left to the private sector to deal with frankly."" But the government spokesman said: ""Half of the food we eat is produced in the UK. The rest of our food is imported, with 30% coming from the EU and 20% from other countries. There will not be an overall shortage of food in the UK after we leave the EU."" 'Low take-up' of no-deal Brexit fund No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' How have councils prepared for Brexit?

"The government is assuming that French preparations for customs and regulatory checks have markedly decreased the anticipated trade disruption from a no-deal Brexit, the BBC has learned. ""Reasonable worst case scenarios"" still anticipate long disruption to about half the freight crossing the Channel. But the assumption, the basis for a lot of the government's no-deal planning, has been upgraded twice recently. The scenarios were told to industry, but kept secret from the public. Last year the government's original ""reasonable worst case scenario"" for no deal was that for three to six months, 75-87% of ""flow"" across the ""short straits"" would be interrupted and forced to join queues on motorways approaching the Channel Tunnel and ports. That assessment assumed that French authorities would check every lorry coming into its country manually. As there had been no talks between authorities, UK officials had to use satellite photographs to estimate the potential for holding and processing facilities around French ports. Brexit: Two can play that game theory What happened to post-Brexit free-trade nirvana? In April this secret assessment, shared with industry via non-disclosure agreements, was improved to 50-70% of freight stopped. This was principally because of the new preparations made on the French side of the border. For example, the Eurotunnel facility for UK freight can check nine lorries at the same time and provides parking for 100 vehicles. In the past few days, the possible disruption to trade flow in the ""short straits"" has been further downgraded to 40-60% of traffic. Better than it was, but still meaning thousands of lorries stuck on motorways in Kent and around Calais, blocking and delaying crucial trade. Even at this improved rate of flow, the available spaces for emergency lorry parking on the M20 and at disused airfields, would fill up over a fortnight, better than the two or three days assumed last year. It is understood that even if the flow rate was 80%, much higher than currently assumed, medicine suppliers say they would require access to emergency freight provision currently being sought by the government again. In reply, a government spokesperson said: ""We are pushing on with all preparations for a no-deal scenario. There are already well-developed plans in place to manage any traffic disruptions in Kent."" Brexit: Two can play that game theory What happened to post-Brexit free-trade nirvana?

"UK-based Ryanair pilots have voted to strike in a row over pay and conditions. The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) has announced two walkouts, one from 22-23 August, while the second strike will be from 2-4 September. It said pilots did not want to disrupt people's travel plans but felt they had no choice after ""decades of Ryanair refusing to deal with unions"". But the airline said the ""ill-timed"" strikes would endanger pilot jobs. It comes days after the budget airline warned of job lossesfollowing a 21% fall in quarterly profits, due to higher costs for fuel and staff, and reduced ticket prices. Balpa said its members have many disagreements with the airline, including over pensions, loss of licence insurance, maternity benefits, allowances and pay structure. ""We have had no formal offer from Ryanair and it is imperative that we resolve this dispute urgently to avoid strike action,"" said Balpa's general secretary Brian Strutton. ""No pilot wants to spoil the public's travel plans but at the moment it seems we have no choice."" The union said 72% of its members at the company had taken part in the ballot with 80% of those supporting strike action. However, Ryanair said that fewer than 50% of Ryanair's UK pilots were members of Balpa, and of these, just 57% voted in favour of industrial action. In a letter to Balpa, Ryanair's director of HR strategy and operations Darrell Hughes said senior captains were paid up to Â£180,000 per annum and, because of this, pilot turnover had fallen to zero ""in recent months"". He said: ""At this difficult time for UK pilots facing base cuts and closures, Balpa should be working with Ryanair to save UK pilot jobs, not endanger them through ill-timed and ill-judged disruption of our customers' travel plans, just 10 weeks before the threat of a no-deal Brexit. We remain available for talks at your convenience."" On 31 July, Ryanair bossMichael O'Leary warned staff in a video message to prepare for job cutsin the coming weeks, saying the airline has 900 too many pilots and cabin crew members. He said the two weakest markets were Germany, where Ryanair faced fierce competition on price, and the UK, where there were Brexit uncertainties. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary speaks in a video to staff ""It's been a challenging summer, we're facing into a very difficult winter,"" he said in the video, seen by the BBC. ""I'm sorry to advise you that this means we need to cut our aircraft numbers and our staffing, not just for summer 2020 but also in winter 2019. ""This will result in some base cuts, some base closures, and I'm very sorry to say, some job losses this winter for pilots and cabin crew, at the end of our summer schedule in September and October, and also some immediately after Christmas."" Mr O'Leary blamed planned cuts to flights next summer due to the grounding of its Boeing 737 Max fleet. The 737 Max is grounded worldwide over concerns with its software following two deadly crashes. Mr O'Leary said it been a big factor in the cuts, having delayed the delivery of some 28 planes and having forced the airline to cut flights and close bases. Mr O'Leary also blamed the ""increasing likelihood of a no-deal Brexit in just 12 weeks' time"". ""We're worried this could have quite a damaging effect, particularly on our UK bases and on some of our Irish bases, which are heavily dependent on people travelling between Ireland and the UK,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Some festival-goers vowed to have a good time despite travelling for twelve hours The Boardmasters festival has been called off just hours before gates were due to open, after warnings the site would be battered by storms. About 55,000 people were expected in Newquay to see headliners Wu-Tang Clan, Florence + The Machine and Foals. Many revellers were already on their way, with crowds now gathered at the town's railway station or searching for somewhere to stay. Organisers said ticket holders would get a full refund. Festival bosses said the forecast was ""too severe"" for the event to go ahead and felt they had no option but to cancel because they ""just could not compromise the safety of our customers"". People were queuing at Newquay railway station on Wednesday after Boardmasters was cancelled Organisers said refunds were available for anyone who bought a ticket via the festival website or an official ticket seller. Fern Jameson said she had received no news on when she would get her refund and said the ""Â£10 booking fees and the Â£10 litter bond"" were not getting refunded. But Taia, who was coming to the festival from Farnborough, said the festival had been ""amazing at keeping us all posted since they made the announcement"". She said she had not heard when the refund would come through, but said it was a ""huge relief"" to hear they would be receiving one.

"The competition to operate rail services between London, Kent and parts of East Sussex has been cancelled, the government has said. The current incumbent, Southeastern, has been given a five-month extension to run the route until April 2020. Go-Ahead runs Southeastern with Koelis through their joint venture Govia. Go-Ahead chief executive David Brown said he was disappointed his firm's bid was not going to be considered by the Department for Transport. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We have taken the decision to cancel the South Eastern franchise competition. ""This follows significant concerns that continuing the competition process would lead to additional costs incurred to the taxpayer, with no certainty that this would deliver envisaged benefits for passengers in a timely fashion."" The spokesperson said the department would ""use this period to develop a solution that delivers the capacity and performance benefits that passengers are expecting"". It will also allow the government to ensure that the recommendations of the review being conducted by the former boss of British Airways, Keith Williams, in to the railways, are taken into account. Government should not manage railways, says review Labour could renationalise railways in five years - McDonnell His Williams Review will be published in the autumn but hehas previously told the BBC government involvement should be limited to overall policyand budget decisions, and the Department for Transport should not manage the system. David Statham, Southeastern's managing director, said: ""Over this next extension period, our focus remains squarely on our passengers, delivering more improvements and continuing to improve the punctuality and reliability of our services."" The process has frustrated other bidders for the franchise, which was put out to tender in November 2017 and again last year before being cancelled by new Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Abellio, which also operates Mersey Rail and Greater Anglia, said it had been working for ""many months"" with consumer groups, councils and businesses. ""This is a really disappointing outcome for customers across the Southeastern network,"" a spokesperson for Abellio said. Stagecoach was another bidder butwas barred from bidding for this franchise and two othersin a row over pensions. Southeastern also runs the only high-speed network in the UK from London St Pancras International to destinations in Kent. Dyan Crowther, chief executive of HS1, said: ""Confusion about the future of these franchised services is frustrating for the very passengers who have driven the phenomenal growth in high-speed train travel. ""This pause does provide a real chance to re-think the specifications of the franchise and consider the benefits more high-speed trains between London and Kent can bring"". In 2012, bidding on two other rail franchises - the West Coast Partnership and Great Western - was also cancelled. Rachael Maskell, Shadow Rail Minister, said the decision to keep the franchise with Govia meant important investment decisions such as new trains ""are kicked into the long grass"". Labour has raised the prospect of nationalising the railways and she said: ""It's clear that the government does not believe franchising competition can deliver benefits for passengers - but they have no ideas for how to deliver better services.""

"This video can not be played Richard Leonard: ""I am clear that the Labour Party's position at the moment is opposition to a second independence referendum."" The Scottish Labour leader has hit back at suggestions from shadow chancellor John McDonnell that the party would not oppose an independence referendum. Richard Leonard said he had made clear to Mr McDonnell that there is ""no case"" for a second referendum. He also claimed that the majority of people in Scotland were still opposed to one being held. Mr McDonnell has said a Labour government would not block any request from Holyrood to hold a vote. His comments - which have been heavily criticised by several senior Scottish Labour figures - contradict the party's general election manifesto pledge to rule out a referendum, as well as previous public statements by Mr Leonard. Labour government 'would not block' indyref2 Sturgeon points to 'growing urgency' for independence Mr Leonard told BBC Scotland that Labour's official policy is still to oppose a referendum. He said he had spoken to Mr McDonnell to ""put to him the very clear view that the people of Scotland do not want a second independence referendum and also to remind him that the last independence referendum was supposed to be once in a generation"". Mr Leonard added: ""I was elected 18 months ago directly by the members of the Scottish Labour Party, and one of the parts of the platform I stood on was clear opposition to a second independence referendum. ""So I think it's pretty clear where I stand, it's pretty clear where the membership of the Scottish Labour Party stand and that's the view that we'll be communicating. ""We will be doing everything we can do to make sure it is in the Labour manifesto for the general election, whenever it comes"". Mr Leonard is traditionally seen as a close ally of UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn He also said that, should Labour win a general election, Mr McDonnell would have more pressing priorities to deal with as Chancellor than an independence referendum - such as ""resolving austerity, investing in public services and trying to tackle whatever situation we find ourselves in with Brexit"". An opinion pollpublished on Mondayput support for independence at 52% in Scotland - with 48% opposed - once those who do not know how they would vote were excluded. But Mr Leonard said his stance on a second referendum would only change if the will of the Scottish people was shown to be ""demonstrably"" different from 2014, when voters rejected independence by 55% to 45%. It comes amid speculation that Labour and the SNP are moving towards some form of agreement that would see the parties join forces at Westminster in an attempt to remove Boris Johnson from Downing Street and force a general election. Former Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdalepredicted in Junethat Mr Corbyn would agree to hold an independence referendum if he needed SNP support to form a government. And Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister and the SNP leader, told the Guardian on Tuesday that her party would ""always want to be part of a progressive alternative to a Tory government"". However, Ms Sturgeon also stressed that she was ""no great fan of Jeremy Corbyn"" and said she ""can't see the SNP going into formal coalition with Labour."" Mr McDonnell has been interviewed in two separate Edinburgh Fringe events Mr McDonnell was being interviewed by LBC broadcaster Iain Dale at the Edinburgh Fringe on Tuesday when he said it would be ""for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish people to decide"" whether a referendum should be held before making a formal request for consent to the ""English parliament"". The shadow chancellor went on to say: ""We would not block something like that. We would let the Scottish people decide. That's democracy. There are other views within the party but that's our view"". A Labour spokesman later insisted that Mr McDonnell was ""clearly not advocating a second independence referendum"" and had ""made clear the huge benefit a UK Labour government will bring for the people of Scotland"". The shadow chancellor repeated his comments about not blocking a referendum during a separate Edinburgh Fringe interview on Wednesday - but said the most important thing was getting a Labour government. He also ruled out a formal electoral pact with the SNP. Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that Mr McDonnell's comments had clearly not been a slip of the tongue. He said it was ""not the first time that senior members of the Labour leadership have come to Scotland and freelanced on this big issue and got it wrong"". Mr Murray appears to have been referring to comments made in the past by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has previously said that a referendumwould be ""absolutely fine""and that he wouldnot rule out granting consentfor one to be held if he becomes prime minister. The MP added: ""This is an issue that is in the grasp of the devolved Scottish Labour Party, and that should be the policy that holds"". Allow Twitter content?

Ms Sturgeon has said she wants to hold a referendum on independence within the next two years - but has said formal consent would need to be granted by Westminster before it happens. She has welcomed Mr McDonnell's comments on indyref2 as being ""basic democracy"". But Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson claimed that Mr McDonnell was paving the way for a ""pact with the SNP in order to parachute Jeremy Corbyn into Number 10"". She added: ""The fact is this - Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell would happily sell Scotland down the river if they thought it could give them a sniff of power.

"The price of energy is set to fall for millions of British households this October after the regulator, Ofgem, lowered price caps. Ofgem sets maximum prices that can be charged for gas and electricity to those who have not switched suppliers and are on default tariffs. The new cap could see these households typically pay Â£75 less a year. However, bills will still be higher than they were in January when the first price cap came into force. Ofgem boss Dermot Nolan said: ""The price caps require suppliers to pass on any savings to customers when their cost to supply electricity and gas falls. Energy prices to rise for millions Energy firms handed new customers amid probe ""This means the energy bills of around 15 million customers on default deals or pre-payment meters will fall this winter to reflect the reduction in cost of the wholesale energy."" About 11 million households are on default, or standard variable tariffs, and are set to be affected. Such a household, which uses a typical amount of energy and pays the bill by direct debit, should now expect to pay Â£1,179 a year. Consumer groups say they could save hundreds of pounds by shopping around for a better deal. Another four million people are on pre-payment meters, so pay for their energy in advance. The price cap will fall on their tariffs too, with the typical customer paying Â£1,217 per year, down Â£25 from the previous cap level. Energy price capping, brought in under Theresa May, is designed to protect the vulnerable and those who have stayed loyal to their energy supplier. From next year, Ofgem will set the cap twice a year for households in England, Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland has a separate energy regulator and its own price cap. The regulator sets a cap on the unit price of energy for electricity and gas, and a maximum standing charge. Energy companies are not allowed to charge default tariffs that are higher than these thresholds. The first caps came into force at the start of January and have been revised twice since then - once in April when they went up, and now for October, when they will fall. However, Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, warned that the new cap for a standard variable and default tariff is still higher than the Â£1,137 level set back January. He added: ""Crucially, there are more than 100 cheaper tariffs available to consumers in the market today. ""That means someone switching today could secure a deal that delivers three times the saving the price cap offers, while protecting themselves from this rollercoaster of price fluctuations every six months. It's a no-brainer."" Major energy companies such as Centrica have complained the price caps are squeezing their business, while a number of smaller suppliers have blamed the policy for putting them out of business. But Ofgem boss Dermot Nolan told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that the cap was working ""reasonably well"". ""I think it has done what parliament has asked us to do which is to make sure the cap protects people who don't wish to switch. ""It's forced some of the bigger companies to make efficiency savingsâ¦ and it's also still permitting switching.  So you still see fairly significant switching, you see lots of other firms in the market."" The cap is per unit of energy, not on the total bill. So people who use more energy will still pay more than those who use less. The new cap also takes effect in October, just when people are starting to switch the heating back on, which will offset the impact of lower prices. Ofgem recommends consumers should shop around for cheaper fixed rate deals - something that would make the cap irrelevant for them.

"The competition to operate rail services between London, Kent and parts of East Sussex has been cancelled, the government has said. The current incumbent, Southeastern, has been given a five-month extension to run the route until April 2020. Go-Ahead runs Southeastern with Koelis through their joint venture Govia. Go-Ahead chief executive David Brown said he was disappointed his firm's bid was not going to be considered by the Department for Transport. A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We have taken the decision to cancel the South Eastern franchise competition. ""This follows significant concerns that continuing the competition process would lead to additional costs incurred to the taxpayer, with no certainty that this would deliver envisaged benefits for passengers in a timely fashion."" The spokesperson said the department would ""use this period to develop a solution that delivers the capacity and performance benefits that passengers are expecting"". It will also allow the government to ensure that the recommendations of the review being conducted by the former boss of British Airways, Keith Williams, in to the railways, are taken into account. Government should not manage railways, says review Labour could renationalise railways in five years - McDonnell His Williams Review will be published in the autumn but hehas previously told the BBC government involvement should be limited to overall policyand budget decisions, and the Department for Transport should not manage the system. David Statham, Southeastern's managing director, said: ""Over this next extension period, our focus remains squarely on our passengers, delivering more improvements and continuing to improve the punctuality and reliability of our services."" The process has frustrated other bidders for the franchise, which was put out to tender in November 2017 and again last year before being cancelled by new Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. Abellio, which also operates Mersey Rail and Greater Anglia, said it had been working for ""many months"" with consumer groups, councils and businesses. ""This is a really disappointing outcome for customers across the Southeastern network,"" a spokesperson for Abellio said. Stagecoach was another bidder butwas barred from bidding for this franchise and two othersin a row over pensions. Southeastern also runs the only high-speed network in the UK from London St Pancras International to destinations in Kent. Dyan Crowther, chief executive of HS1, said: ""Confusion about the future of these franchised services is frustrating for the very passengers who have driven the phenomenal growth in high-speed train travel. ""This pause does provide a real chance to re-think the specifications of the franchise and consider the benefits more high-speed trains between London and Kent can bring"". In 2012, bidding on two other rail franchises - the West Coast Partnership and Great Western - was also cancelled. Rachael Maskell, Shadow Rail Minister, said the decision to keep the franchise with Govia meant important investment decisions such as new trains ""are kicked into the long grass"". Labour has raised the prospect of nationalising the railways and she said: ""It's clear that the government does not believe franchising competition can deliver benefits for passengers - but they have no ideas for how to deliver better services.""

"A no-deal Brexit threatens the UK's food security and will lead to higher prices and empty shelves in the short-term, retailers are warning. Sainsbury's, Asda and McDonald's are among those warning stockpiling fresh food is impossible and that the UK is very reliant on the EU for produce. The warning comes in a letter from the British Retail Consortium and is signed by several of the major food retailers. It comes ahead of crucial votes in Parliament on Tuesday. Retailers have told me that they fear shelves would be left empty if there were significant disruptions to supplies. The letter from the retailers, and seen by the BBC, says there will be ""significant risks"" to maintaining the choice, quality and shelf life of food. ""We are extremely concerned that our customers will be among the first to experience the realities of a no deal Brexit,"" the letter says. Brexit: A really simple guide A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Is Parliament's Brexit fog about to clear? MPs will consider a series of amendments to Theresa May's plans that could shape the future direction of Brexit. While it will not be MPs' final verdict on the deal, they will vote on the amendments and, if one is passed, it will illustrate what changes to the deal might be enough to get a modified version of the deal through Parliament. Retailers have been reluctant to intervene in the Brexit debate but are doing so now as the UK's departure date from the EU approaches. In the letter, they urge MPs to work together ""urgently to find a solution that avoids the shock of a no-deal Brexit"". A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. The letter uses the government's own estimate that freight through Calais may fall 87% from current levels, threatening the availability and shelf life of many products. It expresses worry over tariffs, with only 10% of the UK's food imports currently subject to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. If the UK were to revert to WTO rules, the retailers warn that would ""greatly increase import costs that would in turn put upward pressure on food prices"". The other signatories to the letter include the chief executives of M&S, KFC, Co-Op, and Lidl. The letter spells out the UK's food relationship with Europe, with nearly one third of the food in the UK coming from the EU. ""In March, the situation becomes more acute as UK produce is out of season,"" the letter says. At that time of year, 90% of lettuces, 80% of tomatoes and 70% of soft fruit sold in the UK is grown in the EU, the letter says. ""As this produce is fresh and perishable, it needs to be moved quickly from farms to our stores,"" the retailers say. Their letter says that stockpiling fresh food is impossible and that the complex, just-in-time supply chain through which food is imported into the UK will be ""significantly disrupted"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It adds it is difficult to stockpile any more produce as ""all frozen and chilled storage is already been used"". ""While we have been working closely with our suppliers on contingency plans, it is not possible to mitigate all the risks to our supply chains and we fear significant disruption as a result if there is no Brexit deal,"" the retailers say in the letter to MPs. The retailers say that while they are looking for alternate supply routes, there are limited options and not enough ferries. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a high level of food security built upon a diverse range of sources including strong domestic production and imports from other countries. This will continue to be the case whether we leave the EU with or without a deal."" They added the government had ""well established"" ways of working with the food industry to prevent disruption. The letter comes after a report from MPs on the Exiting the EU Committee said the government must rule out a no-deal Brexit. Committee chairman Hilary Benn said: ""The suggestion that the UK might opt for a no-deal outcome but assume that the EU will continue to act in a co-operative manner to avoid disruption, cannot seriously constitute the policy of any responsible government."" However, a Tory member of the committee, Craig Mackinlay, said he ""disowned"" the report findings as ""just more Project Fear from a group of MPs who have never wanted the UK to leave the EU"". A number of amendments are being voted on by MPs on Tuesday - although the Irish deputy PM says changes to the backstop - aimed at preventing a hard border - would not be acceptable. The backstop is the ""insurance policy"" in the withdrawal deal, intended to ensure there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU.

Trump will now visit with first responders, hospital staff, victims and families at the University Medical Center of El Paso, the White House says. Angelica CasasBBC News, El Paso, Texas Political discourse is the last
thing on the minds of most El Pasoans right now. The communityâs loss is a
personal one, and theyâre still trying to resolve how to heal. But President Trumpâs arrival
months after he held a rally in the city, does ignite fear. Local immigration
lawyer Christina Garcia says the rally he held in February left residents
shaken by the arrival of anti-immigrant, Trump supporters. A visit from President Trump
could just add fuel to the fire in an already heartbroken city. As the president makes his way to visit victims, first responders and families in El Paso, US immigration authorities have announced one of the largest Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in years. The raids at food plants in Mississippi saw over 600 mostly Latino workers arrested, local media say. The gunman in El Paso is believed to have carried out the attack that left 22 dead to combat a ""Hispanic invasion"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lauren TurnerBBC News Tito Anchondo, who lost his brother Andre and sister-in-law Jordan in the shooting at El Paso's Walmart, voiced his support for Trump earlier this week.

His father Gilbert, he added, is a Mexican American who is proud of his roots and has always said America is the greatest nation on earth. Both said they were pleased with Trump's comments in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, and the fact he had expressed his sympathy. ""Mr Trump made a good statement,"" said Gilbert Anchondo. ""He's making reforms and we appreciate it."" Read the full interview: ""Victim's father says he forgives his son's killer."" Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O'Rourke is speaking at a counter-rally in El Paso. ""We live in a country that is not safe, that refuses to pass laws to end gun violence,"" O'Rourke said.

"The latest series of Line of Duty was a ratings hit Watching programmes on a TV set is still the most popular way for UK audiences to watch television - but streaming is catching up. Traditional viewing - including catch-up within 28 days - still accounts for most TV watching, with an average of three hours and 12 minutes per day. But according toOfcom's latest Media Nations report,external, this marks a drop of 11 minutes since 2017. Average daily viewing of streaming services rose last year to 26 minutes. The number of UK households signed up to the most popular streaming platforms - Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Now TV and Disney Life - increased from 11.2m (39%) in 2018 to 13.3m (47%) in 2019. The total number of UK streaming subscriptions rose by a quarter in 2018 - from 15.6m to 19.1m - with many homes signing up to more than one service. The report found that two in five of UK adults now consider online video services to be their main way of watching TV and film. Despite traditional TV viewing declining, the five main public service broadcasters - BBC One, BBC Two, Channel 4, ITV/STV and Channel 5 - held their share of viewing, at 52%. Still Game most-watched Scottish show of 2018 But viewers now watch 50 minutes less traditional TV each day than in 2010 - and those in the younger age bracket (16 to 24) have halved the time they spend watching TV that way during the same period. This is the second Media Nations report to be published by Ofcom. Friends is still the most streamed show on paid-for services in the UK The first, which came out in 2018, found thatFriends topped a listof the UK's most popular shows on paid-for streaming services. It was the same again this year, with Friends at number one and accounting for around 2% of total streams. The US sitcom, which first aired in 1994, was added to Netflix early last year. Amazon's car show Grand Tour was the second most streamed, followed by You, The Good Place and Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which are all on Netflix. BBC One's Line of Duty is the most-watched programme overall this year so far with 12.1 million tuning in to the final episode. The channel's Bodyguard was the most-watched drama in 2018, with 14.3 million viewers for its final outing. Yih-Choung Teh, strategy and research group director at Ofcom, said: ""The way we watch TV is changing faster than ever before. In the space of seven years, streaming services have grown from nothing to reach nearly half of British homes. ""But traditional broadcasters still have a vital role to play, producing the kind of brilliant UK programmes that overseas tech giants struggle to match.

"The price of energy is set to fall for millions of British households this October after the regulator, Ofgem, lowered price caps. Ofgem sets maximum prices that can be charged for gas and electricity to those who have not switched suppliers and are on default tariffs. The new cap could see these households typically pay Â£75 less a year. However, bills will still be higher than they were in January when the first price cap came into force. Ofgem boss Dermot Nolan said: ""The price caps require suppliers to pass on any savings to customers when their cost to supply electricity and gas falls. Energy prices to rise for millions Energy firms handed new customers amid probe ""This means the energy bills of around 15 million customers on default deals or pre-payment meters will fall this winter to reflect the reduction in cost of the wholesale energy."" About 11 million households are on default, or standard variable tariffs, and are set to be affected. Such a household, which uses a typical amount of energy and pays the bill by direct debit, should now expect to pay Â£1,179 a year. Consumer groups say they could save hundreds of pounds by shopping around for a better deal. Another four million people are on pre-payment meters, so pay for their energy in advance. The price cap will fall on their tariffs too, with the typical customer paying Â£1,217 per year, down Â£25 from the previous cap level. Energy price capping, brought in under Theresa May, is designed to protect the vulnerable and those who have stayed loyal to their energy supplier. From next year, Ofgem will set the cap twice a year for households in England, Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland has a separate energy regulator and its own price cap. The regulator sets a cap on the unit price of energy for electricity and gas, and a maximum standing charge. Energy companies are not allowed to charge default tariffs that are higher than these thresholds. The first caps came into force at the start of January and have been revised twice since then - once in April when they went up, and now for October, when they will fall. However, Stephen Murray, energy expert at MoneySuperMarket, warned that the new cap for a standard variable and default tariff is still higher than the Â£1,137 level set back January. He added: ""Crucially, there are more than 100 cheaper tariffs available to consumers in the market today. ""That means someone switching today could secure a deal that delivers three times the saving the price cap offers, while protecting themselves from this rollercoaster of price fluctuations every six months. It's a no-brainer."" Major energy companies such as Centrica have complained the price caps are squeezing their business, while a number of smaller suppliers have blamed the policy for putting them out of business. But Ofgem boss Dermot Nolan told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that the cap was working ""reasonably well"". ""I think it has done what parliament has asked us to do which is to make sure the cap protects people who don't wish to switch. ""It's forced some of the bigger companies to make efficiency savingsâ¦ and it's also still permitting switching.  So you still see fairly significant switching, you see lots of other firms in the market."" The cap is per unit of energy, not on the total bill. So people who use more energy will still pay more than those who use less. The new cap also takes effect in October, just when people are starting to switch the heating back on, which will offset the impact of lower prices. Ofgem recommends consumers should shop around for cheaper fixed rate deals - something that would make the cap irrelevant for them.

"The government has come up with new proposals for England and Wales to end the row with doctors over pensions. Doctors had started refusing to do overtime shifts because they were being landed with bills after changes to the amount that can be accrued tax-free. Just weeks after ruling out reviewing the rules, ministers now say they will. A consultation launched by Theresa May's government offering to introduce more pension flexibility is also being replaced by more radical solutions. The previous consultation was only published on 22 July. But it was reassessed following the appointment as prime minister of Boris Johnson, who had promised to address the issue during the Tory leadership contest. Thepensions row has been linked to a rise in waiting times for routine surgerycaused by medics refusing to work beyond their planned hours. The government said it would now be putting forward a plan to allow doctors complete flexibility when it comes to scaling down their pension contributions to avoid breaching the annual tax-free allowance. The allowance has been reduced from Â£255,000 a year in 2010-11 to Â£40,000 - and drops still further for the highest earners. This tends to affect those earning more than Â£110,000, around a third of senior doctors and GPs Previously the government had said it favoured a 50:50 option whereby public sector staff could forsake half the amount paid into their pension. But now ministers have said they will publish a consultation in the coming weeks which favours giving public sector staff the ability to reduce contributions to zero. It will also allow doctors to be given the contributions the employer would have made, meaning their pay packets could be boosted by thousands of pounds a year. Meanwhile, the Treasury has agreed to look at how public sector workers are taxed on their pensions to see if the rules can be relaxed. This will not involve reviewing the Â£40,000 threshold, but instead will focus on how that reduces to Â£10,000 as more is earned. Some doctors have reported being landed with huge unexpected tax bills. The plans will be set out in a consultation published during the summer with a view to introducing them from April. But to help relieve the problems immediately, the government is also promising to allow doctors to opt out from the pension scheme for this financial year. Again, guidance will be published in the coming weeks. The government hopes this will relieve the pressure on hospitals, which have reported waiting lists are lengthening because doctors are refusing extra shifts. It will be up to Scotland and Northern Ireland to decide whether to make similar changes, although the way pensions work in those parts of the UK is slightly different anyway. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""NHS doctors do extraordinary life-saving work every day - they should not have to worry about the tax impacts if they choose to go the extra mile by taking on additional work to help patients."" Dr Chaand Nagpaul, of the British Medical Association, said: ""We acknowledge this step forward by the government."" ""After tireless lobbying on the damaging effect that perverse and ill-thought out tax legislation is having on our NHS, its doctors and patients, it is good to see the government finally sitting up and taking notice and proposing action."" But Sara Gorton from the union Unison said: ""Introducing measures to help only a small proportion of the millions of active NHS scheme members looks alarmingly like the beginning of a 'clinicians-first' approach to pension strategy."" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the pension changes had undermined the ability of the NHS to provide care to patients and ministers still need to do more to address existing staff shortages.

"A Japanese convenience store chain has apologised after a video of rats scampering around one of its branches emerged. FamilyMart said it had shut a store and was sorry if the ""unsanitary"" footage had made customers feel ""uneasy"". A video circulated on social media on Monday appears to show as many as six rodents scurrying through a store, near sushi displays and down aisles. Broadcaster NHK said the clip had been viewed more than five million times. The footage shows several rats racing down the side of a refrigerated cabinet storing fresh food like sushi and rice boxes, while another rodent rushes under shelves holding packaged items. Dead rat in soup costs restaurant $190m The BBC could not independently verify the authenticity of the video. In a statement, FamilyMart said it had closed a store in the busy Shibuya district on 5 August as it investigated the cause. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Some festival-goers vowed to have a good time despite travelling for twelve hours The Boardmasters festival has been called off just hours before gates were due to open, after warnings the site would be battered by storms. About 55,000 people were expected in Newquay to see headliners Wu-Tang Clan, Florence + The Machine and Foals. Many revellers were already on their way, with crowds now gathered at the town's railway station or searching for somewhere to stay. Organisers said ticket holders would get a full refund. Festival bosses said the forecast was ""too severe"" for the event to go ahead and felt they had no option but to cancel because they ""just could not compromise the safety of our customers"". People were queuing at Newquay railway station on Wednesday after Boardmasters was cancelled Organisers said refunds were available for anyone who bought a ticket via the festival website or an official ticket seller. Fern Jameson said she had received no news on when she would get her refund and said the ""Â£10 booking fees and the Â£10 litter bond"" were not getting refunded. But Taia, who was coming to the festival from Farnborough, said the festival had been ""amazing at keeping us all posted since they made the announcement"". She said she had not heard when the refund would come through, but said it was a ""huge relief"" to hear they would be receiving one. Josh, Jack and Ellis Fitzgerald, from Northampton, say they are now booked in a hotel for three nights but are still ""planning to have a good time"" The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning,externalfor heavy rain and thunderstorms for much of England and Wales on Friday and Saturday, with strong winds forecast for Cornwall.

Event organiser Andrew Topham said the decision was taken after discussions with the Met Office, the event safety team, emergency services and representatives from Cornwall Council. He said the priority now was to de-rig the festival site to mitigate the risk it posed. Ellie Fraser and Shannon Manley, from Nottingham, said they spent nearly Â£700 each and ""it took us 10 hours to get here"" Brook Bell, from Dover, said he was ""fuming"" having ""literally travelled the whole country to be here"" Nightclubs and bars across Newquay have said after-parties are still going ahead and some new events will be added. All campsites in Newquay are full and people are being directed to stay on the outskirts of the town, tourism bosses said. Boardmasters is off but festival vibes go on Cancelled festival 'won't stop our holiday' The main acts were not set to play until Friday but gates were due to open on Wednesday. Ticket prices ranged from Â£69 for day-entry passes through to VIP packages for five days of camping from about Â£370 per person. Ticket-holders have been considering whether to stay in town or go home Sarah Eames, 18, from Spalding, Lincolnshire dyed her hair pink and purple just a few hours before the cancellation, and is scared to tell her parents Kristina Powell said she had not been able to sleep for shock after learning that the festival was cancelled after travelling from Cheshire. She said she and her friends ""at first couldn't and didn't want to believe it and honestly thought it was a hoax"". ""It all seemed a bit unprofessional - a screenshot of a statement written on a Notes app? ""The website was down, which added to our doubt. Then, when it did come back up, tickets were still available to buy."" She said tickets were still available on the website until 01:30, despite the festival being cancelled hours earlier.

BBC forecaster Paul Goddard said that while the weather warning currently predicted high winds on Saturday, his weather maps were showing they were likely to hit on Friday night. He added there could be average wind speeds of about 40mph, and gusts of up to 60mph. Malcolm Bell, Visit Cornwall chief executive, said that despite the cancellation the county was ""still open for business"". However, local businesses say they are already concerned about the effects of the cancellation. Surf shop manager Tim Rowe said he was concerned at losing festival trade and family trade Tim Rowe, manager of Newquay's Rip Curl shop on Bank Street, said: ""My biggest problem is that families are put off coming this week because of Boardmasters. ""Not only have we lost the T-shirt and hats trade from the festival-goers, we won't get the families buying wetsuits and surfboards either.""

"Lorries queue on the A20 outside Dover, in Kent, where Operation Stack is being implemented Councils have spent money repaving roads, hiring vets, stockpiling food for school meals and registering their own staff for the EU settled status scheme in preparation for Brexit. Details of council spending were released to BBC News in response to Freedom of Information requests made to all upper-tier authorities in the United Kingdom. The burden fell most heavily on councils in strategically important areas, such as those near ports that may have to deal with increased checks and lorry tailbacks in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Local councils to get Â£56.5m Brexit fund Councils 'left in the dark over Brexit' Altogether, 204 upper-tier authorities responded to the BBC's request for information. Of those, 58 provided details of Brexit-related spending, including staffing costs. A number of councils were unable to estimate the cost of staff time on Brexit-related work. In the run-up to March 2019, councils were allocated a share of Â£56.5m put aside by the Ministry for Communities, Housing and Local Government (MCHLG) to deal with Brexit preparedness. Of this, Â£20m was divvied up among councils for 2018-19, ahead of the UK's exit from the EU, and another Â£20m was earmarked for 2019-20, seen as a fund to deal with the potentially disruptive effects of a no-deal exit. Some local authorities have also received direct funding from the Department for Transport, for specific projects. A large chunk of this funding - almostÂ£29m for Operation Brock- went to Kent County Council to deal with a potential increase in traffic around the Port of Dover. A no-deal exit from the European Union could bung up Britain's ports. Lorries travelling to and from the Continent could be subject to greater checks, creating tailbacks that could go on for miles. Councils have responded to this by spending on road improvements. Hampshire County Council spent Â£178,142 on designs to upgrade routes feeding the Port of Portsmouth, with works estimated to cost Â£200,000 to follow. Supplies stockpiled in case of no deal Dover warns of Brexit disruption risk With its responsibility for the area around the Port of Dover - the UK's most important point of access for the Continent - Kent County Council has spent much of the money from the Department for Transport improving the A256 between Dover and Manston Airfield, where backed-up lorries would be parked. Portsmouth, Sunderland and Kent, again, all put plans in place for lorry parks in the event of a no deal. In Sunderland, Â£19,735 was paid to lease land for a lorry park to ease supply-chain pressures at thelocal Nissan plantand a further Â£11,942 to furnish it with manhole covers. Others looked at ways to smooth the flow of traffic through their ports by employing extra staff. Portsmouth spent Â£67,182 on port staffing costs, while Southampton employed more veterinary staff for the port at a cost of Â£30,380 for 2018-19. Some councils say a no-deal Brexit could threaten their ability to deliver services. A risk assessment commissioned by Thurrock Council said the area, home to three major ports, could become a ""gridlocked borough"". In response, the council spent over Â£8,000 on 10 electric bicycles - to ensure carers and support staff for vulnerable individuals could visit them even if the roads were blocked. Thurrock and their neighbours in Southend also bought fuel tanks, for about Â£4,500, to keep council workers on the road in the event of a ""national fuel shortage"". And it's not just maritime ports concerning councils, Leicestershire Council bought equipment for traffic management in case of any knock-on effects from increased freight checks at East Midlands Airport. Nine councils have taken steps to register EU citizens for the government's settled status scheme. Under this, more than 3.2 million EU citizens resident in the UK before exit or the end of any transition period will have the same rights as they do now. Five of these were in Greater London, where large numbers of EU citizens live. In Brent, the London borough with the highest number of EU citizens, the council spent Â£1,500 on document-scanning equipment to register residents for settled status. In total, five councils bought new devices to register EU citizens - sometimes Google Android devices to replace Apple products, which do not support the government's app. Council plans for post-Brexit 'threats' Post-Brexit lorry park trial 'too late' In Slough, the council reported using staff time, at an estimated cost of Â£1,530, to sign up its own workers for the scheme. In Bristol, the city council spent Â£1,500 employing ""a small mobile unit of security officers"" to monitor the European elections in May this year. Renfrewshire Council stockpiled food to secure supplies for school meals in the event of a no-deal Brexit It said it had been responding to ""reports of low level public order issues occurring in neighbouring areas during their 2 May elections, with Brexit cited as a triggering issue"". Meanwhile, Renfrewshire Council stockpiled Â£58,232 worth of food to avoid potential supply issues for school meals and care homes. And council spending on preparations to mitigate the potential consequences of a no deal, ahead of the UK's planned exit on 29 March 2019, has had to be extended following the extension granted by the EU to the Article 50 period, until 31 October. Staff hired in anticipation of exit will have to be retained until they are needed or can be released. ""Planning exercises held in the run up to 31 March will now have to be repeated in the run up to 31 October,"" Southend-on-Sea Borough Council said in response to a query. The Local Government Association said in a statement that councils were ""as prepared as they can be given the uncertainty surrounding the process"" but ""there remains resource, information and advice gaps that councils are facing while helping their communities prepare, which need to be met by the government"".

"Poor harvests have left many in need of humanitarian aid More than five million people in Zimbabwe - about a third of the population - need food aid, with many coming close to starving, the UN says. It has launched a $331m (Â£270m) appeal for aid as the country battles the effects of drought, a cyclone and an economic crisis. The UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said many were ""in crisis emergency mode... marching towards starvation"". Once a regional bread basket, Zimbabwe has suffered years of turmoil. Recent harvests have been badly affected by drought and the price of food has risen sharply. Low water levels have also hit the main hydro-electric plant at Kariba, triggering rolling power cuts across the country. The country is also facing a financial crisis and has reintroduced the Zimbabwe dollar a decade after it was abandoned amidst rampant inflation. Africa Live: More on this and other stories from the continent Zimbabwe descends into darkness Why Zimbabwe has banned foreign currencies Mugabe in Singapore hospital since April Launching the appeal on Tuesday, WFP head David Beasley said about 2.5 million people were on the cusp of starvation. ""We are talking about people who truly are marching towards starvation if we are not here to help them,"" he said. ""We are facing a drought unlike any that we have seen in a long time."" The drought has reduced water levels at Kariba, cutting electricity generation Zimbabwe's problems were exacerbated whenCyclone Idai swept through the regionearlier this year. The huge storm, which also hit parts of Malawi and Mozambique, affected 570,000 Zimbabweans and left tens of thousands of them homeless. This video can not be played Cyclone Idai: Survivors rescued by land and air Last week, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said the government had been providing grain to 757,000 homes since January, in both rural and urban areas. And on Tuesday, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who took over from long-time ruler Robert Mugabe in November 2017, declared the drought a national disaster. The UN was already appealing for $294m for Zimbabwe but says it now needs more funding as the impact of the drought has spread.

"North Korea says recent missile launches are a warning to the US and South Korea North Korea has stolen $2bn (Â£1.6bn) to fund its weapons programme using cyber-attacks, a leaked United Nations report says. The confidential report says Pyongyang has targeted banks and crypto-currency exchanges to collect cash. Sources confirmed to the BBC that the UN was investigating 35 cyber-attacks. North Korea launched two missiles on Tuesday, the fourth such launch in less than two weeks. In a statement on Wednesday, the North's leader Kim Jong-un said the launches were a warning against joint military exercises being carried out by the US and South Korea. Pyongyang has described the exercises as a violation of peace agreements. North Korea 'tests missiles' as South starts drill North Korea crisis in 300 words The leaked report, sent to the UN Security Council's North Korea sanctions committee, says Pyongyang ""used cyber-space to launch increasingly sophisticated attacks to steal funds from financial institutions and crypto-currency exchanges to generate income"". Experts are also investigating cyber-mining activity - the use of powerful computers to generate virtual currency - designed to earn foreign money. The report adds that North Korea's attacks against crypto-currency exchanges allowed it to ""generate income in ways that are harder to trace and subject to less government oversight and regulation than the traditional banking sector"". The report also says North Korea has violated UN sanctions by means of illicit ship-to-ship transfers, as well as obtaining items related to weapons of mass destruction. Since 2006, the UN Security Council has imposed sanctions on North Korea that ban exports including coal, iron, lead textiles and seafood. There has also been a cap on imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Kim Jong-un agreed during a summit with US President Donald Trump in Singapore last year that he would stop nuclear testing. Mr Kim also agreed that North Korea would no longer launch intercontinental ballistic missiles. A second summit between the two leaders in Hanoi in 2019 ended without agreement. Since then, denuclearisation talks have stalled although both sides say they still want to pursue diplomacy. In response to the UN report, a US state department spokeswoman told Reuters news agency: ""We call upon all responsible states to take action to counter North Korea's ability top conduct malicious cyber activity, which generates revenue that supports its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programmes.""

"A Japanese convenience store chain has apologised after a video of rats scampering around one of its branches emerged. FamilyMart said it had shut a store and was sorry if the ""unsanitary"" footage had made customers feel ""uneasy"". A video circulated on social media on Monday appears to show as many as six rodents scurrying through a store, near sushi displays and down aisles. Broadcaster NHK said the clip had been viewed more than five million times. The footage shows several rats racing down the side of a refrigerated cabinet storing fresh food like sushi and rice boxes, while another rodent rushes under shelves holding packaged items. Dead rat in soup costs restaurant $190m The BBC could not independently verify the authenticity of the video. In a statement, FamilyMart said it had closed a store in the busy Shibuya district on 5 August as it investigated the cause. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Some festival-goers vowed to have a good time despite travelling for twelve hours The Boardmasters festival has been called off just hours before gates were due to open, after warnings the site would be battered by storms. About 55,000 people were expected in Newquay to see headliners Wu-Tang Clan, Florence + The Machine and Foals. Many revellers were already on their way, with crowds now gathered at the town's railway station or searching for somewhere to stay. Organisers said ticket holders would get a full refund. Festival bosses said the forecast was ""too severe"" for the event to go ahead and felt they had no option but to cancel because they ""just could not compromise the safety of our customers"". People were queuing at Newquay railway station on Wednesday after Boardmasters was cancelled Organisers said refunds were available for anyone who bought a ticket via the festival website or an official ticket seller. Fern Jameson said she had received no news on when she would get her refund and said the ""Â£10 booking fees and the Â£10 litter bond"" were not getting refunded. But Taia, who was coming to the festival from Farnborough, said the festival had been ""amazing at keeping us all posted since they made the announcement"". She said she had not heard when the refund would come through, but said it was a ""huge relief"" to hear they would be receiving one. Josh, Jack and Ellis Fitzgerald, from Northampton, say they are now booked in a hotel for three nights but are still ""planning to have a good time"" The Met Office has issued a yellow weather warning,externalfor heavy rain and thunderstorms for much of England and Wales on Friday and Saturday, with strong winds forecast for Cornwall.

Event organiser Andrew Topham said the decision was taken after discussions with the Met Office, the event safety team, emergency services and representatives from Cornwall Council. He said the priority now was to de-rig the festival site to mitigate the risk it posed. Ellie Fraser and Shannon Manley, from Nottingham, said they spent nearly Â£700 each and ""it took us 10 hours to get here"" Brook Bell, from Dover, said he was ""fuming"" having ""literally travelled the whole country to be here"" Nightclubs and bars across Newquay have said after-parties are still going ahead and some new events will be added. All campsites in Newquay are full and people are being directed to stay on the outskirts of the town, tourism bosses said. Boardmasters is off but festival vibes go on Cancelled festival 'won't stop our holiday' The main acts were not set to play until Friday but gates were due to open on Wednesday. Ticket prices ranged from Â£69 for day-entry passes through to VIP packages for five days of camping from about Â£370 per person. Ticket-holders have been considering whether to stay in town or go home Sarah Eames, 18, from Spalding, Lincolnshire dyed her hair pink and purple just a few hours before the cancellation, and is scared to tell her parents Kristina Powell said she had not been able to sleep for shock after learning that the festival was cancelled after travelling from Cheshire. She said she and her friends ""at first couldn't and didn't want to believe it and honestly thought it was a hoax"". ""It all seemed a bit unprofessional - a screenshot of a statement written on a Notes app? ""The website was down, which added to our doubt. Then, when it did come back up, tickets were still available to buy."" She said tickets were still available on the website until 01:30, despite the festival being cancelled hours earlier.

Acts due to take part have given their reaction, with Foalsreposting Boardmasters' cancellation notice on Facebook,externaland adding the single word: ""Gutted"". BBC forecaster Paul Goddard said that while the weather warning currently predicted high winds on Saturday, his weather maps were showing they were likely to hit on Friday night. He added there could be average wind speeds of about 40mph, and gusts of up to 60mph. Malcolm Bell, Visit Cornwall chief executive, said that despite the cancellation the county was ""still open for business"". However, local businesses say they are already concerned about the effects of the cancellation. Surf shop manager Tim Rowe said he was concerned at losing festival trade and family trade Tim Rowe, manager of Newquay's Rip Curl shop on Bank Street, said: ""My biggest problem is that families are put off coming this week because of Boardmasters. ""Not only have we lost the T-shirt and hats trade from the festival-goers, we won't get the families buying wetsuits and surfboards either."" Other acts that were set to perform at the site in Watergate Bay included Razorlight, Dizzee Rascal and Jorja Smith. Hundreds had arrived in Newquay for five days by the sea The cancellation means those who are now going home will do so with bags still full The five-day surfing side of event, at nearby Fistral beach, is still going ahead. The surfing competition is often overlooked because the swell at this time of year is usually small. However, the current forecast is for waves of up to 10ft (3m) at Fistral.

"The system will now comprise two nodes in the sky - with a third to follow before 2025 Europe has launched the second satellite in its space laser telecommunications network. It will use optical beams to pull pictures and data from other spacecraft and then speed that information to the ground. EDRS-C, as it is known, was sent into orbit on Tuesday by an Ariane-5 rocket from the Kourou spaceport in French Guiana. It joins the first node in the network, EDRS-A, which was put up in 2016. That spacecraft was positioned over Central Africa to service Europe. The new satellite will sit slightly to the east, where it will provide additional capacity. The European Data Relay System is a joint venture between the European Space Agency and aerospace giant Airbus. It is used predominantly by the European Union's Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Earth observation spacecraft. These platforms take images of the planet's surface. Rapid retrieval of space images is important for emergency response Ordinarily, such satellites would have to wait until they pass over a radio receiving dish on the ground before downloading their pictures, which could mean a delay of over an hour as they circle the globe. But the Sentinels were equipped to connect with the EDRS satellites' 1.8-gigabit laser links. The relay platforms orbit much higher in the sky - some 36,000km in altitude - and always have visibility of a radio antenna on the ground. The capability has particular relevance in the realm of natural disasters, such as major floods or big earthquakes. Information about the scale of these emergencies can be put in the hands of first responders much faster than would normally be the case. ""We have demonstrated that it's possible to get a Sentinel image on the ground and ready to use after just 15 minutes of it being acquired,"" Magali Vaissiere, the director of telecoms at Esa, told BBC News. ""The launch of EDRS-C brings additional capacity to the network, obviously, but it also provides redundancy, a back-up, which you need in an operational system."" Between a third and a half of all image data from Sentinels 1 and 2 is now routed through EDRS, and usage is certain to expand with the second node now in orbit. EDRS-C undergoing testing during its development There are plans to use the relay system to regularly pull data to the ground from the European Columbus science laboratory on the space station. Future Earth observation satellites are also actively being planned with EDRS in mind, including the EU's next batch of Sentinels and Airbus's PlÃ©iades Neo satellites which will take Earth images at 30cm resolution. Airbus says airborne reconnaissance could make use of the laser links, too. A third node, EDRS-D, should be launched over the Asia-Pacific region before 2025. Esa wants to see optical technology play a much bigger role in space communications. Telecoms satellites that rely solely on radio frequency transmissions are being left behind by the performance of terrestrial fibre networks. In time, this is going to put significant constraints on applications that include TV broadcasting and the services carrying the messages of connected devices (the so-called Internet of Things). It is why the space agency will propose to Europe's research ministers in November that they fund the R&D necessary to break the ""bottleneck in the sky"". Esa's High Throughput Optical Network (HyDRON) project envisages laser links, not just between satellites but between spacecraft and the ground. This brings certain challenges, including the issue of how to manage light transmissions through a turbulent - and often cloudy - atmosphere. However, if the technologies can be mastered they should permit terabit-per-second connections. ""We have shown with EDRS that we have some leadership in Europe in these technologies, and one of the strategic lines we have defined for [the ministerial meeting] will be dedicated to optical uses so that we strengthen that leadership,"" the Esa telecoms director said. The 3-tonne EDRS-C satellite also hosts a Ka-band radio frequency payload for the London-based Avanti telecommunications company. Avanti calls the payload Hylas-3 and will be using it to deliver broadband and other data services to markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

"The UK food industry has asked the government to waive aspects of competition law to allow firms to co-ordinate and direct supplies with each other after a no-deal Brexit. TheFood and Drink Federation,external(FDF) said it repeatedly asked ministers for clarity on a no-deal scenario. Existing rules prohibit suppliers and retailers discussing supply or pricing. The industry says leaving in the autumn could pose more supply problems than the original Brexit date last March. The FDF, which represents a wide range of food companies and trade associations, said: ""We asked for these reassurances at the end of last year. But we're still waiting."" The boss of one leading retailer told the BBC: ""At the extreme, people like me and people from government will have to decide where lorries go to keep the food supply chain going. And in that scenario we'd have to work with competitors, and the government would have to suspend competition laws."" What is 'no-deal Brexit'? No-deal Brexit: 10 ways it could affect you Brexit: What happens now? The FDF's chief operating officer Tim Rycroft told the BBC that in the event of a no deal, there would be ""selective shortages"" of food that would go on for ""weeks or months"". ""It may be the government is going to come to us and say, 'can't you guys work together to ensure that remote communities or the elderly or children - at risk groups - don't suffer from these shortages',"" he said. ""We're happy to help, but the CMA can fine companies up to 10% of turnover if they are guilty of anti-competitive behaviour. So we wouldn't be able to do that without some pretty cast iron reassurances."" He said the industry had asked for these reassurances at the end of last year, but despite ""support"" from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, they were still waiting. This video can not be played âIâm worried our goods could get stuck at seaâ A government spokesman said: ""The UK will be leaving the EU on 31 October and our top priority is supporting consumers and businesses in their preparations for Brexit. ""We are working closely with the food industry to support preparations as we leave the EU."" There is a precedent for the government or competition authorities to act in this way, with the government pointing to four previous examples of such orders having been made - three in relation to the defence industry (one of which was subsequently repealed), and a fourth made regarding arrangements for the supply of oil and petroleum products. But John Fingleton, the former head of the Office for Fair Trading, warned: ""The last time something like this happened was in relation to dairy prices in 2001 when companies incorrectly thought government words about higher prices for dairy farmers would protect them from competition law. It did not."" As a consequence, supermarkets faced huge fines for price fixing. The cross-party Exiting the EU Committee has warned that a no deal could mean ""damaging consequences"" for sectors such as: Car industry Food industry Services businesses Farming Pharmaceuticals Chemicals Technology Higher education It comes after Domino's Pizza Group said it had spent Â£7m stockpiling ingredients, including tomato sauce, in case a no-deal Brexit disrupts supplies. The company, which imports the tomato sauce for its pizza bases from Portugal, said the probability of shortages of ingredients had increased since March. The FDF said it has repeatedly asked government to direct the CMA to issue a ""letter of comfort"" to the industry that such co-ordination would be considered legal, in the public interest and that the strict letter of the law would not be enforced in this situation. The industry claims that the government, in internal discussions, has played down the impact a no-deal Brexit would have on the overall food supply. One industry member said that a year ago: ""Food was part of the conversation in terms of what to prioritise in a no-deal Brexit"". That has changed with the government now privately acknowledging there may be an impact on price and choice rather than overall availability. The change in date for the UK to leave the European Union from the end of March to the end of October is also causing problems for the food industry as it relies more heavily on Europe for fresh food at this time of year. There is also a lack of warehouse space available for stockpiling. One retailer said that 31 October ""is about the worst day you can pick,"" because warehouse capacity is at 105% in November, versus 75-80% in March. They said that the UK would need 30 massive empty warehouses to store just a week's extra food supply. Lord Haskins, former chairman of Northern Foods, told the BBC: ""The government thinks food will flow normally in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  I have my doubts. ""I think there will be some panic buying, that will create shortages. I am very worried about the supermarkets getting a priority, we have to remember the schools are very important, the NHS is very importantâ¦ restaurants and catering.  All of them have very complex distribution systems. I don't see how that can be left to the private sector to deal with frankly."" But the government spokesman said: ""Half of the food we eat is produced in the UK. The rest of our food is imported, with 30% coming from the EU and 20% from other countries. There will not be an overall shortage of food in the UK after we leave the EU."" 'Low take-up' of no-deal Brexit fund No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' How have councils prepared for Brexit?

She championed writers of colour and published the likes of Gayl Jones, Henry Dumas, Muhammad Ali and Angela Davis, among others. Morrison also taught at Princeton University. Professor Noliwe Rooks, who worked with Morrison at Princeton, told the BBC her debut novel, whose protagonist was a young black girl, had broken new ground when it was released in 1970. ""At this moment when [The Bluest Eye] comes out - who's writing about black girls? Who's writing about this kind of trauma? Who's writing about the interior lives of someone like that?

Her 1987 book Beloved told the story of a runaway female slave and was made into a film starring Oprah Winfrey in 1998. Obituary: Toni Morrison Toni Morrison on Beloved Toni Morrison on The Bluest Eye Morrison once said: ""We die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language. That may be the measure of our lives."" Toni Morrison pictured in 1979 The Morrison family statement said the ""extremely devoted mother, grandmother, and aunt"" had ""passed away peacefully last night [5 August] surrounded by family and friends"". ""The consummate writer who treasured the written word, whether her own, her students or others, she read voraciously and was most at home when writing,"" it continued. ""Although her passing represents a tremendous loss, we are grateful she had a long, well lived life."" Morrison died at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York.

President Obama presented Morrison with the Presidential Medal of Freedom ""We will share information in the near future about how we will celebrate Toni's incredible life."" Her long-time editor, Robert Gottlieb from Knopf publishers, said: ""She was a great woman and a great writer, and I don't know which I will miss more."" And Sonny Mehta, the chairman of Knopf, said: "" I can think of few writers in American letters who wrote with more humanity or with more love for language than Toni.

She championed writers of colour and published the likes of Gayl Jones, Henry Dumas, Muhammad Ali and Angela Davis, among others. Morrison also taught at Princeton University. Professor Noliwe Rooks, who worked with Morrison at Princeton, told the BBC her debut novel, whose protagonist was a young black girl, had broken new ground when it was released in 1970. ""At this moment when [The Bluest Eye] comes out - who's writing about black girls? Who's writing about this kind of trauma? Who's writing about the interior lives of someone like that? Who's writing about black communities?"" said Prof Rooks. ""There was no one who was doing it the way she was, with the truth-telling and the ugliness, as well as the grandeur and the beauty."" Prof Rooks, now at Cornell University, added that Morrison ""could make a story about going car-shopping sound like some kind of Homeric odyssey"". ""From the moment she left her house to the riding in the back of the Bentley was somehow an epic adventure,"" she said.

"John McDonnell said it would be for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish people to decide on whether to hold another independence vote A future Labour government would not block a second Scottish independence referendum, according to shadow chancellor John McDonnell. In an interview at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, he said any decision about holding a vote would be up to the Scottish Parliament. His view contradicts that of Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard. Earlier this year, Mr Leonard said the party would refuse to grant Holyrood the power to hold another vote. Will Brexit break Britain, and would England care? Will indyref2 happen before May 2021? Sturgeon: Indyref2 'more essential than ever' Mr McDonnell's comments follow the publication of an opinion poll suggesting the majority of Scots could back independence. And on Monday Nicola Sturgeon told journalist Iain Dale there was a""growing urgency"" for Scotland to become independent ""sooner rather than later"". Mr McDonnell was also speaking to the LBC broadcaster when he was asked about the possibility of a second independence vote. ""It will be for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish people to decide that,"" the senior Labour MP said. ""They will take a view about whether they want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon said by late next year or thebeginning of 2021."" He added: ""We would not block something like that. We would let the Scottish people decide. That's democracy. ""There are other views within the party but that's our view."" Richard Leonard is opposed to a second independence referendum Mr McDonnell's position appears to be in opposition to the leader of the Scottish Labour party. In March, Richard Leonard told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland that if Labour took power in Westminster the party would refuse to grant a Section 30 order. He added: ""What we said in the manifesto at the 2017 election was that there is no case for, and we would not support, a second independence referendum."" However, Mr McDonnell said: ""The Scottish Parliament will come to a considered view on that and they will submit that to the government and the English Parliament itself. ""If the Scottish people decide they want a referendum that's for them."" His comments were condemned by his party colleague Ian Murray, the MP for Edinburgh South. ""These are utterly irresponsible comments from John McDonnell that betray our party's values,"" he said. ""The Labour Party is an internationalist party founded on a vision of solidarity and we should never seek to appease nationalists, whether they be for Brexit or Scottish independence, who want to divide communities and people."" In a post on Twitter Nicola Sturgeon said the Shadow Chancellor's position was ""basic democracy"". She added that it made ""political sense"" as polls suggested 40% of Labour voters support independence. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Meanwhile, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie described Mr McDonnell's comments as ""astonishingly irresponsible"". ""It's bad enough with Boris Johnson bungling on Brexit and independence but to have the Labour Party's chancellor piling in makes it a whole lot worse,"" he said. On Brexit, Mr McDonnell said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would ""never"" step down if other opposition parties demanded it to form a coalition of national unity. He said: ""It won't happen. I think we'd form a minority government, seek to implement our manifesto and we'd expect the other opposition parties and other MPs to vote for those policies and if they don't we'll go back to the country. ""If they want to vote against a real living wage, if they want to vote against Â£70bn worth of investment in Scottish infrastructure, if they want to vote against a green industrial revolution to tackle climate change then so be it, we'll go back to the people and then let them explain to the people why they wouldn't support those policies."" ""We want to change the world, we're not going be held back by other parties."" The senior Labour frontbencher said he was ""extremely worried"" about new Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He added: ""I think he's reckless and I think he's unstable and I will move heaven and Earth to stop a no-deal Brexit.""

"Chris Hemsworth as Thor in Avengers: Endgame Walt Disney's latest profit has failed to impress Wall Street, despite producing blockbuster movie hits including Avengers: Endgame and Toy Story 4. Disney's shares fell 5% in after-hours trading when the firm posted figures that missed analysts' forecasts. Profits at the entertainment giant fell 51% to $1.4bn in the last three months, despite revenues rising 33% to $20.2bn. Avengers has become the biggest grossing movie ever, beating Avatar. But profits from a string of movie hits, including Aladdin, failed to offset other costs at the company. In March, Disney bought the TV and film assets of 21st Century Fox for $71bn. Disney chairman and chief executive Robert Iger said the third quarter results ""reflect our efforts to effectively integrate the 21st Century Fox"". The company is also gearing up for a new digital streaming service, Disney+, which it is launching in November to challenge Netflix. Costs to build online services will weigh on profits for several years, the company has said. Streaming competitors from AT&T's Warner Media and Comcast's NBC Universal are expected next year. Disney's direct-to-consumer and international unit reported an operating loss of $553m, up from $168m a year earlier, from consolidation of Hulu and spending on Disney+ and the ESPN streaming service. At the theme parks unit, overall operating income rose 4% to $1.7bn but fell at Disney's US parks. The company attributed the drop to expenses for an ambitious Star Wars-themed expansion in late May at California's Disneyland and lower attendance. Media networks, which includes ESPN, the Disney Channels and FX, reported a 7% increase in operating income to $2.1bn.
