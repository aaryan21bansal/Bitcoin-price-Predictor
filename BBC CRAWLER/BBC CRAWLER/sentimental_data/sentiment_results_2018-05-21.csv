"This video can not be played Stories of moped crime from victims and police Police drivers will have more legal protection if they are involved in a crash, in a bid to tackle criminals on mopeds, as part of Home Office plans. New proposals aim to smash the ""myth"" that officers cannot pursue riders who are not wearing helmets. ""Criminals must not think they can get away with a crime by riding or driving in a certain way,"" policing minister Nick Hurd said. The Police Federation, which has called for the changes, welcomed the reforms. But the federation's roads policing lead Tim Rogers urged government to ""act quickly to prevent more officers suffering unnecessary and often mendacious prosecutions"". The reforms - which would affect forces in England and Wales - follow concerns among officers that they risk prosecution for careless or dangerous driving if they chase criminals at high speed, particularly those on mopeds and motorcycles. Moped crime: 'Change in law intended' Moped crime up 30 times in five years Under current rules, any motorist - including police officers - who fails to drive in a ""competent and careful"" manner can be prosecuted for careless or dangerous driving. Use our tool to see how badly your neighbourhood is affected (London only).  Or select from           Since 2012, by far the most common type of crime has been theft and handling with 30,387 offences - around three quarters of the total:  If you cannot view the postcode search, please clickhereto reload the page. The Police Federation argues this deters some officers from pursuing suspects - because they are worried they will be investigated and charged if they have to break the speed limit, jump red lights or drive on the wrong side of the road. The overhaul of the law follows a surge in crimes involving scooters and motorbikes in the last three years,particularly in London. Common moped crimes include snatching phones, but some people have been slashed with knives and weapons by drivers too. By BBC Reality Check There's no specific rule which forces the police from calling off a pursuit. Instead it's up to police forces to issue guidance to officers. The Home Office consultation says ""we have seen how criminals' perception of well-intentioned local guidance around pursuing motorcycle riders not wearing crash helmets has contributed to an increase in motorcycle-related crime, particularly in London"". The Metropolitan Police said that if a suspect removes their helmet they can still pursue, while ""taking advice from the pursuit tactical adviser"". Joy Merriam, a solicitor advocate, told Reality Check it comes down to a value judgement: ""If the police pursue someone who is not wearing a helmet they have to weigh up the risk of the suspect getting injured. Officers have to consider things like: how built up the area is, whether the speed is appropriate to the conditions and the risk to pedestrians."" Under the government's proposals, published on the first day of the annual conference of the Police Federation, rules would be changed to take into account police drivers' high level of training. Police would instead be subject to a separate test requiring an officer to drive in a way that is necessary and proportionate to the circumstances. ""Our proposed changes will make sure that skilled police drivers who follow their rigorous training are protected, while ensuring the minority of officers who do cross the line are robustly held to account,"" Policing Minister Nick Hurd said. The rules will also make clear that a moped or motorcycle rider who does not wear a helmet is responsible for their own decision to drive dangerously. In 2016-17 there were about 10,000 police pursuits and 500,000 blue-light responses in England and Wales.

"This video can not be played US vows 'unprecedented pressure on Iran' Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the US is imposing the ""strongest sanctions in history"" on Iran. In a speech in Washington, America's top diplomat said Iran would be ""battling to keep its economy alive"" after the sanctions took effect. His Iranian counterpart said the US was a prisoner of its ""failed policies"" and would suffer the consequences. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump took the US out of the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said Mr Pompeo had not demonstrated in his speech how abandoning the deal made the region safer from the threat of nuclear proliferation. Could the Iran deal collapse? Does US 'Plan B' on Iran risk war? The impact of Iran sanctions - in charts US sanctions lifted after the 2015 deal will be re-imposed, Mr Pompeo said, and those and new measures will together constitute ""unprecedented financial pressure on the Iranian regime"". Danish shipping giant Maersk has said it will stop doing business in Iran The older American sanctions prohibited almost all trade with Iran, making some exceptions only for activity ""intended to benefit the Iranian people"" such as the export of medical and agricultural equipment. The secretary of state did not say what new measures Washington was contemplating but he described sanctions imposed last week on the head of Iran's central bank as ""just the beginning"". Some of Europe's biggest firms who rushed to do business with Iran after the nuclear deal now find themselves forced to choose between investing there or trading with the US. What is the nuclear accord? Some of the biggest contracts at risk include: French energy giant Total's deal, worth up to $5bn, signed to help Iran develop the world's largest gas field. Total now plans to unwind those operations by November unless the US grants it a waiver Norwegian firm Saga Energy's $3bn deal to build solar power plants An Airbus deal to sell 100 jets to IranAir Iran is one of the world's largest oil producers, and the export of oil and gas is worth billions of dollars each year. Both the country's oil output and its GDP fell noticeably under international sanctions. The sanctions will not be re-imposed on Tehran immediately but are subject to three-month and six-month wind-down periods. ""Iran will never again have carte blanche to dominate the Middle East,"" Mr Pompeo said. Javad Zarif said America was ""regressing to old habits"". Iran, he added, was working with the other partners of the nuclear deal to find a solution. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Mogherini said there was ""no alternative"" to the JCPOA. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent This then is the US ""Plan B"" for Iran - to step up the sanctions pressure, to force the Tehran government into a new diplomatic deal.  It would need to accept broader constraints not just on its nuclear activities but also on its missile programme and wider behaviour in the region. It is certainly tough but may be totally unrealistic. For sanctions to work they must be comprehensive. The pressure that brought about the JCPOA deal that President Trump has now abandoned was long-standing and widely supported. Now Washington's European allies want to stick with the existing deal. Russia, China and India are unlikely to bow to US pressure. Compelling allies and other countries to abandon trade with Iran risks damaging a whole series of wider diplomatic relationships. Critics may charge that this ""policy"" is impossible - a diplomatic smokescreen intended to cloak a policy whose fundamental goal is regime change in Iran. Read Jonathan's analysis in full Mr Pompeo laid out 12 conditions for any ""new deal"" with Iran, including the withdrawal of its forces from Syria and an end to its support for rebels in Yemen. Others include Tehran: Giving the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) a full account of its former nuclear military programme, and giving up such work forever Ending its ""threatening behaviour"" towards its neighbours, including ""its threats to destroy Israel, and its firing of missiles into Saudi Arabia and the UAE"" Releasing all US citizens, and those of US partners and allies, ""detained on spurious charges or missing in Iran"" This video can not be played Iran nuclear deal: Trump announces US pull-out It has spread its influence across parts of the Middle East where there are large communities of fellow Shia Muslims, from Iraq to Lebanon. Its support for Lebanon's Hezbollah movement is particularly alarming for Israel while Saudi Arabia, another bitter enemy, accuses the Iranians of equipping rebels in Yemen. In the Syrian civil war, it is one of President Bashar al-Assad's few outside allies, sending thousands of fighters and military advisers. Israel v Iran in 300 words Lebanon caught in Saudi-Iran tension Israel praised the Trump administration's decision to pull out of the pact but the move was roundly criticised by fellow signatories, including France, Germany, the UK and Russia. All of the above signatories pledged to honour their commitments under the deal. Mr Pompeo has made clear he expects the backing of his allies in Europe but also called for support from ""Australia, Bahrain, Egypt, India, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea [and] the UAE"". ""We welcome any nation which is sick and tired of the nuclear threats, the terrorism, the missile proliferation and the brutality of a regime at peace with inflicting chaos on innocent people,"" he said. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) saw Iran agree to limit the size of its stockpile of enriched uranium - which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons - for 15 years and the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium for 10 years. This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? Iran also agreed to modify a heavy water facility so it could not produce plutonium suitable for a bomb. In return, sanctions imposed by the UN, US and EU that had crippled Iran's economy were lifted. The deal was agreed between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, China and Russia - plus Germany.

Contents of the bags include the order of service booklet and a tube of ""handbag shortbread"". One listing reads: ""Don't miss out on this limited once in a life time opportunity to have a piece of royal history."" Another, seemingly posted by the Swindon Night Shelter, promised all proceeds would go towards meeting ""the complex needs of those homeless and vulnerable in Swindon and the surrounding area"". Other items given to the guests include a bottle of water, a chocolate coin, a fridge magnet, a badge and a 20% off voucher for the Windsor Castle gift shop.

The 40-year-old said she had become a ""lab rat"", in her latest post, after starting her first trial last week. She also revealed she was out with her young son when she received a call with the news that her cancer was incurable. Bland, who also co-hosts the podcast You, Me and the Big C, was diagnosed with breast cancer in November 2016. She had months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in 2017 but required more surgery earlier this year after discovering cancer had spread to her lymph nodes. Allow Twitter content?

Bland told the BBC she had been ""absolutely overwhelmed by all the wonderful messages"", adding that ""whatever happens, I feel like I have such amazing support from everyone"". After going through a strict screening process, Bland started immunotherapy - which works by harnessing the immune system to destroy cancer cells - at the Christie Hospital in Manchester last Wednesday. She is taking a new trial drug that is designed to make immunotherapy - usually used for other cancers - more effective in treating breast cancer. It was very early in the process, she said, but she felt ""an odd sense of pride"" that she was one of fewer than 150 people in the world to test it. ""If it doesn't help me then I hope the data I provide will at some point in the future help others in the same position,"" she added. ""I feel a bit like a grenade with the pin outâ¦ just waiting for some odd sensations to appear. Tick tock."" She said she will stay on the trial if, when she has a scan in six weeks, the cancer is stable or has shrunk, or if it has grown by more than 20% she will be put on a different trial.

"Our modern germ-free life is the cause of the most common type of cancer in children, according to one of Britain's most eminent scientists. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia affects one in 2,000 children. Prof Mel Greaves, from the Institute of Cancer Research, has amassed 30 years of evidence to show the immune system can become cancerous if it does not ""see"" enough bugs early in life. It means it may be possible to prevent the disease. The type of blood cancer is more common in advanced, affluent societies, suggesting something about our modern lives might be causing the disease. There have been wild claims linking power cables, electromagnetic waves and chemicals to the cancer. That has been dismissed in this work published inNature Reviews Cancer,external. Instead, Prof Greaves - who has collaborated with researchers around the world - says there are three stages to the disease. The first is a seemingly unstoppable genetic mutation that happens inside the womb Then a lack of exposure to microbes in the first year of life fails to teach the immune system to deal with threats correctly This sets the stage for an infection to come along in childhood, cause an immune malfunction and leukaemia This ""unified theory"" of leukaemia was not the result of a single study, rather a jigsaw puzzle of evidence that established the cause of the disease. Prof Greaves said: ""The research strongly suggests that acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has a clear biological cause and is triggered by a variety of infections in predisposed children whose immune systems have not been properly primed."" Evidence that helped build the case included: An outbreak of swine flu in Milan that led to seven children getting leukaemia Studies showing children who went to nursery or had older siblings, which expose them to bacteria, had lower rates of leukaemia Breastfeeding - which promotes good bacteria in the gut - protects against leukaemia Lower rates in children born vaginally than by caesarean section, which transfers fewer microbes Animals bred completely free of microbes developed leukaemia when exposed to an infection This study is absolutely not about blaming parents for being too hygienic. Rather it shows there is a price being paid for the progress we are making in society and medicine. Coming into contact with beneficial bacteria is complicated, it's not just about embracing dirt. But Prof Greaves adds: ""The most important implication is that most cases of childhood leukaemia are likely to be preventable."" His vision is giving children a safe cocktail of bacteria - such as in a yoghurt drink - that will help train their immune system. This idea will still take further research. In the meantime, Prof Greaves said parents could ""be less fussy about common or trivial infections and encourage social contact with other and older children"". Dr Alasdair Rankin, the director of research at the blood cancer charity Bloodwise, said: ""We urge parents not to be alarmed by this study. ""While developing a strong immune system early in life may slightly further reduce risk, there is nothing that can be currently done to definitively prevent childhood leukaemia."" This study is part of a massive shift taking place in medicine. To date we have treated microbes as the bad guys. Yet recognising their important role for our health and wellbeing is revolutionising the understanding of diseases from allergies to Parkinson's and depression and now leukaemia. Prof Charles Swanton, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, said: ""Childhood leukaemia is rare and it's currently not known what or if there is anything that can be done to prevent it by either medical professionals or parents. ""We want to assure any parents of a child who has or has had leukaemia, that there's nothing that we know of that could have been done to prevent their illness.""

"Unai Emery is set to join Arsenal after two years with Paris St-Germain Arsenal are set to appoint Unai Emery as their new manager. Manchester City assistant manager and former Gunners captain Mikel Arteta was strong favourite to succeed Arsene Wenger. Emery emerged as the unanimous choice following a recruitment process in which all candidates were spoken to. The 46-year-old Spaniard is available afterleaving Paris St-Germainwhere he won one Ligue 1 title and four domestic cups in two seasons in charge. Previously he guided Sevilla to three consecutive Europa League triumphs between 2014 and 2016. Meticulous, experienced, successful - and still a risk: Phil McNulty on Arsenal's surprise choice Emery announced last month he would leave French champions PSG when his contract expired at the end of the season. He was replaced by former Borussia Dortmund bossThomas Tuchel,who had also been linked with the Arsenal job. Emery's English is not completely fluent but the language barrier is not expected to be a problem. An announcement and news conference are expected later this week. After Wenger's departure was announced, the betting odds on Emery replacing him were at one stage as long as 66-1 - placing him behind the likes of former Tottenham manager Tim Sherwood. Other candidates included Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri and former Chelsea and Real Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti, as well as former Arsenal players Arteta, Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira. Cazorla to leave Arsenal this summer The recruitment process was led by Arsenal chief executive Ivan Gazidis, head of football relations Raul Sanllehi and head of recruitment Sven Mislintat - though the final decision would be down to majority shareholder and owner Stan Kroenke. Wenger, 68, left the Gunners at the end of season after 22 years in charge, during which he won three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups, including two Doubles. Former Arsenal striker Ian Wright on BBC Radio 5 live What's going on at Arsenal? Where's Unai Emery come from? I can't get it out of my head. You'd have thought that by now they would have known exactly what's going on. Emery has had loads of money to spend at Paris St-Germain and now has to come to Arsenal with Â£50m with a bunch of players who have been playing in second gear. His coaching ability will have to get going instantly and he will have to find some gems instantly. I wouldn't be disgruntled as an Arsenal fan about Unai Emery, I think the fact he's come out of left field when everyone's thinking 'it's going to be Arteta', that's the only problem. If we do see a difference in intensity, drive and consistency everybody will get onside and that's all Arsenal fans want to see.

"Rail passengers such as these at Manchester Piccadilly are facing continued delays Rail passengers are facing further cancellations and delays on a day dubbed ""Meltdown Monday"" by unions after new timetables were introduced. Great Northern, Thameslink, Southern and Northern have been affected by anoverhaul billed as the UK's biggest. The rail firms apologised for the disruption, saying changes would result in extra services on the network. The RMT union said there was ""a hopeless lack of planning, combined with a shortage of crew and fleet"". Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which runs Great Northern, Thameslink and Southern, warned passengers to expect disruption over the next few days. It has rescheduled every train since Sunday and a spokesman said it needed time to adapt, adding it was ""unfortunate but unavoidable"". The operator saw 160 cancellations (7% of the schedule) and 213 delays (12%) by 16:30 BST on Monday. Chief executive Charles Horton said: ""There have been some teething problems... For anyone who has been caught up in the disruption, I'm sorry."" Meanwhile Northern passengers reported delays and cancellations as about 90% of its services also changed on Sunday. It said a shortage of train drivers was to blame for problems affecting destinations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle. Northern admitted it had been a ""difficult"" experience for customers A changed timetable and a lack of drivers affected services in the north of England A spokesman said it had been a ""difficult morning"" for some of its customers and it was ""very sorry"". One in seven (14%) of Northern's services were cancelled on Monday morning, with a further 17% delayed by at least five minutes. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said the situation was ""appalling"" and called on Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to intervene. The RMT called it ""Meltdown Monday"" and said it should ""spell the end of the privatised chaos on Britain's railways"". Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said some Northern passengers ""had a torrid time"" and pledged to keep a ""close eye on crowded services"" run by GTR.

""Well that's a great start"" mumbled a commuter to himself as the next train was cancelled. I was at Harpenden this morning - a small commuter town in Hertfordshire.  And it has been one of the areas most angry at these huge timetable changes. Here they're losing trains between 07:00 - 08:00. This morning, in near silence, commuters wearily shook their heads as two services were cancelled. There were also delays. It was met with a stoical bemused resignation. Some were confused at the new destinations. And when trains did arrive they were absolutely packed and standing room only. It has been an extremely frustrating, difficult morning for the half million commuters who use these services. When I texted a friend to ask how his journey had been, he replied: ""Useless."" Commuters will hope things start to improve quickly. GTR said it was rescheduling every train in its franchise in an attempt to improve rail efficiency in the South East. It runs services to Bedford, Luton, Peterborough, King's Lynn, Cambridge, London King's Cross, London Moorgate, Wimbledon and Brighton. The timetable changes would mean a 13% increase in services across the GTR network - 400 extra trains a day and new direct services from 80 stations into central London, creating space for 50,000 extra passengers at peak times. This video can not be played Govia Thameslink worst for 'station skipping' Arriva Rail North Ltd, which runs the Northern franchise in the north of England, said its timetable changes would result in an extra 1,300 services added to the network. It said 90% of the services would be affected by the changes. Passengers have been advised to check withNational Rail Enquiries before planning their journey,external. Trains cancelled on new timetable day one Rail firm changes time of every train Major changes to Northern rail services Rail delays: How to get your money back Four GTR services were among the 10 least punctual in Great Britain. For the year to the end of April 2018, between one in four and one in five of their commuter trains were at least five minutes late arriving at their terminating stations. Thameslink trains, the only GTR service which does not appear in the top 10 for delays, arrived on schedule about 86% of the time. There are54 services in Great Britain measured for punctuality in figures published by Network Rail,external. The public performance measure treats commuter services as late if they arrive at their terminating station five or more minutes after their scheduled time. For long distance services it is 10 minutes. A GTR spokesman said: ""Due to the scale and complexity of the task, these changes will be made incrementally. ""This involves redeploying drivers and trains and changing operating practices to achieve a large increase in the number of services, carriages and station stops."" It has called the new timetable ""the biggest change to rail timetables in a generation"" and said ""we expect some disruption to services in the initial stages"". A spokesman for Northern also said the timetable change was the ""biggest change to local rail for many years"". ""This remains a significant operational challenge and we continue to expect some localised service disruption, which could happen at very short-notice. ""We are working hard to address the issues we faced this morning and are developing plans to help our customers get where they need to be this evening and for the rest of the week."" The RMT said it had reports from both Northern and GTR of a ""hopeless lack of planning, combined with a shortage of crew and fleet, which has reduced the Monday morning journey to a nightmare for many passengers"". General secretary Mick Cash said: ""It is our members dealing with the anger at the sharp end not the well-paid top brass from Arriva and Govia who are responsible for this Meltdown Monday on our railways. ""Both of these companies have sought to compromise safety and access by hacking back on critical staff and it is no surprise to RMT that they can't be trusted with the massive logistical challenges of bringing in new timetables."" The Aslef union said not enough drivers had been trained on new routes and rolling stock. An official said the union had asked the company to start training drivers last summer, but it only started in February. ""It's very sad. We welcome investment, we welcome new routes and we welcome new timetables if they work but believe GTR do not know how to run a railway,"" he said.

"This video can not be played âMy hip replacement left me in constant pain' Hundreds of patients have lost the first round of a legal battle for compensation at the High Court over allegedly ""defective"" hip implants. A judge ruled that manufacturer DePuy was not liable to the 312 patients who claimed they had been injured by the implants. Claimants say the metal-on-metal hips were defective and meant some patients needed more surgery than necessary. The Pinnacle Ultamet replacement was withdrawn from sale in the UK in 2013. And 312 people said they had had to have remedial surgery after it had failed prematurely. Lawyers for claimants alleged it had released metal particles, damaging the surrounding tissues and causing pain, difficulty walking, swelling and numbness or loss of sensation in the leg. But Mrs Justice Andrews said they had failed to prove the hip joint: ""did not meet the level of safety that the public generally were entitled to expect at the time when it entered the market in 2002"" ""carried with it an 'abnormal risk' of damage, as alleged"" And DePuy said it was ""pleased"" the implant had: ""met the standard of safety under the Consumer Protection Act and performed as well or better than other prostheses that were on the market at the time"" been ""backed by a strong record of clinical data showing reduced pain and restored mobility for patients suffering from chronic hip pain"" ""At DePuy, we have no greater responsibility than to the patients who use our products,"" it added. But lawyers for the claimants, Leigh Day, said they were ""extremely disappointed"" by the judgement and were in touch with their clients ""to see what next steps could be taken"". ""It is genuinely concerning that the DePuy Pinnacle metal-on-metal hip replacement, which no clinician would now use, from a product group the orthopaedic profession has rejected for the serious harm it can cause, is deemed safe by this judgement,"" they said. Last year, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said every patient with a metal-on-metal prosthetic hip should have regular check-ups to spot any complications. ""Although the majority of patients with these metal-on-metal devices have well-functioning hips, it is known some may develop soft tissue reactions related to their implant. ""The clinical advice we have received indicates patients will likely have the best outcomes if these problems are detected early, monitored and treated if necessary,"" the MHRA said when it updated its advice in 2017. About 56,000 UK patients have had a metal-on-metal hip device implanted. âMy hip replacement left me in constant pain' Video, 00:01:45âMy hip replacement left me in constant pain' Hip implant patients sue manufacturer Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Our modern germ-free life is the cause of the most common type of cancer in children, according to one of Britain's most eminent scientists. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia affects one in 2,000 children. Prof Mel Greaves, from the Institute of Cancer Research, has amassed 30 years of evidence to show the immune system can become cancerous if it does not ""see"" enough bugs early in life. It means it may be possible to prevent the disease. The type of blood cancer is more common in advanced, affluent societies, suggesting something about our modern lives might be causing the disease. There have been wild claims linking power cables, electromagnetic waves and chemicals to the cancer. That has been dismissed in this work published inNature Reviews Cancer,external. Instead, Prof Greaves - who has collaborated with researchers around the world - says there are three stages to the disease. The first is a seemingly unstoppable genetic mutation that happens inside the womb Then a lack of exposure to microbes in the first year of life fails to teach the immune system to deal with threats correctly This sets the stage for an infection to come along in childhood, cause an immune malfunction and leukaemia This ""unified theory"" of leukaemia was not the result of a single study, rather a jigsaw puzzle of evidence that established the cause of the disease. Prof Greaves said: ""The research strongly suggests that acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has a clear biological cause and is triggered by a variety of infections in predisposed children whose immune systems have not been properly primed."" Evidence that helped build the case included: An outbreak of swine flu in Milan that led to seven children getting leukaemia Studies showing children who went to nursery or had older siblings, which expose them to bacteria, had lower rates of leukaemia Breastfeeding - which promotes good bacteria in the gut - protects against leukaemia Lower rates in children born vaginally than by caesarean section, which transfers fewer microbes Animals bred completely free of microbes developed leukaemia when exposed to an infection This study is absolutely not about blaming parents for being too hygienic. Rather it shows there is a price being paid for the progress we are making in society and medicine. Coming into contact with beneficial bacteria is complicated, it's not just about embracing dirt. But Prof Greaves adds: ""The most important implication is that most cases of childhood leukaemia are likely to be preventable."" His vision is giving children a safe cocktail of bacteria - such as in a yoghurt drink - that will help train their immune system. This idea will still take further research. In the meantime, Prof Greaves said parents could ""be less fussy about common or trivial infections and encourage social contact with other and older children"". Dr Alasdair Rankin, the director of research at the blood cancer charity Bloodwise, said: ""We urge parents not to be alarmed by this study. ""While developing a strong immune system early in life may slightly further reduce risk, there is nothing that can be currently done to definitively prevent childhood leukaemia."" This study is part of a massive shift taking place in medicine. To date we have treated microbes as the bad guys. Yet recognising their important role for our health and wellbeing is revolutionising the understanding of diseases from allergies to Parkinson's and depression and now leukaemia. Prof Charles Swanton, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, said: ""Childhood leukaemia is rare and it's currently not known what or if there is anything that can be done to prevent it by either medical professionals or parents. ""We want to assure any parents of a child who has or has had leukaemia, that there's nothing that we know of that could have been done to prevent their illness.""

"The TV presenter had been riding in a charity event when the accident occurred in 2012 TV presenter Lorraine Kelly has had a tearful reunion with the NHS staff who saved her life after a ""terrifying"" horse-riding accident. To mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS, Ms Kelly visited St George's Hospital, south London, where she was taken after her fall in 2012. Kelly said she was ""close to death"" after losing three pints of blood. The ITV star paid tribute to the hospital's ""amazing"" staff, adding she owed an ""unpayable debt"" to the NHS. ""I'm just one of many that are helped by this incredible service on a daily basis,"" she said. Glasgow-born Kelly was reunited with consultant Sarah Krishnanandan, who was among the team who treated her after she was rushed in as a trauma call.

"This video can not be played Ken Livingstone: ""It's better for Labour if I resign"" Ken Livingstone has said he is resigning from the Labour Party. The ex-London mayor has been suspended since 2016 in a row over allegations of anti-Semitism following comments he made about Hitler and Zionism. Mr Livingstone said he did not accept he was guilty of anti-Semitism or bringing Labour into disrepute but his case had become a ""distraction"" for the party and its political ambitions. Jeremy Corbyn said it was a sad moment but it was the ""right thing to do"". Mr Livingstone, an ally of Mr Corbyn, has always maintained that comments he made about the Nazi leader supporting a Jewish homeland when he first came to power in the early 1930 were historically accurate. Speaking in April 2016, Mr Livingstone, who was defending MP Naz Shah over claims she had made anti-Semitic social media posts, said: ""When Hitler won his election in 1932, his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews."" Despite his decision to resign from the party, Mr Livingstone said on Monday he ""did not accept"" the allegation that he was ""in any way guilty of anti-Semitism"". Profile: Ken Livingstone Ken Livingstone 'cannot stay in Labour' Labour extends Livingstone suspension He added that he ""abhorred"" anti-Semitism and was ""truly sorry"" that his historical arguments had ""caused offence and upset in the Jewish community"". ""I am loyal to the Labour Party and to Jeremy Corbyn,"" he said in a statement. ""However, any further disciplinary action against me may drag on for months or even years, distracting attention from Jeremy's policies. ""I am therefore, with great sadness, leaving the Labour Party."" A spokesman for the Campaign Against Antisemitism said Mr Corbyn's decision to describe Mr Livingstone's resignation as ""sad"" had merely ""rubbed salt into the wound"". The group called for Mr Corbyn to apologise and added: ""The Labour Party's anti-Semitism problem seems to be growing, not receding."" Allow Twitter content?

Speaking later on BBC Radio 5 live, Mr Livingstone said his decision had come after he was warned ""some of the old right wingers"" in Labour's National Executive Committee had again been planning to call for his expulsion from the party. Labour MP Ruth Smeeth described Mr Livingstone's decision to resign as ""welcome"" but added his ""toxic views"" should have resulted in his expulsion from the party ""years ago"". Ilford North Labour MP Wes Streeting added: ""We must now make it clear that he will never be welcome to return."" Last week, shadow attorney general Baroness Chakrabarti called for Mr Livingstone's expulsion - signalling to some that the party leadership had now turned against him. He was awaiting a fresh disciplinary process due to start this week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Livingstone was expelled from Labour in 2000 after challenging the party's official candidate in the mayoral contest but returned to the fold later. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Livingstone's departure from the partywould be a relief to Mr Corbyn. ""Mr Corbyn wants people to believe that he is taking anti-Semitism seriously. While Mr Livingstone was still a member that was challenging to say the least,"" she said. ""Although he and Mr Corbyn were fellow political travellers for years, he had long passed the point of being helpful to his old friend."" ""After much consideration, I have decided to resign from the Labour Party. The ongoing issues around my suspension from the Labour Party have become a distraction from the key political issue of our time - which is to replace a Tory government overseeing falling living standards and spiralling poverty, while starving our schools and the NHS of the vital resources they need. We live in dangerous times and there are many issues I wish to speak up on and contribute my experience from running London... from the need for real action to tackle climate change, to opposing Trump's war-mongering, to the need to end austerity and invest in our future here in Britain. I do not accept the allegation that I have brought the Labour Party into disrepute - nor that I am in any way guilty of anti-Semitism. I abhor anti-Semitism, I have fought it all my life and will continue to do so. I also recognise that the way I made a historical argument has caused offence and upset in the Jewish community. I am truly sorry for that. Under Labour's new general secretary I am sure there will be rapid action to expel anyone who genuinely has anti-Semitic views. I am loyal to the Labour Party and to Jeremy Corbyn. However any further disciplinary action against me may drag on for months or even years, distracting attention from Jeremy's policies. I am therefore, with great sadness, leaving the Labour Party. We desperately need an end to Tory rule, and a Corbyn-led government to transform Britain and end austerity. I will continue to work to this end, and I thank all those who share this aim and who have supported me in my own political career.""

"This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow admits muttering 'stupid' 'as an aside' Commons Speaker John Bercow has said he ""respects all his colleagues"" after admitting using the word ""stupid"" during Commons exchanges. He said he used the word, reported to have been directed at Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, as a ""muttered aside"". He told MPs he had the highest regard for Mrs Leadsom's ""political ability and personal character"". But he said he would continue to speak openly and, at times, ""disagree"" with ministers on their Commons management. Mr Bercow has faced calls to apologise amid reports he used the phrase ""stupid woman"" in connection with Commons leader Mrs Leadsom during a row over the scheduling of a government statement on the nationalisation of the East Coast rail franchise last week. Commons Speaker facing new outburst claims In an unscheduled statement to MPs on Monday as Mrs Leadsom was about to take part in a debate, Mr Bercow said he believed the timetabling of government business had been ""badly handled"" on the day by the government. The decision to announce such a major development on the same day as Labour debates on Grenfell and Brexit was ""disrespectful"" to MPs wanting to speak on those issues, he said. Explaining what had happened, he said: ""Having expressed my displeasure on the matter quite forcefully from the chair, I used the word stupid in a muttered aside. ""The adjective simply summed up how I felt about the way that the day's business had been conducted."" He said he ""loved this place"" and held all his colleagues in the ""highest esteem"", adding: ""Anyone who knows the leader of the house at all well will not have the slightest doubt about her political ability and personal character."" Speaking later, Mrs Leadsom said she was committed to treating all her colleagues with courtesy and respect and expected the same pleasantries to be shown to all members.

"The fire ripped through the west London tower block on 14 June last year The insulation that burned out of control on Grenfell Tower had never passed the required safety test and should never have been on the building, a BBC investigation has discovered. Panorama understands the manufacturer, Celotex, used extra fire retardant in the product that qualified for the safety certificate. A more flammable version was then sold for public use, the programme believes. Celotex said it is co-operating with the police investigation and inquiry. The company said it could not comment further but wished to express its deepest sympathies to everyone who was and remains affected by the fire. But it has not denied any of Panorama's allegations. Panorama also accused Celotex of mis-selling the insulation with misleading marketing. The programme has been advised that the way Celotex tested and sold the insulation could amount to corporate manslaughter. The RS5000 insulation, which was used in the refurbishment of Grenfell, gives off toxic fumes which contain cyanide when it burns. Panorama understands that almost all of the 72 people who died at Grenfell were killed by smoke. Celotex's plastic foam insulation has been used on hundreds of other buildings around the country. Fire safety expert Arnold Tarling said he was shocked by the revelation: ""Well, words fail me. This is absolutely mind-blowing. This material is all over the place."" This video can not be played A University of Central Lancashire fire test for the BBC of the products used in Grenfell Tower shows the cladding core melting and lighting the insulation. The change in formula was not the only problem with the fire safety test that the insulation passed. The BS8414-2 test only showed RS5000 was safe to use on certain new build projects when it was combined with a specific fire-proof cladding panel. But Celotex knowingly misled buyers about RS5000. Its marketing suggested the insulation was suitable for use with other cladding panels and for tower block refurbishment projects like Grenfell. Neither was true. The company was repeatedly warned that its marketing was misleading, but it carried on mis-selling the product anyway. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Visual guide to the fire Grenfell Inquiry: What is happening? Panorama has discovered Celotex targeted the contractors who were refurbishing Grenfell and specifically offered its flammable insulation - even though the company knew it was going to be combined with combustible cladding panels. Matt Wrack, general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union, said Panorama's allegations should be investigated: ""If there are breaches of the law then those people need to be held to account."" Celotex said it wished to express its deepest sympathies to everyone who was and remains affected by the fire. It said it was co-operating fully with all the inquiries into the Grenfell Tower fire, including the police investigation and the public inquiry. This video can not be played BBC Panorama's Richard Bilton doorsteps the man that managed Grenfell Tower, Robert Black. ""We believe that the right forum for considering and assessing the many, complex and inter-related issues which arise in relation to the fire - and which require consideration of the involvement of all relevant parties - is through these official investigations. We do not think it is appropriate to comment any further outside of or in advance of that process."" When Panorama told Celotex that its actions might amount to corporate manslaughter, the company said: ""We fully recognise the seriousness of the Grenfell fire. It is for this reason that we believe the public inquiry and the police investigation are the right processes to consider the events leading up to the fire, and the night of the fire itself."" Phase two of the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire began on Monday The programme also reveals for the first time that the cladding panels and insulation used at Grenfell were never tested together before the fire. Robert Bond, chief executive of the main contractor Rydon, tells the programme that testing of the cladding system wasn't required because ""it was deemed to comply"". But Panorama understands the company had a legal responsibility to test the system for safety. Grenfell: Who is to Blame? will be broadcast on BBC One at 20:00 BST on 21 May.

"A small number of gift bags given to guests at the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding are being sold online. Nine auctions can currently be found on the website eBay - with some listings reaching more than Â£1,000. The bags were given to 2,640 members of the public invited into the grounds of Windsor Castle for the wedding on 19 May, but not the 600 chapel guests. Contents of the bags include the order of service booklet and a tube of ""handbag shortbread"". One listing reads: ""Don't miss out on this limited once in a life time opportunity to have a piece of royal history."" Another, seemingly posted by the Swindon Night Shelter, promised all proceeds would go towards meeting ""the complex needs of those homeless and vulnerable in Swindon and the surrounding area"". Other items given to the guests include a bottle of water, a chocolate coin, a fridge magnet, a badge and a 20% off voucher for the Windsor Castle gift shop.

"Cameroon's Arcangeline Fouodji Sonkbou is one of dozens of competitors and officials who went missing Around 50 competitors have remained in Australia illegally after going missing during this year's Commonwealth Games, a government official has said. Nearly 200 others hold bridging visas and are applying for refugee status. Australia has warned it will deport those who stay in the country illegally, after dozens of competitors - including many from Africa - disappeared from the competition. The numbers are a dramatic increase on other international sporting events. When athletes vanish from sporting events Malisa Golightly, from the department of home affairs, told a Senate committee on Monday that the government had ""had no contact"" with the missing athletes, but added: ""We know they haven't left."" She said that around 190 of the 205 athletes and officials in the country legally are seeking protection visas. The remaining number are applying for business or other visas. Australian media had speculated that anywhere between 20 and 100 athletes had absconded during the Golden Coast Games, which ended on 15 April. They included eight members of Cameroon's delegation, as well as participants from Uganda, Sierra Leone and Rwanda. This video can not be played Why some Commonwealth Games athletes overstay their visas Other athletes have disappeared during major international sporting events, although not on this scale. During the London 2012 Olympics, for example, 21 athletes and coaches vanished and many have still not been found. More than 80 also filed for asylum in the same period. And when Australia last held the Commonwealth Games, in 2006, more than 40 athletes and officials overstayed or sought asylum. Why some athletes 'desert' during games.

"Rail passengers such as these at Manchester Piccadilly are facing continued delays Rail passengers are facing further cancellations and delays on a day dubbed ""Meltdown Monday"" by unions after new timetables were introduced. Great Northern, Thameslink, Southern and Northern have been affected by anoverhaul billed as the UK's biggest. The rail firms apologised for the disruption, saying changes would result in extra services on the network. The RMT union said there was ""a hopeless lack of planning, combined with a shortage of crew and fleet"". Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which runs Great Northern, Thameslink and Southern, warned passengers to expect disruption over the next few days. It has rescheduled every train since Sunday and a spokesman said it needed time to adapt, adding it was ""unfortunate but unavoidable"". The operator saw 160 cancellations (7% of the schedule) and 213 delays (12%) by 16:30 BST on Monday. Chief executive Charles Horton said: ""There have been some teething problems... For anyone who has been caught up in the disruption, I'm sorry."" Meanwhile Northern passengers reported delays and cancellations as about 90% of its services also changed on Sunday. It said a shortage of train drivers was to blame for problems affecting destinations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle. Northern admitted it had been a ""difficult"" experience for customers A changed timetable and a lack of drivers affected services in the north of England A spokesman said it had been a ""difficult morning"" for some of its customers and it was ""very sorry"". One in seven (14%) of Northern's services were cancelled on Monday morning, with a further 17% delayed by at least five minutes. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said the situation was ""appalling"" and called on Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to intervene.

""Well that's a great start"" mumbled a commuter to himself as the next train was cancelled. I was at Harpenden this morning - a small commuter town in Hertfordshire.  And it has been one of the areas most angry at these huge timetable changes. Here they're losing trains between 07:00 - 08:00. This morning, in near silence, commuters wearily shook their heads as two services were cancelled. There were also delays. It was met with a stoical bemused resignation. Some were confused at the new destinations. And when trains did arrive they were absolutely packed and standing room only. It has been an extremely frustrating, difficult morning for the half million commuters who use these services. When I texted a friend to ask how his journey had been, he replied: ""Useless."" Commuters will hope things start to improve quickly. GTR said it was rescheduling every train in its franchise in an attempt to improve rail efficiency in the South East. It runs services to Bedford, Luton, Peterborough, King's Lynn, Cambridge, London King's Cross, London Moorgate, Wimbledon and Brighton. The timetable changes would mean a 13% increase in services across the GTR network - 400 extra trains a day and new direct services from 80 stations into central London, creating space for 50,000 extra passengers at peak times. This video can not be played Govia Thameslink worst for 'station skipping' Arriva Rail North Ltd, which runs the Northern franchise in the north of England, said its timetable changes would result in an extra 1,300 services added to the network.

Trains cancelled on new timetable day one Rail firm changes time of every train Major changes to Northern rail services Rail delays: How to get your money back Four GTR services were among the 10 least punctual in Great Britain. For the year to the end of April 2018, between one in four and one in five of their commuter trains were at least five minutes late arriving at their terminating stations. Thameslink trains, the only GTR service which does not appear in the top 10 for delays, arrived on schedule about 86% of the time. There are54 services in Great Britain measured for punctuality in figures published by Network Rail,external. The public performance measure treats commuter services as late if they arrive at their terminating station five or more minutes after their scheduled time. For long distance services it is 10 minutes. A GTR spokesman said: ""Due to the scale and complexity of the task, these changes will be made incrementally. ""This involves redeploying drivers and trains and changing operating practices to achieve a large increase in the number of services, carriages and station stops."" It has called the new timetable ""the biggest change to rail timetables in a generation"" and said ""we expect some disruption to services in the initial stages"". A spokesman for Northern also said the timetable change was the ""biggest change to local rail for many years"". ""This remains a significant operational challenge and we continue to expect some localised service disruption, which could happen at very short-notice. ""We are working hard to address the issues we faced this morning and are developing plans to help our customers get where they need to be this evening and for the rest of the week."" The RMT said it had reports from both Northern and GTR of a ""hopeless lack of planning, combined with a shortage of crew and fleet, which has reduced the Monday morning journey to a nightmare for many passengers"". General secretary Mick Cash said: ""It is our members dealing with the anger at the sharp end not the well-paid top brass from Arriva and Govia who are responsible for this Meltdown Monday on our railways. ""Both of these companies have sought to compromise safety and access by hacking back on critical staff and it is no surprise to RMT that they can't be trusted with the massive logistical challenges of bringing in new timetables."" The Aslef union said not enough drivers had been trained on new routes and rolling stock. An official said the union had asked the company to start training drivers last summer, but it only started in February. ""It's very sad.

"This video can not be played US vows 'unprecedented pressure on Iran' Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the US is imposing the ""strongest sanctions in history"" on Iran. In a speech in Washington, America's top diplomat said Iran would be ""battling to keep its economy alive"" after the sanctions took effect. His Iranian counterpart said the US was a prisoner of its ""failed policies"" and would suffer the consequences. Earlier this month, President Donald Trump took the US out of the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said Mr Pompeo had not demonstrated in his speech how abandoning the deal made the region safer from the threat of nuclear proliferation. Could the Iran deal collapse? Does US 'Plan B' on Iran risk war? The impact of Iran sanctions - in charts US sanctions lifted after the 2015 deal will be re-imposed, Mr Pompeo said, and those and new measures will together constitute ""unprecedented financial pressure on the Iranian regime"". Danish shipping giant Maersk has said it will stop doing business in Iran The older American sanctions prohibited almost all trade with Iran, making some exceptions only for activity ""intended to benefit the Iranian people"" such as the export of medical and agricultural equipment. The secretary of state did not say what new measures Washington was contemplating but he described sanctions imposed last week on the head of Iran's central bank as ""just the beginning"". Some of Europe's biggest firms who rushed to do business with Iran after the nuclear deal now find themselves forced to choose between investing there or trading with the US. What is the nuclear accord? Some of the biggest contracts at risk include: French energy giant Total's deal, worth up to $5bn, signed to help Iran develop the world's largest gas field. Total now plans to unwind those operations by November unless the US grants it a waiver Norwegian firm Saga Energy's $3bn deal to build solar power plants An Airbus deal to sell 100 jets to IranAir Iran is one of the world's largest oil producers, and the export of oil and gas is worth billions of dollars each year. Both the country's oil output and its GDP fell noticeably under international sanctions. The sanctions will not be re-imposed on Tehran immediately but are subject to three-month and six-month wind-down periods. ""Iran will never again have carte blanche to dominate the Middle East,"" Mr Pompeo said. Javad Zarif said America was ""regressing to old habits"". Iran, he added, was working with the other partners of the nuclear deal to find a solution. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Mogherini said there was ""no alternative"" to the JCPOA. Analysis by Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent This then is the US ""Plan B"" for Iran - to step up the sanctions pressure, to force the Tehran government into a new diplomatic deal.  It would need to accept broader constraints not just on its nuclear activities but also on its missile programme and wider behaviour in the region. It is certainly tough but may be totally unrealistic. For sanctions to work they must be comprehensive. The pressure that brought about the JCPOA deal that President Trump has now abandoned was long-standing and widely supported. Now Washington's European allies want to stick with the existing deal. Russia, China and India are unlikely to bow to US pressure. Compelling allies and other countries to abandon trade with Iran risks damaging a whole series of wider diplomatic relationships. Critics may charge that this ""policy"" is impossible - a diplomatic smokescreen intended to cloak a policy whose fundamental goal is regime change in Iran. Read Jonathan's analysis in full Mr Pompeo laid out 12 conditions for any ""new deal"" with Iran, including the withdrawal of its forces from Syria and an end to its support for rebels in Yemen. Others include Tehran: Giving the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) a full account of its former nuclear military programme, and giving up such work forever Ending its ""threatening behaviour"" towards its neighbours, including ""its threats to destroy Israel, and its firing of missiles into Saudi Arabia and the UAE"" Releasing all US citizens, and those of US partners and allies, ""detained on spurious charges or missing in Iran"" This video can not be played Iran nuclear deal: Trump announces US pull-out It has spread its influence across parts of the Middle East where there are large communities of fellow Shia Muslims, from Iraq to Lebanon. Its support for Lebanon's Hezbollah movement is particularly alarming for Israel while Saudi Arabia, another bitter enemy, accuses the Iranians of equipping rebels in Yemen. In the Syrian civil war, it is one of President Bashar al-Assad's few outside allies, sending thousands of fighters and military advisers. Israel v Iran in 300 words Lebanon caught in Saudi-Iran tension Israel praised the Trump administration's decision to pull out of the pact but the move was roundly criticised by fellow signatories, including France, Germany, the UK and Russia. All of the above signatories pledged to honour their commitments under the deal. Mr Pompeo has made clear he expects the backing of his allies in Europe but also called for support from ""Australia, Bahrain, Egypt, India, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Korea [and] the UAE"". ""We welcome any nation which is sick and tired of the nuclear threats, the terrorism, the missile proliferation and the brutality of a regime at peace with inflicting chaos on innocent people,"" he said. The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) saw Iran agree to limit the size of its stockpile of enriched uranium - which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons - for 15 years and the number of centrifuges installed to enrich uranium for 10 years. This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? Iran also agreed to modify a heavy water facility so it could not produce plutonium suitable for a bomb. In return, sanctions imposed by the UN, US and EU that had crippled Iran's economy were lifted. The deal was agreed between Iran and the five permanent members of the UN Security Council - the US, UK, France, China and Russia - plus Germany. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful, and its compliance with the deal has been verified by the IAEA.

"Jailed British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is facing a new charge against her in Iran, her campaign says. Her husband said the 39-year-old, who denied the new allegation of spreading propaganda, was told to expect a conviction by the judge. The prime minister's spokesman said the government was urgently seeking more information from Iranian authorities. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is serving a five-year jail sentence in Iran after being convicted of spying. She was detained at an airport in April 2016 while travelling home with her daughter and was accused by Iran of plotting against the government. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, from Hampstead, north London, denies the charges against her and says she was in the country to introduce her daughter, Gabriella, to her parents. What is the Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Johnson 'must raise jailed Iran mum case' PM raises jailed Briton cases with Iran In her latest court appearance on Saturday, her husband Richard Ratcliffe said his wife asked the judge for leniency for the sake of her child. According to The Free Nazanin Campaign, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe said: ""She hasn't seen her father for over two years now. ""I have been a good prisoner for the sake of my baby, and I would ask the judge to close this new case and give me parole - so that I can go home and have another baby and have a normal life."" Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter Gabriella hasn't seen her father for two years Following her court appearance at the weekend, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was able to telephone the British ambassador to Iran for the first time in more than two years, her campaign said. It added that she discussed, with both the judge and the ambassador, a request for her to be let out on temporary release for her daughter's fourth birthday next month. The prime minister's official spokesman said: ""The UK government remains committed to doing everything possible to help secure Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release and alleviate her suffering."" The new charge came despite Theresa May raising her case, along with other British prisoners held in the country, with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. In a telephone call earlier this month, Mrs May had asked for them to be released on ""humanitarian grounds"". This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) Mr Ratcliffe has petitioned the UK government to help free his wife, making numerous media appearances and visiting Downing Street. In November last year,Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson apologised for telling a Commons committee hearingthat Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been teaching journalism in Iran - something her family and employer say is incorrect. Mr Johnson raised the case with his Iranian counterpart in January and had been urged to do so again, by the family, when they met last week.

"MPs want to see further sanctions against 'Kremlin-connected individuals' The UK has been accused of turning a ""blind eye"" to Russia's ""dirty money"", putting national security at risk. The Commons foreign affairs committee said London was being used to hide the ""corrupt assets"" of President Vladimir Putin and his allies. It said it was ""business as usual"" for the UK despite the poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. This undermined the UK's efforts to confront the full spectrum of President Putin's offensive measures, it said. The UK's ""lethargic response is being taken as proof that we don't dare stop them... London's markets are enabling the Kremlin's efforts,"" committee chairman and Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat wrote in the Sunday Times, ahead of the publication of the report. US punishes key Putin allies over 'malign activity' US targets Russians over cyber-attacks Security and economic crime minister Ben Wallace said he had not been called to give evidence to the committee: ""I fear such an omission weakens the foundation of the report,"" he said. Mr Wallace said the UK was ""determined to drive dirty money and the money launderers out"". ""[We] will use all the powers we have, including the new powers in the Criminal Finance Act, to clamp down on those that threaten our security,"" he added. The UK's efforts to confront President Putin's offensive measures are being undermined, MPs say Mr Tungendhat said ministers should investigate ""gaps"" in the sanctions regime which allows the Russian government and individuals linked to President Putin to continue to raise funds in the City. The report, named Moscow's Gold: Russian Corruption in the UK, points out that Russian gas giant Gazprom was able to trade bonds in London ""days after the attempted murders"" of Mr Skripal and his daughter. That business between the UK and Russia had resumed so swiftly prompted the Russian embassy in London to tweet: ""Business as usual?"" ""The scale of damage that this 'dirty money' can do to UK foreign policy interests dwarfs the benefit of Russian transactions in the City. ""The UK must be clear that the corruption stemming from the Kremlin is no longer welcome in our markets and we will act,"" said Mr Tugendhat. Andrey Kortunov is director general of the Russian International Affairs Council a think tank funded by the Russian state. ""I don't think we can argue that most of the Russian money which is parked in London is used to serve the interests of Russian foreign policy,"" he said. ""There are very different people, their stories are diverse and some of them are very strong opponents of the Russian leadership."" The committee's report urges the government to show ""stronger political leadership"" on the issue by taking a number of actions, including: Further sanctions against ""Kremlin-connected individuals"" Closing loopholes in the existing sanctions regime Speeding up plans to disclose transparent corporate ownership US punishes Russians over vote meddling US sanctions hit Russian shares US slaps sanctions on key Putin allies Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Janet is the first black woman to win the Billboard Icon Prize Janet Jackson made her stance on the #MeToo movement clear as she won the Icon prize at the Billboard awards. ""I believe that, for all of our challenges, we live at a glorious moment in history,"" she said. ""At long last, women have made it clear that we will no longer be controlled, manipulated, or abused. ""I stand with those women and with those men equally outraged by discrimination, who support us in heart and mind.""

She is also one of only four acts to score a number one album in each of the last four decades. The singer's hits include What Have You Done For Me Lately, That's The Way Love Goes, Again and Together Again As the crowd chanted her name, Jackson said she hoped faith could help heal the divisions caused by a tumultuous time in global and personal politics.

"Cameroon's Arcangeline Fouodji Sonkbou is one of dozens of competitors and officials who went missing Around 50 competitors have remained in Australia illegally after going missing during this year's Commonwealth Games, a government official has said. Nearly 200 others hold bridging visas and are applying for refugee status. Australia has warned it will deport those who stay in the country illegally, after dozens of competitors - including many from Africa - disappeared from the competition. The numbers are a dramatic increase on other international sporting events. When athletes vanish from sporting events Malisa Golightly, from the department of home affairs, told a Senate committee on Monday that the government had ""had no contact"" with the missing athletes, but added: ""We know they haven't left."" She said that around 190 of the 205 athletes and officials in the country legally are seeking protection visas. The remaining number are applying for business or other visas. Australian media had speculated that anywhere between 20 and 100 athletes had absconded during the Golden Coast Games, which ended on 15 April. They included eight members of Cameroon's delegation, as well as participants from Uganda, Sierra Leone and Rwanda. This video can not be played Why some Commonwealth Games athletes overstay their visas Other athletes have disappeared during major international sporting events, although not on this scale. During the London 2012 Olympics, for example, 21 athletes and coaches vanished and many have still not been found. More than 80 also filed for asylum in the same period. And when Australia last held the Commonwealth Games, in 2006, more than 40 athletes and officials overstayed or sought asylum. Why some athletes 'desert' during games.

"The diagnosis of cancer and other diseases in the UK can be transformed by using artificial intelligence, Theresa May is to say. The NHS and technology companies should use AI as a ""new weapon"" in research, the PM will urge in a speech later. Experts say it can be used to help prevent 22,000 cancer deaths a year by 2033 while aiding the fight against heart disease, diabetes and dementia. High-skilled science jobs will also be created, Mrs May is to pledge. Speaking in Macclesfield, Mrs May will say: ""Late diagnosis of otherwise treatable illnesses is one of the biggest causes of avoidable deaths. ""And the development of smart technologies to analyse great quantities of data quickly and with a higher degree of accuracy than is possible by human beings opens up a whole new field of medical research."" Eight ways intelligent machines are already in your life Artificial intelligence 'as good as cancer doctors' The prime minister wants to see computer algorithms sifting through patients' medical records, genetic data and lifestyle habits to spot cancer. BBC health and science correspondent James Gallagher says Mrs May's plans dochime with excitement within medical scienceabout the potential of using data and AI. But our correspondent added there are many challenges ahead including creating the right infrastructure within the health service, separating hype and genuine innovation and ensuring the public's highly personal data is used responsibly. Cancer Research UK says halving the number of lung, bowel, prostate and ovarian cancers diagnosed at an advanced stage could prevent thousands of deaths a year. The prime minister will also unveil a new strategy to help older people remain healthy Sir Harpal Kumar, chief executive officer of Cancer Research, described the government's plans as pioneering but added: ""We need to ensure we have the right infrastructure, embedded in our health system, to make this possible."" Simon Gillespie, chief executive at the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Using artificial intelligence to analyse MRI scans could spot early signs of heart disease which may be missed by current techniques. ""This could lead to a quicker diagnosis with more personalised treatment that could ultimately save lives."" Mrs May will also use her speech to announce a new target to ensure that five more years of people's lives will be healthy, independent and active by 2035.

"Flights from Luton Airport were delayed for longer than any other UK airport last year, analysis of Civil Aviation Authority data suggests. Planes left 19.7 minutes late on average, with Gatwick, Jersey and Durham Tees Valley next worst. The top performers were Heathrow - flights were 11 minutes late - Leeds Bradford, Belfast City and London City. Scheduled and charter flights, but not cancelled services, from the 25 busiest airports were examined in the study. Flying home: The longest flight delays revealed Delays warning over air traffic change The Press Association, which compiled the departure punctuality ranking, said flights across all airports left an average of 15 minutes late. The CAA said the data allows passengers to ""make informed choices about which airports they fly from"". But a spokesman for the Airport Operators Association said ""outdated"" airspace infrastructure limits the efficiency of flights. He said: ""Airports are working with air traffic service providers and the government to plan and deliver the necessary changes so everyone can continue to fly with a minimum of delays."" A spokeswoman for London Luton said factors outside its control had an influence on punctuality including air traffic control strikes, late arriving aircraft, bad weather and congested airspace. Gatwick said it was doing ""everything within its power"" to improve the proportion of its flights that depart on time, including using new technology to predict and recover from late running flights.

Part of the UK's strategy will see RAF Air Command given a key role in the control of military space operations.

"Ryanair has reported record annual results, despite it having to cancel thousands of flights in September due to problems with pilots' rotas. The Irish airline said profits after tax rose 10% to â¬1.45bn (Â£1.27bn), despite the wave of bad publicity. However, it warned higher costs would make the year ahead more difficult. The outlook for the coming year was ""on the pessimistic side of cautious"", chief executive Michael O'Leary said in a statement. The carrier, Europe's largest low-cost airline, said passenger numbers had risen by 9% to 130.3 million in the 12 months to the end of March, That increase was stimulated by lower fares, it said, with Germany, Italy and Spain the three largest growth markets. Ryanair cuts length of check-in window Airports with worst flight delays revealed EasyJet's new chief kicks off reign with positive news Ryanair said it expected to carry 7% more passengers in the coming year, but said costs would rise by 9%, including staff costs and the oil price. However, fares are expected to remain unchanged. Last year, mistakes with pilots' rotas led to about 20,000 flights being cancelled. Problems began after the airline admitted in September it had ""messed up"" pilots' holiday, leaving it unable to staff all its scheduled flights. Followingreports that pilots were leaving the firm, Mr O'Leary wrote to the Ryanair's pilots to offer them better pay and conditions. And in December, Ryanair said it would recognise trade unions, something the airline had always resisted, in order to avoid further disruption to flights over the busy Christmas period. Since then, Ryanair has begun to recognise trade unions on a country-by-country basis, and its Irish union is currently threatening to ballot pilots over working practices. Victoria Moores, European editor for Air Transport World, told the BBC's Today programme that Ryanair was a strong performer in the aviation sector, thanks in part to its success at filling aircraft to near full capacity. ""If you look at their load factor, which is the percentage of the aircraft that is filled, they are filling 95% of every aircraft on average."" A load factor of between 60% to 70% was more usual 20 years ago, Ms Moores said. But she added last year's crisis over rosters was prompting change at the airline. ""What we've heard in these results is a move towards pay increases,"" she said. Ryanair's statement said it expected the market for experienced pilots in Europe to remain tight, putting further upward pressure on staff costs.

"Rail passengers such as these at Manchester Piccadilly are facing continued delays Rail passengers are facing further cancellations and delays on a day dubbed ""Meltdown Monday"" by unions after new timetables were introduced. Great Northern, Thameslink, Southern and Northern have been affected by anoverhaul billed as the UK's biggest. The rail firms apologised for the disruption, saying changes would result in extra services on the network. The RMT union said there was ""a hopeless lack of planning, combined with a shortage of crew and fleet"". Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR), which runs Great Northern, Thameslink and Southern, warned passengers to expect disruption over the next few days. It has rescheduled every train since Sunday and a spokesman said it needed time to adapt, adding it was ""unfortunate but unavoidable"". The operator saw 160 cancellations (7% of the schedule) and 213 delays (12%) by 16:30 BST on Monday. Chief executive Charles Horton said: ""There have been some teething problems... For anyone who has been caught up in the disruption, I'm sorry."" Meanwhile Northern passengers reported delays and cancellations as about 90% of its services also changed on Sunday. It said a shortage of train drivers was to blame for problems affecting destinations such as Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle. Northern admitted it had been a ""difficult"" experience for customers A changed timetable and a lack of drivers affected services in the north of England A spokesman said it had been a ""difficult morning"" for some of its customers and it was ""very sorry"". One in seven (14%) of Northern's services were cancelled on Monday morning, with a further 17% delayed by at least five minutes. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said the situation was ""appalling"" and called on Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to intervene. The RMT called it ""Meltdown Monday"" and said it should ""spell the end of the privatised chaos on Britain's railways"". Anthony Smith, chief executive of passenger watchdog Transport Focus, said some Northern passengers ""had a torrid time"" and pledged to keep a ""close eye on crowded services"" run by GTR.

""Well that's a great start"" mumbled a commuter to himself as the next train was cancelled. I was at Harpenden this morning - a small commuter town in Hertfordshire.  And it has been one of the areas most angry at these huge timetable changes. Here they're losing trains between 07:00 - 08:00. This morning, in near silence, commuters wearily shook their heads as two services were cancelled. There were also delays. It was met with a stoical bemused resignation. Some were confused at the new destinations. And when trains did arrive they were absolutely packed and standing room only. It has been an extremely frustrating, difficult morning for the half million commuters who use these services. When I texted a friend to ask how his journey had been, he replied: ""Useless."" Commuters will hope things start to improve quickly. GTR said it was rescheduling every train in its franchise in an attempt to improve rail efficiency in the South East. It runs services to Bedford, Luton, Peterborough, King's Lynn, Cambridge, London King's Cross, London Moorgate, Wimbledon and Brighton. The timetable changes would mean a 13% increase in services across the GTR network - 400 extra trains a day and new direct services from 80 stations into central London, creating space for 50,000 extra passengers at peak times. This video can not be played Govia Thameslink worst for 'station skipping' Arriva Rail North Ltd, which runs the Northern franchise in the north of England, said its timetable changes would result in an extra 1,300 services added to the network. It said 90% of the services would be affected by the changes. Passengers have been advised to check withNational Rail Enquiries before planning their journey,external. Trains cancelled on new timetable day one Rail firm changes time of every train Major changes to Northern rail services Rail delays: How to get your money back Four GTR services were among the 10 least punctual in Great Britain. For the year to the end of April 2018, between one in four and one in five of their commuter trains were at least five minutes late arriving at their terminating stations. Thameslink trains, the only GTR service which does not appear in the top 10 for delays, arrived on schedule about 86% of the time. There are54 services in Great Britain measured for punctuality in figures published by Network Rail,external. The public performance measure treats commuter services as late if they arrive at their terminating station five or more minutes after their scheduled time. For long distance services it is 10 minutes. A GTR spokesman said: ""Due to the scale and complexity of the task, these changes will be made incrementally. ""This involves redeploying drivers and trains and changing operating practices to achieve a large increase in the number of services, carriages and station stops."" It has called the new timetable ""the biggest change to rail timetables in a generation"" and said ""we expect some disruption to services in the initial stages"". A spokesman for Northern also said the timetable change was the ""biggest change to local rail for many years"". ""This remains a significant operational challenge and we continue to expect some localised service disruption, which could happen at very short-notice. ""We are working hard to address the issues we faced this morning and are developing plans to help our customers get where they need to be this evening and for the rest of the week."" The RMT said it had reports from both Northern and GTR of a ""hopeless lack of planning, combined with a shortage of crew and fleet, which has reduced the Monday morning journey to a nightmare for many passengers"". General secretary Mick Cash said: ""It is our members dealing with the anger at the sharp end not the well-paid top brass from Arriva and Govia who are responsible for this Meltdown Monday on our railways. ""Both of these companies have sought to compromise safety and access by hacking back on critical staff and it is no surprise to RMT that they can't be trusted with the massive logistical challenges of bringing in new timetables."" The Aslef union said not enough drivers had been trained on new routes and rolling stock. An official said the union had asked the company to start training drivers last summer, but it only started in February. ""It's very sad. We welcome investment, we welcome new routes and we welcome new timetables if they work but believe GTR do not know how to run a railway,"" he said.

"MPs want to see further sanctions against 'Kremlin-connected individuals' The UK has been accused of turning a ""blind eye"" to Russia's ""dirty money"", putting national security at risk. The Commons foreign affairs committee said London was being used to hide the ""corrupt assets"" of President Vladimir Putin and his allies. It said it was ""business as usual"" for the UK despite the poisoning of Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. This undermined the UK's efforts to confront the full spectrum of President Putin's offensive measures, it said. The UK's ""lethargic response is being taken as proof that we don't dare stop them... London's markets are enabling the Kremlin's efforts,"" committee chairman and Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat wrote in the Sunday Times, ahead of the publication of the report. US punishes key Putin allies over 'malign activity' US targets Russians over cyber-attacks Security and economic crime minister Ben Wallace said he had not been called to give evidence to the committee: ""I fear such an omission weakens the foundation of the report,"" he said. Mr Wallace said the UK was ""determined to drive dirty money and the money launderers out"". ""[We] will use all the powers we have, including the new powers in the Criminal Finance Act, to clamp down on those that threaten our security,"" he added. The UK's efforts to confront President Putin's offensive measures are being undermined, MPs say Mr Tungendhat said ministers should investigate ""gaps"" in the sanctions regime which allows the Russian government and individuals linked to President Putin to continue to raise funds in the City. The report, named Moscow's Gold: Russian Corruption in the UK, points out that Russian gas giant Gazprom was able to trade bonds in London ""days after the attempted murders"" of Mr Skripal and his daughter. That business between the UK and Russia had resumed so swiftly prompted the Russian embassy in London to tweet: ""Business as usual?"" ""The scale of damage that this 'dirty money' can do to UK foreign policy interests dwarfs the benefit of Russian transactions in the City. ""The UK must be clear that the corruption stemming from the Kremlin is no longer welcome in our markets and we will act,"" said Mr Tugendhat. Andrey Kortunov is director general of the Russian International Affairs Council a think tank funded by the Russian state. ""I don't think we can argue that most of the Russian money which is parked in London is used to serve the interests of Russian foreign policy,"" he said. ""There are very different people, their stories are diverse and some of them are very strong opponents of the Russian leadership."" The committee's report urges the government to show ""stronger political leadership"" on the issue by taking a number of actions, including: Further sanctions against ""Kremlin-connected individuals"" Closing loopholes in the existing sanctions regime Speeding up plans to disclose transparent corporate ownership US punishes Russians over vote meddling US sanctions hit Russian shares US slaps sanctions on key Putin allies Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"President Trump often starts his attacks - and announces political initiatives - on Twitter The US Department of Justice says it is expanding an internal inquiry after President Donald Trump suggested the FBI ""infiltrated"" his 2016 campaign. The department said on Monday it will look for any ""political motivation"" in its own inquiry into alleged Russian election meddling in the US. Mr Trump later backed the move after meeting top justice and FBI officials at the White House. He is angry that a confidential source was used during the investigation. And he has saidhe wants to know whether a member of the Obama team ordered such a move,external. But Democrats and members of the intelligence community have warned against unmasking a source because they say this puts lives at risk. Department of Justice spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said on Monday the agency's inspector general would ""expand the ongoing review"" of its applications to snoop on former Trump election campaign adviser Carter Page. The inspector general is being asked to determine ""whether there was any impropriety or political motivation"" on the part of US agents who conducted counter-intelligence operations of ""persons suspected of involvement with the Russian agents who interfered in the 2016 presidential election"". The announcement comes after US media reports suggesting the FBI had an informant meeting campaign aides. The deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein said action would be taken if any infiltration was found. ""If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action,"" Mr Rosenstein said in a statement. The president met FBI Director Christopher Wray and Mr Rosenstein at the White House on Monday afternoon. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coates was also present. After that meeting, the White House said in a statement the Department of Justice (DoJ) had asked its inspector general to expand the investigation. And White House Chief of Staff Kelly will set up a meeting with the FBI, DoJ, the Department of National Intelligence and congressional leaders to review ""highly classified and other information they have requested"". Analysis: Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America correspondent After meeting the president, the DoJ and FBI agreed toâ¦ exactly what they had already said they would do the previous night. The inspector general will expand his probe into the handling of investigations during 2016 election season to include any ""irregularities"" involving FBI or Justice Department ""tactics"" - language vague enough to be essentially meaningless. The ongoing internal review was already broadly defined, and the White House statement does not detail any of the specific allegations of misdeeds, such as ""implanted"" spies and FBI ""infiltration"", that populated the presidential Twitter feed over the past few days. Mr Trump's Sunday outburst on Twitter threatened to breach the longstanding firewall between the White House and the Department of Justice's investigatory operations. That particular bomb appears to have been defused - at least for now. Mr Trump's weekend outburst will probably be viewed by government officials as only the latest example of presidential frustration-venting. Congressional representatives, with the assistance of top intelligence agency officials, will gain access to sensitive details of the FBI's investigation into Russian election meddling. In the past, secrets in the hands of Congress haven't stayed that way for long. This time may be no different. Mr Trump first made the accusation that the FBI had sent a spy into his campaign team on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a 'hot' Fake News story,"" Mr Trump tweeted, adding: ""If true - all time biggest political scandal!"" The New York Times followed with an article that suggested there was, indeed, an FBI informant,external-  whose identity it did not reveal - who had been sent to speak to campaign aides but only after the FBI had received reports of ""suspicious contacts linked to Russia"". The informant - an American academic working in the UK - had made contact with George Papadopoulos and Carter Page. The Washington Post reported a similar account. Law enforcement officials have refused to provide evidence to congressional leaders over the issue. They have argued that doing so would put the alleged informant's life - or that of his contacts - in danger. Mr Trump could order the US Department of Justice - which has oversight over the FBI - to release the documents. Some Democrats are deeply unhappy. Senator Mark Warner, who is the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: ""Publicly outing a source risks not only their life, but the lives of every American, because when sources are burned it makes it that much harder for every part of the intelligence community to gather intelligence on those who wish to do us harm."" Special Counsel Robert Mueller is looking into Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 US election, whether there was any collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump team and whether the president tried unlawfully to obstruct the inquiry. All you need to know about Trump Russia story Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? According to the Washington Post, the informant has been aiding the Russia investigation since before Mr Mueller's appointment a year ago. The FBI opened the inquiry in the middle of the election campaign in July 2016. But it remains unclear how the informant first came by the information that led to his meetings with Mr Papadopoulos and Mr Page - and his wider role as an FBI informant. Robert Mueller has admirers on all sides of US politics As for Mr Mueller, the former FBI head has so far charged 19 people. Mr Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. But Mr Trump and his supporters have multiplied their attacks on the special counsel's work. Without providing any evidence on Sunday, Mr Trump demanded a stop to the inquiry - that he said was nearing $20m in costs and was composed of 13 ""angry and heavily conflicted Democrats"". Mr Mueller is a Republican. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"More consumers will use apps on their smartphone than a computer to do their banking by as early as next year, according to forecasts. Last year, 22 million people managed their current account on their phone, industry analyst CACI said. It has predicted that 35 million people - or 72% of the UK adult population - will bank via a phone app by 2023. By then, customers would typically visit a branch only twice a year, it said. CACI added that rural areas and smaller coastal towns would see the biggest increase in mobile users between now and 2023, owing in part to frustration over broadband access pushing customers towards mobile networks.

"This video can not be played NicolÃ¡s Maduro celebrates his victory Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has won re-election to another six-year term, in a vote marred by an opposition boycott and claims of vote-rigging. Amid food shortages stemming from a severe economic crisis turnout was low. The National Electoral Council (CNE) put it at just 46% but the opposition alleges it was even lower. The main opposition candidate, Henri FalcÃ³n, rejected the result soon after the polls closed and called for new elections. Henri FalcÃ³n was labelled ""a traitor"" by the main opposition coalition for ignoring their boycott ""We do not recognise this electoral process as valid... we have to have new elections in Venezuela,"" he said. With more than 90% of the votes counted, Mr Maduro had 67.7% - 5.8 million votes - CNE chief Tibisay Lucena announced. Mr FalcÃ³n had won 21.2% - 1.8 million votes - she said. With Venezuela's main opposition coalition boycotting the election, a win by President Maduro had been widely expected. What observers were more interested in was to see how many Venezuelans would turn out to vote. Turnout was low and many polling stations appeared deserted The CNE said turnout would probably rise to 48%, still well below the figure in the 2013 presidential election, when almost 80% of eligible voters cast their ballots. The opposition, however, accused the CNE of inflating its figures and claimed the real number was closer to 30%. A source within the CNE told Reuters that only 32.3% of eligible voters had cast their ballot by 18:00 local time, when most voting stations closed. To vote or to veto Under the Venezuelan constitution, the CNE is the official independent body responsible for overseeing and guaranteeing the transparency of all elections. CNE chief Tibisay Lucena. The opposition says it is dominated by Maduro allies It is made up of five members. The opposition alleges that four of the five are government stooges and therefore does not trust the body to be independent. Luis Emilio RondÃ³n, the one CNE member which has been critical of the government, said he did not recognise the results because ""Venezuelans' freedom to vote"" had not been respected. Mr Maduro and his supporters were jubilant. The 55 year old told cheering crowds outside the presidential palace in Caracas that ""the revolution is here to stay!"". Supporters of the president were jubilant and showed their backing by donning fake moustaches His supporters chanted ""let's go, Nico!"" as fireworks went off and confetti was fired in the air. He also mocked his main rival, Mr FalcÃ³n, saying he had been left ""groggy"" by the knockout victory Mr Maduro had achieved. And while on the one hand he called for dialogue with the opposition, he also told supporters that ""the opposition must leave us alone to govern"". Previous attempts at dialogue between the opposition and the government have failed. The main opposition coalition had warned that the election would not be free and fair. It said the poll had been brought forward from December 2018 to take advantage of disarray within opposition ranks and that some of the most promising candidates had been banned from standing or jailed, while many others had fled the country. That is why it called for a boycott. Mr FalcÃ³n however broke ranks, arguing Venezuelans should be given a chance to vote Mr Maduro out of office. But following the vote, he too alleged it had been rigged in Mr Maduro's favour, by abuse of the scanning of state-issued benefits cards used for accessing food. He has called for a rerun. By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent, Caracas Such was the expectation that NicolÃ¡s Maduro would win that his rivals admitted defeat, denouncing the result before it had even been announced. There was never going to be any result other than a Maduro victory - and Venezuelans knew that. It feels like most people here are no longer outraged. Disappointed, maybe, but it's par for the course in a country where political freedom feels increasingly limited. Mr Maduro has promised change in Venezuela - why he needed a second mandate to do that is anyone's guess. He's already been in the job five years. Added to that, change for the better under Mr Maduro is unlikely.

"The governmentâs ambition to clean up motor vehicles by 2040 is not ambitious enough, a leading energy expert says. Professor Jim Watson, head of the prestigious UK Energy Research Centre, said the target should be at least five years earlier, as in Scotland. The government is currently considering obliging new cars to run on electricity for at least 50 miles by 2040. The government said it would not discuss the issue before it had published its policy which is due soon. But ministers are facing competing pressures on the issue. Some UK car firms are telling ministers their proposed targets are unachievable, while others say the targets can easily be reached. Professor Watson, who started working life as a car engineer, says the motor industry has a history of saying targets are impossible, then suddenly finding new models to do the job. âItâs great that they [the government] are having a target, but it could be much more ambitious,â he told BBC News. âIf you push industry further they could go faster. âSometimes the car industry has done itself a great disservice by lobbying against environmental standards and then finding itself in trouble when the oil price goes up and people want cleaner, more efficient cars.â âThey should embrace it [a strong target] and ask government to regulate them harder.â Professor Watson was referring to the long campaign by US car makers against tighter efficiency standards â a battle that ended when the manufacturers faced bankruptcy because in part their models were inefficient. In effect, the US car firms were so successful with lobbying that they nearly lobbied themselves into extinction. Air pollution over London One UK car firm spokesman told me: âWe don't have a good record on this â the industry has cried 'wolf' too often in the past.â The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders told BBC News it rejected this suggestion. There is certainly a range of views among UK car firms about the advisability of the 2040 target. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has said publicly that it expects to meet the governmentâs current proposed standards long before the set date. A spokesman said: âFrom 2020, every new Jaguar and Land Rover will have the option of electrification. âThis (2040 target) is 22 years away - or seven new cars away for many new car buyers on a typical ownership cycle. We are confident that every new Jaguar or Land Rover will meet the proposed criteria long before 2040.â Nissan told BBC News it supported clean car targets. A spokesman said: âAs the pioneer of electric vehicles, we welcome plans that encourage people to switch to low or zero emission vehicles.â But other manufacturers discussing the issue on condition of anonymity told BBC News the proposed 2040 standards are ill-considered. One criticised the idea currently under consideration by the Department for Transport to force hybrid cars, by 2040, to have the capacity to travel 50 miles without burning fossil fuels. The car maker said this would require a much bigger battery entailing more weight and cost. That extra capacity would be redundant for most of the time for an average driver. The issue is causing headaches for many other governments needing to cut emissions that cause local air pollution and climate change. Indiaâs transport minister announced 2030 as a day beyond which only all-electric cars may be sold. But after a barrage of criticism from car firms, he rescinded the order, and Indiaâs policy is not yet clear. Tata Motors in Delhi did not want to comment on whether it could cope with a 2030 all-electric policy. What is certain is that in Europe and Asia, car makers are being expected to move inexorably towards low or zero emissions vehicles. The car makers admit they face uncertainty over the future. After decades of homogenisation of world markets, they may find themselves manufacturing electric cars to access the Chinese economy on the one hand and petrol SUVs for Texas on the other. Car makers think China will probably become a world leader in car standards â especially in cities. The UK car firms are in concert on one issue: the need for the government to radically improve the supply of charging infrastructure, and to increase incentives to buy low-emissions cars. They told BBC News ministers would need to move swiftly to accelerate demand for clean cars, or it would be impossible to step up production levels to the amount needed by 2040. Electric and hybrid cars currently constitute 1.4% of the current UK fleet. Of new sales, 4.7% are clean fuel â thatâs 119,786 out of 2.54 million cars sold last year. Mike Hawes from the SMMT told BBC News:  ""Vehicle manufacturers will increasingly offer electrified versions of their vehicles giving consumers ever more choice but industry cannot dictate the pace of change nor levels of consumer demand."" Environmentalists say this is a red herring â car buyers, they say, will buy whatever vehicles are permitted to be sold in the country at that time. The environment department Defra is concerned that their colleagues in transport at DfT have had their ambition dulled by car industry lobbying. One Defra source told me: âThey are chancing their arm. The targets for 2040 are not ambitious at all.â The DfT didnât want to address that comment.

What is certain is that in Europe and Asia, car makers are being expected to move inexorably towards low or zero emissions vehicles. The car makers admit they face uncertainty over the future. After decades of homogenisation of world markets, they may find themselves manufacturing electric cars to access the Chinese economy on the one hand and petrol SUVs for Texas on the other. Car makers think China will probably become a world leader in car standards â especially in cities. The UK car firms are in concert on one issue: the need for the government to radically improve the supply of charging infrastructure, and to increase incentives to buy low-emissions cars. They told BBC News ministers would need to move swiftly to accelerate demand for clean cars, or it would be impossible to step up production levels to the amount needed by 2040. Electric and hybrid cars currently constitute 1.4% of the current UK fleet. Of new sales, 4.7% are clean fuel â thatâs 119,786 out of 2.54 million cars sold last year. Mike Hawes from the SMMT told BBC News:  ""Vehicle manufacturers will increasingly offer electrified versions of their vehicles giving consumers ever more choice but industry cannot dictate the pace of change nor levels of consumer demand."" Environmentalists say this is a red herring â car buyers, they say, will buy whatever vehicles are permitted to be sold in the country at that time. The environment department Defra is concerned that their colleagues in transport at DfT have had their ambition dulled by car industry lobbying. One Defra source told me: âThey are chancing their arm. The targets for 2040 are not ambitious at all.â The DfT didnât want to address that comment.

"This video can not be played NicolÃ¡s Maduro celebrates his victory Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has won re-election to another six-year term, in a vote marred by an opposition boycott and claims of vote-rigging. Amid food shortages stemming from a severe economic crisis turnout was low. The National Electoral Council (CNE) put it at just 46% but the opposition alleges it was even lower. The main opposition candidate, Henri FalcÃ³n, rejected the result soon after the polls closed and called for new elections. Henri FalcÃ³n was labelled ""a traitor"" by the main opposition coalition for ignoring their boycott ""We do not recognise this electoral process as valid... we have to have new elections in Venezuela,"" he said. With more than 90% of the votes counted, Mr Maduro had 67.7% - 5.8 million votes - CNE chief Tibisay Lucena announced. Mr FalcÃ³n had won 21.2% - 1.8 million votes - she said. With Venezuela's main opposition coalition boycotting the election, a win by President Maduro had been widely expected. What observers were more interested in was to see how many Venezuelans would turn out to vote. Turnout was low and many polling stations appeared deserted The CNE said turnout would probably rise to 48%, still well below the figure in the 2013 presidential election, when almost 80% of eligible voters cast their ballots. The opposition, however, accused the CNE of inflating its figures and claimed the real number was closer to 30%. A source within the CNE told Reuters that only 32.3% of eligible voters had cast their ballot by 18:00 local time, when most voting stations closed. To vote or to veto Under the Venezuelan constitution, the CNE is the official independent body responsible for overseeing and guaranteeing the transparency of all elections. CNE chief Tibisay Lucena. The opposition says it is dominated by Maduro allies It is made up of five members. The opposition alleges that four of the five are government stooges and therefore does not trust the body to be independent. Luis Emilio RondÃ³n, the one CNE member which has been critical of the government, said he did not recognise the results because ""Venezuelans' freedom to vote"" had not been respected. Mr Maduro and his supporters were jubilant. The 55 year old told cheering crowds outside the presidential palace in Caracas that ""the revolution is here to stay!"". Supporters of the president were jubilant and showed their backing by donning fake moustaches His supporters chanted ""let's go, Nico!"" as fireworks went off and confetti was fired in the air. He also mocked his main rival, Mr FalcÃ³n, saying he had been left ""groggy"" by the knockout victory Mr Maduro had achieved. And while on the one hand he called for dialogue with the opposition, he also told supporters that ""the opposition must leave us alone to govern"". Previous attempts at dialogue between the opposition and the government have failed. The main opposition coalition had warned that the election would not be free and fair. It said the poll had been brought forward from December 2018 to take advantage of disarray within opposition ranks and that some of the most promising candidates had been banned from standing or jailed, while many others had fled the country. That is why it called for a boycott. Mr FalcÃ³n however broke ranks, arguing Venezuelans should be given a chance to vote Mr Maduro out of office. But following the vote, he too alleged it had been rigged in Mr Maduro's favour, by abuse of the scanning of state-issued benefits cards used for accessing food. He has called for a rerun. By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent, Caracas Such was the expectation that NicolÃ¡s Maduro would win that his rivals admitted defeat, denouncing the result before it had even been announced. There was never going to be any result other than a Maduro victory - and Venezuelans knew that. It feels like most people here are no longer outraged. Disappointed, maybe, but it's par for the course in a country where political freedom feels increasingly limited. Mr Maduro has promised change in Venezuela - why he needed a second mandate to do that is anyone's guess. He's already been in the job five years. Added to that, change for the better under Mr Maduro is unlikely. With international pressure likely to build after these results, and with a crumbling economy, his job is harder than ever - as are the lives of Venezuelans. As polling started, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced the election as a ""sham"" on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The US mission to the United Nations called the process an ""insult to democracy"" and Chile and Panama said that they would not recognise the result. El Salvador and Cuba, on the other hand, congratulated President Maduro on his election win. All eyes are now on the US to see whether it will impose sanctions on Venezuela's all-important oil sector, as it has threatened to do. The European Union and Latin American countries had also warned ahead of the vote that they would take measures against the government if it went ahead with the election. The exodus of Venezuelans leaving their country is expected to speed up further. According to International Office of Migration figures, the number of Venezuelans living abroad increased to an estimated 1.6 million in 2017 from 700,000 in 2015.

"President Trump often starts his attacks - and announces political initiatives - on Twitter The US Department of Justice says it is expanding an internal inquiry after President Donald Trump suggested the FBI ""infiltrated"" his 2016 campaign. The department said on Monday it will look for any ""political motivation"" in its own inquiry into alleged Russian election meddling in the US. Mr Trump later backed the move after meeting top justice and FBI officials at the White House. He is angry that a confidential source was used during the investigation. And he has saidhe wants to know whether a member of the Obama team ordered such a move,external. But Democrats and members of the intelligence community have warned against unmasking a source because they say this puts lives at risk. Department of Justice spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores said on Monday the agency's inspector general would ""expand the ongoing review"" of its applications to snoop on former Trump election campaign adviser Carter Page. The inspector general is being asked to determine ""whether there was any impropriety or political motivation"" on the part of US agents who conducted counter-intelligence operations of ""persons suspected of involvement with the Russian agents who interfered in the 2016 presidential election"". The announcement comes after US media reports suggesting the FBI had an informant meeting campaign aides. The deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein said action would be taken if any infiltration was found. ""If anyone did infiltrate or surveil participants in a presidential campaign for inappropriate purposes, we need to know about it and take appropriate action,"" Mr Rosenstein said in a statement. The president met FBI Director Christopher Wray and Mr Rosenstein at the White House on Monday afternoon. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coates was also present. After that meeting, the White House said in a statement the Department of Justice (DoJ) had asked its inspector general to expand the investigation. And White House Chief of Staff Kelly will set up a meeting with the FBI, DoJ, the Department of National Intelligence and congressional leaders to review ""highly classified and other information they have requested"". Analysis: Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America correspondent After meeting the president, the DoJ and FBI agreed toâ¦ exactly what they had already said they would do the previous night. The inspector general will expand his probe into the handling of investigations during 2016 election season to include any ""irregularities"" involving FBI or Justice Department ""tactics"" - language vague enough to be essentially meaningless. The ongoing internal review was already broadly defined, and the White House statement does not detail any of the specific allegations of misdeeds, such as ""implanted"" spies and FBI ""infiltration"", that populated the presidential Twitter feed over the past few days. Mr Trump's Sunday outburst on Twitter threatened to breach the longstanding firewall between the White House and the Department of Justice's investigatory operations. That particular bomb appears to have been defused - at least for now. Mr Trump's weekend outburst will probably be viewed by government officials as only the latest example of presidential frustration-venting. Congressional representatives, with the assistance of top intelligence agency officials, will gain access to sensitive details of the FBI's investigation into Russian election meddling. In the past, secrets in the hands of Congress haven't stayed that way for long. This time may be no different. Mr Trump first made the accusation that the FBI had sent a spy into his campaign team on Friday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a 'hot' Fake News story,"" Mr Trump tweeted, adding: ""If true - all time biggest political scandal!"" The New York Times followed with an article that suggested there was, indeed, an FBI informant,external-  whose identity it did not reveal - who had been sent to speak to campaign aides but only after the FBI had received reports of ""suspicious contacts linked to Russia"". The informant - an American academic working in the UK - had made contact with George Papadopoulos and Carter Page. The Washington Post reported a similar account. Law enforcement officials have refused to provide evidence to congressional leaders over the issue. They have argued that doing so would put the alleged informant's life - or that of his contacts - in danger. Mr Trump could order the US Department of Justice - which has oversight over the FBI - to release the documents. Some Democrats are deeply unhappy. Senator Mark Warner, who is the ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said: ""Publicly outing a source risks not only their life, but the lives of every American, because when sources are burned it makes it that much harder for every part of the intelligence community to gather intelligence on those who wish to do us harm."" Special Counsel Robert Mueller is looking into Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016 US election, whether there was any collusion between the Kremlin and the Trump team and whether the president tried unlawfully to obstruct the inquiry. All you need to know about Trump Russia story Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? According to the Washington Post, the informant has been aiding the Russia investigation since before Mr Mueller's appointment a year ago. The FBI opened the inquiry in the middle of the election campaign in July 2016. But it remains unclear how the informant first came by the information that led to his meetings with Mr Papadopoulos and Mr Page - and his wider role as an FBI informant. Robert Mueller has admirers on all sides of US politics As for Mr Mueller, the former FBI head has so far charged 19 people. Mr Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. But Mr Trump and his supporters have multiplied their attacks on the special counsel's work. Without providing any evidence on Sunday, Mr Trump demanded a stop to the inquiry - that he said was nearing $20m in costs and was composed of 13 ""angry and heavily conflicted Democrats"". Mr Mueller is a Republican. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Ms Valdez's suspected abductor Mark Hennessy was shot in Cherrywood in south Dublin by GardaÃ­ (Irish police) The woman abducted near her home in County Wicklow died by strangulation, Irish police have confirmed. A post mortem examination took place on Tuesday to establish how 24-year-old Jastine Valdez died. GardaÃ­ (Irish police) had been searching for Ms Valdez after witnesses saw the student being bundled into a car near Enniskerry on Saturday. Her body was found in the Puck's Castle area of County Dublin on Monday. According to Irish national broadcaster RTE,external, detectives believe she was killed within 45 minutes of being abducted. A blood-stained note found in the car driven by her suspected killer Mark Hennessy is to be forensically analysed. Mr Hennessy, 40, was shot dead by police in Cherrywood in south Dublin on Sunday night. Police are investigating Mr Hennessy's background. The Wicklow father of two had a previous conviction for assault a number of years ago, but he was also facing a drink-driving charge after he had been arrested last year, RTE reports. Officers thanked the public for their help with the investigation and appealed for privacy for the Valdez family. It was reported that Ms Valdez's purse was found by GardaÃ­ in the Rathmichael area of County Dublin on Monday morning. Jastine Valdez was last seen alive on Saturday afternoon Search teams were in Rathmichael and also searched an area known as the 'Scalp', while a walk on Killiney Hill was cordoned off. The Garda helicopter conducted an aerial search of the area while members of the Irish Defence Forces and Civil Defence were called in to help. It is understood Mr Hennessy was armed with a knife when he was shot. A Garda statement said officers had ""interacted with the driver"" of a black Nissan Qashqai in Cherrywood at about 20:00 local time on Sunday. It added that an ""official Garda firearm was discharged"" during the incident. The shooting has since been referred to the Republic of Ireland's police watchdog for an independent investigation. Officers searching for Ms Valdez had appealed for information about the suspected abduction of a woman on the R760 road out of Enniskerry, around the same time she disappeared. Mr Hennessy was a father of two from County Wicklow A woman walking along the road was reportedly forced into a black Nissan Qashqai, registration 171 D 20419, at about 18:15 local time on Saturday. A phone belonging to Ms Valdez was later found near the Powerscourt Estate in Enniskerry and the area was cordoned off for investigation. Police traced a vehicle to the man who was later shot An incident room has been established at Bray Garda Station. Sunday Times journalist John Mooney said that after the abduction reports, police viewed CCTV footage and traced a vehicle to Mr Hennessy. They visited his home in Bray, County Wicklow, but his partner said he was not there. Mr Mooney said there was no known link between Mr Hennessy and Ms Valdez. ""The words abduction and ransom have been mentioned to me, but some of the more established detectives working on this case are stating that maybe there's some connection that hasn't been established just yet,"" he said. ""But at the moment there is no clear link between the two.""

"Ed Sheeran says he has not given permission for his song Small Bump to be used by anti-abortion campaigners. The singer told his Instagram followers it was ""important"" that he let them know ""it does not reflect what the song is about"". He said he's been told that the song, released in 2012, has been used to promote an anti-abortion campaign. It comes just days before a referendum on whether tochange Ireland's strict abortion lawstakes place on 25 May. This video can not be played Why Ireland is having a referendum on abortion Small Bump, which comes from his debut album + (Plus), includes the lyrics: ""You were just a small bump unborn, just four months then torn from life. ""Maybe you were needed up there, but we're still unaware as why."" Writing on Instagram on Friday, Ed said: ""I've been informed that my song Small Bump is being used to promote the pro-life campaign, and I feel it's important to let you know I have not given approval for this use, and it does not reflect what the song is about."" Voters in Ireland are to decide on whether to change the country's constitution - which only allows for abortions if the life of the mother is in danger. If passed, the law would allow for abortions to take place up to 12 weeks of pregnancy without restriction. At the moment, a woman convicted of having an illegal abortion faces up to 14 years in jail. But they are allowed to travel abroad for terminations.
