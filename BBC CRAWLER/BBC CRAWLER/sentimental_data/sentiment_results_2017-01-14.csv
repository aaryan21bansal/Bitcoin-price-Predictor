"Theresa May's Brexit plan ""could see the UK quit the EU single market"", according to many of Sunday's front pages. ""May's big gamble on a clean Brexit,"" is the main headline in theSunday Telegraph,external, which reports the content of the prime minister's much-anticipated speech this week is being ""closely guarded"" by Number 10. But citing ""numerous government sources"", the paper says the prime minister is expected to indicate she is prepared to take Britain out of the single market and the customs union. ""She's gone for the full works,"" a source tells the Sunday Telegraph. ""People will know that when she said 'Brexit means Brexit', she really meant it."" TheSunday Times,externalbelieves Mrs May will try to reassure voters who backed the Remain side, by suggesting that she could strike a transitional deal on Brexit, avoiding ""a cliff-edge"" for British business. TheSunday People,externalhighlights what it says will be an appeal to everyone to unite behind Mrs May's vision for leaving the EU. ""The victors in the EU referendum have a responsibility to act magnanimously,"" the paper quotes pre-released extracts from the speech as saying. ""The losers have a responsibility to respect the result."" The NHS winter crisis features in some of Sunday's newspapers The winter crisis in the NHS receives further coverage with theObserver,externalreporting that ""a large number of hospitals across the UK"" have been cancelling some cancer operations since the start of this year. TheMail on Sunday,externalleads with the results of a Survation poll, which found that more than three-quarters of 12,000 people surveyed believed money from the foreign aid budget should be diverted to the NHS. The Sunday Times leads with a suggestion that Donald Trump is planning to hold asummit with Vladimir Putin,external, within weeks of becoming US President. It says he hopes to emulate Ronald Reagan's Cold-War deal-making with Mikhail Gorbachev. On its front page, the Observer carries a claim by the former Foreign Office minister, Chris Bryant, who says he's ""certain"" Russia istargeting senior British politicians,external, to try to find out potentially compromising details about their private lives. On the letters page of the Sunday Telegraph, 50 Conservative MPsurge the government to bring in tougher strike laws,external. They want walkouts on ""critical public infrastructure"", such as train and bus services, to be banned unless a judge decides the action is proportionate. TheSun on Sunday,externalreports that the rail company Southern is preparing to recruit 200 part-time drivers to keep trains running during strikes. First it was ""trousergate"", in which Theresa May's ""high-end"" wardrobe choices caused a storm, now she is to grace the pages of the world's most influential fashion bible. This is according to the Mail on Sunday, which reveals that the prime minister hasposed for the renowned photographer, Annie Leibovitz,external, in a fashion shoot for American Vogue. TheSun on Sunday,externalsays the aim is to make the Theresa May appear ""more personable"" to British voters. But the Mail on Sunday takes a different view and says it is part of a Downing Street strategy to cosy up to the new administration in the White House, after being ""wrong-footed"" by the presidential election result. ""Theresa knows she needs to raise her profile in the US,"" a source tells the paper. ""The Vogue shoot will form a central part of Operation Trump.""

"Olivier Giroud now has 13 goals from 18 shots on target Arsenal returned to the top four with a handsome victory at Swansea City, consigning Paul Clement to a demoralising defeat in his first Premier League game in charge of the hosts. Having initially been frustrated by their opponents, the Gunners led at half-time thanks to Olivier Giroud's powerful, close-range finish. Alex Iwobi's strike looped in via a big deflection off Jack Cork to double their advantage, and Kyle Naughton scored a second Swansea own goal when he turned another Iwobi shot into his own net. Alexis Sanchez completed the rout to lift Arsenal up to third in the table, while Hull's win over Bournemouth means Swansea return to the bottom of the table. Despite some encouraging signs early in the game, this was a stark reminder to former Bayern Munich assistant manager Clement of the enormous task he faces to steer the Swans to safety. By contrast, the ruthless nature of Arsenal's display - particularly in an extremely one-sided second half - will surely give Arsene Wenger renewed hope of mounting a serious title challenge. Wenger tips Swansea to stay up Relive Arsenal's thrashing of Swansea Reaction from all of Saturday's Premier League matches The Gunners' bid for a first title since 2004 had stuttered lately, largely due to an away record of one point from their past three Premier League matches on the road. Although they started slowly against the high-pressing Swans, the visitors settled thanks to a goal from an increasingly reliable source. Giroud started this game with 12 goals from his past 17 shots on target, and the France striker was clinical with his first effort on this occasion, seizing on Mesut Ozil's blocked header and firing the ball into the roof of the net from six yards. Arsenal took control from that point and a period of concerted pressure early in the second half saw the floodgates open. There was an element of luck about the second and third goals, but they were no more than the Gunners deserved for their dominance of possession and inventive use of it around the Swansea penalty area. The irrepressible Sanchez finally got in on the act after 73 minutes, volleying in from close range to score his 21st goal in 32 Premier League appearances. There was a certain symmetry to Clement's first league game in charge, coming as it did against an Arsenal side who had beaten Swansea 3-2 at the start of his predecessor Bob Bradley's short tenure. One of Clement's priorities is to improve the Swans' defence - the most porous in the top flight - and the way his players shackled Arsenal early on with their high pressing was encouraging. But after falling behind, the home side simply collapsed. They were slack in their marking and slow to react to the Gunners' movement, summed up by the space in which Sanchez found himself in the Swansea box when he scored the fourth. Swansea find themselves back at the bottom of the table and with a tough run of fixtures to come - Liverpool and Manchester City are two of their next three opponents. The threat of relegation is as startling a reality as ever. As he has often been this season, Chile forward Sanchez was the beating heart of nearly every Arsenal attack. An industrious runner and intelligent passer, he scored a deserved goal late on. Swansea boss Paul Clement:""It is very disappointing. The first half we were in the game and looked solid defensively, even though we did not do enough offensively. We got caught on the counter for the first goal. ""We had a big claim for a penalty. Looking back on it, it is a penalty. In the second half, we started poorly and then it was an uphill struggle after the first own goal. Arsenal showed how much quality they have offensively."" This video can not be played Clement curses Swansea's misfortune Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger:""The first half was very intense physically, they gave a lot in the first half and then our pace took over. They had problems containing us. ""In the second half, you could see we could create chances. Our transition and accuracy of passing was very good. We were fortunate with the goals, but the chances were there."" This video can not be played Arsenal dominated second half - Wenger Ex-England midfielder Danny Murphy:""Arsenal have missed Mesut Ozil for a few games but he made a big difference against Swansea. Ozil was exceptional in crucial areas of the pitch. ""He makes the right decisions nine times out of 10. Ozil gives that extra quality and class in final third. Arsenal are a better team when he is in it. Alexis Sanchez and Ozil together make Arsenal an exceptional and dangerous team. ""Paul Clement will be on training pitch as long as he can. He is a workaholic. He will be quite savvy in the transfer market. He will improve Swansea but whether it will be enough, we'll have to wait and see."" Ex-Arsenal striker Ian Wright on Swansea's penalty appeal: ""Swans boss Paul Clement said he thought it was a penalty. I didn't think it was. Ki Sung-yueng was searching for the (Laurent Koscielny's) foot and I think he kicks the foot. Those have been given."" On Sanchez's reaction to being taken off: ""He is disappointed. He doesn't want to be taken off. He's so integral to Arsenal. If Sanchez is not there, there is massive problem."" It does not get any easier for Swansea as they travel to Liverpool next Saturday (kick-off 12:30 GMT), while Arsenal host Burnley on Sunday, 22 January (kick-off 14:15). Arsenal have scored 27 goals away from home in the Premier League this season, at least five more than any other side. The Gunners have scored four or more goals in four away Premier League games this season, their most in a single campaign since 2002-03. Giroud has scored in each of his past nine starts, netting 11 goals in total. Sanchez has been involved in more goals (21) than any other Premier League player this season (14 goals, seven assists). Swansea became the first team to score two own goals in a Premier League match since QPR against Liverpool in October 2014. The Swans have conceded four or more goals in three of their past five Premier League home games, having only let in four or more in three of their previous 62 league games at the Liberty Stadium.

"Mr Trump scorned as ""fake news"" claims that Russia holds compromising material about his private life Every Russian knows what ""kompromat"" means. Now, thanks to a graphic section of the unverified intelligence dossier on Donald Trump, the rest of the world does, too. Sincethe allegationswere made public, the US president-elect has denied claims that he cavorted in Russia with prostitutes - and Russian officials have denied claims that they filmed it. This week, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin told me that ""the Kremlin does not collect kompromat"". But someone in Russia clearly does. And the sensational results periodically surface, either via the compliant state media or via the internet. Last spring was a case in point. A state-controlled TV channel, NTV, ran footage of former Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov in bed with his personal assistant, Natalia Pelevina. Not only was the material cringe-worthily intimate, it also revealed the couple bad-mouthing other members of Russia's notoriously divided opposition. The tape helped divide them even further. ""It was shot inside a private apartment by the [Russian security service] FSB, there is no doubt about it,"" Ms Pelevina told the BBC, referring to what happened as an ""obvious smear campaign"". Grainy video footage showed Mr Kasyanov with his personal assistant in a bedroom There is no evidence that America's president-elect was ever caught in a similar way. But Ms Pelevina argues that her own experience suggests that such an idea is not implausible. ""I would not rule out that the Russian FSB has something against Donald Trump. Because they collect those materials not just against enemies; they collect against so-called friends. Just in case it will come in handy one day,"" she said. Trump 'compromising' claims: How did we get here? Angry denials from the Kremlin Trump press event a theatre of the absurd 'Honey traps' target Russian dissidents Some argue that the FSB had no reason to ensnare Mr Trump before his presidential ambitions were public. ""What would have been the point?"" Frederick Forsyth, a spy author who worked for MI6 for 20 years, asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday. ""I don't think there's any indication that the man who was host of the game show Apprentice and builder of hotels was ever going to be anything important in the political world,"" he said. But a former Russian intelligence agent dismissed that logic. ""Donald Trump was never just anyone. He was always a well-known businessman, not just a tourist,"" the former operative, who asked not to be named, pointed out. ""You call it 'kompromat', but it's just information. Everyone does it. You British gathered it on [Mikhail] Gorbachev, we gathered it on [Margaret] Thatcher. So theoretically, yes, it's possible,"" he said. If Russian agents did gather such information, he said, then it would be no surprise that it got out. ""You can't be surprised by anything anymore, after Edward Snowden and after Wikileaks,"" the ex-agent said. That is one reason why many Russians are unfazed by the allegations. Another is that they have seen it all before. The most notorious victim of kompromat wasYury Skuratov,external. The then-prosecutor general was investigating claims of corruption in the Kremlin in the late 1990s when Russian TV aired a video entitled Three in a Bed. The grainy footage, which ended his career, showed a man resembling Mr Skuratov in bed with two women. The tape's authenticity was confirmed publicly by none other than Mr Putin, then head of the FSB. Prosecutor General Skuratov was sacked in 2000 after a video appeared to show him with prostitutes Then there was Mumu. In 2010, the part-time model befriended opposition activists and journalists and lured them back to her flat. Their sexual activities and drug-taking were all captured on hidden cameras. The films were then posted on the internet. And the technique has been turned on foreign targets, too. The British deputy consul-general in Yekaterinburg wasforced to step down in 2009after footage allegedly showing his own sexual encounter with two prostitutes was made public. The UK Foreign Office declined to comment at the time, only stating that it expected ""high levels of personal and professional integrity"" from its staff. The list goes on and the FSB is always cited as the prime suspect. The big difference with the claims of kompromat against Mr Trump is, of course, that his alleged video tape has not been made public. Trump 'compromising' claims: How and why did we get here?

"US intelligence agencies dispute that Guccifer 2.0 is just one individual Who or what is Guccifer 2.0? US intelligence agencies believe the mysterious hacker persona was central to efforts to interfere with last year's American election and responsible for distributing hacked documents that embarrassed the Democratic Party. But now Guccifer 2.0 has broken a two-month silence to deny any connection to Russia. In the run up to Donald Trump's victory, BBC Trending's Mike Wendling struck up an online dialogue with Guccifer 2.0 to try to probe the hacker's motives. It turned out that talking to one of the world's most notorious hackers was easier than you might think. Just send him a tweet. In the summer of 2016 the hacker, going by the name Guccifer 2.0, leaked a trove of documents from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to Wikileaks, which then made the material public. The revelations were embarrassing for the Democrats and the Hillary Clinton campaign, and resulted in theresignation of party chair Debbie Wasserman-Shultz. Although Guccifer 2.0 took his name from a Romanian hacker - the original Gucciferhacked emails belonging to American and Romanian officials,external, and is currently in prison - suspicion immediately fell on Russia. Metadata attached to the leaked documents was in Russian not Romanian. Analysts determined that Guccifer 2.0 had used a Russian server. A host of security experts traced the leak to Russian intelligence. Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai, a journalist with Vice's Motherboard,chatted with the hacker in Romanian,externalin the days after the DNC hack. The problem was, Guccifer didn't seem to speak the language very well. ""He did answer some questions in Romanian,"" but the answers were very basic, Franceschi-Bicchierai told BBC Trending. ""I showed those answers to people who did speak Romanian and they all agreed he wasn't a Romanian speaker,"" Franceschi-Bicchierai says. ""We later put the conversation to linguists and not everyone agreed that he was a Russian speaker but he was definitely not a native Romanian speaker."" Listen to more on this story on BBC Trending radioon the BBC World Service. During our exchanges in October - and until the present day - Guccifer 2.0 continued to deny having anything to do with Russia. He also claimed to have more incriminating documents on Hillary Clinton - documents which he urged me to publish. The information was sent to me via encrypted email. But despite the cloak-and-dagger presentation, the material was ultimately disappointing - a mishmash of old stories, publically available documents which were rather dull, and others which were obvious forgeries. I asked him about his motivations. He said he believed that people have the right to know what's going on in the election process. Trying to get friendly journalists to write sympathetic stories is a common tactic of Russia's online intelligence operations, says Lee Foster of FireEye, one of the big computer security firms which has been looking into the Guccifer 2.0 hacks. ""This is actually something that we've coined 'direct advocacy',"" Foster says. ""These false hactivists reach out to journalists but also other individuals, security blogs, and so on to get them to publicise the activity that they've been engaged in and sometimes even to spin particular narratives around those leaks as well."" Foster says he's highly confident that the Russian authorities are behind the Guccifer persona. For its part, Moscow denies being behind the leaks, and Julian Assange of Wikileaks says Russia wasn't the source of the leaked DNC emails. I asked Guccifer about Russia. After that, he stopped responding to my messages. In the run-up to the US election in November, Gucciferwarned that the Democrats,externalwould attempt to rig the vote. But after Donald Trump's victory, he went silent. Last week US intelligence chiefs released adeclassified version of a report,externalwhich has been presented to President Obama and President-Elect Trump. One of the report's key judgements read: ""We assess with high confidence that Russian military intelligence (General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate or GRU) used the Guccifer 2.0 persona and DCLeaks.com to release US victim data obtained in cyber operations publicly and in exclusives to media outlets and relayed material to WikiLeaks."" It added: ""Guccifer 2.0, who claimed to be an independent Romanian hacker, made multiple contradictory statements and false claims about his likely Russian identity throughout the election. Press reporting suggests more than one person claiming to be Guccifer 2.0 interacted with journalists."" So could there be several people involved in operating the Guccifer 2.0 persona? Lee Foster from FireEye believes so. ""It may be one person who actually looks after the twitter account or it may be part of a team,"" he told Trending. ""But what we certainly can say based on the scale of the activity that we're seeing - that encompasses everything from this initial breach all the way through to the creation of these fake personas to push the information through to the trolling activity trying to push narratives around these leaks - this is not a one person effort. There's quite clearly a concerted and very well resourced and frankly sophisticated operation that is making all of this stuff come together."" Late on Thursday, Guccifer broke his two-month silence to respond to the US intelligence agencies report. ""Here I am again, my friends!""he announced on his blog,external. ""I'd like to make it clear enough that these accusations are unfounded,"" the hacker wrote. ""I have totally no relation to the Russian government. I'd like to tell you once again I was acting in accordance with my personal political views and beliefs."" Several observers noted that Guccifer's English had markedly improved. Visit theTrending Facebook page,external Donald Trump has promised a full report on hackingwithin 90 daysof taking office. Lee Foster from FireEye says we shouldn't get too hung up on the Guccifer 2.0 brand. ""What doesn't really matter here is the personas themselves. What matters is to what extent does type of activity continue and potentially expand as well. We're already on the trolling side seeing  a redirection towards European elections coming up, particularly France and Germany in 2017,"" he says. After the report, and his blog re-emergence, I tried once more to contact Guccifer 2.0 on Twitter. He hasn't responded.

Abel is an important player for us."" West Ham 3-0 Crystal Palace Martin KeownFormer Arsenal defender on Final Score It was really important for West Ham to put down a marker, with the team on the pitch, who want to play and want to move on from this Payet situation. Sam Allardyce coming back to his old club was probably an added motivation and Andy Carroll looks back to his best. West Ham 3-0 Crystal Palace West Ham United West Ham boss Slaven Bilic:""It was a very difficult game for us, a very difficult week. But the team showed everything we asked for - determination, character. The first half was nervous but the crowd were brilliant. ""Second half we made a change at half-time and we were magnificent. We gave everything, scored three really good goals and were compact and solid. ""I can only congratulate the boys, they were amazing. And I would like to thank the fans who were magnificent. ""Andy Carroll has got it but he was unlucky in training when he was trying it - he was hitting the post or whatever. With his history of injuries I go a bit crazy when he does that in training because you don't want him to get hurt."" On Dimitri Payet wanting to leave the club:""I said very openly what I said. It needed to be said and to be fair now I don't want to talk about it. I can talk for ages about the guys who play, they deserved it.""  Sunderland 1-3 Stoke Sunderland boss David Moyes:""The first 20 minutes or so was really poor. All our own doing, terrible mistakes for all three goals.Â ""The players need to take responsibility and stop making individual mistakes, but I didn't think our overall performance was that bad. ""The fans left early because there is only one road out of here, not just because of the result. They actually leave when we are winning as well sometimes."" Watford 0-0 Middlesbrough Watford Watford manager Walter Mazzarri:""In the second half we had six or seven very good chances and hit the post so we were unlucky but Iâm happy with the performance. ""In some of the games we were not lucky at all and today we were very unlucky, the important thing is to keep playing and the victory will come."" On the tribute to former Hornets manager Graham Taylor, Mazzarri said: ""It was beautiful, there were a lot of emotions, everyone was emotional. ""We wanted to give this victory to this great person who passed away and that is the only thing we missed."" Watford 0-0 Middlesbrough Middlesbrough Middlesbrough boss Aitor Karanka:""It was not the best game to watch, for us it was a good game and we showed once again we are a consistent team. ""I would like to have had more chances but they are a strong team and we had to defend. ""We will score goals, we have good players and we created chances but sometimes it is difficult if you are playing against a physical team. It is one more point and a game we have to learn from in the future. ""As a coach until the 31st (of January) you are always expecting for something to happen, the aim is to finish the transfer market with a better squad than we have got at the moment."" West Ham 3-0 Crystal Palace Crystal Palace Crystal Palace boss Sam Allardyce:""We were the best team in the first half. But we couldn't score from two very good chances. You can't maker basic errors at a place like this.Â ""My problem is then the team holding their nerve and waiting for an opportunity because we know how nervous West Ham can be here, but we opened up too much. ""It's a terrific finish from Andy Carroll and he's always had that in his locker. The volley was outstanding. But he was all on his own, stood in the box and we had three defenders doing nothing. ""It looks like we haven't played very well today and of course we have for 70 minutes - 70 minutes is not enough."" Burnley 1-0 Southampton Allow Twitter content?

Who cares if they started well? The key for them is they need to get a couple of centre-halves as they currently don't have any leadership there or any defenders with a defensive instinct. Swansea 0-4 Arsenal Swansea City Swansea boss Paul Clement:""It is very disappointing. The first half we were in the game and looked solid defensively, even though we did not do enough offensively. We got caught on the counter for the first goal. ""We had a big claim for a penalty, looking back on it, it is a penalty. In the second half, we started poorly and then it was an uphill struggle after the first own goal. Arsenal showed how much quality they have offensively. ""We could have had a penalty and then two deflections went against us. I did see some good things but you have to do it for 90 minutes at this level. ""We have all got a difficult job on our hands and we have to work on the training field to get the basics right. We will have a better chance after that. ""We were wasteful with the ball, the team defended well in general, but we did not do enough offensively. ""It is not an eye opener, I know what this level is like. We have some good players and we are looking to do (business) soon. Martin Olsson and Tom Carroll are imminent and hopefully will go through without any problems. ""We need to put in some decent performances and be ready for the games we need to win."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"It's no secret that lots of people watch pornography on the internet. It's usually something done behind closed doors - but how would you feel about someone watching porn in public? The BBC's Siobhann Tighe describes a troubling experience on a London bus. It had been a long day at work. I got on the bus at 7.30 in the evening and it was cold and drizzly. All the passengers were wrapped up in thick coats, hoods and hats. Inside, the bus was softly lit and I was expecting to zone out on my way back home: just let the day go and switch off. I sat on the lower deck beside a complete stranger and didn't give it a second thought. I was just relieved to get a seat. As we meandered through the London traffic, my gaze was drawn to my neighbour's phone. I wasn't being nosy but in the dim light of the bus, the brightness of his mobile caught my attention even though he was slanting it slightly away from me. Although I didn't mean to or want to, I found myself looking over towards his mobile a few times and then it suddenly occurred to me what was going on. The man beside me was watching porn. Find us on Facebook,external Once I realised, although I genuinely didn't mean to, my eyes kept on being pulled back to it. I couldn't quite believe it. First he was watching animated porn, with the two naked characters in lurid colours repeating their movements over and over again. Then he started watching a film, which seemed to begin in a petrol station with a large woman in a low-cut yellow top and blonde hair peering into the driver's window. I didn't hear any sound, apart from a brief few seconds when my fellow passenger pulled the headphone jack out of his mobile, and then reinserted it. The man didn't seem to notice my glances towards his phone, maybe because his hood was hampering his peripheral vision. He seemed oblivious to me and others around him, who admittedly wouldn't have been able to see what I saw. We eventually arrived at his bus stop and because he had the window seat and I had the aisle, he made a motion that he needed to get out, and he muttered a ""thank you"" as he squeezed past me. I watched him get off and walk down the street. I felt uncomfortable and annoyed, but I didn't do anything about it. I didn't say anything to him and neither did he pick up on any of my glances or quizzical looks. His eyes didn't meet mine so I couldn't even communicate my feelings non-verbally and it didn't occur to me to tell the driver. Even if I wanted to, it would have been difficult to get to the front of the bus because it was packed. But when I got off, questions flooded into my mind about what I had just experienced. What if a child saw that? Are there any laws about looking at porn in public spaces? If there are laws, how easy are they to enforce? Why did this passenger feel public transport was an appropriate place to watch porn, and should I be worried from a safety point of view? As a journalist, I also looked at it from his point of view, even though he made me feel uncomfortable. I asked myself: is he within his rights to look at porn on his private device wherever he is? Do civil liberties in our society grant him that freedom? But in my heart, I was offended. This video can not be played From disgust to it's ok, Woman's Hour took to the streets to find out what you think of it. When I mentioned it to friends, everyone seemed to have a story of their own, or an opinion. ""It happened to me when I was with my son having a coffee at a Swiss airport,"" one said. ""Two Italian guys were sitting next to me. I said something because I felt safe and I sensed there'd be support if an argument ensued."" It worked, and they politely switched the laptop off. It certainly got everyone talking, but like me, no-one was sure where the law stood. According to Prof Clare McGlynn from Durham University who specialises in the law around porn, there's little to stop someone viewing pornographic material in public - on public transport, in a library, in a park or a cafe, for example. ""It's like reading a book,"" she says. ""They are viewing lawful material which is freely available, and restricting people's access to it presents other challenges."" In Prof McGlynn's view, the law would only prevent it if the porn viewer is harassing someone or causing a disturbance. So, what do you do? Prof McGlynn describes it as a dilemma. ""It's like someone shouting at you, calling to you to 'Cheer up, love!'"" says Prof McGlynn. ""Do you confront it, or do you put your head down and walk along?"" But when I contacted Transport for London, they appeared to take the case very seriously. ""If someone has made you feel uncomfortable, for example by viewing pornographic material, please tell the police or a member of our staff,"" I was told. A member of staff said passengers should report incidents like to this to the bus driver, who would tell the control centre, and the information would then be passed to the police for them to investigate. In Prof McGlynn's view, there is not much the police could do. On the other hand, James Turner QCcontacted the BBC to say,externalthat there is a law - the Indecent Displays (Control) Act - which might form the basis for a prosecution. Five years ago, in the US, the executive director of a group called Morality in the Media had an experience similar to mine on an aeroplane. As a result, the group - now called the National Center On Sexual Exploitation (NCOSE) - campaigned to get the major US airlines to stop passengers watching porn. ""All of them except for one agreed to improve their policies to prohibit passengers from viewing this material during flights and agreed to better train their flight attendants on what to do,"" Haley Halverson of NCOSE told me. Buses don't have flight attendants, though. Nor do trains. And even if police wanted to investigate incidents of porn-watching on public transport, passengers can get off whenever they like. How would officers catch them and question them then? Siobhann Tighe and Prof Clare McGlynn spoke to Jenni Murray on Woman's Hour, on BBC Radio 4.Listen to the discussion here.

"Singapore's golden girl, Yip Pin Xiu Three gold medals, two world records and one Lego figurine under her belt. But what's next for Singapore Paralympian Yip Pin Xiu? The BBC's Heather Chen profiles the young athlete, as part of a series on the Asian women likely to make the news in 2017. Swimmer Joseph Schooling may have delivered Singapore itsfirst-ever Olympic goldmedal but Yip Pin Xiu remains the country's most decorated athlete. With her 2016 and 2008 wins in Rio and Beijing, Yip now has more gold medals to her name than any other Singaporean Olympian or Paralympian. But setting her sights on too much and not having enough time is often a problem for the busy 24-year-old, who's just returned from Europe, where she spent Christmas with her boyfriend and family. School has started and Yip is back home. The swimmer is currently studying for her degree in political science at the Singapore Management University, which recently set up asports scholarship,externalin her name. Leila de Lima: The woman who dares to defy Duterte Regina Ip: The 'Iron Lady' who wants to lead Hong Kong Hong Kong's rebellious lawmaker Yau Wai-ching It's evident that Yip's heart is still in the pool. She says she is ""in a hurry"" to graduate so she can resume full-time training and even though she is training up to five times a week, Yip wants to dedicate more hours to it. ""Training isn't as intensive for me now as it normally is in the lead-up to major games,"" she said. But balancing commitments is no easy feat, let alone for a three-time Paralympic champion. ""Juggling school and training takes up a lot of my time. And the only travelling I'll be doing for the rest of the year will be for competitions, not holidays,"" she says. But it's not impossible for her. ""Since young, I've learnt to manage my time. It's difficult but I can do it."" Yip's optimism about life is infectious The youngest of three children, Yip was born with muscular dystrophy, a genetic disorder that slowly breaks down the muscles. When she turned 11, she lost her ability to walk and had to rely on a wheelchair. By age 12, she ventured into the world of competitive swimming. Yip also suffers from a nerve condition that affects her eyesight. But she remains infectiously optimistic about her life. ""Things are so good and I'm really happy,"" she said with a smile. On that, she recalled her biggest highlight of 2016: winning at the Rio Paralympics. ""My teammates and I were overwhelmed. The recognition we received was a lot higher compared to what we ever had,"" she said. ""I will always remember how good it felt to return home to Singapore, to see all the support for Paralympians."" Yip is known in the sporting world for her signature back stroke swim Rio may have been just the beginning for Yip Pin Xiu but there is still more to come.  All eyes will be on her during her next major swim at the ASEAN Para Games scheduled to take place in September. ""My biggest competitor is myself and I want to be even better than that,"" Yip said. She is also gearing forTokyo 2020, which she says will be ""a very exciting and vibrant event"". Yip Pin Xiu: 'Nobody knows our struggle' Singapore Paralympian in her own words Singapore delights as Schooling delivers first Olympic gold But does she have her sights set on a fourth gold? She had this to say: ""Committing myself to the next Paralympics can be scary and after three medals, I don't know what else could be better. But there's a high possibility that I will go on for more years of training and competition. If I see a potential, I'll keep going."" 'Paralympians need the same kind of support like any other athlete' With those milestones some time away, can Yip count on the celebratory spirit and support of 2016? ""I wouldn't say that support for Paralympic athletes is dying down. Attention has diminished but that's only natural,"" she enthused. ""A lot of people still step forward to lend their support and offer their help and assistance."" Yip and her fellow Paralympian Theresa Goh were immortalised as Lego figurines Yip has found tremendous support in her fellow Paralympian Theresa Goh, who herself has racked up world records and medals. Beyond the headlines, both girls enjoy an endearing friendshipoften documented,externalon their social media accounts. In 2016, toy maker Lego cemented the duo's star status with theirvery own figurines. ""We know we have a bond and we don't have to verbally remind each other of our support,"" she said. ""I can tell Theresa anything. It's nice having someone to talk to, who wouldn't judge you for anything and just listen."" Yip remains hopeful for the year ahead Over the years, Yip has made various contributions to public debate in Singapore about the treatment and recognition of its disabled athletes. ""I want the world to know that being a disabled athlete is not that different from being an able-bodied one,"" she said. ""We put in the same number of hours and we need support like any other athlete. I would like people to look beyond the disability and see the individual instead."" She regularly takes time out from her busy schedule to lend her support to events that raise awareness of disabled sport. ""I want our community to go beyond their limits and not believe the negativity."" And water presents her with more challenges she wants to conquer in the coming year. Could scuba diving be on the cards for the world champion? Will Singapore's champion swimmer soon take up a new water sport? ""I love swimming but strangely, I've never dived before. Diving is interesting and I wouldn't mind learning as I love nature and being in the water so it would be quite an experience."" But she has some concerns because in the water, Yip does not have the ability to kick her legs and so channels her strength into her arms. ""Divers propel themselves in the water using flippers so I don't know how I'd do it,"" she admitted. ""There are special programmes in Singapore that offer disabled people a chance to dive so I know it isn't impossible, I just need to find the time."" The coming year could see her shattering even more barriers.

"The fate of Jerusalem is one of the most contentious issues between the two sides For many, the holy city of Jerusalem is meant to be a shared capital for Israel and the Palestinians - two peoples in two nations, living peacefully, side-by-side. At least that is the dream of the so-called ""two-state solution"" to end a decades-old conflict. The idea has been set out in UN resolutions going back to the mid-'70s, driving diplomatic efforts that culminated in the breakthrough 1993 Oslo Accords. But after many rounds of failed peace talks, it looks increasingly in jeopardy. A summit taking place in Paris on Sunday is expected to try to signal to Israel and the next US president that establishing a Palestinian state is the only path to peace. Palestinians say Israel must freeze settlement activity before talks can resume France will host more than 70 countries and world powers for the conference, but there will be no Israelis or Palestinians present. Well-informed sources confirm reports of a draft statement asking both sides ""to officially restate their commitment to the two-state solution"". It will also affirm that the international community ""will not recognise"" changes to Israel's pre-1967 lines unless they are agreed with the Palestinians. It will make clear ""a negotiated solution"" is ""the only way to achieve enduring peace"". The Palestinians welcome the French initiative but it is rejected by Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. ""It's a rigged conference, rigged by the Palestinians with French auspices to adopt additional anti-Israeli stances,"" he said this week.  ""This pushes peace backwards."" The conference follows last month's UN Security Council resolution which called on Israel to stop settlement construction in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Israel says many international forums are historically biased against it Over 600,000 Israelis live in these areas which were captured in the 1967 Middle East war.  They are seen as illegal under international law, but Israel disagrees. This week, US President Barack Obama returned to the subject of settlements in an interview with Israel's Channel Two. ""The facts on the ground are making it almost impossible - at least very difficult, and if this trend line continues, impossible - to create a contiguous, functioning, Palestinian state,"" he said. ""If that's the case, then what you're embracing is a vision of Greater Israel in which an occupation continues indefinitely."" The timing of the talks in Paris - just days before Donald Trump moves into the White House - appear very deliberate. He has not yet spelt out his vision for the Middle East but has shown strong backing for the Israeli far-right. He has nominated a lawyer, David Friedman, who is an outspoken critic of the two-state solution and supporter of settlements, to be his ambassador to Israel. Mr Trump has also promised to move the US embassy to Jerusalem. Palestinians say relocating the US embassy to Jerusalem will kill prospects for peace Like other countries, the US currently keeps its embassy in Tel Aviv, as it does not recognise Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem. ""This is very dangerous what President-elect Trump wants to do,"" Palestinian official, Mohammed Shtayyeh tells me.  ""It is American recognition that Jerusalem is part of the State of Israel."" ""We would consider this American move as an end to the peace process, an end to the two states and really putting the whole region into chaos."" Apoll conducted last year,externalsuggests that a slight majority of Palestinians - 51% - and Israelis - 59% - still support the two-state solution.  However there is high mutual mistrust. In recent days, Israeli officials have urged world leaders to refocus their attention on ways to tackle terrorism following a truck ramming by a Palestinian that killed four young soldiers in Jerusalem. They argue that the very Palestinian leaders with whom they are supposed to be seeking peace have incited an upsurge in attacks, mostly stabbings, since October 2015. Some 40 Israelis have been killed and more than 230 Palestinians have been shot dead by Israeli security forces.  Israel says most of those Palestinians were involved in attacks.  Others were killed in clashes with troops. Palestinian leaders blame the violence on a younger generation's anger at the failure of talks to end Israel's occupation and deliver on promises of an independent state.

"Sir Arthur Hacker's portrait of Ivy Close was on the front page of the Daily Mirror in 1908 Ivy Close won Britain's first national beauty contest, was a trailblazing actress and the matriarch of one of Britain's most illustrious showbusiness dynasties. She faded into obscurity - but her great-grandson, who created Downton Abbey, has put her back in the spotlight. When 17-year-old Ivy Close charmed the country in the first nationwide beauty competition, the press swooned over her ""exquisite loveliness"". Part of her prize - along with a new Rover motorcar - was to have her portrait exhibited at the Royal Academy in London. That picture, showing Close with rosy cheeks and wispy curls, also took up the entire front page of the Daily Mirror - which had run the contest - on 4 May 1908. Ivy Close beat 15,000 other entrants to win the Daily Mirror's beauty contest ""She's effectively the first British beauty queen,"" says her great-grandson Gareth Neame, a Bafta-winning TV producer who came up with the concept for Downton and made The Hollow Crown and Hotel Babylon. ""And there was then a competition between the winner in Britain and the winner in the US, and she ended up winning that one. So I often say she was effectively the first ever Miss World."" The portrait, by Sir Arthur Hacker, has now been restored thanks to a donation from Mr Neame and is hanging in the refurbished Ferens Art Gallery in Hull, which reopened on Friday to coincide with Hull becoming UK City of Culture. It is a return to the limelight for one of Britain's first modern celebrities, whose career took the firework trajectory that has been followed by many celebrities over the decades since. Born in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, Close beat 15,000 other hopefuls to the beauty contest title, which was awarded by nine famous artists on the Daily Mirror's Beauty Adjudication Committee (yes, really). She became an instant star and there was ""an overwhelming rush for copies"" of a special commemorative edition of the paper that featured Close in ""a variety of charming poses"". The portrait now has a prominent spot in Hull's Ferens gallery Just as she charmed the Beauty Adjudication Committee, Close also caught the eye of society photographer Elwin Neame, who had photographed the finalists. Two years later, her picture filled the Daily Mirror front page again - this time in her wedding dress. Inside, the paper reported how a large crowd had gathered outside the church where she had married Elwin Neame, and how she had been accompanied by a ""best girl"", as opposed to a best man. In her film debut two years later, directed by her husband and filmed in their house, she played a model posing as figures from famous paintings. She went on to star in a long list of films that decade and set up her own production company, which was not uncommon for a successful actress in the silent era. Gareth Neame (right) with Downton Abbey writer Julian Fellowes and actress Elizabeth McGovern ""It's a well-trodden path, to have gone from being a model to an actress, and she went to America to be in the movies before Hollywood was even invented,"" Gareth Neame explains. ""She went to America in about 1917 and went to Jacksonville in Florida, which was one of the centres of film-making back then, and she was in a company of actors along with Oliver Hardy."" After that, Close's films included the 1923 French epic La Roue, of which Jean Cocteau said: ""There is cinema before and after La Roue, as there is painting before and after Picasso."" Gareth Neame says: ""I've got it on DVD so I'm able to watch my great-grandmother as a young woman as the lead in a silent movie. She was a reputable actress with some career."" But her life took a tragic turn the same year when Elwin Neame was killed in a motorcycle accident. ""It must have been quite a tough life, having lost her husband so young,"" Gareth Neame says. ""My grandfather [Ronald] was at boarding school, but just one year in, at the age of 14, he had to be pulled out because there wasn't the money to pay the fees any more."" Gareth Neame is the son of Christopher Neame (left) and grandson of Ronald Neame (centre) Meanwhile, with the arrival of talking movies, Close's acting roles were drying up. ""Like the film The Artist, about the end of the silent film era, I think she was one of the people that fell foul of that. ""I'm not sure her accent quite fitted in with American audiences, and when talking pictures came in, that was really the end of her career."" She did pantomime and minor films, but had fallen off the radar by the end of the 1920s. If there was a Celebrity Big Brother in 1931, she would surely have done it. Gareth Neame was a toddler when Close died in 1968. ""I never knew the lady, but she was quite a big figure in the family by all accounts. ""Like a lot of people in showbusiness, as she got older she was probably slightly curmudgeonly and thought 'it's not the way that it used to be'. ""It must have been very interesting to have been this very beautiful young starlet and very famous, and then talking pictures come along and your career starts to fade."" Her career may have faded, but the family dynasty she and Elwin Neame launched is still going strong. Ronald Neame went into the family business, and went on to direct The Poseidon Adventure and The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (with an Oscar-winning turn by future Downton Abbey star Dame Maggie Smith) and co-write Brief Encounter. Ronald's son Christopher Neame was a Bafta-nominated writer and producer, meaning Gareth is the fourth generation to have success in the TV and film industries. His father and grandfather knew about the portrait of Ivy Close, but did not know where it had ended up after being shown at the Royal Academy. An online art database,ArtUK,external, meant Gareth Neame could track it down easily. He got in touch with the Ferens curator, who told him it had not been exhibited for several years because it needed restoration - and pointed him in the direction of their Adopt A Painting scheme. ""It's very nice to be able to make a charitable gift for something that brings back a piece of art into public view, and because of my family association with it,"" he says. But restoring the painting is not the only way he has kept her memory alive. ""I put a little reference to her when we made Downton Abbey,"" he reveals. ""We had a scene where a couple of the servants went to the pictures and they were coming back from having seen a film that Ivy Close was in. It was a little in-joke for me.""

"This video can not be played WATCH: Taking a test drive in Faraday Future's FF91 Faraday Future, the company hoping to beat Tesla in the electric car game, had to halt building its factory in order to afford its glitzy CES press event, the firm told the BBC. The company broke ground on its enormous plant in the Nevada desert in April last year - âbut work halted in October amid reports the company was in dire financial straits. Speaking on the record for the first time about the firmâs money woes, Faraday Futureâs senior vice president of research and design, Nick Sampson, acknowledged the company was facing ""challenges"". ""Clearly something like [CES] requires funding and some resources,"" Mr Sampson told me. ""We are resource-limited at times. [It's] just a matter of keeping the cash flow balance between the different projects weâre trying to do."" No date has been set for work on the site to recommence. ""Things like [CES] have to take priority at this point in time. Weâll be starting again [on the factory] very shortly,"" he said. The company was spinning several financial plates, he argued. ""The challenge of building a new company is that itâs not just doing the engineering and R&D work, weâve got manufacturing to keep aligned, weâve also got the whole sales and marketing, branding and imaging. ""Itâs a matter of keeping the whole programme aligned."" Faraday Futureâs launch was arguably the most extravagant press event at this yearâs CES, taking place in a huge venue away from the famous Las Vegas strip. It was attended by the mayor of North Las Vegas, John Lee. The $1bn plant is being subsidised by around $320m of taxpayerâs money, a deal which has attracted intense criticism, though Mr Lee has insisted the public will not be left out of pocket should Faraday Future pull out of the project. Faraday Future's contractor, AECOM, has stopped work on the factory but said it is still committed to the project Little is known about the finances of Faraday Future, other than that its biggest backer is the founder and chief executive of Chinaâs LeEco - âa company also embroiled in legal difficulties owing to what suppliers claim are unpaid bills. Another problem facing Faraday Future, as well as the stalled factory construction, is that several suppliers have begun taking legal action against the firm. Futuris, a company which specialises in luxury car interiors, is suing the firm for breach of contract, demanding immediate payment of more than $10m. According to a recent report published by Buzzfeed, Faraday Future owes more than $300m. But thatâs typical for a fledgling technology firm, Mr Sampson argued. ""Weâve gone from nothing to where we are today in just over two years,"" he said. ""Matching the speed of development and building with the inflow of cash doesnât always match. ""Many companies have had this - Apple and Steve Jobs didnât always have it easy in its early days. Thatâs one of the hurdles that we have to get over."" That kind of comparison - to technology pioneers - is something Faraday Future does often. An impression of how Faraday Future wants its factory to eventually look During its CES presentation, it brought up a timeline of milestones including the invention of the lightbulb and the creation of the world wide web. Faraday Future placed itself at the end of this timeline. ""That to me was stepping too far,"" remarked Tim Stevens, editor at large of motoring news site Roadshow. If the company does manage to put its first vehicle into production, Mr Stevens said he still had reason to be cautious. ""Iâm expecting this car to be in the range of $150,000, maybe $200,000. Far more expensive even than a Tesla Model X. ""Thatâs a big ask - âif they are talking a low-number, high-margin car, theyâve still got to have a production down pat, and the reliability down pat too. Those are things it's taken Tesla a long time to figure out."" Where Faraday Future doesnât appear to be struggling is with the car itself. The FF91, shown off for the first time at CES, goes like a rocket - 0-60mph (97km/h) in an alleged 2.39 seconds. Faster, it said, than a Tesla Model S (though Teslaâs chief executive, Elon Musk, disputes the claim). A test drive also demonstrated the carâs ability to park itself completely autonomously. The company hopes drivers will one day be able to leave their car at the side of the road and ask it to drive off and park using a mobile app - like a robot valet. The FF91 impressed car buffs - the company has promised it will be ready by 2018 However, the technology wonât be a part of daily life any time soon. It will be valet parking ""approved by Faraday Future"", a test driver told me - a process that will mean adoption across the world will likely be painstakingly slow. But when it comes to hurdles to leap over, autonomous parking is well down the priority list. Right now, Faraday Future is a company seemingly operating on a thread. It is right to acknowledge that getting into the car industry as a brand new player is extremely difficult - which is why so few companies attempt it, and even fewer succeed. Even behemoths like Apple and Google owner Alphabet have turned their focus more to providing software for established car makers, rather than begin manufacturing themselves. At CES 2016, when Faraday Future launched a concept car so outlandish it instantly became known as the Batmobile, the company insisted it would defy its critics by 2017. Has it done that? Partly - there is a car, and itâs rapid. But building on that achievement and turning it into a mass-produced vehicle and a viable business? By next year? That seems unfathomably ambitious.

"Young people are being advised to start saving by the age of 25 We keep being told to save more for our retirement. But how big a pension will we need, and how much should we be putting away to pay for it? On the first question, one clue came from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)this week, which said the average retired household now spends Â£21,770 a year. So to earn a pension of at least Â£20,000, how much should you be saving each month? To get an answer, the BBC asked a firm of actuaries to make some calculations. To a generation that has got out of the habit of saving, the figures may come as something of a shock. They reveal that even at the age of 25, you need to be putting away several hundred pounds a month. And if you haven't started saving by the age of 40, reaching the target is going to be a real challenge. If you qualify for a full state pension - and initially many peoplewill not- the government currently gives you just over Â£8,000 a year. So assuming you are not a member of a defined benefit (DB) pension scheme, you will need to find at least Â£12,000 of income from a defined contribution (DC) scheme. For those on the average salary of Â£26,364, getting such a pension needs very careful planning. ""Twenty thousand pounds on average national earnings is quite an ambitious target,"" says Patrick Bloomfield, a partner at Hymans Robertson LLP, which did the calculations for the BBC. ""It would have them replace three-quarters of their pay with pension. But I think it is an excellent target to aim at."" The table above shows how much money a worker would have to contribute every month to get an eventual pension of Â£20,000 a year, depending on the age they start saving. So someone who starts saving at the age of 25 would need to put away Â£246 a month, net of tax. After 20% tax relief, that sum is actually worth Â£307. The pot would eventually be used to buy an annuity, or income for life. The calculations are based on a complex model that predicts the investment return over the lifetime of the pension. Assuming it achieves investment growth of a typical default investment strategy, and assuming the eventual payout increases annually with inflation, as well as granting a 50% income to a surviving partner, this level of saving has a 50/50 chance of providing an annual income of Â£20,000 or more. The cost can be higher for women, because they are expected to live longer. However, having a male partner reduces the cost in a joint annuity, as they have shorter life expectancy. How to be a Mum and still get a good pension How not to run out of money before you die The figures show that an average earner who starts saving at 25 need only contribute 14% of their salary to hit the Â£20,000 target. But if they leave it to the age of 35, they will need to contribute 23%. By the time they are 45, if they haven't started a pension plan, they will need to pay in pretty much half their earnings, a difficult task. ""The biggest message from this analysis is the cost of delaying when you start to save,"" says Patrick Bloomfield. ""The challenge is, when they're in their 20s and 30s people are trying to save, they're trying to get on the housing ladder, they're being young and having fun. There are lots of calls on that money."" However, the figures show that there is an alternative option for those who haven't started saving by the age of 45. If they are prepared to delay taking the income for five years beyond their current state pension age, they can reduce their contributions to Â£418 a month, or 28% of their earnings. But not many people will want to be working at the age of 72. Indeed, some will find that ill health stops them doing so anyway. Someone who is a higher earner may wish to save more. This table shows how much they would need to save monthly to buy an annuity that pays out Â£30,000 a year. If they are on a salary of Â£52,728 - double the national average - this process is currently made easier for them by the fact that the taxman will give them a rebate of up to 40% of their income tax. Thus a 25-year-old would need to save Â£342 a month, while a 35-year-old would need to put away more than Â£500. But again, leave it to the age of 45 and he or she would have to save well over Â£1,000 a month. If successful, such a saver would receive a pension that amounts to 57% of their previous income. This too is an ambitious target. According to thePensions Commission,externalreport from 2006, someone earning more than Â£50,000 should be aiming to get a pension which is equivalent to 50% of their pre-retirement salary. Someone earning between Â£25,000 and Â£50,000 should aim for a pension of 60% of their salary.

There are now plenty of alternatives, such aspension drawdown. These figures also do not take account of National Insurance contributions. Workers in salary sacrifice schemes should be able to reclaim some of those contributions, meaning the amount they need to save monthly will be less than shown. But the figures we used are still a clear sign that workers need to save more. One financial advisory firm, the deVere Group, said this week that 80% of the people it sees are not saving enough. ""Too many people have a live-for-today attitude,"" said chief executive Nigel Green. ""There needs to be a seismic shift in the savings culture."" As Patrick Bloomfield concludes: ""There are two big messages in this. The first is please start saving. And the second is how expensive it is to wait before you start saving. So the sooner you start - even if you can't afford the levels in these tables - every little will help.""
