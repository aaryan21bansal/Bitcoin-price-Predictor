"Antonio Colak's fifth goal in eight games put Rangers into the group stages Rangers will play at European football's top table for the first time in more than a decade after stunning PSV Eindhoven to reach the Champions League group stage. The decisive moment of an absorbing tie finally came on the hour, when Malik Tillman intercepted a PSV pass out from defence and squared for Antonio Colak to find an empty net from six yards. The Philips Stadion went almost silent and the home side could find no response in the final half hour despite a flurry of chances. Rangers can now look forward to drawing some of the continent's biggest names in Thursday's draw, where they join rivals Celtic in pot four as the pair play in the group stage in the same season for the first time since 2007/08. Also vital will be the minimum Â£25m windfall which will now come their way as the Ibrox side complete the turnaround from playing in Scotland's third division 10 years ago to the Champions League. 'Dogged Rangers fight way to place with big boys' What awaits Celtic & Rangers in group stage? How calm Van Bronckhorst led Rangers to big time Podcast: 'Rangers can swagger in Champions League' The feat was achieved with a huge amount of resilience as PSV threatened throughout, and also amid the controversy surrounding striker Alfredo Morelos, who was left at home due to concerns about his attitude and fitness. Instead it was the man who has started in his stead all season, Colak, who was in the right place at the crucial moment to score his fifth goal in eight games after brilliant awareness from Tillman to read and shut down goalkeeper Walter Benitez's pass. The inevitable response from PSV came as Philip Max shot wide, and goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin denied their star man Cody Gakpo when through on goal, and those were just the opportunities which came after Rangers struck. There were others, including a free header from Ibrahim Sangare and a shot from close-range from Luuk De Jong fired straight at McLaughlin, but ultimately there was no way through. Rangers showed immense character to hang on and also had their own strong spells, with Tom Lawrence unlucky not to score with a fantastic curling effort which cannoned back off the bar. But it was their European muscle memory which got Giovanni van Bronckhorst's team over the line, as they again proved a smart, skilful and gutsy team on the big stage, traits which characterised their run to last season's Europa League final. Now, the club and its fans can look forward to testing themselves on the biggest stage. The 22-year-old American came of age in Eindhoven. His reading of the game was outstanding, making six clearances and two interceptions Rangers have impressed regularly in Europe in the past four seasons, and this performance underlines the belief and confidence in the group as they triumphed despite trying circumstances. Van Bronckhorst made a huge call to leave out Morelos and travel with just one recognised striker in Colak, and their preparations were disrupted further before kick-of when their bus was held up by PSV fans. Then there was the fact their away record in Europe read just one win in 11. But away from Ibrox and in a rowdy arena, they still produced the goods. It wasn't the swashbuckling football they showed on their run to Seville last season, but they were disciplined, rode their luck, and delivered big moments when it mattered. Tillman's reading of the game was crucial, and McLaughlin's brilliant save from Gakpo kept them ahead. With Celtic already assured of their place in the group stage, it was vitally important for the club financially to keep pace and qualify. The manager has to take huge credit for his influence on the team, having now guided them to six wins from six in two-legged European knockout ties. His calm authority and tactical nous have stood out particularly in cup competitions. Almost exactly 10 years ago Rangers were held to a draw by Berwick Rangers in the third division, this caps the journey back. The league title two seasons ago was crucial, but now they can truly say they have returned to the top level. Ross County are the visitors to Ibrox in the Scottish Premiership on Saturday (15:00 BST), but before that they can enjoy Thursday's group stage draw, which takes place at 17:00.

"Nine changing rooms at Urban Outfitters in York had to be closed so the changing room could be cleaned A police officer has kept her job despite urinating in a clothes shop fitting room while drunk off-duty and then lying to her bosses about it. PC Amelia Shearer, 24, of Cleveland Police was found guilty of gross misconduct following the incident in Urban Outfitters in York last year. A disciplinary panel in Middlesbrough found her conduct was discreditable and she had been dishonest. It decided not to sack her but instead issued a final written warning. The panel's chairwoman, Ogheneruona Iguyovwe, said: ""There is scope for her to be rehabilitated, there is scope for her to set the record straight and to begin on a new path."" Ms Iguyovwe had earlier pointed out that police officers were ""expected to maintain high standards of behaviour"" and should consider if their actions might cause a loss of confidence in the police. ""Officers are required to act with integrity and honesty at all times,"" she said. During the three-day hearing, the panel was told probationer PC Shearer had been in York with a friend while off-duty on 11 September. In under four hours Middlesbrough-based officer drank half a bottle of Prosecco, three cocktails and a Jack Daniels and Coke before going to the store. While thereshe is alleged to have asked a sales assistant if the store had toilets, and when told it did not she went into a changing room cubicle. PC Shearer, who studied a Masters in criminal investigations before joining the police in 2019, admitted she had been drunk and described herself and her friend as ""loud and giggly"". She denied relieving herself in the store. She claimed to have used the changing rooms to adjust her bra - but had told her superior Insp Christian Duree she had been trying on clothes during a phone call the day after it happened. She explained that she only gave him an ""abridged version"" of events but Cleveland Police accused her of lying - and the panel agreed. Olivia Checa-Dover, acting for the force, said the conclusion that PC Shearer had been dishonest meant she was now ""undeployable"". She said the fact the officer had lied while being questioned on oath would have to be disclosed to defence lawyers in any future investigations she carried out. Joan Smith, for the defendant, said her client had consistently denied the claims, had good references and her performance had been described by her inspector as ""excellent"". She said the officer had the potential to be ""exceptional"" and to ""flourish in this police force with the appropriate guidance"".

"Google plans to show ads that educate people about disinformation techniques, following a successful experiment by Cambridge University. Google Jigsaw, which tackles online security dangers, will run adverts on YouTube, TikTok, Twitter and Facebook. Researchers found the videos improved people's ability to recognise manipulative content. They will be shown in Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland to combat fake news about Ukrainian refugees. Google said the ""exciting"" findings showed how social media can actively pre-empt the spread of disinformation. The research was founded on a developing area of study called ""prebunking"", which investigates how disinformation can be debunked by showing people how it works - before they are exposed to it. In the experiment, the ads were shown to 5.4 million people, 22,000 of whom were surveyed afterwards. After watching the explanatory videos, researchers found: an improvement in respondents' ability to spot disinformation techniques an increased ability to discern trustworthy from untrustworthy content an improved ability to decide whether or not to share content The peer-reviewed research was conducted in conjunction with Google, which owns YouTube, and will be published in the journal Science Advances. Beth Goldberg, head of research and development for Google Jigsaw, called the findings ""exciting"". ""They demonstrate that we can scale prebunking far and wide, using ads as a vehicle,"" she said. Jon Roozenbeek, the lead author on the paper, told the BBC the research is about ""reducing the probability someone is persuaded by misinformation"". ""Obviously you can't predict every single example of misinformation that's going to go viral,"" he said. ""But what you can do is find common patterns and tropes. ""The idea behind this study was - if we find a couple of these tropes, is it possible to make people more resilient against them, even in content they've never seen before?"" The scientists initially tested the videos with members of the public under controlled-conditions in a lab, before showing them to millions of users on YouTube, as part of a broader field study. The anti-misinformation campaign and prebunking campaign was run on YouTube ""as it would look in the real world"", Mr Roozenbeek said. ""We ran them as YouTube ads - just like an ad about shaving cream or whatever... before your video plays,"" he explained. Advertisers can use a feature on YouTube called Brand Lift, which tells them if, and how, an advert has raised awareness of their product. The researchers used this same feature to assess people's ability to spot the manipulation techniques they had been exposed to. Instead of a question about brand awareness, people were shown a headline and asked to read it. They were told the headline contained manipulation and asked to identify what kind of technique was being used. In addition, there was a separate control group who were not shown any videos, but were shown the headline and corresponding questions. ""What you hope to see is that the group that saw the videos is correct in their identification significantly more often than the control group - and that turned out to be the case,"" Mr Roozenbeek said. ""On average, the group that got the videos was correct about 5% more often than the control group. That's highly significant. ""That doesn't sound like a lot - but it's also true that the control group isn't always wrong. They also get a number of questions correct. ""That improvement, even in the noisy environment of YouTube, basically shows that you can improve people's ability to recognise these disinformation techniques - simply by showing them an ad."" Cambridge University said this was the first real-world field study of 'inoculation theory' on a social media platform. Professor Sander van der Linden, who co-authored the study, said the research results were sufficient to take the concept of inoculation forward and scale it up, to potentially reach ""hundreds of millions"" of social media users. ""Clearly it's important for kids to learn how to do lateral reading and check the veracity of sources,"" he said, ""but we also need solutions that can be scaled on social media and interface with their algorithms."" He acknowledged the scepticism around technology firms using this type of research, and the broader scepticism around industry-academia collaborations. ""But, at the end of the day, we have to face reality, in that social media companies control much of the flow of information online. So in order to protect people, we have come up with independent, evidence-based solutions that social media companies can actually implement on their platforms."" ""To me, leaving social media companies to their own devices is not going to generate the type of solutions that empower people to discern misinformation that spreads on their platforms.""

"A senior civil servant has taken control of Stormont's finances. Neil Gibson has done so because of the failure to pass a budget before the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) collapsed the executive in February. The senior official at the Department of Finance will use emergency powers to release cash to departments until a new budget is in place. The move means departments can continue to operate but Mr Gibson cannot start funding new policies. He will not have the power to distribute more than Â£400m of unallocated funds which Stormont has received from the Treasury since the draft budget was published. Mr Gibson is a former chief economist at EY and has held senior roles across the private and public sectors and in academia. Hejoined the Department of Financethis year. Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the development would ""keep the lights on and keep the doors open at various departments for another couple of months"". He added that it did not allow any response to the emergency that was ""growing daily in terms of people's ability to pay their bills and to put food on the table"". Mr Murphy called for the immediate return of the executive and urged Westminster to help address the ""mounting problems"". Up until now departments could operate without a formal budget because of what is known as the vote on account. It is a legal mechanism which allows the spending of money in the first few months of a financial year before full budget legislation is passed. It authorises spending equal to 45% of the allocation for the previous year. Departments are now approaching that 45% limit so need a new legal authorisation to keep spending. Neil Gibson has acted due to the lack of a budget at Stormont That authority is Section 59 of the Northern Ireland Act, which ultimately allows Mr Gibson to use money, equivalent to up to 95% of last year's budget, ""for such services and purposes"" as he directs. The Department of Finance said for most departments the new authorisation has been set at approximately 60% of departments' provision for the 2021-22 financial year. That will be reviewed at the end of October. A spokesperson added: ""These contingency arrangements are no substitute for an agreed budget and while departments will have legal cover to continue to spend on delivering services, they will still not have the certainty that an agreed budget would provide."" If the 95% limit is ever reached it would effectively mean in-year cuts of least 5% across the public service. However, it is improbable that the emergency situation will continue for that length of time. If the executive does not return to pass a budget then budget legislation could be approved by the Westminster parliament as has happened during other periods when devolution was not functioning. The Section 59 powers were first used in March 2017 with the Northern Ireland secretary then taking budget legislation through Parliament in November that year. There is no functioning assembly or executive at Stormont because of the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. Theprotocol, part of the UK government's Brexit deal with the EU, keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods. Why could parts of the Brexit deal be ditched? That was designed to continue free trade across the Irish land border but it has been criticised by unionist politicians for adding restrictions to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. UK plans to legislate against the outworkings of the protocol have been criticised by the EU. In May's assembly election, Sinn FÃ©in was returned as Stormont's largest party, entitling it to nominate for the position of first minister. What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

"British Gas is to donate 10% of its profits to help customers cope with soaring bills for the ""duration of the energy crisis"". Its owner Centrica says the money will go into an existing support fund - trebling help available this winter for the poorest customers. The firm, which has seen huge profits this year, said thousands of households would get grants of Â£250-Â£750. But this is a fraction of the support needed to tackle the crisis nationally. Earlier this week, one energy company boss put that costcloser to Â£100bn. British Gas' offer of support will be based on the company's retail supply profits, which were Â£98m before tax in the first-half of 2022. It said the initial donation would be Â£12m. However, Centrica, which is the parent company of British Gas, reported adjusted operating profits of Â£1.3bn in the six months to June - up from Â£262m a year earlier - most of which came from oil and gas drilling. What is the energy price cap and how high will bills go? And Paul de Leeuw, director of the RGU Energy Transition Institute at Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen and a former executive at Centrica, British Gas's initial donation would only benefit 0.5% of its 7.5 million customers. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that while it was a helpful gesture, the initial Â£12m donation amounted to just 1% of Centrica's profits. ""They've got 7.5 million [residential] energy customers in the UK, so if you look at the money that is available, it's probably going to benefit around 40,000 people max so that's 0.5% of their customer base. ""So 99.5% of Centrica and British Gas customers are probably not going to see any benefit from this."" British Gas customers in fuel poverty and withless than Â£1,000 in savingsare eligible A household is considered to be infuel povertyif it has to spend 10% or more of its income on energy Eligible customers can apply for a one-off grant throughthe British Gas Energy Trust,external Since its creation last year, British Gas said ""thousands"" of customers receivedaverage grants of over Â£550 Over a third of the recipients were on disability benefit,30% were single parentsand 25% had children under five It comes as the next energy price cap - which limits what suppliers can charge per unit of energy in England, Scotland and Wales - is set to be announced on Friday. The typical home energy bill is forecast to reach Â£3,600 a year in October - up from Â£1,971 currently - with further rises expected for January. The government has promised a package of help but there have been warnings many people will face hardship without further support. Energy firms are also under pressure to help after posting soaring profits this year, amid record high energy prices driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Insiders at British gas parent company Centrica say this offer is a call to arms for other companies - from all sectors - to do the same at a time of national need. Sceptics say that it is a token gesture that represents a tiny fraction of the overall cost to households, made possible by having a parent company that is making huge profits on its gas production business which other energy retailers don't have. Scottish Power have estimated the cost of shielding customers from increasing wholesale energy costs at Â£100bn. British Gas is saying they are the first to volunteer to put their hand in their own pocket to help struggling customers. Others say it is a drop in a very deep ocean of looming financial distress. Customers in fuel poverty and more than Â£250 in arrears on their energy bills to apply for a grant from British Gas. A household is considered to be in fuel poverty if it has to spend 10% or more of its income on energy. British Gas told the BBC it would take into account customers' income and household expenditure to determine whether they are eligible. It said it would continue to donate around 10% of its supply profits every six months ""for the duration of the energy crisis, backdated to the start of 2022"". Mr de Leeuw said that Centrica had made a ""smart move"" which ""pre-empts a conversation around a possible windfall tax on the energy providers"" and other companies might announce similar measures. But he said: ""This requires billions to fix not millions so we are in the wrong conversation if you want to sort out the energy crisis which is just around the corner."" Centrica boss Chris O'Shea said the support package was worth Â£25m. ""As a responsible business we want to do more to support our customers during this difficult time,"" he said. This week rival power company Scottish Power' proposed an industry wide scheme to freeze energy bills for two years. Boss Keith Anderson said the Â£100bn plan would see the price cap frozen at the current level, with the government covering the difference between what people pay for energy and how much it costs to supply their homes. The cost could then be repaid over the next 15 to 20 years and would be underwritten by the UK government. Mr Anderson said he had submitted the idea to Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng who was ""seriously considering"" it. So far the government has promised a Â£15bn package of support for UK households. This includes a Â£650 one-off payment for eight million low income households and aÂ£400 grant for all homes. Plans to offer households discounts on electricity bills if they cut use at peak times are also set to be announced by National Grid in the next few weeks. Average energy bills in the UK are predicted to reach Â£3,600 a year in October No 10 previously said there would be no new support offered before a new prime minister is appointed on 5 September. The current favourite to replace Boris Johnson, Liz Truss, has promised tax cuts and recently hinted at direct financial help for hard-pressed households. Her rival, Rishi Sunak, has said he would introduce more targeted support for households, and has promised to reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero. But Resolution Foundation, the think tank, warned that the UK would face a ""catastrophe"" this winter unless the government stepped in to support the most vulnerable. It is calling for a 30% bill cut for those on benefits, and for households where all individuals are earning less than Â£25,000 a year. It also said energy bill freezes, social tariffs and a ""solidarity tax"" of 1% on all income tax rates would ease the situation. Meanwhile, the British Chambers of Commerce wants more help for small businesses to cope with rising energy costs. It wants a grant for businesses and a temporary reversal of National Insurance contributions to ""put money back into the pockets of businesses and workers"".

"Mr Biden announced student loan relief with Education Secretary Miguel Cardona US President Joe Biden will cancel up to $10,000 (Â£8,474) in federal student loans for millions of Americans who earn less than $125,000 each year.Â Mr Biden will also forgive $20,000 of debt for students on Pell Grants, which applies to those in greatest financial need. ""People can finally crawl out under that mountain of debt,"" he said. An estimated 43 million Americans owe a combined total of $1.6tn in federal student debt. Nearly one-fifth owe less than $10,000.Â The temporary student loan pause, first put in place in March 2020, will also be extended a final time until 31 December of this year. Speaking from the White House on Wednesday, Mr Biden said his plan would give more ""breathing room"" to working and middle class families. ""The burden is so heavy that even if you graduate you may not have access to the middle class life that the college degree once provided,"" he said, recalling the shame his car salesman father felt when he struggled to pay for his children's education. About one-third of borrowers have student debt but no degree, Mr Biden said. ""The worst of both worlds."" The announcement follows more than a year of intense internal White House debate and mounting pressure from progressive Democrats. Top Democrats Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, are among those who had pushed Mr Biden to use his executive power to wipe out borrower debts. Wednesday's plan falls short of the $50,000 per borrower plan that Mr Schumer and Ms Warren had asked for. A one-time cancellation of $10,000 for each borrower earning a maximum of $125,000 will cost the federal government around$300bn, according to an estimatefrom the Penn Wharton budget model at the University of Pennsylvania,external. Mr Biden addressed this criticism on Wednesday, saying his student forgiveness plan is the ""economically responsible course"". ""I will never apologise for helping working Americans and the middle class,"" he said, adding that ""no high-income individual or high-income household will benefit from this action"". Republicans and some moderate Democrats have said debt cancellation will add to inflation by giving Americans more money to spend. And others say that blanket debt forgiveness is unfair to those who have already paid off students loans. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, quickly criticised the plan on Twitter: ""Who will have to pay for Biden's debt transfer scam? Hard-working Americans who already paid off their debts or never took on student loan debt in the first place,"" he wrote. Some Democratic lawmakers have pushed back, saying that cancelling student loans helps address economic racial disparities. Black students are more likely to borrow federal student loans and at higher amounts than other Americans. Four years after earning bachelor's degrees, black borrowers owe nearly $25,000 more than their white peers on average, according to a Brookings Institution study.

"Scotland's public spending deficit fell to Â£23.7bn last year as the country's finances continued to be hit by the Covid pandemic. Scottish government statistics showed that total public spending dropped to Â£97.5bn. Income from taxes rose by Â£11bn to Â£73.8bn, leaving a gap between spending and revenue equating to 12.3% of Scotland's GDP. The deficit for the UK as a whole over the same period was 6.1% of GDP. Scotland's public deficit figure stood at Â£15.1bn - 8.6% of GDP - the year before the pandemic hit but more than doubled to Â£36.3bn, or 22.4% of GDP, in 2020. Check out the latest headlines from Scotland,external Read more stories on Scottish politics,external The annual Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (Gers) report said that overall spending ""for the benefit of Scotland"" by the Scottish government, UK government and other public sector bodies fell from Â£98.5bn to Â£97.5bn last year - the largest ever drop in public expenditure. This was equivalent to Â£17,793 per person, which is Â£1,963 per person greater than the UK average. The fall in spending was mainly due to a reduction in money being spent on Covid support schemes - with the authors saying that spending remains at historically high levels. Overall, the Scottish government spent Â£5.7bn in response to the coronavirus pandemic last year, down from Â£8.8bn in 2020. Scotland received at least a further Â£3.7bn in reserved spending in response to the pandemic, down from Â£9.4bn. However, this reduction in spending on the pandemic was largely offset by the costs of servicing the public sector debt. What is Gers and how is it calculated? Meanwhile, Scotland's illustrative geographical share of North Sea oil and gas revenue was Â£3.5bn, up from Â£0.8bn the previous year, as energy prices recovered from the falls during the pandemic. The report said the oil price increased from $18.38 per barrel in April 2021 to $117.25 in March 2022, while gas prices rose from 55p per therm to 314p. The increase was driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which increased competition for supplies as countries attempted to switch away from Russian oil and gas. Overall North Sea production of oil and gas fell by 16.8% in 2021 to 76 million tons of oil equivalent. Scotland's total public sector revenue was said to be equivalent to Â£13,463 per person, Â£221 less than the UK average. Excluding North Sea revenue, it was Â£12,831 per person, or Â£805 less than the UK average The report said the figures ""continue to be affected by the coronavirus pandemic, which had an ongoing and significant impact on global public sector finances."" The data was calculated by Scottish government statisticians, with the annual report having been at the centre of the debate over independence in recent years. Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who is Scotland's acting finance secretary, said the continued rise in oil and gas prices was likely to see North Sea revenues grow to Â£13bn next year, which he said would cause Scotland's deficit to fall faster than the UK's. He added: ""Even without North Sea receipts, the record revenue generated was sufficient to cover all day-to-day devolved spending as well as all social security spending in Scotland, including the state pension."" Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the Gers figures showed how ""people and their families benefit massively from being part of a strong, resilient UK"". Mr Jack said: ""As we continue to recover from the pandemic and confront global pressures on prices and the cost of living, it is clear we need a shared and a relentless focus on boosting the economy."" Scotland's notional deficit is down year on year for two main reasons: extra Covid spending has reduced and oil and gas revenues have increased. That said, the gap between what's raised in Scotland in taxes and what's spent in and on behalf of Scotland is still very high at Â£23.7bn That is equivalent to 12.3% of Scotland's economic output (as measured by GDP) which is more than double the 6.1% rate for the UK as a whole. While these numbers are new, they trigger a very old debate about the state of Scotland's economy and its likely prospects in the event of independence. UK supporters say the figures show how Scottish families ""benefit massively"" from being part of the union and a much larger economy. Independence supporters say if the Scottish government had full financial control it could do a better job of running the economy. Today's report does not tell us what the future holds - with or without independence - but it does highlight the very challenging financial position that needs to be addressed.

"Conman Jody Oliver dressed as cruise ship seaman and told targets of fictitious holidays A fake sea captain who sold bogus holidays to victims has been jailed for six years. Jody Oliver, 44, dressed as cruise ship seaman and lied to his targets about holidays with huge discounts. Newport Crown Court heard he admitted stealing Â£320,315 in a fraud the judge called an ""intricate deception"". Andrew Davies, prosecuting, said  Oliver, of Bwlch, Powys, ""baited the hook"" for his victims with bargain holidays that did not exist. One victim was a taxi driver tipped off by a barmaid at Newport's Alma Inn about deals offered by ""Captain Oliver"". Facebook sued over scam celebrity ads Police response to Â£3.9m fraud 'woeful' Mr Davies said: ""He would dress as a ship's captain and had a fake lanyard for the Carnival Line."" He also created fake documents, including a forged contract, before cancelling or delaying the holidays, saying it was the result of security issues or ship problems. Jody Oliver met some victims through Newport's Alma Inn He created fictitious Carnival Line staff to back up his story, forwarding victims fake emails. One family was left waiting in December 2018 with bags packed for an airport transfer that never came. When victims raised their concerns, police uncovered the gravity of the fraud, carried out while Oliver was on bail for VAT fraud charges. Mr Davies said, when first quizzed by police, Oliver gave his name as Jonathan and said he was born in 1983. He insisted he was a ""master mariner"" and had served as captain for Carnival Line for two years. Oliver split his time between his wife and three children, and a secret boyfriend in Newport. He married childhood sweetheart Laura Ann Oliver in 2002 and met Rhys Burgess online. Mrs Oliver, now separated from her husband, believed he worked as a businessman in the motor trade, for a gaming machine company and as a partner in a funeral home. Mr Burgess believed Oliver was Jaguar Land Rover's director of events. Jody Oliver was sentenced to six years in prison at Newport Crown Court Oliver also targeted 16 friends and family of Mr Burgess at Newport pub The Alma Inn, including his mother Helen Marie and grandmother Denise Fisher. Christine and and Kevin Evans, friends of Mr Burgess' grandmother, booked several cruises. The court heard Oliver led a fantasy lifestyle beyond his means and was an online gambler who had taken out substantial high interest loans and was being chased for his debts. He lost Â£136,000 to online betting in 2017 and 2018. Ms Evans' victim impact statement said: ""It makes my blood boil. I have very bad days myself after getting friends and family involved with this evil man."" Oliver's estranged wife told the court of her ""shock, disgust and anger"" and said she had to move twice because of his crimes. Matthew Buckland, defending, said his client had left a ""trail of devastation"" and was sorry. He added: ""He was unhappy. His life was spiralling out of control."" The court heard in 2004 Oliver was convicted of defrauding the former world rally champion Colin McCrae in a fake sponsorship deal scam, followed by a 2019 conviction for VAT fraud. Judge Richard Williams said: ""You've devastated not only your immediate family but all those involved in this case and have left a lot of people significantly out of pocket and feeling betrayed. ""The motivating factor in your offending is your profound dishonesty and willingness to leech off those of your acquaintance."" He ordered an investigation into Oliver's finances so a proceeds of crime hearing can be held.

"Antonio Colak's fifth goal in eight games put Rangers into the group stages Rangers will play at European football's top table for the first time in more than a decade after stunning PSV Eindhoven to reach the Champions League group stage. The decisive moment of an absorbing tie finally came on the hour, when Malik Tillman intercepted a PSV pass out from defence and squared for Antonio Colak to find an empty net from six yards. The Philips Stadion went almost silent and the home side could find no response in the final half hour despite a flurry of chances. Rangers can now look forward to drawing some of the continent's biggest names in Thursday's draw, where they join rivals Celtic in pot four as the pair play in the group stage in the same season for the first time since 2007/08. Also vital will be the minimum Â£25m windfall which will now come their way as the Ibrox side complete the turnaround from playing in Scotland's third division 10 years ago to the Champions League. 'Dogged Rangers fight way to place with big boys' What awaits Celtic & Rangers in group stage? How calm Van Bronckhorst led Rangers to big time Podcast: 'Rangers can swagger in Champions League' The feat was achieved with a huge amount of resilience as PSV threatened throughout, and also amid the controversy surrounding striker Alfredo Morelos, who was left at home due to concerns about his attitude and fitness. Instead it was the man who has started in his stead all season, Colak, who was in the right place at the crucial moment to score his fifth goal in eight games after brilliant awareness from Tillman to read and shut down goalkeeper Walter Benitez's pass. The inevitable response from PSV came as Philip Max shot wide, and goalkeeper Jon McLaughlin denied their star man Cody Gakpo when through on goal, and those were just the opportunities which came after Rangers struck. There were others, including a free header from Ibrahim Sangare and a shot from close-range from Luuk De Jong fired straight at McLaughlin, but ultimately there was no way through. Rangers showed immense character to hang on and also had their own strong spells, with Tom Lawrence unlucky not to score with a fantastic curling effort which cannoned back off the bar. But it was their European muscle memory which got Giovanni van Bronckhorst's team over the line, as they again proved a smart, skilful and gutsy team on the big stage, traits which characterised their run to last season's Europa League final. Now, the club and its fans can look forward to testing themselves on the biggest stage. The 22-year-old American came of age in Eindhoven. His reading of the game was outstanding, making six clearances and two interceptions Rangers have impressed regularly in Europe in the past four seasons, and this performance underlines the belief and confidence in the group as they triumphed despite trying circumstances. Van Bronckhorst made a huge call to leave out Morelos and travel with just one recognised striker in Colak, and their preparations were disrupted further before kick-of when their bus was held up by PSV fans. Then there was the fact their away record in Europe read just one win in 11. But away from Ibrox and in a rowdy arena, they still produced the goods. It wasn't the swashbuckling football they showed on their run to Seville last season, but they were disciplined, rode their luck, and delivered big moments when it mattered. Tillman's reading of the game was crucial, and McLaughlin's brilliant save from Gakpo kept them ahead. With Celtic already assured of their place in the group stage, it was vitally important for the club financially to keep pace and qualify. The manager has to take huge credit for his influence on the team, having now guided them to six wins from six in two-legged European knockout ties. His calm authority and tactical nous have stood out particularly in cup competitions. Almost exactly 10 years ago Rangers were held to a draw by Berwick Rangers in the third division, this caps the journey back. The league title two seasons ago was crucial, but now they can truly say they have returned to the top level. Ross County are the visitors to Ibrox in the Scottish Premiership on Saturday (15:00 BST), but before that they can enjoy Thursday's group stage draw, which takes place at 17:00.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Footage has emerged showing passengers being evacuated through an emergency service tunnel Dozens of people were left stranded for hours inside the Channel Tunnel after a train from Calais to Folkestone appeared to have broken down. Footage emerged showing Eurotunnel Le Shuttle passengers being evacuated through an emergency service tunnel after having to abandon their vehicles. They were eventually transferred to a replacement train and taken to the Folkestone terminal in Kent. A Eurotunnel spokesman said services were now back to normal. Le Shuttle said Tuesday night's incident began when the train's alarms went off and this needed to be investigated. A spokesman said such incidents were unusual but not exceptional - far more common on trains carrying lorries than those with private cars. ""The Shuttle was brought to a controlled stop and inspected. As a precautionary measure, for their safety and comfort, we transferred the passengers on-board to another shuttle, via the service tunnel [which is there for exactly that purpose],"" the spokesman said. ""We brought them to the passenger terminal building, where food and drinks were available."" He added the original train was then ""slowly brought out"" of the tunnel and the passengers had their vehicles returned to them in Folkestone. Sarah Fellows, 37, from Birmingham, told the PA news agency she found the service tunnel ""terrifying"". She added: ""It was like a disaster movie. You were just walking into the abyss not knowing what was happening. We all had to stay under the sea in this big queue. ""There was a woman crying in the tunnel, another woman having a panic attack who was travelling alone."" One passenger said ""several people were freaking out about being down in the service tunnel"" Another passenger, who did not want to be named, said: ""Several people were freaking out about being down in the service tunnel, it's a bit of a weird place... We were stuck down there for at least five hours."" Mike Harrison, from Cranbrook in Kent, told BBC News it took about six hours to travel from Calais to Folkestone. He said staff spent over an hour trying to find the fault on the train after it had broken down initially before they got it moving again only for it to ""conk out"" after five minutes. Passengers had to walk 10 to 15 minutes to another train, he said. ""Things were getting a bit fractious, a bit stressed. A few people were having minor panic attacks,"" he said. But the freight train used to take passengers to the terminal was also hit by problems with Mr Harrison saying it did not have enough traction. ""By the third time we were all just thinking 'what is going on',"" he said. Rachel Thynne told BBC Radio Kent it was ""getting hotter and hotter"" while staff tried to identify the problem. All those on board the train were transferred ""in line with safety procedures and as a comfort measure"", Le Shuttle said. A passenger contacted the BBC before 17:45 BST saying they were on the train which had stopped. They complained of poor communication and said the public address system did not work properly. One evacuated passenger shared a photo from inside the train they were transferred to Four additional trains were laid on overnight from Calais to Folkestone to deal with the backlog from the incident. The service transports passengers and their vehicles between Folkestone and Calais. At 23.5 miles (37.9km), it has the longest underwater section of any tunnel in the world. Le Shuttle said all passengers would be contacted individually to arrange compensation.

"Mr Biden announced student loan relief with Education Secretary Miguel Cardona US President Joe Biden will cancel up to $10,000 (Â£8,474) in federal student loans for millions of Americans who earn less than $125,000 each year.Â Mr Biden will also forgive $20,000 of debt for students on Pell Grants, which applies to those in greatest financial need. ""People can finally crawl out under that mountain of debt,"" he said. An estimated 43 million Americans owe a combined total of $1.6tn in federal student debt. Nearly one-fifth owe less than $10,000.Â The temporary student loan pause, first put in place in March 2020, will also be extended a final time until 31 December of this year. Speaking from the White House on Wednesday, Mr Biden said his plan would give more ""breathing room"" to working and middle class families. ""The burden is so heavy that even if you graduate you may not have access to the middle class life that the college degree once provided,"" he said, recalling the shame his car salesman father felt when he struggled to pay for his children's education. About one-third of borrowers have student debt but no degree, Mr Biden said. ""The worst of both worlds."" The announcement follows more than a year of intense internal White House debate and mounting pressure from progressive Democrats. Top Democrats Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, are among those who had pushed Mr Biden to use his executive power to wipe out borrower debts. Wednesday's plan falls short of the $50,000 per borrower plan that Mr Schumer and Ms Warren had asked for. A one-time cancellation of $10,000 for each borrower earning a maximum of $125,000 will cost the federal government around$300bn, according to an estimatefrom the Penn Wharton budget model at the University of Pennsylvania,external. Mr Biden addressed this criticism on Wednesday, saying his student forgiveness plan is the ""economically responsible course"". ""I will never apologise for helping working Americans and the middle class,"" he said, adding that ""no high-income individual or high-income household will benefit from this action"". Republicans and some moderate Democrats have said debt cancellation will add to inflation by giving Americans more money to spend. And others say that blanket debt forgiveness is unfair to those who have already paid off students loans. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, quickly criticised the plan on Twitter: ""Who will have to pay for Biden's debt transfer scam? Hard-working Americans who already paid off their debts or never took on student loan debt in the first place,"" he wrote. Some Democratic lawmakers have pushed back, saying that cancelling student loans helps address economic racial disparities. Black students are more likely to borrow federal student loans and at higher amounts than other Americans. Four years after earning bachelor's degrees, black borrowers owe nearly $25,000 more than their white peers on average, according to a Brookings Institution study.

Thanks for joining us. The page was written by Catherine Evans, Marita Moloney, Matt Murphy, James FitzGerald and Sam Hancock. The page was edited by Andrew Humphrey, Chris Giles and Alex Therrien.  Boris Johnson made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Ukraine's Independence Day Our live coverage of the war in Ukraine is due to end soon, but first here's a roundup of the key events from today. Railway station attack:At least 22 people were killed and 50 others injured, after a Russian strike on a railway station in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukraine has said. President Volodymyr Zelensky told the UN Security Council train carriages were hit at Chaplyne station, around 70 miles (110km) west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Independence Day:Monday saw Ukraine mark its 31st Independence Day from the Soviet Union. Public events for the holiday were banned in Kyiv over concerns they could become a target for renewed Russian attacks. Johnson in Kyiv:UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a surprise visit to Kyiv, his third since the war began, to mark Independence Day. While there, he said Ukraine ""can and will"" win against Russia. Six months of war a 'tragic milestone':Wednesday also marked six months since Russia invaded Ukraine. UN chief Antonio Guterres described it as a ""sad and tragic milestone"", adding that the consequences of the ""sad and senseless war"" were being felt far beyond Ukraine"". US aid:President Joe Biden earlier announced $3bn (Â£2.5bn) of fresh US military support for Ukraine - the biggest American package yet - which will help Ukraine to acquire weaponry and equipment. Change in pace:Kyrylo Budanov, one of Ukraine's top military intelligence officials, suggested Russia's offensive is slowing because of ""moral and physical fatigue"". But Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed Moscow had deliberately slowed down its campaign in a bid to to reduce civilian casualties. The lights of Berlin's famous Brandenberg Gate were turned off last month Germany has approved a range of energy-saving measures for the winter as it tries to reduce its dependence on Russian gas. Among other plans, heating in public buildings will be switched off or capped from September onwards, and there will be new restrictions on the lighting of public buildings and shops for aesthetic reasons. The heating of private swimming pools could also be banned. The government hopes the rules could help reduce gas usage by 2%, while the country lowers its longstanding reliance on Russian imports. It says the rules could save households, companies and the public sector around â¬10.8bn (Â£9.1bn) over two years. Read more. President Biden says he's committed to defending Ukrainian sovereignty In other news, there are more details now of the US's new support package for Ukraine worth nearly $3bn (Â£2.5bn). It'll allow the US to procure weapons on Ukraine's behalf - rather than taking arms from existing American stocks. The Pentagon says Kyiv will receive: The US says it's pledged more than $13.5bn (Â£11.5bn) in security assistance to Ukraine under President Joe Biden, and that this fresh tranche is the largest to date. We just reported that the death toll from an air strike on a Ukrainian railway station has risen from 15 to 22. In a message posted on the messaging app Telegram, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky described the attack on Chaplyne railway station in a Ukrainian-held area as today's ""pain"". ""As of this moment, there are 22 dead, five of them burned in a car,"" he said before adding one of those killed was an 11-year-old whose house had been destroyed by a Russian rocket. He said: ""Search and rescue operations at the railway station continue. We will definitely make the occupiers answer for everything they have done. And we will certainly throw out the invaders from our land."" In a nod to Ukraine's 31st Independence Day, Zelensky also said this year's may be ""coming to an end"" but vowed to ensure there'd be a 32nd, a 33rd and so on. ""Ukraine is forever,"" he said. ""And it will only get stronger every day."" Moscow has not commented on the attack. The death toll from a Russian rocket
attack on a railway station in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday has
risen to 22, up from the initial estimate of 15, President
Volodymyr Zelensky has said in a video address. In an address to Ukraine's President Zelensky, the Queen says she hopes the world can look ahead to ""better times in the future"" for Ukrainian people after six months of war. Her words, which the British Embassy in Kyiv published earlier on Twitter, marked Ukraine's 31 years of independence from the Soviet Union. In a series of tweets, the UK in Ukraine Twitter account said: ""In her address to the President of Ukraine she said: ""In this most challenging year, I hope that today will be a time for the Ukrainian people, both in Ukraine and around the world, to celebrate their culture, history and identity. May we look to better times in the future. Elizabeth R.'"" The monarch has previously shown her support for Ukrainian citizens by donating to the Disasters Emergency Committee.. The charitable appeal thanked her in March for making a ""generous donation"" towards its appeal. At the time, the palace declined to disclose the amount given. It's been exactly six months since Russia invaded Ukraine, and the BBC's Ukrainecast team are taking stock in a special episode. Victoria DerbyshireandVitaly Shevchenkohave been following the stories of Max, Anna, Hussain, Maksym and Viktoria - none of whom will ever be the same again. Listen to the podcast here. Against the backdrop of six months of war, Ukraine marked 31 years of independence from the Soviet Union today. Many countries around the world showed support by joining in on the celebrations too. Let's take a look: London, England Protesters demonstrate against Russia's invasion during a Ukrainian Independence Day rally outside Downing Street in London Berlin, Germany People march during a Freedom Parade in Berlin, Germany Donetsk, Ukraine A Ukrainian flag is raised with balloons on Independence Day in Avdiivka in the Donetsk region of Ukraine Athens, Greece Ukrainians living in Greece hold their national flag as they gather to mark the day in Athens Edinburgh, Scotland People gathered for a Ukraine independence rally at Edinburgh's Calton Hill Dublin, Ireland Protesters also demonstrated in Dublin, Ireland Oslo, Norway People take part in a demonstration against the Russian war in Ukraine at Eidsvolls plass in Oslo, Norway The alleged Russian attack that President Zelensky says killed 15 people happened at Chaplyne railway station in a Ukrainian-held area roughly between Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk on the map below. As you can see, Russian troops have gradually been moving towards the area, having seized swathes of territory across Ukraine's east since launching their invasion. Moscow has not yet commented on the strike. Images of devastation have been shared by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba after Kyiv said Russia had attacked Ukraine's Chaplyne station. The photos - which have not yet been verified by the BBC - show a number of smouldering rail carriages which appear to have suffered fire damage, as well as burned-out road vehicles and fallen masonry. Kuleba said civilians had been killed in the attack, which he blamed on Russia. Moscow is yet to comment on the strike, which President Zelensky says killed at least 15 people. Allow Twitter content?

More now on an alleged Russian attack on a railway station in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, mentioned by President Zelensky at the UN Security Council a short while ago. He said train carriages were hit at Chaplyne station, about 70 miles (110km) west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Four carriages were on fire when he received the news, he said. He added that emergency services were on the scene, but that the number of fatalities could increase from 15. Russia has not commented on the alleged attack, which came on Ukrainian Independence Day and the six-month anniversary of Moscow's invasion. Fifteen people have been killed in a Russian strike on a railway station in the Dnipropetrovsk region, says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Around 50 others were injured, he told the UN Security Council. We'll bring you more details when we get them. Pratiksha GhildialReporting from New York The Ukrainian leader was allowed to address the Security Council remotely Let's get a little more from the UN Security Council earlier, where member states displayed
solidarity for Ukrainians on the country's Independence Day. TheUSand other Western nations were
some of the most vocal to offer support, while others likeBrazilandIndiawere more cautious and advised dialogue. The meeting
started withUkrainerequesting that the countryâs President Volodymyr Zelensky be
allowed to participate via video link.Russiawas quick to object, citing rules
that members need be physically present to speak. It asked why Zelensky hadnât travelled to New York even though he was seen travelling around
Ukraine meeting foreign delegations and posing for ""glossy magazines"". In a vote by a
show of hands, Russia was quickly overruled by other members, and Zelensky
was allowed to talk. Despite technical difficulties (which Russia later took a
dig at), the president spoke for about 10 minutes. Referring
to the situation at theZaporizhzhianuclear plant, he accused Russia of putting the world on the brink of a ""radiation catastrophe"" and indulging in
""nuclear blackmail"". Russia
then accused Ukraine of destroying civilian infrastructure - including schools
and medical facilities - and Western nations of being ""accomplices"" to crimes
against civilians, having supplied Ukraine with more weapons. The
UN secretary general expressed deep concern over Zaporizhzhia â and admitted there seemed to be no signs of the war ending soon. A protester being arrested in St Petersburg in March A leading human rights group says more than 16,000 Russians have been detained by the Kremlin for protesting against the invasion of Ukraine. The report from the OVD-Info group, an independent Russian human rights monitor, said some 16,437 people have been arrested for a range of offences since February. Suspects were seized for demonstrating in the street and making comments on social media. The figure also includes people arrested simply for referring to the conflict as a ""war"",  which has been made illegal in Russia. The majority of the arrests came in the first two months of the conflict, suggesting that much of the internal opposition in Russia has been suppressed by the heavy government crackdown. The report comes as authorities arrested the prominent Kremlin critic, Yevgeny Roizman, on charges of ""discrediting the military"". One of Ukraine's top military intelligence officials has suggested that Russia's offensive is slowing because of ""moral and physical fatigue"" in their ranks - and Moscow's ""exhausted"" resource base. Kyrylo Budanov, chief of the Defence Intelligence agency, made the remarks on Ukrainian television, Reuters reports, providing one of the strongest signals yet that Kyiv believes Russia's power could be waning. ""Russia has rather seriously slowed down the tempo of its assault. The reason for this is the exhaustion of their resource base, as well as a moral and physical fatigue from the fighting,"" he said. It comes after Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed earlier that Moscow had deliberately slowed down its campaign in Ukraine, something he said had been driven by the need to reduce civilian casualties. Scaled-down celebrations have been taking place across Ukraine to mark the country's Independence Day and the six-month anniversary of the Russian invasion. Here's what's been happening so far: Gary O'DonoghueWashington Correspondent As we reported earlier, the US has announced a fresh $3bn (Â£2.5bn) military aid package for Ukraine. This is the largest package to be announced in one go, something the president can do safe in the knowledge that most Americans back the support thatâs going to Ukraine. While there are differences between Democrats and Republicans, one recent poll indicated 53% backing for the aid until Russia withdrew â with just 18% opposed. Even among Republicans, who are more cautious about the policy, there was still majority support. While some of the aid (up to Â£4bn recently approved by Congress) is for humanitarian purposes, the vast majority is going to weapons systems and ammunition that Ukraine requires in the medium term â such as technologies for spotting and shooting down unmanned drones. One key point worth noting in this latest round of military aid is that itâs being drawn down from something called the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. This is a pot of money authorised by Congress that allows weapons and equipment to be purchased through industry rather than taken from existing military stocks. That sounds like a technical point, but such purchasing could take longer than the simple transfer of gear already in storage. And thatâs a key indication that Washington believes this war wonât be over anytime soon. Russia carried out a much higher number of air and missile attacks on Ukrainian territory on 24 August - Ukraine's Independence Day - than usual, the Ukrainian General Staff said in its daily evening update. It did not specify what facilities were hit. In the Donetsk Region, Russian troops tried to advance in the direction of Nova Dmytrivka, Pisky, Novoselske, Pobeda, Novomykhaylivka, Pavlivka and Velyka Novosilka but suffered losses and retreated, the report said. The Russians tried to improve their tactical positions by attacking in the direction of Soledar, Bakhmutske and Kodema but were rebuffed and withdrew. In Kherson, Ukrainian troops repelled a Russian attack in the direction of Mykolayivka, the General Staff added. The six-month anniversary of the start of Russia's war in Ukraine is a ""sad and tragic milestone"", the UN secretary general says. Speaking during a special meeting of the UN's security council in New York, Antonio Guterres says the consequences of ""this senseless war are being felt far beyond Ukraine"", referring to spiralling global food and energy costs. He warns ""there simply will not be enough food in 2023"" if the fertiliser market is not stabilised this year. Guterres also remains ""gravely concerned"" about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine and the Russian militarisation of the facility. ""The warning lights are flashing. Any further escalation of the situation could lead to self-destruction. The security of the plant must be ensured, and the plant must be re-established as purely civilian infrastructure."" Antonio Guterres, UN secretary general Â© 2025 BBC.

"Olivia's head teacher said she had a ""beautiful smile, a lovely sense of humour, and a bubbly personality"" Police hunting the gunman who shot dead a nine-year-old girl at her home in Liverpool have been given the name of a suspect by two different sources. Olivia Pratt-Korbel was killed by a masked attacker who had chased a man into her house in the Dovecot area of the city on Monday night. News that detectives had been given a lead was welcomed by Merseyside Police and Crime Commissioner Emily Spurrell. ""I'm really pleased to hear information is coming forward,"" she told the BBC. ""It was the plea that was put out yesterday - we know somebody out there will know what happened and who is involved."" Officers are also reviewing CCTV footage and conducting house-to-house inquiries. Girl, 9, shot dead after gun chase spills into home Shooting victim was ray of sunshine - school head Police said the gunman ""fired indiscriminately"", hitting Olivia in the chest as she stood behind her mother Cheryl Korbel, who was shot in the wrist. The man being chased was also shot and remains in hospital in a serious, but not life-threatening, condition. Detectives have not yet spoken to him and he has not been arrested. Mrs Korbel is recovering at another hospital. The family had no connection to either of the men, police said. This video can not be played Watch: Liverpool police reveal how shooting of 9-year-old unfolded At a press conference on Tuesday, Merseyside Police said: A 35-year-old man ran into Olivia's home, followed by a man armed with a handgun, after Ms Korbel opened the door to see what the noise was outside Olivia was fatally shot and Ms Korbel was shot in the wrist as she tried to shut the door The gunman then twice fired through the gap in the door, hitting the 35-year-old in the upper body, before running away The injured man was then driven away in a black Audi, while Olivia and Ms Korbel were left behind The gunman was described as about 5ft 7in (170cm), of slim build, carrying a handgun and wearing a black padded jacket, a black balaclava and black gloves Merseyside's criminal fraternity are being asked to help in the hunt for the gunman Merseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy described the attack, which happened in Kingsheath Avenue at about 22:00 BST, as ""shocking and appalling"". She said: ""I want to take this opportunity again to appeal to anybody who knows who is responsible for this attack to please come forward and give us those names. ""We need to find all who are responsible for this - not just the gunman. We need to find out who supplied the weapon and who arranged this terrible incident."" She said Olivia's death was ""an absolute tragedy and crosses every single boundary"". Ms Kennedy added: ""If people are frightened to come forward, we can have those conversations in confidence."" This video can not be played Watch: Liverpool police say gunman had no connection to killed 9-year-old girl Boris Johnson described the shooting as ""horrific"" and ""senseless"". On Twitter, the prime minister promised Merseyside Police would get ""whatever they need to catch those responsible and secure justice for Olivia"". Liverpool Mayor Joanne Anderson ""someone out there knows who did this... abhorrent act of evil"". Local councillor Barbara Murray told BBC Breakfast: ""Coming forward, you don't have to go to the police. Liverpool has got 90 councillors, I think any one of them would liaise with police on behalf of anybody who wants to give information. ""Really strongly, I would say people can use Crimestoppers. It's an anonymous phone call. You don't have to give information about yourself."" Assistant mayor Harry Doyle told the Radio 4 Today programme: ""It was just, and still is, a complete and utter shock. As the news progressed yesterday it just became more horrific. ""Just speaking to people on their doorsteps, they're mortified. Lots of children in the area who have played with Olivia on the street, they're really upset. ""The confusion as well when these things happen, when it's in your street, it's very real. It's heartbreaking, it really is."" Floral tributes to Olivia have been left close to the scene of the shooting Mr Doyle said the police's understanding of crime in the city had changed sincethe murder of 11-year-old Rhys Jonesin 2007, and he was ""very confident we will get justice"". But the former chief constable of Greater Manchester Police has downplayed the likelihood of criminals turning in the killer. Questioned on Sky News about whether criminal gangs would respond to an appeal from Merseyside Police, Sir Peter Fahy said: ""It's very rare, really. ""This, at the end of the day, will be down to either a lucky piece of information from the public, really good analysis of mobile phone data. ""Often when criminal members suffer the most horrendous injuries they refuse to co-operate with the police or tell the police what's happened. ""Because they want to exact their own revenge or just out of fear."" Olivia's death comes after a spate of killings involving guns and knives on Merseyside in recent weeks.

"Merseyside's criminal fraternity are being asked to help in the hunt for the killer of Olivia Pratt-Korbel Is the recent spate of fatal shootings in Merseyside and London a statistical blip, or the end of a period of success in the fight against gun crime? The horrifyingkilling of nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbelwas the third death involving a gun in or around Liverpool this month. There were also three deaths in London in July and a fourth in August. It follows a period where guns appeared to be being kept off the streets and out of the hands of criminals. A combination of factors including Covid lockdowns, intensive policing, and a breakthrough in the fight against organised crime were thought to be reducing firearms crimes overall. But there are very early signs that that might be changing, especially in Merseyside - where shots have been fired at houses, vehicles and people. A review of police statements detail men and women found with injuries in the street or turning up at hospitals with gunshot wounds. They were the lucky ones. On the night of 16 August, 20-year-old Sam Rimmer was shot dead in a cul-de-sac in Dingle, close to the banks of the Mersey, as he walked with a group of friends. Police have said his alleged attackers were two men who fired from motorbikes before riding off.Three men were arrested on Wednesday. Then in the early hours of Sunday morning Ashley Dale, 28, was found by officers with gunshot wounds in a garden in the Old Swan neighbourhood of the city. Policebelieve she was not the intended victimof the attack and the gunman is still on the run. They are trying to trace a car driven into Leinster Road 10 minutes before the shooting. This video can not be played Watch: CCTV shows moments before girl, 9, shot dead Olivia Pratt-Korbel was thethird victimon Monday. There have been nine shooting incidents since April involving someone being injured in areas including Croxteth, Knotty Ash, Old Swan, Toxteth and Woodchurch. In Merseyside, 16 guns have been seized by police investigating criminal activities this year, with many more handed in as part of Operation Aztec - a firearms surrender programme held every two years. Gun offences had been increasing since roughly 2015 across England and Wales, according to figures from the Office of National Statistics. But then came the pandemic. Lockdowns had a huge impact on all of our lives, and patterns of crime, with criminals finding it harder to move around empty streets. In the year to 31 March 2020 there were 83 shooting incidents reported to Merseyside Police. As the pandemic clamped down on movement, the number dropped to 42 between April 2020 and March 2021. This was followed by 39 the next year -  which was a 21-year low, according to Labour's police and crime commissioner for Merseyside Emily Spurrell. Last year, Merseyside Police launched a new specialist team to tackle drugs and firearms. There have been 27 shootings, or ""discharge incidents"" in police jargon in just five months since March this year, suggesting the rate is increasing compared to the year before. Dr Robert Hesketh, from the School of Justice Studies at Liverpool John Moores University, thinks the incidents will increase because of the cost of living crisis. ""People are getting desperate and desperate times call for desperate measures,"" he said. Dr Hesketh disagreed with senior police officers, who say it is hard for a criminal to buy a gun in Britain. The academic instead suggested in Liverpool a cheap firearm can be obtained for as little as Â£150 with a bit of asking around. Gun crime is closely linked with drug dealing. At the top of the criminal tree drug gangs arrange imports to sell in the UK. The retail arm of the market has become dominated by a relatively new business model. County lines gangs, using dedicated mobile phones for customers to make orders, shift drugs around the country and have been blamed for increasing the risk of violence involving guns and knives. Liverpool is an important part of the UK's drug gang infrastructure. In spring 2020 there was a breakthrough in the fight against organised crime, following the penetration of the Encrochat encrypted phone network by the French police. The expensive phones had become a required bit of kit for organised criminals, especially drug dealers, because it allowed them to safely organise their business. But for two months the cracking of the Encrochat server in France allowed police to read their candid criminal messages, a fraction of a second after they were sent. This led tomore than a thousand arrests across the UK. Many criminals pleaded guilty in the face of the evidence. This breakthrough for police coincided with the coronavirus pandemic and may have increased the pressure on criminals created by the lockdowns. However the concern now is that something has changed and a long hot summer of gun crime will continue into the autumn. Steve Rotheram, Mayor of the Liverpool City Region, said ""Liverpool is still one of the safest metropolitan areas in the country. Until last week, we hadn't seen a gun-related death in the city for more than 12 months.""

Olivia Pratt-Korbel was shot in the chest as her mother struggled with the men at the door of her house in Dovecot at about 22:00 BST on Monday. The gunman ""fired indiscriminately"", hitting Olivia, her mum Cheryl Korbel in the wrist and the man in the body. Merseyside Police said the family had no connection to the two men who forced their way into the house.

""We need to find all who are responsible for this,"" she said. ""Not just the gunman, we need to find who supplied the weapon and who arranged this terrible incident."" She added that she wanted to appeal to Liverpool's ""criminal fraternity"" for information, as Olivia's death was ""an absolute tragedy and crosses every single boundary"". Ms Kennedy said officers who were sent to the scene ""could see just how poorly Olivia was and they rushed her to Alder Hey Children's Hospital, where, despite the best efforts of medical staff, she sadly died"". She added forensic experts were at the scene conducting house-to-house inquiries and officers were reviewing CCTV footage to establish and identify who was responsible. Olivia was joyful and kind-hearted, head teacher says Appealing to the gunman to hand himself in, Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen said officers had not yet spoken to the injured man, who had not been arrested and was in hospital in a serious, but not life-threatening, condition.

Fellow resident Sarah Halliday said it was ""absolutely disgusting to wake up and find that a nine-year-old girl has been shot dead"". Her partner Scott Mason added it was ""scary for men, because women and kids are getting shot"". ""You're scared of your girlfriend and your daughter going to the shop... are they going to come back?"" he said. Police are appealing for dashcam, CCTV and mobile phone footage from anyone in the area at the time Olivia's head teacher Rebecca Wilkinson, from St Margaret Mary's Catholic Junior School in Huyton,described her as ""a much-loved member of our school""with a ""beautiful smile, a lovely sense of humour, and a bubbly personality"".

Merseyside Police said there was nothing to indicate that Olivia's shooting was linked to other recent killings, but officers were keeping an open mind to follow any potential leads. The force added the attack on the 35-year-old man was targeted and was believed to be related to organised crime.

"Claire Sugden took up the position of justice minister in 2016, when she was 29 A former Stormont justice minister has hit out at criticism she faced about her age and gender when appointed to the role. Claire Sugden, now the assembly's longest-serving independent member, took up the position in 2016, when she was 29. She said she still felt frustrated by commentary surrounding that period. ""I was in government with another minister who was months older than me - he was a man and wasn't criticised."" Ms Sugden was asked to become justice minister by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in when they were forming a government after the assembly election in May 2016. The role is filled on a cross-community basis, meaning it needs the support of a majority of unionists and nationalists at Stormont. Alliance had held the role prior to that election, butdeclined to take it up again. Speaking onBBC News NI's Red Lines podcast, Ms Sugden said she was surprised to be offered the job, but ultimately agreed to the role. ""I did question if I'd be good enough, but I reflected on people who had done the job previously,"" she said. ""They were no more experienced as the minister of justice at the point they were asked to do it than I was, but there was criticism because of my age and gender. ""I think people feel the justice portfolio was a masculine, severe role. I disagree with that. ""My father was a prison officer and as kids we were in and out of prisons all the time because of the nature of his role."" Claire Sugden told Mark Carruthers she was disappointed she only had nine months in the role of justice minister She said she was prepared to ""stand up"" to the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in when required over executive business. ""I know a lot of people would have criticised me for being young and. to an extent, inexperienced, but my own life experiences up to that point - my education, other jobs and roles I've performed - it's about having the goal of doing what you believe is right,"" she added. However, she said she was disappointed that she only had nine months in the role before the power-sharing government collapsed, following a political crisis over agreen energy scandal. ""I asked them (the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in) to give me a chance, sadly for me they didn't because less than nine months later, the government collapsed. ""I kept my promise, but they didn't keep theirs. I wholeheartedly can say, that was a government that had an opportunity to do wonderful things."" Claire Sugden vows to remain independent ""for now"" but may look elsewhere if devolution does not fully return Asked about the difficulty of working as one of only two independent members at Stormont, Ms Sugden said it could be challenging. She was co-opted into the seat in 2014 and has since retained it in three assembly elections. ""It is really tough being a backbench MLA (assembly member) if you can't create change,"" said the East Londonderry representative. Stormont has been without a functioning assembly and executive for several months, due to the DUP's opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Ms Sugden said she was ""unsure"" about what her own political future would bring, if devolution did not fully return. Stormont recall: Third attempt to fully restore NI Assembly fails NI protocol: Legislation clears House of Commons NI Protocol: Government urges DUP to return to Stormont 'as soon as possible' Last year it emerged she had been approached to join the Ulster Unionists but hadturned the offer down. ""I guard my independence fiercely, to achieve what I've achieved is really important to me,"" she said of the decision. ""But [we] can't keep firefighting, we have to ensure the fires don't start in the first place - that's why we need Stormont. ""Maybe as long as people keep electing me, I will still be there, but I don't want to be part of the furniture I want to create change. ""Sadly, that means if the institutions don't enable me to do that, I may have to look elsewhere. ""Maybe that means standing for Westminster, maybe potentially looking at a political party eventually - but I don't know."" She said she would remain independent ""for now"", in order to respect the electorate who gave her their vote in May.

"The German government has approved a set of energy-saving measures for the winter which will limit the use of lighting and heating in public buildings. The government aims to reduce gas usage by 2% through the new rules. Germany's economy minster said the rules could save private households, companies and the public sector around â¬10.8bn (Â£9.1bn) over two years. It is part of efforts to reduce the country's dependency on Russian gas. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, Germany got 55% of its gas from Russia but it has reduced this to 35% and vowed to end imports completely. However, it remains a huge market for Moscow and paid almost â¬9bn (Â£7.7bn; $9.6bn) for Russian oil and gas in the first two months of the war. Can hydrogen ease Germany's need for Russian gas? How Russia is cutting off gas to Europe Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Russia has also cut flows of gas through the key Nordstream 1 pipeline to Germany to 20% of capacity, raising fears it may turn off the taps this winter. Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck told reporters that his country wanted to free itself ""as quickly as possible from the grip of Russian energy imports"". But he added: ""Overall the [new] measures save energy. However, not to the extent that we can sit back and say, 'That'll do now.'"" Brandenburg Gate in Berlin had its lights turned off in July Starting from September, public buildings apart from institutions like hospitals, are to be heated to a maximum of 19C and the heating may be turned off completely in entrances, corridors and foyers. Public monuments and buildings will also not be lit up for aesthetic reasons and businesses could be banned from keeping their shops illuminated at night. Private swimming pool heating could also be banned. And the country will give coal and oil cargo priority over passenger travel on railways meaning passengers will have to wait. ""We have a shortage situation on the rails right now,"" Transport Minister Volker Wissing said. ""That means that if additional fuel transports are temporarily necessary we would have to prioritise them."" Germany also plans to run publicity campaigns to tell locals how they can cut down on their own consumption. And amid concerns about winter shortages, the country is setting up two liquefied natural gas terminals on the North Sea coast to improve storage. Most European Union member states have committed to voluntarily reduce gas use by 15% this winter - although this will become mandatory if there are serious shortages. Meanwhile, Spain has already brought in rules limiting use of air conditioning and heating temperatures in public and large commercial buildings, as it seeks to save energy. On Wednesday, Switzerland's energy minister said it would ""certainly make sense"" for the country to align with the EU's plan in order to prevent an energy crisis. Switzerland's electricity commission has also recommended that households stock up on candles in case of blackouts caused by changes in Russian supplies. Earlier this month Swiss energy Minister Simonetta Sommaruga said she would try to enact a plan to have the heating turned down in public buildings. Can hydrogen ease Germany's need for Russian gas?

"Some BTec level 2 students will not get their results as expected on Thursday, an exam board has suggested. About 235,000 BTec Firsts, Technicals and Tech Award grades were scheduled to be sent to students on Thursday. But exam board Pearson said that, as of Wednesday morning, 7,000 students were ""ineligible to receive their grade"". Pearson said it had ""a dedicated team"" working to obtain any outstanding information and would provide any results ""as quickly as possible"". Results for GCSEs, as well as other vocational and technical qualifications,are also due to be released on Thursday. Pearson's announcement does not affect results for GCSEs. What you need to know about this year's GCSEs 'BTec results delay has cost my clearing place' The affected BTec students could be deemed ""ineligible"" because some of their marks are not logged in the system, the BBC understands. This may be because of processing issues, or, in some instances, because the pupil has decided not to continue with their BTec studies. By Hayley Clarke Jacqueline Williamson is worried that BTec delays could affect her son, as well as her daughter Jacqueline Williamson, 48, a nurse in a fertility unit from Washington, in Tyne and Wear, was worried when her daughter, Sian Wright, 18, was affected by delays to BTec Level 3 results last week. Now she fears her son, Owen Wright, 16, may be affected by the recently announced delays to BTec Level 2 results. ""He did two BTecs... so there is the potential for delays,"" she told the BBC. She says she is ""absolutely devastated"" for ""all the kids - who deserve better"". ""They've had two years of disrupted education - through no-one's fault - during the pandemic,"" she says. ""I feel they've been massively let down and disrespected. These exam boards know results' day is coming - it's like Christmas, you know when it's coming. ""It's just so frustrating."" Pearson cannot currently confirm how many students who are expecting grades on Thursday will not receive them. In a statement on Wednesday, the exam board said: ""As of 09:00 BST today, there are 7,000 students that are currently ineligible to receive their grade as they do not meet the qualification criteria at this time. ""We have a dedicated team in place to work with schools and colleges to obtain and validate any outstanding information."" Pearson said it was focused on ""running those eligibility checks and providing any results as quickly as possible to students"". It thanked schools and colleges for ""tirelessly supporting us in this work"". Anger as late exam results delay uni places Apology to students over delay to BTec results School leaders' union NAHT said: ""This will cause unnecessary anxiety and stress as young people seek to confirm their places with sixth forms, colleges and training providers."" Sarah Hannafin, its senior policy adviser, added: ""And with no result, how can they celebrate their achievements with family and friends?"" The Department for Education in England said it was working with exams regulator Ofqual to make sure grades are awarded ""as quickly as possible"", and that it expected schools and colleges ""to hold places offered to students who are awaiting results, to ensure they can still progress"". Last week,Pearson apologised after some BTec level 3 studentsdid not receive their results on the day they were expected, in some cases putting the chance of securing a university place in doubt. Pearson said a ""very small percentage"" of its BTec students were affected. Another exam board, OCR, has also experienced delays issuing Cambridge Technicals results to some students. Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow education secretary, said ""chaos"" around BTec results was ""unacceptable"", adding: ""It's appalling that students are still waiting on results from last week."" The Department for Education has been contacted for comment. Overall grades for GCSEs on Thursday are expected to be lower than 2020 and 2021, when grades based on teachers' assessments led to arise in top marks. But - as with last week's A-level results - they are projected to be higher than grades in 2019. Are you expecting BTEC Level 2 results tomorrow, and are worried you may not receive your results?

"Asda is scrapping best before dates on hundreds of fruit and vegetable products to help reduce food waste. The supermarket will make the change to more than 200 products across its UK stores from September. They will be replaced by a code that Asda staff will use to check quality and freshness. Waste & Resources Action Programme (Wrap) said the average family throws away Â£60 worth of food and drink each month. Products including citrus fruits, potatoes, cauliflowers, and carrots will all have the labels removed. Catherine David, director of collaboration and change at Wrap, said: ""We are delighted by this development from Asda to help tackle food waste in our homes. ""Our research has shown that date labels on fruit and veg are unnecessary - getting rid of them can prevent the equivalent of seven million shopping baskets' worth from our household bins."" Best before labels are used to indicate when the product is at its best quality, taste and texture. But foods can be safe to eat beyond this. They are different to use by dates, which show when food can be cooked and consumed safely. The Food Standards Agency said use by dates should be on ""food like meat products and ready to eat salads which could be unsafe if left for too long"". Asda's Andy Cockshaw said: ""Reducing food waste in our business and in customers' homes is a priority and we are always looking at different ways to achieve this. ""We know for customers this has become more important than ever in the current climate as many families are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis and are looking to make savings wherever they can.""

"There are fears fish and chip shops could struggle to survive as costs rise Fish and chip shops are facing ""extinction"" amid rising costs, an industry body has warned. Some shops in the West of England say the soaring price of cod, sunflower oil and energy has left them struggling. The National Federation of Fish Friers is urging the government to cut VAT and help shops with energy bills. A government spokesman said it is supporting businesses ""of all sizes by slashing fuel duty"" and introducing a 50% business rates relief. The federation has secured a meeting with ministers on Thursday to push its message that the industry needs help. One manager said they feared some families were cutting out regular fish and chip nights due to the cost-of-living crisis. Craig Williams, from Sand Bay Fish and Chip Shop near Weston-super-Mare, said the current situation was ""worse"" than during the pandemic. ""People were coming in to spend their money [when] they were furloughed,"" he said. Craig Williams of Sand Bay Fish and Chip Shop said some families were abandoning their regular treat ""People had money in their pockets, people are penny-pinching now. So fish and chips might not be top of their priority list on a Friday night."" Some shops are putting their prices up to stay afloat. Bishopston Fish Bar on Gloucester Road in Bristol has already raised its prices three times this year, but staff hope they will not have to do it again. Chip shops battered as price of fish rises What's the best fish and chips combo? Seagulls have 'favourite' fish and chip shops to visit Jason Ford, from the shop, said during the same period ""business had dropped by about 30% per cent - but we're still going"". Jason Ford from Bishopston Fish Bar hope they won't have to raise their prices again National Federation of Fish Friers President Andrew Crook revealed about 66% of shops had reduced opening hours to save money - equating to a fall in staffing levels of four people per shop. He added: ""Unfortunately this is potentially an extinction event for small businesses. ""It's like nothing we've ever seen before."" A government spokesman said: ""We are working closely with industry to mitigate the impact our sanctions against Russia may have on British businesses, including through the creation of the Â£100m UK Seafood Fund. ""We're already supporting businesses of all sizes by slashing fuel duty, introducing a 50% business rates relief for eligible high street businesses and put the brakes on bill increases by freezing the business rates multiplier - worth Â£4.6 billion over the next five years.""

"Mr Biden announced student loan relief with Education Secretary Miguel Cardona US President Joe Biden will cancel up to $10,000 (Â£8,474) in federal student loans for millions of Americans who earn less than $125,000 each year.Â Mr Biden will also forgive $20,000 of debt for students on Pell Grants, which applies to those in greatest financial need. ""People can finally crawl out under that mountain of debt,"" he said. An estimated 43 million Americans owe a combined total of $1.6tn in federal student debt. Nearly one-fifth owe less than $10,000.Â The temporary student loan pause, first put in place in March 2020, will also be extended a final time until 31 December of this year. Speaking from the White House on Wednesday, Mr Biden said his plan would give more ""breathing room"" to working and middle class families. ""The burden is so heavy that even if you graduate you may not have access to the middle class life that the college degree once provided,"" he said, recalling the shame his car salesman father felt when he struggled to pay for his children's education. About one-third of borrowers have student debt but no degree, Mr Biden said. ""The worst of both worlds."" The announcement follows more than a year of intense internal White House debate and mounting pressure from progressive Democrats. Top Democrats Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, are among those who had pushed Mr Biden to use his executive power to wipe out borrower debts. Wednesday's plan falls short of the $50,000 per borrower plan that Mr Schumer and Ms Warren had asked for. A one-time cancellation of $10,000 for each borrower earning a maximum of $125,000 will cost the federal government around$300bn, according to an estimatefrom the Penn Wharton budget model at the University of Pennsylvania,external. Mr Biden addressed this criticism on Wednesday, saying his student forgiveness plan is the ""economically responsible course"". ""I will never apologise for helping working Americans and the middle class,"" he said, adding that ""no high-income individual or high-income household will benefit from this action"". Republicans and some moderate Democrats have said debt cancellation will add to inflation by giving Americans more money to spend. And others say that blanket debt forgiveness is unfair to those who have already paid off students loans. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, a Republican from California, quickly criticised the plan on Twitter: ""Who will have to pay for Biden's debt transfer scam? Hard-working Americans who already paid off their debts or never took on student loan debt in the first place,"" he wrote. Some Democratic lawmakers have pushed back, saying that cancelling student loans helps address economic racial disparities. Black students are more likely to borrow federal student loans and at higher amounts than other Americans. Four years after earning bachelor's degrees, black borrowers owe nearly $25,000 more than their white peers on average, according to a Brookings Institution study.

"Nine changing rooms at Urban Outfitters in York had to be closed so the changing room could be cleaned A police officer has kept her job despite urinating in a clothes shop fitting room while drunk off-duty and then lying to her bosses about it. PC Amelia Shearer, 24, of Cleveland Police was found guilty of gross misconduct following the incident in Urban Outfitters in York last year. A disciplinary panel in Middlesbrough found her conduct was discreditable and she had been dishonest. It decided not to sack her but instead issued a final written warning. The panel's chairwoman, Ogheneruona Iguyovwe, said: ""There is scope for her to be rehabilitated, there is scope for her to set the record straight and to begin on a new path."" Ms Iguyovwe had earlier pointed out that police officers were ""expected to maintain high standards of behaviour"" and should consider if their actions might cause a loss of confidence in the police. ""Officers are required to act with integrity and honesty at all times,"" she said. During the three-day hearing, the panel was told probationer PC Shearer had been in York with a friend while off-duty on 11 September. In under four hours Middlesbrough-based officer drank half a bottle of Prosecco, three cocktails and a Jack Daniels and Coke before going to the store. While thereshe is alleged to have asked a sales assistant if the store had toilets, and when told it did not she went into a changing room cubicle. PC Shearer, who studied a Masters in criminal investigations before joining the police in 2019, admitted she had been drunk and described herself and her friend as ""loud and giggly"". She denied relieving herself in the store. She claimed to have used the changing rooms to adjust her bra - but had told her superior Insp Christian Duree she had been trying on clothes during a phone call the day after it happened. She explained that she only gave him an ""abridged version"" of events but Cleveland Police accused her of lying - and the panel agreed. Olivia Checa-Dover, acting for the force, said the conclusion that PC Shearer had been dishonest meant she was now ""undeployable"". She said the fact the officer had lied while being questioned on oath would have to be disclosed to defence lawyers in any future investigations she carried out. Joan Smith, for the defendant, said her client had consistently denied the claims, had good references and her performance had been described by her inspector as ""excellent"". She said the officer had the potential to be ""exceptional"" and to ""flourish in this police force with the appropriate guidance"".

"The minimum wage in the UK should rise to Â£15 an hour ""as soon as possible"", the Trades Union Congress (TUC) says. This rate should apply to workers of all ages, instead of the current lower rate for under-23s, it said. Minimum wage is Â£9.50 an hour for workers over the age of 23 and Â£9.18 for 21 and 22 year olds. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at 10.1% - so wages do not go as far. The government said raising the minimum wage could push unemployment up. Prices are rising at their fastest rate in 40 years, driven by higher food, fuel and energy costs. How much is the minimum wage? Sainsbury's urged to extend higher pay to cleaners Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: ""Every worker should be able to afford a decent standard of living. ""But millions of low-paid workers live wage packet to wage packet, struggling to get by - and they are now being pushed to the brink by eye-watering bills and soaring prices."" The government said it was ""determined to make work pay"" and that this year's increase in the minimum wage, in April, was the largest ever rise. However, it said setting the minimum wage too high or increasing it too quickly could lead to higher unemployment. The TUC argues that at a time when companies are paying increased dividends to shareholders, the government should ensure workers get ""their fair share"" by increasing minimum wage rates now, rather than waiting for the next expected uprating in April. It should start with low-paid workers who are ""absolutely terrified about what those hikes in energy bills will mean for their budgets, having to fork out for school uniforms and put food on the table"", Ms O'Grady told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She said a higher minimum wage would mean workers were less likely to be claiming in-work benefits, and more likely to be paying taxes as well as buying goods and services on the High Street. Kelly, 31, works front of house in a well-known London restaurant and despite eight years of experience in the sector is paid the minimum wage. Her income is topped up with tips and her partner has a  salary, but she has still seen a decline in her quality of life over the past decade. ""We are constantly in a precarious position, living hand-to-mouth,"" she said. ""[We're] being squeezed further and further."" But Mark Hodges, 66, who runs a clubhouse restaurant on a holiday park in Norfolk, said raising the minimum wage to Â£15 an hour would mean restaurants would have to raise prices. ""Although it would be fantastic to see us all move to Â£15 an hour, I cannot see how such a large rise - across all ages - would do our sector many favours,"" he said. ""If somebody said let's move to Â£15 an hour by 2027 so the industry had plenty of time to plan and adjust, then maybe it's achievable,"" he told the BBC, but he wouldn't like to see the minimum wage go up immediately at a time when everything else is rocketing in price. And giving the same minimum wage across the board, would mean older workers applying for jobs that are currently given to younger, less experienced workers. ""The people who would suffer would be young ones,"" he added. Before the minimum wage was first introduced in 1999 some economists warned it could lead to job losses because firms would hire fewer people. But there has been no evidence of overall job losses linked to the minimum wage. The TUC said the evidence from around the world suggested higher minimum wages led to higher wages overall, rather than job losses. There was no justification for paying lower rates to younger workers, Ms O'Grady added.  Workers aged 18 to 20 are paid a minimum of Â£6.83 an hour. ""It's clear to me, and I think to many people, that people ought to be paid the rate for the job, regardless of the age they are,"" Ms O'Grady said. ""If they're working as hard doing the same job, why should they be discriminated against simply because they're under 23?"" However, Matthew Percival, director of skills and inclusion at the CBI, which represents businesses, said there should not be a new target for the minimum wage and that any rise in its rate should be rooted in growth and higher productivity across the economy. ""Firms are increasing wages where they can, but energy price rises are pushing some to the brink. High energy prices require urgent government action to support households and businesses, not relying on the minimum wage alone,"" he said. The minimum wage is set in relation to the median wage - an average calculated by taking every pay packet in the UK and identifying the mid-point. The current target is for the minimum wage to reach 66% of median wages by 2024. The TUC argues wages should rise for all workers to an average of Â£20 an hour and that the minimum wage target should be 75% of that.

"This video can not be played Watch: Kyiv residents reflect on six months of war with Russia Few know the cost of challenging Russian influence better than Viktor Yushchenko. The former Ukrainian president was poisoned with a toxic chemical while campaigning in 2004 against a Moscow-preferred candidate. He then led protests against a rigged election before taking office the following year. Sitting in his timber-framed home on the outskirts of Kyiv, Mr Yushchenko praises the ""power of national spirit"" as the key to Ukraine's independence. ""Today I can say with confidence that 42 million Ukrainians speak in one voice. And that allows us to face any enemy, including Russia."" You can still see the scarring on the former president's face from when he was poisoned. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko: ""The benchmark of independence is the strength of spirit"" Ukraine's day of independence falls six months to the day since Vladimir Putin launched an invasion from the north, east and south. In that time, the Ukrainian military says almost 9,000 members have been killed. Some 5,500 civilian deaths have been confirmed by the UN. While few here predicted the war, Mr Yushchenko largely blames what he sees as the West's historic inability to combat Russian aggression: notably the 2008 conflict in Georgia and theannexation of Crimeasix years later. However, he thinks Ukraine's ultimate test has changed its standing in the world. ""Today, when more than 50 countries have expressed solidarity with the ideas of our fight. They're providing all kinds of support - military, financial and humanitarian."" Carpentry now occupies most of the former statesman's time. We are surrounded by dozens of sculptures, and the former president tells me of his absolute belief that Ukraine can carve out a victory in this war. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians joined the military to fight Russia at the start of the war including members of rock band Antytila. Watch their story,Frontline Frontmenon iPlayer (UK only). The more Russia tries to pull Ukraine into its orbit, the stronger its people's sense of national identity becomes. At a small factory on the left bank of Kyiv's Dnieper river, Nataliia's business used to make hotel uniforms, but now produces Ukrainian flags. Orders for Ukrainian flags have surged since Russia's invasion six months ago She started getting requests from military checkpoints early on in the invasion, now she gets more than 2,500 orders a month - not just from the army, but businesses too. ""These are very dear colours to us,"" she tells me over the whirring sound of sewing machines. ""Every Ukrainian feels these colours and we see them in everything - in the sky, in wheat. This gives us pleasure, joy and positive emotions, because our work is useful."" Six months into the war, Ukraine is presented with some uncomfortable realities. After weeks of talking about it, Ukraine's planned counter-offensive in the south, on the occupied city of Kherson, has yet to materialise. Yes, there have been longer range missile strikes deeper into Russian-held territory, but this war is now dominated by artillery along an almost static front line. So far Western weapons are helping Ukraine to hold the line and frustrate Russian supply lines, but it will take something seismic for the momentum to shift and for Kyiv to force Russia out completely. Therefore, this military status quo looks set to continue, at a growing, unimaginable cost for tens of thousands of families. Also - while widely viewed as the country's war hero, President Volodymyr Zelensky is now facing criticism for how he prepared for Russia's attack. Notably over his decision not to act on warnings from the US, saying it would cause panic and damage Ukraine's economy. Another symbol of Ukrainian defiance is in the newsroom of the Kyiv Independent. This English language news site was set up weeks before the invasion. Within days their online following went from tens of thousands to millions. ""It's the Independence Day we didn't know was going to happen,"" says editor-in-chief Olga Rudenko. Olga Rudenko, editor-in-chief at the Kyiv Independent, a news website established just weeks before Russia's invasion She describes the publication as the voice of Ukraine, and the world's window into it. ""Back in February, when things were so uncertain, we didn't know whether most of the country would be invaded or whether we'd be killed,"" she says. ""To still be here, to be able to celebrate, is so meaningful."" A recent deal, which has allowed Ukraine once again to export grain through the Black Sea, remains the only diplomatic breakthrough in this war. Some see it as the basis for an eventual peace treaty. That is a long way off, and Ukraine has already lost control of a fifth of its territory. To maintain its independence, this country will be dependent on the outside world for help for some time yet.

"Claire Sugden took up the position of justice minister in 2016, when she was 29 A former Stormont justice minister has hit out at criticism she faced about her age and gender when appointed to the role. Claire Sugden, now the assembly's longest-serving independent member, took up the position in 2016, when she was 29. She said she still felt frustrated by commentary surrounding that period. ""I was in government with another minister who was months older than me - he was a man and wasn't criticised."" Ms Sugden was asked to become justice minister by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in when they were forming a government after the assembly election in May 2016. The role is filled on a cross-community basis, meaning it needs the support of a majority of unionists and nationalists at Stormont. Alliance had held the role prior to that election, butdeclined to take it up again. Speaking onBBC News NI's Red Lines podcast, Ms Sugden said she was surprised to be offered the job, but ultimately agreed to the role. ""I did question if I'd be good enough, but I reflected on people who had done the job previously,"" she said. ""They were no more experienced as the minister of justice at the point they were asked to do it than I was, but there was criticism because of my age and gender. ""I think people feel the justice portfolio was a masculine, severe role. I disagree with that. ""My father was a prison officer and as kids we were in and out of prisons all the time because of the nature of his role."" Claire Sugden told Mark Carruthers she was disappointed she only had nine months in the role of justice minister She said she was prepared to ""stand up"" to the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in when required over executive business. ""I know a lot of people would have criticised me for being young and. to an extent, inexperienced, but my own life experiences up to that point - my education, other jobs and roles I've performed - it's about having the goal of doing what you believe is right,"" she added. However, she said she was disappointed that she only had nine months in the role before the power-sharing government collapsed, following a political crisis over agreen energy scandal. ""I asked them (the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in) to give me a chance, sadly for me they didn't because less than nine months later, the government collapsed. ""I kept my promise, but they didn't keep theirs. I wholeheartedly can say, that was a government that had an opportunity to do wonderful things."" Claire Sugden vows to remain independent ""for now"" but may look elsewhere if devolution does not fully return Asked about the difficulty of working as one of only two independent members at Stormont, Ms Sugden said it could be challenging. She was co-opted into the seat in 2014 and has since retained it in three assembly elections. ""It is really tough being a backbench MLA (assembly member) if you can't create change,"" said the East Londonderry representative. Stormont has been without a functioning assembly and executive for several months, due to the DUP's opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Ms Sugden said she was ""unsure"" about what her own political future would bring, if devolution did not fully return. Stormont recall: Third attempt to fully restore NI Assembly fails NI protocol: Legislation clears House of Commons NI Protocol: Government urges DUP to return to Stormont 'as soon as possible' Last year it emerged she had been approached to join the Ulster Unionists but hadturned the offer down. ""I guard my independence fiercely, to achieve what I've achieved is really important to me,"" she said of the decision. ""But [we] can't keep firefighting, we have to ensure the fires don't start in the first place - that's why we need Stormont. ""Maybe as long as people keep electing me, I will still be there, but I don't want to be part of the furniture I want to create change. ""Sadly, that means if the institutions don't enable me to do that, I may have to look elsewhere. ""Maybe that means standing for Westminster, maybe potentially looking at a political party eventually - but I don't know."" She said she would remain independent ""for now"", in order to respect the electorate who gave her their vote in May.

"The minimum wage in the UK should rise to Â£15 an hour ""as soon as possible"", the Trades Union Congress (TUC) says. This rate should apply to workers of all ages, instead of the current lower rate for under-23s, it said. Minimum wage is Â£9.50 an hour for workers over the age of 23 and Â£9.18 for 21 and 22 year olds. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at 10.1% - so wages do not go as far. The government said raising the minimum wage could push unemployment up. Prices are rising at their fastest rate in 40 years, driven by higher food, fuel and energy costs. How much is the minimum wage? Sainsbury's urged to extend higher pay to cleaners Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC, said: ""Every worker should be able to afford a decent standard of living. ""But millions of low-paid workers live wage packet to wage packet, struggling to get by - and they are now being pushed to the brink by eye-watering bills and soaring prices."" The government said it was ""determined to make work pay"" and that this year's increase in the minimum wage, in April, was the largest ever rise. However, it said setting the minimum wage too high or increasing it too quickly could lead to higher unemployment. The TUC argues that at a time when companies are paying increased dividends to shareholders, the government should ensure workers get ""their fair share"" by increasing minimum wage rates now, rather than waiting for the next expected uprating in April. It should start with low-paid workers who are ""absolutely terrified about what those hikes in energy bills will mean for their budgets, having to fork out for school uniforms and put food on the table"", Ms O'Grady told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She said a higher minimum wage would mean workers were less likely to be claiming in-work benefits, and more likely to be paying taxes as well as buying goods and services on the High Street. Kelly, 31, works front of house in a well-known London restaurant and despite eight years of experience in the sector is paid the minimum wage. Her income is topped up with tips and her partner has a  salary, but she has still seen a decline in her quality of life over the past decade. ""We are constantly in a precarious position, living hand-to-mouth,"" she said. ""[We're] being squeezed further and further."" But Mark Hodges, 66, who runs a clubhouse restaurant on a holiday park in Norfolk, said raising the minimum wage to Â£15 an hour would mean restaurants would have to raise prices. ""Although it would be fantastic to see us all move to Â£15 an hour, I cannot see how such a large rise - across all ages - would do our sector many favours,"" he said. ""If somebody said let's move to Â£15 an hour by 2027 so the industry had plenty of time to plan and adjust, then maybe it's achievable,"" he told the BBC, but he wouldn't like to see the minimum wage go up immediately at a time when everything else is rocketing in price. And giving the same minimum wage across the board, would mean older workers applying for jobs that are currently given to younger, less experienced workers. ""The people who would suffer would be young ones,"" he added. Before the minimum wage was first introduced in 1999 some economists warned it could lead to job losses because firms would hire fewer people. But there has been no evidence of overall job losses linked to the minimum wage. The TUC said the evidence from around the world suggested higher minimum wages led to higher wages overall, rather than job losses. There was no justification for paying lower rates to younger workers, Ms O'Grady added.  Workers aged 18 to 20 are paid a minimum of Â£6.83 an hour. ""It's clear to me, and I think to many people, that people ought to be paid the rate for the job, regardless of the age they are,"" Ms O'Grady said. ""If they're working as hard doing the same job, why should they be discriminated against simply because they're under 23?"" However, Matthew Percival, director of skills and inclusion at the CBI, which represents businesses, said there should not be a new target for the minimum wage and that any rise in its rate should be rooted in growth and higher productivity across the economy. ""Firms are increasing wages where they can, but energy price rises are pushing some to the brink. High energy prices require urgent government action to support households and businesses, not relying on the minimum wage alone,"" he said. The minimum wage is set in relation to the median wage - an average calculated by taking every pay packet in the UK and identifying the mid-point. The current target is for the minimum wage to reach 66% of median wages by 2024. The TUC argues wages should rise for all workers to an average of Â£20 an hour and that the minimum wage target should be 75% of that.

"Many UK households and businesses are struggling with rising prices, but that's not the story for everyone. The fastest rise in the cost of living for four decades meanspeople are typically having to spend Â£110 to get what Â£100 bought them last year. But some industries are benefiting from higher inflation and posting bumper profits. There are huge sums to be made if you're in the business of drilling for oil, trading wheat, transporting toys or selling fine wines. So who's gaining from the extra spend? Businesses which extract and refine fossil fuels have grabbed the headlines in recent months due to their record profits. Wholesale gas prices have soared on international markets and oil prices have hovered around $100 per barrel due to demand increasing and supply fears following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Saudi Arabia's Aramco posted record profits between April to June, while BP cleared Â£6.9bn in that period and Shell topped that with its profits of Â£9bn worldwide. Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, has seen profits rise five-fold due to its oil, gas and nuclear assets. But there are many firms operating in the UK which get less attention. Among the biggest of the North Sea producers is Harbour Energy. The company has grown by acquiring oil and gas operations and returned to profit this year. Meanwhile, private-equity backed Neptune Energy, which produces around 12% of UK's gas saw profits double last year, allowing for $1bn in dividends to be returned to its owners. Israeli-owned Ithaca and Norway's Equinor are other big producers. All of these companies will be faced with the government's 25% windfall tax on the profits they make from extracting UK oil and gas - this is intended to go towards helping households with rising bills. Yet for most of the energy giants, domestic extraction is a small part of their operations. For example, the UK accounts for just a tenth of BP's overall oil and gas production. How much are prices rising for you? Try our calculator How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? How high will my energy bill go and can I reduce it? But there are some firms who are yet to benefit from high oil and gas prices due to the way they buy wholesale energy. These companies set prices in advance to insure against big swings in the market price - a process known as hedging. As countries look for alternatives to Russian gas, coal is unexpectedly back in fashion. That's paying off for mining firms who've specialised in the dirtiest of fossil fuels. Glencore's thermal coal business benefited from record prices, helping profits double to over Â£15bn in the first half of 2022. Many of its rivals have backed away from coal, but Glencore has argued it will be an important fuel in the process of the transition to greener forms of producing energy in some countries, and that it will look to wind down production across the next few decades. With fears of gas supply disruption this winter from Russia to Europe, energy firms have been asked to delay the closure of UK coal-fired power plants by the government. German utility Uniper said on Monday it will start producing electricity for the market at its reserve coal-fired power station Heyden 4 due to Russia halting pipeline flows. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus, aren't household names but their products feature heavily on dinner plates globally. The ""ABCDs"" are the dominant traders of food commodities, and grain in particular. At times of global disruption, these supply chain middlemen can play a key role in helping food supplies flow to where it's needed - helping countries find alternative sources of wheat in the face of disruption to supplies from Ukraine and Russia, for example. But that disruption means wheat prices are now 25% higher than a year ago. Many other staples have  become more expensive. ADM reported a 60% rise in their latest quarterly profits. Bunge fared less well - but is optimistic about the rest of the year. Privately-owned Cargill's revenues were up by 23% to a record $165bn (Â£140bn) in the latest financial year. It says it gave $163m to humanitarian relief and other good causes, which equates to 0.1% of sales. Pandemic shutdowns may have disrupted economies and supply chains, but they boosted the fortunes of shipping companies. Freight rates surged and have remained high since demand for consumer goods increased during Covid lockdowns. Restrictions meant ports were congested and new shipbuilding projects were halted. The container-shipping industry will have notched up profits of half a trillion dollars over the last two years by the end of 2022, according to consultancy Drewry. The world's second-largest container shipping group, AP MÃ¸ller-Maersk, hiked its annual profit forecast for a third time this year because of the prolonged disruption at ports, saying ""normalisation"" of rates may now not happen until the end of the year. For people with cash to burn, a combination of surging inflation, relatively low interest rates and weak economic growth means decent returns on conventional investments can be difficult to find. They are turning elsewhere. Brokers at Knight Frank reported that the value of investments in fine wines and luxury watches shot up by 16% last year, art by 13% and whiskies and coins by 19%. Investors were taking a punt on collectibles, bettering their worth would outpace inflation, and that has continued into this year. The world's largest fine wine trader, Bordeaux Index, reported a 37% increase in sales in the year to June. For the rest of us, however, inflation may leave a sourer taste.

"The UK imported no fuel from Russia in June for the first time on record, according to official figures. Imports of goods from Russia also fell to Â£33m in June, the lowest level since records began in January 1997, the Office for National Statics (ONS) said. Western nations have imposed strict sanctions on Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February. The UK has pledged to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year and gas imports as soon as possible. Fuel imports from Russia fell by Â£499m - or 100% - compared with the average for the previous 12 months to February. In 2021, the UK imported around 4% of its gas from Russia, and 11% of its oil, according to the International Energy Agency. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Exports of most goods to Russia had also decreased substantially by June, with machinery and transport equipment sales slashed by 91.3% to Â£118m. Overall, exports to Russia dropped by almost 70%, to Â£168m, compared with the monthly average in the 12 months to February. The only products to see a slight rise were chemicals, driven by an increase in exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products, which are exempt from sanctions. The ONS said that apart from government-stipulated sanctions, trade between Russia and the UK was lessened as businesses voluntarily sought alternatives to Russian goods. The figures were released as Ukraine marked its day of independence, exactly six months since the Russian invasion began. As a result of Russia's invasion, the EU has said it will cut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year and has also agreed to ban all Russian oil imports which come in by sea by the end of the year. Meanwhile, the US has imposed a total ban on Russian oil and gas imports. This data doesn't include services, where the UK has in the past made large sums through consultants, accountants and lawyers in London advising Russian companies and wealthy individuals. But insofar as we're talking about imported goods, it looks like sanctions have been highly effective. According to the ONS we imported no fuel whatsoever from Russia in June, whereas normally we'd import on average about half a billion pounds of it. Prior to the war, gas imported from Russia was about 4.9% of total UK gas imports; now it's dropped to zero. The UK hasn't cut the overall amount of gas it's importing; Russian gas has largely been replaced with gas from elsewhere. That shows clearly the mismatch between the effect of war on the supply to the UK of wholesale gas (modest) and the change to the prices we're paying (huge). A lot of the fear built into the price of wholesale gas relates to market speculation on the potential disruptions to supply to Germany, Italy and other Russian-gas-addicted countries. Our own gas supply is much more secure. Yet because the energy price cap is linked to international wholesale gas prices, the danger is that when the price cap re-sets in October, millions of households will end up paying unnecessarily large bills which have a whole lot of irrelevant fear built into them. What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working? How are sanctions affecting Russia's energy exports?

"A senior civil servant has taken control of Stormont's finances. Neil Gibson has done so because of the failure to pass a budget before the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) collapsed the executive in February. The senior official at the Department of Finance will use emergency powers to release cash to departments until a new budget is in place. The move means departments can continue to operate but Mr Gibson cannot start funding new policies. He will not have the power to distribute more than Â£400m of unallocated funds which Stormont has received from the Treasury since the draft budget was published. Mr Gibson is a former chief economist at EY and has held senior roles across the private and public sectors and in academia. Hejoined the Department of Financethis year. Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the development would ""keep the lights on and keep the doors open at various departments for another couple of months"". He added that it did not allow any response to the emergency that was ""growing daily in terms of people's ability to pay their bills and to put food on the table"". Mr Murphy called for the immediate return of the executive and urged Westminster to help address the ""mounting problems"". Up until now departments could operate without a formal budget because of what is known as the vote on account. It is a legal mechanism which allows the spending of money in the first few months of a financial year before full budget legislation is passed. It authorises spending equal to 45% of the allocation for the previous year. Departments are now approaching that 45% limit so need a new legal authorisation to keep spending. Neil Gibson has acted due to the lack of a budget at Stormont That authority is Section 59 of the Northern Ireland Act, which ultimately allows Mr Gibson to use money, equivalent to up to 95% of last year's budget, ""for such services and purposes"" as he directs. The Department of Finance said for most departments the new authorisation has been set at approximately 60% of departments' provision for the 2021-22 financial year. That will be reviewed at the end of October. A spokesperson added: ""These contingency arrangements are no substitute for an agreed budget and while departments will have legal cover to continue to spend on delivering services, they will still not have the certainty that an agreed budget would provide."" If the 95% limit is ever reached it would effectively mean in-year cuts of least 5% across the public service. However, it is improbable that the emergency situation will continue for that length of time. If the executive does not return to pass a budget then budget legislation could be approved by the Westminster parliament as has happened during other periods when devolution was not functioning. The Section 59 powers were first used in March 2017 with the Northern Ireland secretary then taking budget legislation through Parliament in November that year. There is no functioning assembly or executive at Stormont because of the Democratic Unionist Party's (DUP) protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. Theprotocol, part of the UK government's Brexit deal with the EU, keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods. Why could parts of the Brexit deal be ditched? That was designed to continue free trade across the Irish land border but it has been criticised by unionist politicians for adding restrictions to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. UK plans to legislate against the outworkings of the protocol have been criticised by the EU. In May's assembly election, Sinn FÃ©in was returned as Stormont's largest party, entitling it to nominate for the position of first minister. What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

"Asda is scrapping best before dates on hundreds of fruit and vegetable products to help reduce food waste. The supermarket will make the change to more than 200 products across its UK stores from September. They will be replaced by a code that Asda staff will use to check quality and freshness. Waste & Resources Action Programme (Wrap) said the average family throws away Â£60 worth of food and drink each month. Products including citrus fruits, potatoes, cauliflowers, and carrots will all have the labels removed. Catherine David, director of collaboration and change at Wrap, said: ""We are delighted by this development from Asda to help tackle food waste in our homes. ""Our research has shown that date labels on fruit and veg are unnecessary - getting rid of them can prevent the equivalent of seven million shopping baskets' worth from our household bins."" Best before labels are used to indicate when the product is at its best quality, taste and texture. But foods can be safe to eat beyond this. They are different to use by dates, which show when food can be cooked and consumed safely. The Food Standards Agency said use by dates should be on ""food like meat products and ready to eat salads which could be unsafe if left for too long"". Asda's Andy Cockshaw said: ""Reducing food waste in our business and in customers' homes is a priority and we are always looking at different ways to achieve this. ""We know for customers this has become more important than ever in the current climate as many families are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis and are looking to make savings wherever they can.""

"The UK imported no fuel from Russia in June for the first time on record, according to official figures. Imports of goods from Russia also fell to Â£33m in June, the lowest level since records began in January 1997, the Office for National Statics (ONS) said. Western nations have imposed strict sanctions on Russia since it invaded Ukraine in February. The UK has pledged to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of the year and gas imports as soon as possible. Fuel imports from Russia fell by Â£499m - or 100% - compared with the average for the previous 12 months to February. In 2021, the UK imported around 4% of its gas from Russia, and 11% of its oil, according to the International Energy Agency. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Exports of most goods to Russia had also decreased substantially by June, with machinery and transport equipment sales slashed by 91.3% to Â£118m. Overall, exports to Russia dropped by almost 70%, to Â£168m, compared with the monthly average in the 12 months to February. The only products to see a slight rise were chemicals, driven by an increase in exports of medicinal and pharmaceutical products, which are exempt from sanctions. The ONS said that apart from government-stipulated sanctions, trade between Russia and the UK was lessened as businesses voluntarily sought alternatives to Russian goods. The figures were released as Ukraine marked its day of independence, exactly six months since the Russian invasion began. As a result of Russia's invasion, the EU has said it will cut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year and has also agreed to ban all Russian oil imports which come in by sea by the end of the year. Meanwhile, the US has imposed a total ban on Russian oil and gas imports. This data doesn't include services, where the UK has in the past made large sums through consultants, accountants and lawyers in London advising Russian companies and wealthy individuals. But insofar as we're talking about imported goods, it looks like sanctions have been highly effective. According to the ONS we imported no fuel whatsoever from Russia in June, whereas normally we'd import on average about half a billion pounds of it. Prior to the war, gas imported from Russia was about 4.9% of total UK gas imports; now it's dropped to zero. The UK hasn't cut the overall amount of gas it's importing; Russian gas has largely been replaced with gas from elsewhere. That shows clearly the mismatch between the effect of war on the supply to the UK of wholesale gas (modest) and the change to the prices we're paying (huge). A lot of the fear built into the price of wholesale gas relates to market speculation on the potential disruptions to supply to Germany, Italy and other Russian-gas-addicted countries. Our own gas supply is much more secure. Yet because the energy price cap is linked to international wholesale gas prices, the danger is that when the price cap re-sets in October, millions of households will end up paying unnecessarily large bills which have a whole lot of irrelevant fear built into them. What are the sanctions on Russia and are they working? How are sanctions affecting Russia's energy exports?

"This video can not be played WATCH: Footage has emerged showing passengers being evacuated through an emergency service tunnel Dozens of people were left stranded for hours inside the Channel Tunnel after a train from Calais to Folkestone appeared to have broken down. Footage emerged showing Eurotunnel Le Shuttle passengers being evacuated through an emergency service tunnel after having to abandon their vehicles. They were eventually transferred to a replacement train and taken to the Folkestone terminal in Kent. A Eurotunnel spokesman said services were now back to normal. Le Shuttle said Tuesday night's incident began when the train's alarms went off and this needed to be investigated. A spokesman said such incidents were unusual but not exceptional - far more common on trains carrying lorries than those with private cars. ""The Shuttle was brought to a controlled stop and inspected. As a precautionary measure, for their safety and comfort, we transferred the passengers on-board to another shuttle, via the service tunnel [which is there for exactly that purpose],"" the spokesman said. ""We brought them to the passenger terminal building, where food and drinks were available."" He added the original train was then ""slowly brought out"" of the tunnel and the passengers had their vehicles returned to them in Folkestone. Sarah Fellows, 37, from Birmingham, told the PA news agency she found the service tunnel ""terrifying"". She added: ""It was like a disaster movie. You were just walking into the abyss not knowing what was happening. We all had to stay under the sea in this big queue. ""There was a woman crying in the tunnel, another woman having a panic attack who was travelling alone."" One passenger said ""several people were freaking out about being down in the service tunnel"" Another passenger, who did not want to be named, said: ""Several people were freaking out about being down in the service tunnel, it's a bit of a weird place... We were stuck down there for at least five hours."" Mike Harrison, from Cranbrook in Kent, told BBC News it took about six hours to travel from Calais to Folkestone. He said staff spent over an hour trying to find the fault on the train after it had broken down initially before they got it moving again only for it to ""conk out"" after five minutes. Passengers had to walk 10 to 15 minutes to another train, he said. ""Things were getting a bit fractious, a bit stressed. A few people were having minor panic attacks,"" he said. But the freight train used to take passengers to the terminal was also hit by problems with Mr Harrison saying it did not have enough traction. ""By the third time we were all just thinking 'what is going on',"" he said. Rachel Thynne told BBC Radio Kent it was ""getting hotter and hotter"" while staff tried to identify the problem. All those on board the train were transferred ""in line with safety procedures and as a comfort measure"", Le Shuttle said. A passenger contacted the BBC before 17:45 BST saying they were on the train which had stopped. They complained of poor communication and said the public address system did not work properly. One evacuated passenger shared a photo from inside the train they were transferred to Four additional trains were laid on overnight from Calais to Folkestone to deal with the backlog from the incident. The service transports passengers and their vehicles between Folkestone and Calais. At 23.5 miles (37.9km), it has the longest underwater section of any tunnel in the world. Le Shuttle said all passengers would be contacted individually to arrange compensation.

"Scotland's public spending deficit fell to Â£23.7bn last year as the country's finances continued to be hit by the Covid pandemic. Scottish government statistics showed that total public spending dropped to Â£97.5bn. Income from taxes rose by Â£11bn to Â£73.8bn, leaving a gap between spending and revenue equating to 12.3% of Scotland's GDP. The deficit for the UK as a whole over the same period was 6.1% of GDP. Scotland's public deficit figure stood at Â£15.1bn - 8.6% of GDP - the year before the pandemic hit but more than doubled to Â£36.3bn, or 22.4% of GDP, in 2020. Check out the latest headlines from Scotland,external Read more stories on Scottish politics,external The annual Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (Gers) report said that overall spending ""for the benefit of Scotland"" by the Scottish government, UK government and other public sector bodies fell from Â£98.5bn to Â£97.5bn last year - the largest ever drop in public expenditure. This was equivalent to Â£17,793 per person, which is Â£1,963 per person greater than the UK average. The fall in spending was mainly due to a reduction in money being spent on Covid support schemes - with the authors saying that spending remains at historically high levels. Overall, the Scottish government spent Â£5.7bn in response to the coronavirus pandemic last year, down from Â£8.8bn in 2020. Scotland received at least a further Â£3.7bn in reserved spending in response to the pandemic, down from Â£9.4bn. However, this reduction in spending on the pandemic was largely offset by the costs of servicing the public sector debt. What is Gers and how is it calculated? Meanwhile, Scotland's illustrative geographical share of North Sea oil and gas revenue was Â£3.5bn, up from Â£0.8bn the previous year, as energy prices recovered from the falls during the pandemic. The report said the oil price increased from $18.38 per barrel in April 2021 to $117.25 in March 2022, while gas prices rose from 55p per therm to 314p. The increase was driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which increased competition for supplies as countries attempted to switch away from Russian oil and gas. Overall North Sea production of oil and gas fell by 16.8% in 2021 to 76 million tons of oil equivalent. Scotland's total public sector revenue was said to be equivalent to Â£13,463 per person, Â£221 less than the UK average. Excluding North Sea revenue, it was Â£12,831 per person, or Â£805 less than the UK average The report said the figures ""continue to be affected by the coronavirus pandemic, which had an ongoing and significant impact on global public sector finances."" The data was calculated by Scottish government statisticians, with the annual report having been at the centre of the debate over independence in recent years. Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who is Scotland's acting finance secretary, said the continued rise in oil and gas prices was likely to see North Sea revenues grow to Â£13bn next year, which he said would cause Scotland's deficit to fall faster than the UK's. He added: ""Even without North Sea receipts, the record revenue generated was sufficient to cover all day-to-day devolved spending as well as all social security spending in Scotland, including the state pension."" Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said the Gers figures showed how ""people and their families benefit massively from being part of a strong, resilient UK"". Mr Jack said: ""As we continue to recover from the pandemic and confront global pressures on prices and the cost of living, it is clear we need a shared and a relentless focus on boosting the economy."" Scotland's notional deficit is down year on year for two main reasons: extra Covid spending has reduced and oil and gas revenues have increased. That said, the gap between what's raised in Scotland in taxes and what's spent in and on behalf of Scotland is still very high at Â£23.7bn That is equivalent to 12.3% of Scotland's economic output (as measured by GDP) which is more than double the 6.1% rate for the UK as a whole. While these numbers are new, they trigger a very old debate about the state of Scotland's economy and its likely prospects in the event of independence. UK supporters say the figures show how Scottish families ""benefit massively"" from being part of the union and a much larger economy. Independence supporters say if the Scottish government had full financial control it could do a better job of running the economy. Today's report does not tell us what the future holds - with or without independence - but it does highlight the very challenging financial position that needs to be addressed.

"There are fears fish and chip shops could struggle to survive as costs rise Fish and chip shops are facing ""extinction"" amid rising costs, an industry body has warned. Some shops in the West of England say the soaring price of cod, sunflower oil and energy has left them struggling. The National Federation of Fish Friers is urging the government to cut VAT and help shops with energy bills. A government spokesman said it is supporting businesses ""of all sizes by slashing fuel duty"" and introducing a 50% business rates relief. The federation has secured a meeting with ministers on Thursday to push its message that the industry needs help. One manager said they feared some families were cutting out regular fish and chip nights due to the cost-of-living crisis. Craig Williams, from Sand Bay Fish and Chip Shop near Weston-super-Mare, said the current situation was ""worse"" than during the pandemic. ""People were coming in to spend their money [when] they were furloughed,"" he said. Craig Williams of Sand Bay Fish and Chip Shop said some families were abandoning their regular treat ""People had money in their pockets, people are penny-pinching now. So fish and chips might not be top of their priority list on a Friday night."" Some shops are putting their prices up to stay afloat. Bishopston Fish Bar on Gloucester Road in Bristol has already raised its prices three times this year, but staff hope they will not have to do it again. Chip shops battered as price of fish rises What's the best fish and chips combo? Seagulls have 'favourite' fish and chip shops to visit Jason Ford, from the shop, said during the same period ""business had dropped by about 30% per cent - but we're still going"". Jason Ford from Bishopston Fish Bar hope they won't have to raise their prices again National Federation of Fish Friers President Andrew Crook revealed about 66% of shops had reduced opening hours to save money - equating to a fall in staffing levels of four people per shop. He added: ""Unfortunately this is potentially an extinction event for small businesses. ""It's like nothing we've ever seen before."" A government spokesman said: ""We are working closely with industry to mitigate the impact our sanctions against Russia may have on British businesses, including through the creation of the Â£100m UK Seafood Fund. ""We're already supporting businesses of all sizes by slashing fuel duty, introducing a 50% business rates relief for eligible high street businesses and put the brakes on bill increases by freezing the business rates multiplier - worth Â£4.6 billion over the next five years.""

"A former security chief for Twitter has turned whistleblower and testified that the company misled users and US regulators about gaps in its security. Peiter Zatko also claimed that Twitter underestimated how many fake and spam accounts are on its platform. The accusations could affect a legal battle between Twitter and billionaire Elon Musk, who is trying to cancel his $44bn (Â£37bn) deal to buy the company. Twitter says Mr Zatko's allegations are inaccurate and inconsistent. It says he was sacked in January for ineffective leadership and poor performance. In Mr Zatko's damning revelations,first revealed by CNN,externalandThe Washington Post,external, he accused Twitter of failing to maintain stringent security practices and ""lying about bots to Elon Musk"". He filed his complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission in July. The BBC has seen a redacted copy of the complaint shared via CBS news. In it, Mr Zatko also criticised the way in which Twitter handled sensitive information and claimed that it has failed to accurately report some of these matters to US regulators. Twitter has faced a number of high profile hackswith Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Kanye West all targeted. Among his concerns Mr Zatko alleges that Twitter suffered from an usually high rate of security incidents - ""approximately one security incident each week serious enough that Twitter was required to report it to regulators"". He said that so-called insider threats - security risks posed by people with malicious intent from within the company - went ""virtually unmonitored"". The former security chief revealed his concern about how Twitter handled data, alleging that too many employees had access to sensitive systems and user data. He worried that the company had no workable disaster recovery plan, and claimed that in the past, Twitter had failed to properly delete the data of people who cancelled their accounts. Why did Musk get cold feet on Twitter? On fake and spam accounts, he said that ""deliberate ignorance was the norm"" at the tech company, and accused Twitter executives of having little incentive to accurately identify how many there really are on its platform. However in the view of The Washington Post, he ""provides little hard evidence"" to back up these assertions. Nevertheless, Elon Musk's lawyers have jumped on the comments. His legal team are currently trying to get the Tesla boss out of the deal, by arguing that Twitter has no way of verifying how many of its 229 million daily active users were actually human. Following the publication of Mr Zatko's revelations, Mr Musk tweeted screenshots of The Washington Post's story, andtweeted an image carrying the phrase ""give a little whistle"",external. Mr Zatko's lawyer told CNN that his client started the whistleblowing process before the takeover bid became public, and had not made contact with Elon Musk. However one of Elon Musk's lawyers, Alex Spiro, told CNN that Mr Zatko had been subpoenaed to be a potential witness. Elon Musk launched an aggressive takeover bid of Twitter, but now wants to back out of the deal A former hacker, Peiter Zatko is a well-known figure in computer security circles. Nicknamed Mudge, he was a member of computer security think-tank L0pht (pronounced ""loft""), and took part in congressional hearings on cyber-security in 1998. He has also held senior positions with Google and the US government's research and development agency, DARPA. A Twitter spokesperson said: ""What we've seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data-security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context. ""Mr Zatko's allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders. ""Security and privacy have long been company-wide priorities at Twitter and will continue to be."" John Tye, of Whistleblower Aid, which is assisting Pieter Zatko, described him as a ""hero"" and called on agencies to investigate the allegations quickly.

"This video can not be played Watch: Kyiv residents reflect on six months of war with Russia Few know the cost of challenging Russian influence better than Viktor Yushchenko. The former Ukrainian president was poisoned with a toxic chemical while campaigning in 2004 against a Moscow-preferred candidate. He then led protests against a rigged election before taking office the following year. Sitting in his timber-framed home on the outskirts of Kyiv, Mr Yushchenko praises the ""power of national spirit"" as the key to Ukraine's independence. ""Today I can say with confidence that 42 million Ukrainians speak in one voice. And that allows us to face any enemy, including Russia."" You can still see the scarring on the former president's face from when he was poisoned. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko: ""The benchmark of independence is the strength of spirit"" Ukraine's day of independence falls six months to the day since Vladimir Putin launched an invasion from the north, east and south. In that time, the Ukrainian military says almost 9,000 members have been killed. Some 5,500 civilian deaths have been confirmed by the UN. While few here predicted the war, Mr Yushchenko largely blames what he sees as the West's historic inability to combat Russian aggression: notably the 2008 conflict in Georgia and theannexation of Crimeasix years later. However, he thinks Ukraine's ultimate test has changed its standing in the world. ""Today, when more than 50 countries have expressed solidarity with the ideas of our fight. They're providing all kinds of support - military, financial and humanitarian."" Carpentry now occupies most of the former statesman's time. We are surrounded by dozens of sculptures, and the former president tells me of his absolute belief that Ukraine can carve out a victory in this war. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians joined the military to fight Russia at the start of the war including members of rock band Antytila. Watch their story,Frontline Frontmenon iPlayer (UK only). The more Russia tries to pull Ukraine into its orbit, the stronger its people's sense of national identity becomes. At a small factory on the left bank of Kyiv's Dnieper river, Nataliia's business used to make hotel uniforms, but now produces Ukrainian flags. Orders for Ukrainian flags have surged since Russia's invasion six months ago She started getting requests from military checkpoints early on in the invasion, now she gets more than 2,500 orders a month - not just from the army, but businesses too. ""These are very dear colours to us,"" she tells me over the whirring sound of sewing machines. ""Every Ukrainian feels these colours and we see them in everything - in the sky, in wheat. This gives us pleasure, joy and positive emotions, because our work is useful."" Six months into the war, Ukraine is presented with some uncomfortable realities. After weeks of talking about it, Ukraine's planned counter-offensive in the south, on the occupied city of Kherson, has yet to materialise. Yes, there have been longer range missile strikes deeper into Russian-held territory, but this war is now dominated by artillery along an almost static front line. So far Western weapons are helping Ukraine to hold the line and frustrate Russian supply lines, but it will take something seismic for the momentum to shift and for Kyiv to force Russia out completely. Therefore, this military status quo looks set to continue, at a growing, unimaginable cost for tens of thousands of families. Also - while widely viewed as the country's war hero, President Volodymyr Zelensky is now facing criticism for how he prepared for Russia's attack. Notably over his decision not to act on warnings from the US, saying it would cause panic and damage Ukraine's economy. Another symbol of Ukrainian defiance is in the newsroom of the Kyiv Independent. This English language news site was set up weeks before the invasion. Within days their online following went from tens of thousands to millions. ""It's the Independence Day we didn't know was going to happen,"" says editor-in-chief Olga Rudenko. Olga Rudenko, editor-in-chief at the Kyiv Independent, a news website established just weeks before Russia's invasion She describes the publication as the voice of Ukraine, and the world's window into it. ""Back in February, when things were so uncertain, we didn't know whether most of the country would be invaded or whether we'd be killed,"" she says. ""To still be here, to be able to celebrate, is so meaningful."" A recent deal, which has allowed Ukraine once again to export grain through the Black Sea, remains the only diplomatic breakthrough in this war. Some see it as the basis for an eventual peace treaty. That is a long way off, and Ukraine has already lost control of a fifth of its territory. To maintain its independence, this country will be dependent on the outside world for help for some time yet.

While there, he said Ukraine ""can and will"" win against Russia. Six months of war a 'tragic milestone':Wednesday also marked six months since Russia invaded Ukraine. UN chief Antonio Guterres described it as a ""sad and tragic milestone"", adding that the consequences of the ""sad and senseless war"" were being felt far beyond Ukraine"". US aid:President Joe Biden earlier announced $3bn (Â£2.5bn) of fresh US military support for Ukraine - the biggest American package yet - which will help Ukraine to acquire weaponry and equipment. Change in pace:Kyrylo Budanov, one of Ukraine's top military intelligence officials, suggested Russia's offensive is slowing because of ""moral and physical fatigue"". But Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed Moscow had deliberately slowed down its campaign in a bid to to reduce civilian casualties. The lights of Berlin's famous Brandenberg Gate were turned off last month Germany has approved a range of energy-saving measures for the winter as it tries to reduce its dependence on Russian gas. Among other plans, heating in public buildings will be switched off or capped from September onwards, and there will be new restrictions on the lighting of public buildings and shops for aesthetic reasons. The heating of private swimming pools could also be banned. The government hopes the rules could help reduce gas usage by 2%, while the country lowers its longstanding reliance on Russian imports. It says the rules could save households, companies and the public sector around â¬10.8bn (Â£9.1bn) over two years. Read more. President Biden says he's committed to defending Ukrainian sovereignty In other news, there are more details now of the US's new support package for Ukraine worth nearly $3bn (Â£2.5bn). It'll allow the US to procure weapons on Ukraine's behalf - rather than taking arms from existing American stocks. The Pentagon says Kyiv will receive: The US says it's pledged more than $13.5bn (Â£11.5bn) in security assistance to Ukraine under President Joe Biden, and that this fresh tranche is the largest to date. We just reported that the death toll from an air strike on a Ukrainian railway station has risen from 15 to 22. In a message posted on the messaging app Telegram, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky described the attack on Chaplyne railway station in a Ukrainian-held area as today's ""pain"". ""As of this moment, there are 22 dead, five of them burned in a car,"" he said before adding one of those killed was an 11-year-old whose house had been destroyed by a Russian rocket. He said: ""Search and rescue operations at the railway station continue. We will definitely make the occupiers answer for everything they have done. And we will certainly throw out the invaders from our land."" In a nod to Ukraine's 31st Independence Day, Zelensky also said this year's may be ""coming to an end"" but vowed to ensure there'd be a 32nd, a 33rd and so on. ""Ukraine is forever,"" he said. ""And it will only get stronger every day."" Moscow has not commented on the attack. The death toll from a Russian rocket
attack on a railway station in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday has
risen to 22, up from the initial estimate of 15, President
Volodymyr Zelensky has said in a video address. In an address to Ukraine's President Zelensky, the Queen says she hopes the world can look ahead to ""better times in the future"" for Ukrainian people after six months of war. Her words, which the British Embassy in Kyiv published earlier on Twitter, marked Ukraine's 31 years of independence from the Soviet Union. In a series of tweets, the UK in Ukraine Twitter account said: ""In her address to the President of Ukraine she said: ""In this most challenging year, I hope that today will be a time for the Ukrainian people, both in Ukraine and around the world, to celebrate their culture, history and identity. May we look to better times in the future. Elizabeth R.'"" The monarch has previously shown her support for Ukrainian citizens by donating to the Disasters Emergency Committee.. The charitable appeal thanked her in March for making a ""generous donation"" towards its appeal. At the time, the palace declined to disclose the amount given. It's been exactly six months since Russia invaded Ukraine, and the BBC's Ukrainecast team are taking stock in a special episode. Victoria DerbyshireandVitaly Shevchenkohave been following the stories of Max, Anna, Hussain, Maksym and Viktoria - none of whom will ever be the same again. Listen to the podcast here. Against the backdrop of six months of war, Ukraine marked 31 years of independence from the Soviet Union today. Many countries around the world showed support by joining in on the celebrations too. Let's take a look: London, England Protesters demonstrate against Russia's invasion during a Ukrainian Independence Day rally outside Downing Street in London Berlin, Germany People march during a Freedom Parade in Berlin, Germany Donetsk, Ukraine A Ukrainian flag is raised with balloons on Independence Day in Avdiivka in the Donetsk region of Ukraine Athens, Greece Ukrainians living in Greece hold their national flag as they gather to mark the day in Athens Edinburgh, Scotland People gathered for a Ukraine independence rally at Edinburgh's Calton Hill Dublin, Ireland Protesters also demonstrated in Dublin, Ireland Oslo, Norway People take part in a demonstration against the Russian war in Ukraine at Eidsvolls plass in Oslo, Norway The alleged Russian attack that President Zelensky says killed 15 people happened at Chaplyne railway station in a Ukrainian-held area roughly between Zaporizhzhia and Donetsk on the map below. As you can see, Russian troops have gradually been moving towards the area, having seized swathes of territory across Ukraine's east since launching their invasion. Moscow has not yet commented on the strike. Images of devastation have been shared by Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba after Kyiv said Russia had attacked Ukraine's Chaplyne station. The photos - which have not yet been verified by the BBC - show a number of smouldering rail carriages which appear to have suffered fire damage, as well as burned-out road vehicles and fallen masonry. Kuleba said civilians had been killed in the attack, which he blamed on Russia. Moscow is yet to comment on the strike, which President Zelensky says killed at least 15 people. Allow Twitter content?

More now on an alleged Russian attack on a railway station in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk region, mentioned by President Zelensky at the UN Security Council a short while ago. He said train carriages were hit at Chaplyne station, about 70 miles (110km) west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. Four carriages were on fire when he received the news, he said. He added that emergency services were on the scene, but that the number of fatalities could increase from 15. Russia has not commented on the alleged attack, which came on Ukrainian Independence Day and the six-month anniversary of Moscow's invasion. Fifteen people have been killed in a Russian strike on a railway station in the Dnipropetrovsk region, says Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Around 50 others were injured, he told the UN Security Council. We'll bring you more details when we get them. Pratiksha GhildialReporting from New York The Ukrainian leader was allowed to address the Security Council remotely Let's get a little more from the UN Security Council earlier, where member states displayed
solidarity for Ukrainians on the country's Independence Day. TheUSand other Western nations were
some of the most vocal to offer support, while others likeBrazilandIndiawere more cautious and advised dialogue. The meeting
started withUkrainerequesting that the countryâs President Volodymyr Zelensky be
allowed to participate via video link.Russiawas quick to object, citing rules
that members need be physically present to speak. It asked why Zelensky hadnât travelled to New York even though he was seen travelling around
Ukraine meeting foreign delegations and posing for ""glossy magazines"". In a vote by a
show of hands, Russia was quickly overruled by other members, and Zelensky
was allowed to talk. Despite technical difficulties (which Russia later took a
dig at), the president spoke for about 10 minutes. Referring
to the situation at theZaporizhzhianuclear plant, he accused Russia of putting the world on the brink of a ""radiation catastrophe"" and indulging in
""nuclear blackmail"". Russia
then accused Ukraine of destroying civilian infrastructure - including schools
and medical facilities - and Western nations of being ""accomplices"" to crimes
against civilians, having supplied Ukraine with more weapons. The
UN secretary general expressed deep concern over Zaporizhzhia â and admitted there seemed to be no signs of the war ending soon. A protester being arrested in St Petersburg in March A leading human rights group says more than 16,000 Russians have been detained by the Kremlin for protesting against the invasion of Ukraine. The report from the OVD-Info group, an independent Russian human rights monitor, said some 16,437 people have been arrested for a range of offences since February. Suspects were seized for demonstrating in the street and making comments on social media. The figure also includes people arrested simply for referring to the conflict as a ""war"",  which has been made illegal in Russia. The majority of the arrests came in the first two months of the conflict, suggesting that much of the internal opposition in Russia has been suppressed by the heavy government crackdown. The report comes as authorities arrested the prominent Kremlin critic, Yevgeny Roizman, on charges of ""discrediting the military"". One of Ukraine's top military intelligence officials has suggested that Russia's offensive is slowing because of ""moral and physical fatigue"" in their ranks - and Moscow's ""exhausted"" resource base. Kyrylo Budanov, chief of the Defence Intelligence agency, made the remarks on Ukrainian television, Reuters reports, providing one of the strongest signals yet that Kyiv believes Russia's power could be waning. ""Russia has rather seriously slowed down the tempo of its assault. The reason for this is the exhaustion of their resource base, as well as a moral and physical fatigue from the fighting,"" he said. It comes after Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu claimed earlier that Moscow had deliberately slowed down its campaign in Ukraine, something he said had been driven by the need to reduce civilian casualties. Scaled-down celebrations have been taking place across Ukraine to mark the country's Independence Day and the six-month anniversary of the Russian invasion. Here's what's been happening so far: Gary O'DonoghueWashington Correspondent As we reported earlier, the US has announced a fresh $3bn (Â£2.5bn) military aid package for Ukraine. This is the largest package to be announced in one go, something the president can do safe in the knowledge that most Americans back the support thatâs going to Ukraine. While there are differences between Democrats and Republicans, one recent poll indicated 53% backing for the aid until Russia withdrew â with just 18% opposed. Even among Republicans, who are more cautious about the policy, there was still majority support. While some of the aid (up to Â£4bn recently approved by Congress) is for humanitarian purposes, the vast majority is going to weapons systems and ammunition that Ukraine requires in the medium term â such as technologies for spotting and shooting down unmanned drones. One key point worth noting in this latest round of military aid is that itâs being drawn down from something called the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. This is a pot of money authorised by Congress that allows weapons and equipment to be purchased through industry rather than taken from existing military stocks. That sounds like a technical point, but such purchasing could take longer than the simple transfer of gear already in storage. And thatâs a key indication that Washington believes this war wonât be over anytime soon. Russia carried out a much higher number of air and missile attacks on Ukrainian territory on 24 August - Ukraine's Independence Day - than usual, the Ukrainian General Staff said in its daily evening update. It did not specify what facilities were hit. In the Donetsk Region, Russian troops tried to advance in the direction of Nova Dmytrivka, Pisky, Novoselske, Pobeda, Novomykhaylivka, Pavlivka and Velyka Novosilka but suffered losses and retreated, the report said. The Russians tried to improve their tactical positions by attacking in the direction of Soledar, Bakhmutske and Kodema but were rebuffed and withdrew. In Kherson, Ukrainian troops repelled a Russian attack in the direction of Mykolayivka, the General Staff added. The six-month anniversary of the start of Russia's war in Ukraine is a ""sad and tragic milestone"", the UN secretary general says. Speaking during a special meeting of the UN's security council in New York, Antonio Guterres says the consequences of ""this senseless war are being felt far beyond Ukraine"", referring to spiralling global food and energy costs. He warns ""there simply will not be enough food in 2023"" if the fertiliser market is not stabilised this year. Guterres also remains ""gravely concerned"" about the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in southern Ukraine and the Russian militarisation of the facility. ""The warning lights are flashing. Any further escalation of the situation could lead to self-destruction. The security of the plant must be ensured, and the plant must be re-established as purely civilian infrastructure."" Antonio Guterres, UN secretary general Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch: Kyiv residents reflect on six months of war with Russia Few know the cost of challenging Russian influence better than Viktor Yushchenko. The former Ukrainian president was poisoned with a toxic chemical while campaigning in 2004 against a Moscow-preferred candidate. He then led protests against a rigged election before taking office the following year. Sitting in his timber-framed home on the outskirts of Kyiv, Mr Yushchenko praises the ""power of national spirit"" as the key to Ukraine's independence. ""Today I can say with confidence that 42 million Ukrainians speak in one voice. And that allows us to face any enemy, including Russia."" You can still see the scarring on the former president's face from when he was poisoned. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko: ""The benchmark of independence is the strength of spirit"" Ukraine's day of independence falls six months to the day since Vladimir Putin launched an invasion from the north, east and south. In that time, the Ukrainian military says almost 9,000 members have been killed. Some 5,500 civilian deaths have been confirmed by the UN. While few here predicted the war, Mr Yushchenko largely blames what he sees as the West's historic inability to combat Russian aggression: notably the 2008 conflict in Georgia and theannexation of Crimeasix years later. However, he thinks Ukraine's ultimate test has changed its standing in the world. ""Today, when more than 50 countries have expressed solidarity with the ideas of our fight. They're providing all kinds of support - military, financial and humanitarian."" Carpentry now occupies most of the former statesman's time. We are surrounded by dozens of sculptures, and the former president tells me of his absolute belief that Ukraine can carve out a victory in this war. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians joined the military to fight Russia at the start of the war including members of rock band Antytila. Watch their story,Frontline Frontmenon iPlayer (UK only). The more Russia tries to pull Ukraine into its orbit, the stronger its people's sense of national identity becomes. At a small factory on the left bank of Kyiv's Dnieper river, Nataliia's business used to make hotel uniforms, but now produces Ukrainian flags. Orders for Ukrainian flags have surged since Russia's invasion six months ago She started getting requests from military checkpoints early on in the invasion, now she gets more than 2,500 orders a month - not just from the army, but businesses too. ""These are very dear colours to us,"" she tells me over the whirring sound of sewing machines. ""Every Ukrainian feels these colours and we see them in everything - in the sky, in wheat. This gives us pleasure, joy and positive emotions, because our work is useful."" Six months into the war, Ukraine is presented with some uncomfortable realities. After weeks of talking about it, Ukraine's planned counter-offensive in the south, on the occupied city of Kherson, has yet to materialise. Yes, there have been longer range missile strikes deeper into Russian-held territory, but this war is now dominated by artillery along an almost static front line. So far Western weapons are helping Ukraine to hold the line and frustrate Russian supply lines, but it will take something seismic for the momentum to shift and for Kyiv to force Russia out completely. Therefore, this military status quo looks set to continue, at a growing, unimaginable cost for tens of thousands of families. Also - while widely viewed as the country's war hero, President Volodymyr Zelensky is now facing criticism for how he prepared for Russia's attack. Notably over his decision not to act on warnings from the US, saying it would cause panic and damage Ukraine's economy. Another symbol of Ukrainian defiance is in the newsroom of the Kyiv Independent. This English language news site was set up weeks before the invasion. Within days their online following went from tens of thousands to millions. ""It's the Independence Day we didn't know was going to happen,"" says editor-in-chief Olga Rudenko. Olga Rudenko, editor-in-chief at the Kyiv Independent, a news website established just weeks before Russia's invasion She describes the publication as the voice of Ukraine, and the world's window into it. ""Back in February, when things were so uncertain, we didn't know whether most of the country would be invaded or whether we'd be killed,"" she says. ""To still be here, to be able to celebrate, is so meaningful."" A recent deal, which has allowed Ukraine once again to export grain through the Black Sea, remains the only diplomatic breakthrough in this war. Some see it as the basis for an eventual peace treaty. That is a long way off, and Ukraine has already lost control of a fifth of its territory. To maintain its independence, this country will be dependent on the outside world for help for some time yet.

"This video can not be played Vaughan Gething says people are becoming more unpleasant and vocal about race Wales has gone backwards on racial equality over the past decade, it has been claimed. The warning has come from Vaughan Gething, who was the first black person to become a cabinet minister in any of the UK's devolved governments. Mr Gething is Wales' economy minister having previously covered health. While he acknowledges progress has been made, he thinks some of it has been eroded by Brexit divisions and Donald Trump's US presidency. ""We're in better place than we were in the 70s and 80s undoubtedly"" Mr Gething toldBBC Walescastpodcast, as part of a series of interviews with politicians from different parties. But he warned against complacency, adding: ""We are going to have to re-fight some of the battles for people's perception."" Welsh independence 'less likely if Scotland stays' MP reveals how tragedy made her strong Mr Gething arrived in the UK when he was two with his Welsh father and Zambian mother. The family had intended to settle in Monmouth in 1976, but his father had the job offer withdrawn ""when he turned up with my mum and a crowd of brown children"". So he grew up in Dorset instead, becoming interested in politics from reading about the injustices of apartheid-era South Africa on the front pages during his newspaper round. He finally got to Wales for university, studying at Aberystwyth and Cardiff while becoming the first black president of NUS Wales. ""I think sometimes we tell a bit of a myth to ourselves that Wales has always been this proud, progressive place,"" he said. ""But if you talk to people about their own experiencesâ¦ some of them put up with stuff that they should never have had to put up with."" While he acknowledges progress has been made, he thinks some of that has been eroded by the divisions over Brexit and Donald Trump's US presidency. ""I do think that in the last decade or so we have gone backwards,"" Mr Gething said. Vaughan Gething was two when he arrived in the UK with his parents ""It's emboldened some people on the more extreme and unpleasant end of opinion and that gets back into the mainstream. ""So challenging that is important. It's one of the reasons I'm really proud of the fact that we've got a curriculum where black history is being taught as part of Welsh history, because there are people who look like me that have been here for quite a long time. ""And our history is part of the history and the story of Wales and I regularly say it's part of the future of Wales as well."" Mr Gething was elected to what was then the Welsh Assembly in 2011. A steady climb up the ministerial ladder saw him get the health portfolio, putting him in the hot seat when the pandemic struck and raising his public profile considerably. Becoming better known meant ""Some people said, 'You were lucky',"" he said with disbelief. ""I never felt lucky at the time."" He described a relentless workload and difficult choices where evidence sometimes pointed in more than one direction Now the Welsh government is resisting pressure to hold a Wales specific inquiry into its handling of Covid. Mr Gething insists a UK wide inquiry is the best way to examine Welsh ministers' decision-making because they were always made ""in a UK context"". But can he really expect a country with only five per cent of UK's population to get sufficient attention in a UK-wide inquiry? ""I really do think there will be proper scrutiny, and there should be,"" Mr Gething added. Vaughan Gething used to enjoy playing cricket when he first moved to Cardiff As economy minister, he is facing the next big crisis - the rapidly rising prices of everyday essentials like food and energy. With some public servants angry with the Welsh government's pay offer, would he support strike action? ""If I were a trade union steward at the moment, I can well understand why I'd be going to members and saying 'we need to do something',"" he said. ""The challenge is that the Welsh government doesn't have the resources to give people a 13% pay rise."" ""Any negotiation is not just understanding what you want, but understanding what you can get and the other side can give."" Mr Gething also stands by his decision to spend Â£4.25m of taxpayers' money onbuying Gilestone Farm in Powys for the Green Man festival. He accepts communication over why the purchase was being made could have been better but he insisted it was ""a reasonable choice to have made"". He added: ""We've got a festival with a really significant economic impact. ""I want to see that business to continue to be anchored in Wales, with the benefits that come from it. ""When the detailed business plan comes back with advice for me about what to do, I'll then need to make a decision and to explain what decision I've made and why."" Looking to the future, there will be vacancy for the leadership of Welsh Labour in a few years as the present leader and First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced his intention to step down. Mr Gething wasbeaten into second place by Mr Drakeford at the last contest in 2018but he said they work well together. ""Mark is very pragmatic, he wants to know all the evidence but he then makes choices,"" said Mr Gething. ""And that's about understanding that you can't always make your perfect choice."" The pair do share a love of cricket. ""When I moved to Cardiff, the cricket club that was here at the time was Cardiff YMCA, and they were the first cricket club that I played for."" ""I watch cricket now, that's because I can't play anymore."" But the vocal cords still work and Mr Gething also loves singing. ""I always enjoy singing. If there's a karaoke and I'm allowed the opportunity to sing lots of songs in a row then I will do."" His karaoke special? ""My Girl. The Otis Redding version.""

"Olivia's head teacher said she had a ""beautiful smile, a lovely sense of humour, and a bubbly personality"" Police hunting the gunman who shot dead a nine-year-old girl at her home in Liverpool have been given the name of a suspect by two different sources. Olivia Pratt-Korbel was killed by a masked attacker who had chased a man into her house in the Dovecot area of the city on Monday night. News that detectives had been given a lead was welcomed by Merseyside Police and Crime Commissioner Emily Spurrell. ""I'm really pleased to hear information is coming forward,"" she told the BBC. ""It was the plea that was put out yesterday - we know somebody out there will know what happened and who is involved."" Officers are also reviewing CCTV footage and conducting house-to-house inquiries. Girl, 9, shot dead after gun chase spills into home Shooting victim was ray of sunshine - school head Police said the gunman ""fired indiscriminately"", hitting Olivia in the chest as she stood behind her mother Cheryl Korbel, who was shot in the wrist. The man being chased was also shot and remains in hospital in a serious, but not life-threatening, condition. Detectives have not yet spoken to him and he has not been arrested. Mrs Korbel is recovering at another hospital. The family had no connection to either of the men, police said. This video can not be played Watch: Liverpool police reveal how shooting of 9-year-old unfolded At a press conference on Tuesday, Merseyside Police said: A 35-year-old man ran into Olivia's home, followed by a man armed with a handgun, after Ms Korbel opened the door to see what the noise was outside Olivia was fatally shot and Ms Korbel was shot in the wrist as she tried to shut the door The gunman then twice fired through the gap in the door, hitting the 35-year-old in the upper body, before running away The injured man was then driven away in a black Audi, while Olivia and Ms Korbel were left behind The gunman was described as about 5ft 7in (170cm), of slim build, carrying a handgun and wearing a black padded jacket, a black balaclava and black gloves Merseyside's criminal fraternity are being asked to help in the hunt for the gunman Merseyside Police Chief Constable Serena Kennedy described the attack, which happened in Kingsheath Avenue at about 22:00 BST, as ""shocking and appalling"". She said: ""I want to take this opportunity again to appeal to anybody who knows who is responsible for this attack to please come forward and give us those names. ""We need to find all who are responsible for this - not just the gunman. We need to find out who supplied the weapon and who arranged this terrible incident."" She said Olivia's death was ""an absolute tragedy and crosses every single boundary"". Ms Kennedy added: ""If people are frightened to come forward, we can have those conversations in confidence."" This video can not be played Watch: Liverpool police say gunman had no connection to killed 9-year-old girl Boris Johnson described the shooting as ""horrific"" and ""senseless"". On Twitter, the prime minister promised Merseyside Police would get ""whatever they need to catch those responsible and secure justice for Olivia"". Liverpool Mayor Joanne Anderson ""someone out there knows who did this... abhorrent act of evil"". Local councillor Barbara Murray told BBC Breakfast: ""Coming forward, you don't have to go to the police. Liverpool has got 90 councillors, I think any one of them would liaise with police on behalf of anybody who wants to give information. ""Really strongly, I would say people can use Crimestoppers. It's an anonymous phone call. You don't have to give information about yourself."" Assistant mayor Harry Doyle told the Radio 4 Today programme: ""It was just, and still is, a complete and utter shock. As the news progressed yesterday it just became more horrific. ""Just speaking to people on their doorsteps, they're mortified. Lots of children in the area who have played with Olivia on the street, they're really upset. ""The confusion as well when these things happen, when it's in your street, it's very real. It's heartbreaking, it really is."" Floral tributes to Olivia have been left close to the scene of the shooting Mr Doyle said the police's understanding of crime in the city had changed sincethe murder of 11-year-old Rhys Jonesin 2007, and he was ""very confident we will get justice"". But the former chief constable of Greater Manchester Police has downplayed the likelihood of criminals turning in the killer. Questioned on Sky News about whether criminal gangs would respond to an appeal from Merseyside Police, Sir Peter Fahy said: ""It's very rare, really. ""This, at the end of the day, will be down to either a lucky piece of information from the public, really good analysis of mobile phone data. ""Often when criminal members suffer the most horrendous injuries they refuse to co-operate with the police or tell the police what's happened. ""Because they want to exact their own revenge or just out of fear."" Olivia's death comes after a spate of killings involving guns and knives on Merseyside in recent weeks.

"The BBC has verified that the images match the interior of the Mariupol concert hall The UN Human Rights Office says it is concerned by reports that Russia plans to try Ukrainian prisoners of war (POWs) in Russian-occupied Mariupol. A UN spokeswoman said there was evidence that metal cages were being built in the Ukrainian city's concert hall, ""apparently to restrain prisoners of war during proceedings."" The UN said prosecuting POWs for taking part in hostilities is a war crime. Russia has previously denied unfairly treating prisoners of war. Photos posted on social media in recent days -including by Ukrainian authorities,external- appear to show metal cages being built on the stage of the city's philharmonic hall. The BBC has verified that the photos match the interior of the venue and were taken within the last four to five days. Ukraine's intelligence service has alleged that Russia is planning to hold show trials of Ukrainian POWs captured while defending the citybefore it fell to Russian forces in May. Speaking at a press briefing, a spokeswoman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ravina Shamdasani, said ""apparently the idea is to restrain the prisoners of war during proceedings in these cages,"" adding that such plans were ""not acceptable"" and ""humiliating"". ""We recall that international humanitarian law prohibits the establishment of courts solely to judge prisoners of war and that wilfully depriving a prisoner of war of the rights of fair and regular trial amounts to a war crime,"" Ms Shamdasani said in a UN statement released on Tuesday. More on the Ukraine conflict: Speculation rife as Russia ponders killing of nationalist philosopher's daughter Ukraine war in maps: Tracking the Russian invasion Bomb shelters, soldiers & an empty stadium as football restarts She added that the UN is concerned that if POWs are charged with crimes, they will not receive a fair trial. Ms Shamdasani also expressed concern over Russia denying Ukrainian POWs access to independent monitors such as the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which she said could expose them to the risk of being tortured to extract a confession.

"Waste in Edinburgh has been piling up since workers began their strike Bin strikes across a further 13 Scottish local authorities are under way despite a new pay offer being made. Trade unions queried a previous offer of a 5% uplift, saying they needed more detail about how it would impact the lowest paid members. Cosla, the body representing local government, said its offer meant the lowest paid 12% council workers will get more than a 5% increase. But three unions are calling for more funding from the Scottish government. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said Â£140m of new money had already been allocated to the local government pay settlement. Mr Swinney met with union officials on Thursday evening which Unison described as ""detailed constructive talks"" but no further offer was made. Bin strike residents told to keep rubbish inside Festival litter pickers clean up bin strike waste Edinburgh bin workers begin strikes over pay He told BBC Scotland: ""I think it would be helpful if local authorities leaders had made the offer of 5% much earlier than they did, when I gave them the money. ""But Labour and Conservative leaders in Cosla stalled on giving that offer to trade unions."" Mr Swinney said the Scottish government had looked within a fixed budget and made hard choices to provide the funds. This video can not be played John Swinney says councils should contribute more funds to resolve an ongoing pay dispute which has led to bin workers striking He added it was important the ""proper negotiation machinery"" between local authorities and unions took its course. Mr Swinney said: ""I'd encourage all parties to get round the table, including local authority leaders, to resolve these issues. ""We're in an unacceptable situation just now, particularly in the City of Edinburgh with conditions round about the waste in the city so it's important these issues are resolved."" Colsa resources spokeswoman, councillor Katie Hagmann, said: ""The reality of this new offer is that the lowest paid 12% of our workforce will get more than a 5% increase, meaning that those on the Scottish Local Government Living Wage will see an overall 7.36% increase. ""This amounts to one of, if not the best offer in decades for Scottish local government workers during some of the most trying times for councils to continue to deliver the everyday essential services that our communities rely on."" The strikes follow similar industrial action by refuse workers in Edinburgh, which started on 18 August. Edinburgh Castle provides the backdrop as rubbish piles up in nearby streets Johanna Baxter, Unison Scotland's head of local government, said the union was ""a long way"" from agreement. She said: ""Cosla negotiated within the cost envelope that leaders mandated them but that simply isn't enough and goes nowhere near matching the pay offer provided to council workers in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Speaking after the talks with Mr Swinney, she added: ""We welcome that he listened to Unison concerns and was keen to explore how he could support getting council pay talks pay back on track. ""We were clear that we need to rethink not only the construction of the pay offer, so that those on the lowest incomes are fairly treated, we also need to explore ways in which we can increase the overall cash available to come to a fair offer."" Wendy Dunsmore, industrial officer at the Unite union, said Mr Swinney had said he would now ""engage Cosla on a mechanism which could facilitate funding but that this would not come directly from the Scottish government"". She added that the trade unions now want the Scottish government to ""directly engage"" in the negotiations with Cosla. The current offer means that the lowest paid council workers be taken to a new Scottish Local Government Living Wage of Â£10.50. Unite said that for more than half of local government workers, Cosla's offer represented an offer of between Â£900 to Â£1,250 when the UK government is offering council workers in England a Â£1,925 flat rate pay offer. Bins on Princes Street have overflowed as the Edinburgh Festival Fringe continues in the city Tourists walk pass overflowing bins in Edinburgh Unite industrial officer Wendy Dunsmore warned the dispute could cause ""months of disruption"". She said: ""It's a sad indictment that council workers in Scotland are being offered substantially less than their counterparts in England. ""The cold hard reality is that inflation and energy costs are soaring - and they are predicted to rise even higher. The 5% today will not be worth the same in a matter of months when the cost of living crisis will bite even harder. ""The offer on the table just doesn't help the lowest paid make ends meet."" Check out the latest headlines from Scotland,external GMB Scotland senior organiser Keir Greenaway said: ""The fact that Cosla couldn't even commit to the basic principle of a flat rate offer which would help the lowest paid is bitterly disappointing and frankly shameful. ""Our members are angry about the lack of value being shown to them by political leaders and scared about the prospect of pay that doesn't confront a cost of living crisis that's getting worse by the week."" Local authorities had initially proposed a 3.5% increase before upping their offer to 5%, with the minimum hourly rate also to be raised to Â£10.50. Members from the Unite and GMB unions are also involved in the pay dispute. Cosla said it hoped they would consult with their members on the fresh offer. Overflowing rubbish bins in the Grassmarket area of Edinburgh Hundreds of GMB and Unite union members in Edinburgh's waste and recycling service have already begun a strike which was planned to last until 30 August. School and nursery staff in nine Scottish council areasare also to go on strike for three days next month in the same pay row. Unison said a total of 13,000 members would be involved. Unite members formed a picket line outside a recycling centre in Alness in the Higlands Aberdeen City Council workers demonstrated outside council buildings It will see schools, early years centres and nurseries disrupted in Aberdeenshire, Clackmannanshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow City, Inverclyde, Orkney, North Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire and Stirling. The unions represent workers including school catering staff, cleaners, caretakers, teaching assistants and early years practitioners. This is a national industrial dispute about council pay across Scotland - not a local dispute with individual councils. Today marks a significant escalation of the action. Bin workers and recycling staff are now on strike at 14 councils across Scotland. More will join them on Friday. Then in a fortnight, non-teaching staff in schools and nursery workers will go on strike too. The council unions note that the pay offer is still well below the offer made to council workers in the rest of the UK. They have been offered a flat rate rise of Â£1,925 each. But it may be hard to significantly improve on the current offer. Councils argue they have already had to identify more savings or dig into reserves to offer 5% - even with the extra Â£140m they were given by the Scottish government to support an improved pay deal. It is hard to see how they can offer more unless they get more Scottish government cash. Some councils are in a healthier financial position than others but the pay rise has to be affordable to all of them. The Scottish government, in turn, argues that it has had to make hard choices to give councils that extra Â£140m. But without an improved pay offer, strike action is set to continue and intensify. Refuse workers in Edinburgh began industrial action on18 August. Bin collectors from 13 other councils began their strike on24 August: Aberdeen Angus Dundee East Ayrshire East Renfrewshire Edinburgh Falkirk Glasgow Highland Inverclyde South Ayrshire South Lanarkshire West Lothian East Lothian expect domestic bin collections to continue despite strike action because of the number of workers involved. From26 August, a further six councils will see workers join the action: Aberdeenshire North Lanarkshire Stirling Midlothian Orkney Perth and Kinross School catering staff are among those due to take strike action Industrial action by staff in schools, nurseries and early years' centres in nine council areas are scheduled to walk out on6, 7 and 8 September: Aberdeenshire Clackmannanshire East Renfrewshire Glasgow City Inverclyde Orkney North Lanarkshire Stirling South Lanarkshire Festival litter pickers clean up bin strike waste Bin strike residents told to keep rubbish inside Edinburgh bin workers begin strikes over pay Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Hamas tells BBC it has approved Gaza ceasefire deal as Qatar to hold news conference UK's Chagos handover on hold to allow Trump to consider the deal Why the small drop in inflation matters to you The new Lockerbie drama provoking fierce criticism from victims' families What happens if TikTok is banned?

"Many UK households and businesses are struggling with rising prices, but that's not the story for everyone. The fastest rise in the cost of living for four decades meanspeople are typically having to spend Â£110 to get what Â£100 bought them last year. But some industries are benefiting from higher inflation and posting bumper profits. There are huge sums to be made if you're in the business of drilling for oil, trading wheat, transporting toys or selling fine wines. So who's gaining from the extra spend? Businesses which extract and refine fossil fuels have grabbed the headlines in recent months due to their record profits. Wholesale gas prices have soared on international markets and oil prices have hovered around $100 per barrel due to demand increasing and supply fears following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Saudi Arabia's Aramco posted record profits between April to June, while BP cleared Â£6.9bn in that period and Shell topped that with its profits of Â£9bn worldwide. Centrica, the parent company of British Gas, has seen profits rise five-fold due to its oil, gas and nuclear assets. But there are many firms operating in the UK which get less attention. Among the biggest of the North Sea producers is Harbour Energy. The company has grown by acquiring oil and gas operations and returned to profit this year. Meanwhile, private-equity backed Neptune Energy, which produces around 12% of UK's gas saw profits double last year, allowing for $1bn in dividends to be returned to its owners. Israeli-owned Ithaca and Norway's Equinor are other big producers. All of these companies will be faced with the government's 25% windfall tax on the profits they make from extracting UK oil and gas - this is intended to go towards helping households with rising bills. Yet for most of the energy giants, domestic extraction is a small part of their operations. For example, the UK accounts for just a tenth of BP's overall oil and gas production. How much are prices rising for you? Try our calculator How does the windfall tax on energy firms work? How high will my energy bill go and can I reduce it? But there are some firms who are yet to benefit from high oil and gas prices due to the way they buy wholesale energy. These companies set prices in advance to insure against big swings in the market price - a process known as hedging. As countries look for alternatives to Russian gas, coal is unexpectedly back in fashion. That's paying off for mining firms who've specialised in the dirtiest of fossil fuels. Glencore's thermal coal business benefited from record prices, helping profits double to over Â£15bn in the first half of 2022. Many of its rivals have backed away from coal, but Glencore has argued it will be an important fuel in the process of the transition to greener forms of producing energy in some countries, and that it will look to wind down production across the next few decades. With fears of gas supply disruption this winter from Russia to Europe, energy firms have been asked to delay the closure of UK coal-fired power plants by the government. German utility Uniper said on Monday it will start producing electricity for the market at its reserve coal-fired power station Heyden 4 due to Russia halting pipeline flows. Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus, aren't household names but their products feature heavily on dinner plates globally. The ""ABCDs"" are the dominant traders of food commodities, and grain in particular. At times of global disruption, these supply chain middlemen can play a key role in helping food supplies flow to where it's needed - helping countries find alternative sources of wheat in the face of disruption to supplies from Ukraine and Russia, for example. But that disruption means wheat prices are now 25% higher than a year ago. Many other staples have  become more expensive. ADM reported a 60% rise in their latest quarterly profits. Bunge fared less well - but is optimistic about the rest of the year. Privately-owned Cargill's revenues were up by 23% to a record $165bn (Â£140bn) in the latest financial year. It says it gave $163m to humanitarian relief and other good causes, which equates to 0.1% of sales. Pandemic shutdowns may have disrupted economies and supply chains, but they boosted the fortunes of shipping companies. Freight rates surged and have remained high since demand for consumer goods increased during Covid lockdowns. Restrictions meant ports were congested and new shipbuilding projects were halted. The container-shipping industry will have notched up profits of half a trillion dollars over the last two years by the end of 2022, according to consultancy Drewry. The world's second-largest container shipping group, AP MÃ¸ller-Maersk, hiked its annual profit forecast for a third time this year because of the prolonged disruption at ports, saying ""normalisation"" of rates may now not happen until the end of the year. For people with cash to burn, a combination of surging inflation, relatively low interest rates and weak economic growth means decent returns on conventional investments can be difficult to find. They are turning elsewhere. Brokers at Knight Frank reported that the value of investments in fine wines and luxury watches shot up by 16% last year, art by 13% and whiskies and coins by 19%. Investors were taking a punt on collectibles, bettering their worth would outpace inflation, and that has continued into this year. The world's largest fine wine trader, Bordeaux Index, reported a 37% increase in sales in the year to June. For the rest of us, however, inflation may leave a sourer taste.

"A boat trapped in the dried-out shore where the French-Swiss Lac des Brenets lake should be Two-thirds of Europe is under some sort of drought warning, in what is likely the worst such event in 500 years. The latest report from theGlobal Drought Observatory,externalsays 47% of the continent is in ""warning"" conditions, meaning soil has dried up. Another 17% is on alert - meaning vegetation ""shows signs of stress"". The report warns that the dry spell will hit crop yields, spark wildfires, and may last several months more in some of Europe's southern regions. Compared with the average of the previous five years, EU forecasts for harvest are down 16% for grain maize, 15% for soybeans and 12% for sunflowers. The drought observatory is part of the European Commission's research wing. Responding to it, the Commission warned that preliminary data suggests ""the current drought still appears to be the worst since at least 500 years"". The ongoing heatwave and water shortages have ""created an unprecedented stress on water levels in the entire EU"", Research Commissioner Mariya Gabriel said. ""We are currently noticing a wildfire season sensibly above the average and an important impact on crops production. Climate change is undoubtedly more noticeable every year,"" she added. The report warned that nearly all of Europe's rivers have dried up to some extent. Apart from the obvious impact on boats,dry rivers are also hitting the energy sector, which is already in crisis. Hydroelectric power has dropped by a significant 20%, according to the report. A ""severe drought"" has been present in many places all year, but ""has been further expanding and worsening as of early August"" it says. The conditions are likely to last until at least November this year along the European Mediterranean. The report warns that the situation is worsening in countries including Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Romania, Hungary, northern Serbia, Ukraine, Moldova, Ireland and the UK. The researchers' stark warning follows rapidly-sinking river levels across Europe which have exposed relics of the past - including so-called ""hunger stones"" warning of potential famineand the sunken remains of World War Two Nazi ships. And in the UK, which had an official drought declared in several regions,some trees have turned an autumnal shade of auburn- in what's considered a ""false autumn"" due to the heat.

The former Ukrainian president was poisoned with a toxic chemical while campaigning in 2004 against a Moscow-preferred candidate. He then led protests against a rigged election before taking office the following year. Sitting in his timber-framed home on the outskirts of Kyiv, Mr Yushchenko praises the ""power of national spirit"" as the key to Ukraine's independence. ""Today I can say with confidence that 42 million Ukrainians speak in one voice. And that allows us to face any enemy, including Russia."" You can still see the scarring on the former president's face from when he was poisoned. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko: ""The benchmark of independence is the strength of spirit"" Ukraine's day of independence falls six months to the day since Vladimir Putin launched an invasion from the north, east and south. In that time, the Ukrainian military says almost 9,000 members have been killed. Some 5,500 civilian deaths have been confirmed by the UN. While few here predicted the war, Mr Yushchenko largely blames what he sees as the West's historic inability to combat Russian aggression: notably the 2008 conflict in Georgia and theannexation of Crimeasix years later. However, he thinks Ukraine's ultimate test has changed its standing in the world. ""Today, when more than 50 countries have expressed solidarity with the ideas of our fight. They're providing all kinds of support - military, financial and humanitarian."" Carpentry now occupies most of the former statesman's time. We are surrounded by dozens of sculptures, and the former president tells me of his absolute belief that Ukraine can carve out a victory in this war. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians joined the military to fight Russia at the start of the war including members of rock band Antytila. Watch their story,Frontline Frontmenon iPlayer (UK only). The more Russia tries to pull Ukraine into its orbit, the stronger its people's sense of national identity becomes. At a small factory on the left bank of Kyiv's Dnieper river, Nataliia's business used to make hotel uniforms, but now produces Ukrainian flags. Orders for Ukrainian flags have surged since Russia's invasion six months ago She started getting requests from military checkpoints early on in the invasion, now she gets more than 2,500 orders a month - not just from the army, but businesses too. ""These are very dear colours to us,"" she tells me over the whirring sound of sewing machines. ""Every Ukrainian feels these colours and we see them in everything - in the sky, in wheat. This gives us pleasure, joy and positive emotions, because our work is useful."" Six months into the war, Ukraine is presented with some uncomfortable realities. After weeks of talking about it, Ukraine's planned counter-offensive in the south, on the occupied city of Kherson, has yet to materialise. Yes, there have been longer range missile strikes deeper into Russian-held territory, but this war is now dominated by artillery along an almost static front line. So far Western weapons are helping Ukraine to hold the line and frustrate Russian supply lines, but it will take something seismic for the momentum to shift and for Kyiv to force Russia out completely. Therefore, this military status quo looks set to continue, at a growing, unimaginable cost for tens of thousands of families. Also - while widely viewed as the country's war hero, President Volodymyr Zelensky is now facing criticism for how he prepared for Russia's attack. Notably over his decision not to act on warnings from the US, saying it would cause panic and damage Ukraine's economy. Another symbol of Ukrainian defiance is in the newsroom of the Kyiv Independent. This English language news site was set up weeks before the invasion. Within days their online following went from tens of thousands to millions. ""It's the Independence Day we didn't know was going to happen,"" says editor-in-chief Olga Rudenko. Olga Rudenko, editor-in-chief at the Kyiv Independent, a news website established just weeks before Russia's invasion She describes the publication as the voice of Ukraine, and the world's window into it. ""Back in February, when things were so uncertain, we didn't know whether most of the country would be invaded or whether we'd be killed,"" she says. ""To still be here, to be able to celebrate, is so meaningful."" A recent deal, which has allowed Ukraine once again to export grain through the Black Sea, remains the only diplomatic breakthrough in this war. Some see it as the basis for an eventual peace treaty. That is a long way off, and Ukraine has already lost control of a fifth of its territory. To maintain its independence, this country will be dependent on the outside world for help for some time yet.
