"The CoppaFeel! advert encourages people to check themselves for signs of breast cancer The first advertisement to appear on UK daytime television with a female nipple fully visible has been broadcast, with the full advert being shown on Monday. Created for the CoppaFeel! charity, it is being shown during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. It was broadcast on Good Morning Britain on Friday, during a discussion about the disease with the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with one person diagnosed every 10 minutes, with almost all of them women. TV stars AJ Odudu and Olivia Buckland feature in the advert The advert encourages people to examine their own breasts to check for signs of irregularities, which could be symptoms of cancer. It shows inanimate objects being touched, as well as men and women touching their own chest and nipples. Love Island reality TV star Olivia Buckland, television presenter AJ Odudu, blogger Anna Newton, and vlogger Lily Pebbles all feature. Scheduled to run on TV and in cinemas, in 60 and 40-second versions respectively, it will not be shown in or around children's programmes. It also shows inanimate objects, encouraging viewers to explore them by touch Natalie Kelly, CEO of CoppaFeel!, said: ""In demonstrating the power of our hands and celebrating our touch as the best tool for checking, we hope to encourage more young people across the UK to adopt a healthy boob-checking habit, which could one day save their life."" One in eight women in the UK will develop breast cancer in their lifetime. Some 5,000 people will be diagnosed during Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Survival rates for the disease are improving, and have doubled in the last 40 years in the UK. Almost nine in 10 women survive breast cancer for five years or more, while every year about 11,400 people die from breast cancer in the UK.

"It is the second catastrophic season for the southern penguins in five years All but two Adelie penguin chicks have starved to death in their east Antarctic colony, in a breeding season described as ""catastrophic"" by experts. It was caused by unusually high amounts of ice late in the season, meaning adults had to travel further for food. It is the second bad season in five years after no chicks survived in 2015. Conservation groups are calling for urgent action on a new marine protection area in the east Antarctic to protect the colony of about 36,000. WWF says a ban on krill fishing in the area would eliminate their competition and help to secure the survival of Antarctic species, including the Adelie penguins. Adelie penguins pictured at the French monitoring station in Dumont d'Urville in east Antarctica WWF have been supporting research with French scientists in the region monitoring penguin numbers since 2010. The protection proposal will be discussed at a meeting on Monday of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). The Commission is made up of the 25 members and the European Union. Adelie penguins are the most southerly breeding bird in the world. They are found along the Antarctic coast, and breed from October to February They typically lay two eggs in nests made of stones, and parents take turns to incubate the eggs Breeding adults may have to travel up to 30-75 miles (50-120 km) to catch food to then regurgitate for their chicks See more on Adelie Penguins Source: National Geographic and Antarctica.gov.au ""This devastating event contrasts with the image that many people might have of penguins,"" Rod Downie, Head of Polar Programmes at WWF, said. ""The risk of opening up this area to exploratory krill fisheries, which would compete with the Adelie penguins for food as they recover from two catastrophic breeding failures in four years, is unthinkable. ""So CCAMLR needs to act now by adopting a new Marine Protected Area for the waters off east Antarctica, to protect the home of the penguins.""

"This video can not be played Police released CCTV of men they want to trace A teenage girl was sexually assaulted by three different men within an hour as she walked home from a night out. Police said the 17-year-old was attacked in Bethnal Green, east London, after becoming separated from friends. They believe the girl, who was found ""distressed"" by a member of the public, may also have been drugged. Images have been released of two men police want to speak to in connection with the attacks, which happened on the night of 29 and 30 September. Police want to speak to a bearded man who was on a racing bike The victim was spotted on camera shortly before midnight being carried by a man, who was wearing dark clothing, in Cambridge Heath Road. The pair appeared to go into a doorway on the same road, and some of the girl's clothing was later found nearby. Shortly after midnight, the girl was seen on CCTV stumbling down Mint Street, followed by another man on a racing bike who is described as having a beard and wearing a baseball cap backwards and a hooded zipped jacket. She was then attacked for a second time. Minutes later, detectives believe the girl suffered a third attack, possibly involving two or three men. They say she was approached by a third man, who police describe as walking unevenly, ""perhaps being slightly bow-legged"". The man with a beard was wearing a baseball cap backwards Police say she was then found by a member of the public who saw her lying in Corfield Street in ""a state of distress"" and rang 999. Det Insp Suzanne Jordan said: ""This is a horrific multiple sexual assault on an young female who was simply making her way home after a night out. ""We would like to thank the members of the public who intervened to help her and possibly prevented her ordeal from continuing even further."" She urged anyone with information about the ""hideous crimes"" to contact them urgently.

"The couple boasted about their holiday on social media A ""greedy"" couple made ""fake"" holiday sickness compensation claims while boasting about holidays full of ""sun, laughter and fun"", a court heard. Deborah Briton, 53, and partner Paul Roberts, 43, were jailed at Liverpool Crown Court after admitting fraud. They tried to claim nearly Â£20,000 saying their two children fell ill on holidays to Majorca in 2015 and 2016. Judge David Aubrey QC said there had been an ""explosion"" in gastric illness claims made by UK holidaymakers. Briton, who was jailed for nine months, and Roberts, who received a 15-month term, bragged about their holidays on social media, the court heard. The pair, from Wallasey, Wirral, both admitted four counts of fraud in the private prosecution, brought by holiday company Thomas Cook. Family members, including Briton's daughter Charlene, who had initially been charged with two counts of fraud that were later dropped, shouted out in court as the couple were jailed Paul Roberts and Deborah Briton admitted fraud The court heard that had they succeeded, the couple would have also cost the holiday firm a further Â£28,000 in legal expenses. Judge Aubrey said their claims had been a ""complete and utter sham"". ""They were bogus from start to finish, you were both asserting on your behalfs and on behalf of your two children that on two separate holidays you had suffered illness. ""They were totally and utterly fake."" He said the claims, made in August last year, must have required planning and premeditation. He said: ""Why? Pure greed. Seeking to get something for nothing."" The judge said those tempted to make a dishonest claim must ""expect to receive an immediate custodial sentence"" if convicted. A Thomas Cook spokesman added ""We had to take a stand to protect our holidays and our customers from the minority who cheat the system.""

"This video can not be played Trump: 'I can terminate US involvement in deal any time' US President Donald Trump has condemned Iran as a ""fanatical regime"" and refused to continue signing off on a landmark international nuclear deal. In a combative speech on Friday, Mr Trump accused Iran of sponsoring terrorism and proposed new sanctions. He said Iran had already violated the 2015 deal, which imposed curbs on Iran's nuclear capability in return for easing international embargoes. International observers say Iran has been in full compliance with the deal. Speaking at the White House, Mr Trump said he was acting in order todeny Iran ""all paths to a nuclear weapon"",external. ""We will not continue down a path whose predictable conclusion is more violence, more terror, and the very real threat of Iran's nuclear breakout,"" he said. Trump's Iran deal speech: Full text Iran nuclear deal: Key details Europe âconcernedâ by Trump Iran threat What do Trump's words on Iran mean for US/UK relations? Congress requires the US president to certify every 90 days that Iran is upholding its part of the agreement. Mr Trump had already recertified twice, but refused to sign a third time ahead of a Sunday deadline. This video can not be played EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said Iran was implementing the deal Congress now has 60 days to decide whether to pull out of the nuclear deal by re-imposing sanctions. Some advocates of the deal, signed between Iran and six international powers - the UK, US, Russia, France, Germany, and China - had feared that Mr Trump would withdraw the US entirely. Instead he essentially passed the ball to Congress, which will now decide whether to rewrite the framework in accordance with Trump's wishes. The president made it clear that if it did not, he would cancel the deal. ""In the event we are not able to reach a solution working with Congress and our allies, then the agreement will be terminated,"" he said. ""It is under continuous review and our participation can be cancelled by me, as president, at any time."" Mr Trump is seeking is the end to the nuclear deal's so-called""sunset clauses"", one of which allows for the lifting of restrictions on Iran's nuclear enrichment programme after 2025. He also called for new sanctions on Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards, which he called the ""corrupt personal terror force of Iran's leader"", and restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile programme, which is not covered by the deal. Last month,Iran said it had successfully tested a new medium-range missilewith a 2,000km (1,200-mile) range. The test was not internationally verified. The president said that congressional leaders were already drafting amendments that would curb the ballistic missile development and eliminate expiry dates on restrictions to Iran's nuclear development. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the US was ""more than ever isolated"" and could not change the nuclear deal. ""As long as our rights are guaranteed, as long as our interests are served, as long as we benefit from the nuclear deal, we will respect and comply with the deal,"" Mr Rouhani said. Yukiya Amano,external, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said Iran was implementing the deal and was subject to ""the world's most robust nuclear verification regime"". Worshippers shouted anti-US slogans during Friday prayers in Tehran European diplomats warned that any such unilateral changes to the agreement were likely to trigger the deal's collapse and a return to a nuclear standoff in the Middle East. EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini called the deal ""robust"" and said there had been ""no violations"" by Iran. She said it was not in the power of ""any president in the world"" to terminate the agreement. In ajoint statement,external, the UK, Germany and France said they were ""concerned"" by Mr Trump's move but remained committed to the deal. They said they ""shared concerns about Iran's ballistic missile programme and regional activities"". Russia said it remained committed to the deal and was opposed to the use of ""aggressive and threatening rhetoric in international relations"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahucongratulated,externalMr Trump, who he said had ""boldly confronted Iran's terrorist regime"". Saudi Arabia also backed the US president's ""firm strategy"". By Lyse Doucet, chief international correspondent President Trump has recast the list of Middle East threats, with Iran replacing Islamic State as Enemy Number One. That world view is shared by his strongest supporters in the region, including Israel and Gulf Arab leaders who have long seen Iran as their primary threat, and a rival with vast sway across the Middle East. They resented Washington's focus on the Iran deal during President's Obama administration. Like President Trump, they want to undo his legacy. The new approach imposes new sanctions but stops short of designating Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group - a step Iran says would be tantamount to a declaration of war. The urgent question now is whether the new strategy will embolden Iran's hardliners including the Revolutionary Guards. Like US forces, they're involved in battles to defeat IS in Iraq and Syria, and may also see a new enemy. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Washington Donald Trump, trying to reconcile a bluntly delivered campaign promise with the tricky realities of governing, is taking a half-step - and handing the mess to Congress. After railing against it for years, President Trump announced he would refuse to recertify the Iran deal Legislators do not make for great caretakers, however, and without firm White House guidance Iran may prove a daunting challenge. The president has decertified Iran's compliance, but Congress will have to decide how to fix the deal to his liking. The administration recommends establishing ""triggers"" that would automatically impose penalties on the Iran. That will take a lot of legislative manoeuvring, not Washington's strong suit lately. There are signs of progress in Congress, but with tax reform and budget negotiations continuing, the schedule is packed. At some point Mr Trump could again be on the spot. He says if there's no further action, he will officially nix the deal. The original Iran deal legislation was a way to allow congressional Republicans to object to the agreement without killing it. Now, it seems, Mr Trump wants new provisions that will allow him to kill it - or keep it - without getting his hands dirty. Formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, it is designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon. It lifted some sanctions that stopped Iran from trading on international markets and selling oil. The lifting of sanctions is dependent on Iran restricting its nuclear programme. It must curb its uranium stockpile, build no more heavy-water reactors for 15 years and allow inspectors into the country.

"Hull is the UK's only city to have banned sex workers from its red light district, effectively making prostitution illegal. The council says the policy is working, but Millie, who once worked on the streets herself, says it increases the danger for the women involved. Sex work ""slithered"" into Millie's life when she was in her twenties. ""It happens quite slowly at first and then all of a sudden you're in this mad cyclone and you can't find your feet, you get lost,"" she says. The cocky bravado of the women in Hull's red light district made it seem like an easy way of funding her drug addiction. But now, with more than five years on the streets behind her, she knows all that banter is just body armour against the violence and vileness that comes with the job. ""Oh, you must love sex,"" punters would say with a smirk. ""No. I love heroin,"" was Millie's sharp retort. ""There is no love of sex, working on the streets - it's always a last resort."" Millie's drug addiction began as a teenager, when she would steal her mum's sleeping pills and Valium. When her mum's mental illness was at its height, she would whisper menacing things through Millie's bedroom door at night: ""There's evil inside you, I can see it. You are a demon, spawned from demon seed."" The pills helped to block it all out. From there she graduated to ecstasy, opioids - and eventually, heroin. ""Then you get trapped in addiction because you end up needing the drugs to get through it, to block out the things you've had to do,"" says Millie. She remembers how women would steel themselves for a night on Hessle Road - Hull's red light district - telling themselves that they wouldn't do anything for less than Â£60. But their resolve would weaken as soon as withdrawal symptoms set in. ""When you're rattling you'll get in that car for less than Â£20 - you'd do it for a fiver, simple as that,"" says Millie. When we meet, Millie has just finished reading a book about the Victorian serial killer, Jack the Ripper, and can relate to his victims. ""Back then we were referred to as 'unfortunates',"" she says. ""We have different names now but still the same social problems: the poverty, the addiction, the violence."" In Hull, the fishing industry and the sex trade have always been intertwined, she says, the poorest women in the fishing community at risk of sliding into prostitution. Millie knows lots of sex workers today whose fathers were trawlermen in the 1970s, when the industry went into steep decline. ""Generation after generation of women from these fishing families are working the streets - it is a terrifying prospect."" But while Hull has celebrated its fishing heritage with statues and murals as UK City of Culture this year, it takes a hard line on the sex trade. Three years ago - not long after its status as 2017's city of culture had been confirmed - it became the only local authority in the UK to effectively make prostitution illegal. An end-of-terrace mural on Hessle Road, created for Hull's year as UK City of Culture It did this by obtaining powers from the county court to issue injunctions under Section 222 of the Local Government Act 1972, to people found loitering, soliciting or having sex in the Hessle Road area. If they continue their anti-social behaviour they have broken the injunction, and can be arrested, prosecuted, and even jailed. The policy currently affects more than 100 women. Last year the Lighthouse Project, a charity, had contact with 113 women working on the streets of Hull, and another 15 who had stopped - either temporarily or permanently. Women who break free may be back in a few years, charity workers say. Millie, who has been out of the sex trade and clean from drugs for about 10 years, says Section 222 has forced the sex workers out of sight, making their lives more dangerous. To dodge police, they work increasingly in back streets or on isolated industrial estates - areas that are poorly lit and away from surveillance cameras. ""Even without Section 222 to contend with, it's lonely, it's frightening, it's degrading - and it's a secretive life,"" Millie says. ""I can understand that Hull City Council wants to clean up the streets, but I think the best way to do that is not an Asbo, or to victimise victims, I think it is to provide support and proper treatment and look at the social issues - the homelessness, the domestic violence, the exploitation, the drug addiction, the mental health problems."" Millie is one of 11 women who worked with the Lighthouse Project to produce An Untold Story, a book documenting the reality of being a sex worker in Hull. In the three-and-a-half years it took to prepare, five women working on the streets were murdered. Another 11, including two of the book's contributors, died from other causes - pneumonia, drug overdoses or other conditions resulting from years of sex work, and drug or alcohol abuse. Sorry. It's only one word containing five letters. It's not enough, it will never be enough. I miss being a mum. It's down to me that I'm not any more. I hold my hands up to all the mistakes and bad decisions I've made, but it's not enough. It will never be enough. It's not just birthdays, but the silly little things, like making up daft songs about what we were having for tea and singing them all the way home from the shops. Or writing teeny tiny letters from the tooth fairy in minuscule writing, thanking them for an incredible tooth and to keep up the good work. That their tooth would be used to help build the fairy kingdom. I miss being a Mum. My memories of my three children are tainted by guilt, filled with shame, saddened by regret. Since the policy came into force, 29 women have been arrested and served with court orders and four have been prosecuted. Two women have been sentenced to jail; one to 14 days, the other to one month, though her sentence was suspended for a year. Five women are currently waiting for a court date. ""Sending them to prison for two weeks won't do anything and it isn't even enough time to provide rehabilitation,"" argues Millie, who served short sentences in prison herself, and would go back on the streets the day she was released. A couple of times a month, Millie goes out at night on a Lighthouse Project bus. Women who board it are given condoms, hot drinks and information on dangerous individuals - passed on by Ugly Mugs, a charity that collects reports of incidents from sex workers and fields them out to warn others. ""They come to unburden their day - they're telling me their problems and they're the same ones I faced,"" says Millie. She commiserates with them on painful anniversaries - the day their children were taken away by social services, or the last time they spoke to their parents. But since Section 222 came into force, women have been more afraid to use outreach services, says Emma Crick, who led the Untold Stories Project. During the day, Hessle Road is a busy shopping street ""Many times when I have been working in evening outreach, police are around and appear to be waiting for the women to get on or off the vehicle so they can target them,"" she says. As a result of the strong police presence, Hull's sex workers have also become more dispersed, making it harder to offer them support services, Crick says. The director of Ugly Mugs, Georgina Perry, says the charity has received just two incident reports for Hull in 2016/17 - well below average for a city of its size. In Nottingham, a similarly-sized city, 35 incidents were reported during the same period, she says. ""What we see in every authority where there is a heavy-handed enforcement approach is that the number of reports [to Ugly Mugs] goes down and the number of women then willing to take it to the police goes down too, because they are frightened about criminalisation,"" she says. Perry brands Hull council's approach to sex workers a ""quick and dirty way of superficially dealing with a problem that is about poverty and deprivation"". You're usually ""sorting somebody out"" [buying their drugs]. I was sorting out my boyfriend, and a couple of his mates. There's always spongers who just soak up everything that they can get hold of, drug-wise. A lot of fellas, they say, ""I'm looking after our lass,"" and, ""I'm looking after my girl."" No they're not! They don't want to miss out, so they need to be there when the punter drops her off. If not, they might not get anything. By contrast, Graham Paddock, anti-social behaviour team leader at Hull City Council, says the ban has ""been a success so far"" and was renewed in December 2016 for another three years. ""We had reports of sexual intercourse in gardens and against fences, so we had to do something to protect the community,"" he says. ""We are never going to stamp out prostitution in Hull entirely, but at the end of the day we have to send a message out that that kind of behaviour will not be tolerated."" Doing sex work is known in Hull as ""going down the lane"", after the former red light district, Waterhouse Lane Residents reported an improvement after the policy based on Section 222 was introduced, he says. But is this a case of ""victimising victims"", as Millie puts it? ""I can see that argument, but I guess our number one responsibility is the local community being affected,"" Paddock replies. He adds that police tactics have changed over time, so that it isn't just the women who are targeted. ""When it first came into place in 2014 we were concentrating a lot on the girls themselves, but it was always intended for anyone - whether it be pimps, partners, boyfriends - so I've noticed there's been a change recently where more punters are actually being served with the orders now."" No men have yet been prosecuted, however. Slum housing on the edge of the red light district has been demolished in recent years, to make way for modern homes A multi-agency group made up of representatives from the police, the council and charities - including the Lighthouse Project - is now meeting to discuss the best way of using Section 222, while also supporting the women involved in sex work. But Millie is frustrated that no-one with experience of sex work has been invited to take part. She thinks she could have made a useful contribution. She would have argued that if the goal is to protect the local community, then the women and most of their clients are also members of the local community. And she would have underlined that they can be helped to find a way out of prostitution. ""The saying 'once a junkie always a junkie' isn't true - you can break free from addiction,"" she says. It wasn't easy - she relapsed many times - but after moving into a hostel and getting the right counselling, she started to claw back control of her life. She remembers the first time she decided not to use her money to buy heroin - she bought a necklace instead. It was a silver cross with her mum's birthstone in it - amethyst. ""I remember the pride I felt - I wasn't used to feeling pride, it was an emotion I'd lost long ago."" Kate's been my ever-patient mentor for all the years I've volunteered for Lighthouse... We continue our walk up the main road of the red light district in Hull, towards the next working girl, stood on the next street corner. The Lighthouse car pulls up in front of us again, playing a crazy game of leap frog with us, keeping Kate and I within sight. Another working girl opens the side door as we arrive at the car. She's in a hurry so she just needs a hot drink and a goody bag, then she's on her way. For the next two hours we stop and talk to every working girl we see. Most we know. Some are new. When the night shift is over and I'm snuggled up under the duvet with my dog curled up behind my knees, my husband breathing rhythmically sleeping beside me, a man who's never once thrown my past in my face, I once again realise how fortunate I am.

"This video can not be played Former office assistant Lisa Rose: Weinstein mentioned a massage as he invited me to another room When Lisa Rose was 22 she got a job with Miramax in London. It was 1988. Before she started, she was given a warning: ""Harvey will answer the door in a towel. He will ask you for a massage. You say no, you ignore him and you make sure you walk away so you're not too close."" Lisa is one of several people to come forward to the BBC with claims ofharassment by the film producer. Harvey Weinstein denies any sexual assault. This is Lisa's story: It was exciting. I'd just left drama school and it felt glamorous. I met producers, gave feedback on films. I went to parties and screenings of Hear My Song and Nasty Girl in Soho with actors, writers, directors. I did admin for Miramax - bookings, calls, scouted a new penthouse in Belsize Park. I delivered a script to Daniel Day-Lewis. I even booked Concorde flights for Harvey. I remember meeting him, feeling like ""oh, I need to make a good impression, maybe he'll get me an acting job"". When he came into town, everything focused on him. It's like you knew this hurricane force was coming for a short period of time and everybody took a deep in breath and then everybody knew that he would be gone in a couple of days. He used to get a different suit tailored for his meetings in London, from under the Savoy hotel, and just leave it in the wardrobe when he left.  I used to think ""what a waste of money"". He'd leave half-empty coke cans all over the place and the room where he slept was left in a total mess. It was disgusting. Everyone became anxious and scared - on tenterhooks because he would rage and shout. People didn't really talk about it - they were just trying to get on. One time in the hotel, he exploded at a casting person - he screamed, shouted, swore. Hours later he told me to send them flowers, to make a big apology. But while he was at meetings, I could sit in the Savoy and order room service. I remember eating chips, looking out of the window, thinking ""oh, wow, this is cushy"". Despite knowing his reputation, I still chose to work there - it was paid well, hours were flexible and it felt like a good job. But I knew things weren't right. When you got taken to the Savoy, you knew that Harvey was there. Then I ended up in a situation with him. I was sent to the hotel in a taxi. They just said, ""you'll work out of the Savoy today"". Everyone was so busy, so I just went and did it - I was answering the phone and ordering things, it all felt very normal. I was alone in the room with him. He asked me for a back rub, to give him a massage. But I had been forewarned - and I said no. Because of the warning I could really focus on getting out of the situation. He huffed and puffed and said, ""well other people do it"". I moved into a suite room immediately - I could see where the door was from there. I was really frightened, my heart was beating, and I was thinking, ""this is what it's like having so much power - he's a man who's got a lot of power"". He didn't touch me. He said nasty things but he didn't touch me. I told friends about it but no-one really said much. People giggled or looked embarrassed, and some said, ""well, that's just something that happens"". Police forces in the US and UK are investigating Harvey Weinstein Every week I wrote a cheque of a whopping Â£900 to a woman, who was supposedly a writer - I knew she wasn't. One woman who worked very closely with him kept a diary detailing all the things going on. When I saw people come in, when I saw someone on his arm in a picture, I thought, ""oh, that poor person"". I resigned. No-one I worked with would consciously put someone in his path. No-one would willingly say ""go be a victim, be prey to this ogre, we'll sacrifice you to him"". But people were scared stiff of him. Do I feel guilty for not reporting anything? Who could I have gone to - the police? Who would have listened? No-one has ever said go report it. Harvey Weinstein: The accusers' stories Why are some women boycotting Twitter? How the scandal unfolded Did everyone really know about Weinstein? I was a little tiny person against a huge corporation. I thought people would laugh or say it didn't happen. He's a scary and big man - a monster. I thought if I say something, I'll never get an acting job because he runs the industry. His amazing talent also made me question if I was wrong. I thought maybe this is just how it is, and I'm not a strong enough woman to play the game. Sexual harassment is shameful, embarrassing, humiliating. You keep it in for many years because you think, why would I want to be reminded of that? Lisa Rose was hoping to make it as an actress in the late 1980s But now all these people are coming forward, and I want to speak out. I want women to be able to to say this is wrong and know that they'll be heard. This is about exposing abuse of power and bullying. It all needs to stop. Holding it all in all these years affected me. I became very cynical about the film industry. It made me think that only certain types of women can survive it, you have to be very tough to put up with things like that. I think I didn't really get on in my acting career because I refused to do what he wanted - I wouldn't play sexy and seductive and do what men wanted, so I wonder sometimes if that's why I didn't go far. I see his picture in the newspapers on the bus and it makes me feel sick. Even now I feel scared. I'm battling that fear that speaking out could hurt me. I wish I had had the chance to pass on a warning, like the one I was given, to people who never got that chance, and who ended up in compromising situations. I could have stopped that happening to other people.

"This video can not be played On some red carpets, Harvey Weinstein is not a welcome subject Harvey Weinstein's brother, Bob, has denied media reports that the film production company they co-founded could be closed or sold. ""Our banks, partners and shareholders are fully supportive of our company,"" he said in a statement. ""Business is continuing as usual."" The company fired Harvey Weinstein on Sunday amid a slew of sexual harassment allegations. The claims have promptedpolice investigations in both the US and UK. On Friday, the scandal surrounding Weinstein - who produced films including Pulp Fiction, Shakespeare in Love and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - deepened when hewas accused of rapeby US actress Rose McGowan. Bob Weinstein co-founded the studio with his brother in 2005 He was already facing claims of rape, sexual assault, groping and harassment. Weinstein, who is believed to be in Europe seeking therapy, has insisted through a spokeswoman that any sexual contacts he had were consensual. Harvey Weinstein: The accusers' stories What it was like to work for Weinstein How the scandal unfolded Since the avalanche of claims began, the company has been trying to disassociate itself from its co-founder and save the business, reports say, with efforts made to buy Harvey Weinstein out, rebrand and keep creative partners on board. But reports in the Los Angeles Times said that financers had begun to pressure the company to sell and potential buyers were circling. The Wall Street Journal also reported the company was ""exploring a sale or shutdown"" and was ""unlikely to continue as an independent entity"". The Weinstein Company fired Harvey Weinstein last weekend, but there remains intense speculation about its future The company is thought to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars but before the recent allegations had already faced questions about its future prospects amid increasing competition from media streaming services. Investment bank Goldman Sachs said on Friday it was investigating options to sell the small stake it holds, citing the reported ""inexcusable behaviour"". On Saturday, the organisers of the Oscars film awardswill hold emergency talksamid speculation it could suspending Harvey Weinstein's membership. Bafta, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts,has already done so. The New York Times broke the story on 5 October whenit detailed decades of allegations,externalof sexual harassment against Weinstein.

"This video can not be played Adama Jammeh was led out of the store by police officers shortly before 15:00 BST A sacked security guard's 21-hour protest in the roof space of a Tesco store has ended after he received a letter to review his dismissal. Adama Jammeh climbed onto the girders above the checkouts in Tesco Extra, Reading,on Thursday evening. In a series of Facebook videos, the 46-year-old said he was sacked after being wrongly accused of stealing. In its letter, Tesco said evidence suggested Mr Jammeh may have suffered ""a significant injustice"". The former guard was led out of the store by police shortly before 15:00 BST. He was arrested on suspicion of public order offences, a Thames Valley Police spokesman said. Mr Jammeh came down after his wife told him he had received a letter from Tesco Shoppers had been told to abandon their trolleys and leave the store as Mr Jammeh climbed to the roof, with police confirming they had received reports concerning ""the welfare of a man"". He claimed he was falsely accused of stealing electrical goods worth Â£20,000 by the supermarket chain, which led to his sacking by security firm Total Security Services (TSS). The father-of-two has spent the past six months staging a one-man protest outside the Portman Road store with banners. Mr Jammeh, originally from Gambia, said he had not slept and barely eaten since starting the protest at 18:00 on Thursday, and that he would only come down if Tesco issued an apology. This video can not be played Adama Jammeh told the BBC ""every day I'm more angry"" Mr Jammeh ended the protest after his wife told him he had received a letter from the supermarket saying the ""circumstances of the situation"" that led to his dismissal and protest would be ""reviewed"". It added: ""No formal proceedings involving yourself have been instigated which supports your view that you have been the subject of a significant injustice."" Mr Jammeh had earlier said he was ""stressed and angry"" and he was protesting because Tesco had ""ignored"" him. A TSS spokesperson said it had been aware of the incident and had been assisting police and Tesco. Thames Valley Police is yet to respond to claims of Mr Jammeh's innocence.

"The chancellor has labelled the European Union's Brexit negotiators as ""the enemy"" - a remark he subsequently described as a ""poor choice of words"". During a television interview, Philip Hammond also called the negotiators ""the opponents"" and said they should ""behave like grown-ups"". But he tweeted later: ""I was making the point that we are united at home. I regret I used a poor choice of words."" Mr Hammond is in Washington for an International Monetary Fund meeting. He has been criticised for saying that the Brexit process has created uncertainty, and this week a former chancellor claimed he was trying to sabotage the talks. During a series of media interviews in Washington, Mr Hammond told Sky News that ""passions are high"" in the party ""but we are all going to the same place"". But he added: ""The enemy, the opponents, are out there on the other side of the table. Those are the people that we have to negotiate with to get the very best deal for Britain."" Despite his regrets, Mr Hammond's comments drew fire from political opponents. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said it was an ""inept approach from a failing government. Insulting the EU is not the way to protect our economic interests"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

During his interviews, the chancellor also has described as ""bizarre"" and ""absurd"" accusations he is talking down the economy. Mr Hammond said he was a realist and that he wanted to ""protect and prepare"" the economy for the challenges ahead. The chancellor said: ""It is absurd to pretend that the process we are engaged in hasn't created some uncertainty. But the underlying economy remains robust. ""I am committed to delivering a Brexit deal that works for Britain,"" he added. He refused to answer how he would vote if another referendum was held now. ""We've had the referendum,"" he said. ""You know how I voted in it."" This week, former Conservative Chancellor Nigel Lawson called for Mr Hammond to be sacked, saying he was unhelpful to the Brexit process. Lord Lawson said: ""What he [Mr Hammond] is doing is very close to sabotage"". Responding to these comments, Mr Hammond said: ""Lord Lawson is entitled to his view on this and many other subjects and isn't afraid to express it, but I think he's wrong."" The chancellor, who has been accused of being too pessimistic about Brexit, told the Treasury Committee of MPs this week that a ""cloud of uncertainty"" over the outcome of negotiations was ""acting as a dampener"" on the economy. But speaking on Friday, Mr Hammond said he was optimistic about the UK's economic future and was in Washington to promote it. ""What I'm doing here in Washington is talking Britain up, talking about Britain's future as a champion of free trade in the global economy, seeking further moves on liberalisation on trade in services which will hugely benefit our economy."" He added that Britain had ""a very bright future ahead"", but added that it was ""undoubtedly true"" that the process of negotiations had created uncertainty for business. ""If you talk to businesses, they would like us to get it done quickly so that they know clearly what our future relationship with the European Union is going to look like."" Mr Hammond said the Cabinet was united behind Prime Minister Theresa May's recent speech in Florence setting out her Brexit plans. ""We know what our proposal is, we put it on the table effectively. Now we want the European Union to engage with itâ¦ challenge usâ¦ but let's behave like grown-ups."" he said. Mr Hammond said the government would not spend taxpayers' money preparing for a ""no-deal"" Brexit until the ""very last moment"". He said he would not take money from budgets for other areas such as health or education just to ""send a message"" to the EU. One former minister, David Jones, has said billions of pounds should be set aside in November's Budget for a ""no deal"" scenario. He argued that if this did not happen it would be seen as a ""a sign of weakness"" by EU leaders, who would think the UK was not serious about leaving the EU without a deal.

"Where can you afford to live in the UK - and is it cheaper to rent or buy? Try our calculator to see where in the country suits your finances. Choose rent or buy, how many rooms you want the property to have and how much you'd like to pay each month. If you're buying, you also need to enter your deposit, as you won't get a mortgage without one. This interactive content requires an internet connection and a modern browser. Viewaffordability data by UK region Viewaffordability data by local authority area The national average is This calculator assumes you need a deposit of at least 5% of the value of the property to get a mortgage. The average deposit

                                        The prices are based on the local market. If there are 100 properties of the right size in an area and they are placed in price order with the cheapest first, the âlow-endâ of the market will be the 25th property, ""mid-priced"" is the 50th and ""high-endâ will be the 75th. The map also shows which end of the local market matches your budget - so you might only be able to afford something towards the lower end of the market inBathbut your budget could stretch to property at the higher end of the market inShropshire, for example. If you are struggling to find a property you can afford, you may have to increase your deposit.  The average deposit for first-time buyers in the UK is Â£54,770, according to March 2020 data from theCouncil of Mortgage Lenders,external. First-time buyers inLondonare looking at an average deposit of around Â£150,762, almost three times the national average. Whereas, inWales,ScotlandandNorthern Ireland, first-time buyers need to find deposits of around Â£25,000-Â£30,000. The ""Where can I afford to live?"" calculator uses pricing and rental data for the 12 months up to the end of June 2020 provided by residential property analystsHometrack,external. There is not enough recent data available to show figures for Northern Ireland Monthly mortgage payments are based on the figures calculated by the Bank of England from rates currently being offered by banks and building societies. The rate used is for two year, fixed rate mortgages, so would only be relevant for the first two years of the loan. Every month, the Bank of England brings out figures for people wanting a mortgage for 75% or 90% or 95% of the value of the property they want to buy. So currently the calculator assumes you need a deposit of at least 5% of the value of the property to get a mortgage. House prices are based on sales recorded by the Land Registry and Registers of Scotland plus Red Book mortgage valuation - where a surveyor has valued a property for the purpose of mortgage lending. Is rent cheaper in the next street? Where does rent hit young people the hardest? Number of middle-aged renters doubles Rents are based on monthly prices being asked for by landlords. The average rent in the UK is about Â£951, according toHomelet,external. You may find that the map suggests you can't afford to live where you are living now - but this might be because the price of property in your area and interest rates have changed since you got your mortgage. If you were trying to get a mortgage to buy your house today, you might need a bigger deposit and larger monthly payments. If there are fewer than 25 properties matching your criteria in an area, it will come up with ""no data"". Figures based on a smaller number of properties would be unreliable.

"Stillbirth is rarely spoken about. But insights from those who have navigated the heartbreaking experience can help parents come to terms with their grief. A new website, Stillbirth Stories, which collects detailed interviews with mothers, fathers and clinicians, has been launched to coincide with Baby Loss Awareness Week. It aims to nurture a conversation about a once-taboo subject. Here are extracts of some of those stories. ""There was a cold cot that I could put Jannah in. She could stay overnight. And that was really lovely - it was special."" At 41 weeks, Rabia went into labour. But in hospital, she and David were told there was no heartbeat. Jannah was stillborn. The couple were able to stay with their baby for two days in the hospital's bereavement suite. David recalls the time they spent together as a family: ""I was with her for two days in the hospital - they were absolutely amazing, what they did. They had their own bereavement suite, so you [could have] your own time with the baby. I never let Jannah be on her own at any moment. I wanted someone always with her - even though I knew she had gone. But I always felt that she had the right to be loved for those days - to be hugged and kissed and whatever, and not left alone. Like a baby. ""The bereavement suite had a double bed, so I could stay as well. It was like us three sleeping together. It was quite nice to have her with us as part of our family. We spent a lot of quality time with her [there]. We talked to her, made lots of videos, lots of photography, and tried to keep as much memory of her as [we] could. I don't know if it's odd or not, but I looked at every little part of her, right down to between her toes. ""I've got somewhere I can go, and I know she's there. I can put flowers on her grave - but it's not the same."" Alexis was stillborn at term. It was 1963 and neither Marjorie nor her husband, Alex, were allowed to see, or hold, their baby. It would be another 50 years before they found out where she had been buried. ""I knew Alex had to go and register the baby. I must have said to him: 'What are they going to do with her?' And he just said: 'Well, you know, they're going to have her buried.' We went to the hospital at one point and asked where she was, and they just said that she had been buried somewhere in Stockport, in one of the cemeteries. ""I'd started to have more children, and it was, you know, one day we will find her. Until the day came that we did go and look for her. ""We went to the big crematorium in Stockport, and they sent us to the central library. They said everything was on microfilm, and we looked through it and we found two burials around the time Alexis would have been taken there. She was born on the 15th [of April], there was just this one buried on the 17th - a girl of 31. And underneath it said: ""Stillborn"". So I knew they'd put a stillborn in the grave. And that's when we went back to the cemetery. I saw a different lady, and she said: 'Oh did they not get the little book out for you? We have a little book for all the stillborn babies.' She brought it, and it was there, and she gave us a grave number."" Stillbirth Stories,externalis a collection of honest interviews from parents and and those who have worked with them. Besides offering emotional support, the site is a learning resource for clinicians. The project is supported byWellcome,external. Why don't people talk more about stillbirths? ""We went to look for it, and couldn't find it. There was no stone, it was just grass. Eventually, I did ask if I could put something on [the grave]. They said: 'No. The grave belongs to somebody, it's registered to somebody. You can put flowers on, but no, you can't put anything else on.' So, for a while, I just bought something that you could stick in the grass and put flowers on. Then I got a bit angry about it. I've had a proper stone flowerpot with her name put on it. ""Over the other side [of the cemetery] is where all the babies are buried. And that haunts me - to think that she was just put in a grave with somebody that I don't know. I just hope and pray it never happens to anybody else, because it's one of the cruellest things you can do to a couple. I know I can go there and put flowers on for her, but it's not the same."" ""I bathed him for the funeral, which you do in Muslim culture."" Mohammed was stillborn at 27 weeks gestation. Parents Shazia and Omar decided to bury their baby according to the Muslim faith. Shazia says the hospital midwife appreciated the need to have the body released for the funeral as quickly as possible, and helped with the process. It was Omar who performed the Ghusl - or ritual bath - for the funeral. ""So it was just me and him, and a priest. That was the time, I guess, it was just us two. ""That was the toughest part of all of this for me. That's where, you know, you're sort of past the birth and it's the day of the burial, and the funeral. It's a duty that you need to do. At that time, I guess, religion sort of took on a different aspect for me. ""And it was this grief that actually cemented my religion a little bit: maturing and going through that experience, learning what you do when, when it's your responsibility for the funeral. That point where I was bathing him, was the point where I was close to totally breaking down. But I soldiered through - for want of a better phrase. ""Something that I'm proud of, is that me and Shazia made it through it, having seen some really, really low, low times, to where we are now."" At the time of interview Shazia and Omar had recently had their fourth child. ""I just want people to understand it's much more common than they think. There's like over 300 babies a month stillborn."" Guy was stillborn on 13 November 2015 at 25 weeks and five days, to parents Sam and Martin. ""We had a couple of close friends we'd told at the time [when Guy died]. I just physically couldn't even speak to get the words out to tell people. ""Once he was born, we just decided to use Facebook. We thought that is the quickest way to get the message out there and not have to speak to anybody really. ""I got such an overwhelming response from that. So many people messaged me privately to say that they'd had similar experiences; that they'd had losses, various stages, and that was - I want to say comforting, to know that there were other people out there. But I wondered why nobody had ever said anything. And even then, they were posting it privately to me and I thought, well, tell people. ""It was nice to know that they'd opened up and they'd gone on to have their own children, and were trying to put that little bit of hope out to us. ""People sharing their stories is the biggest help, the biggest comfort - because a lot of people will shy away from it. ""The thing about meeting people online, is that you don't know if they're who they say they are. But these were all genuine people sharing their stories. I ended up meeting a few [of them] at a memorial service. A couple of the girls that I was following were going, so we said we'd meet up there, just to put faces to the names, and the stories. Over the last few months, I've just found my own little group of friends ""I've put [Guy's] story out there quite a lot. I've done a lot of fundraising, mostly for Tommy's. Then we've done some for Aching Arms, because they're the charities we feel have helped us the most."" ""We had like a little selection of little knitted dresses, little gowns that a woman had made via a charity"" Petal was born at 23 weeks and 6 days of pregnancy to Aimee and Marc.  In the UK, the definition of 'stillborn' is a baby born with no signs of life at 24 or more weeks of gestation. Had Petal been born one day later she would have been legally 'stillborn'. ""Before I was induced, the bereavement midwife come round and she gave us a selection of clothes that Petal could have to wear. She was too small for babygros and things. We'd bought blankets and dolls and things for her [the day before], but none of the clothes would fit her. We had a selection of little knitted dresses, little gowns that a woman had made via a charity. It was really personal to be able to pick something for Petal to wear. So, when I delivered her, Marc bathed her and then dressed her in a little purple, pink gown, with a little hat and gloves. ""It was precious. It's all we have of her. That's the memory that I have of her that feels real - that she was really here. ""She was classed as a late miscarriage instead of a stillbirth. If she would have been born 22 hours later, I would have been able to register her and she would have had her own death certificate. We don't have any legal documentation for her. ""Sometimes I feel like that because she doesn't have a death certificate, she never existed. ""Since I lost Petal, I felt that people pitied me because of that experience, but I don't want to be defined as the mother who lost a child. I'm also a mother of three healthy children as well, who just wants to say that there is help out there for bereaved parents to carry on.""

"Freshers' fair? Maureen, a 79-year-old law student, says she had a great time socialising What does a student look like? Forget the stereotypes. Think of diversity in a different way. And meet some of the country's oldest undergraduates. Maureen Matthews is starting a three-year law degree at the tender age of 79. She's not even the oldest student on her new course at the University of West London in Brentford. Sitting next to her in lectures is 84-year-old Craigan Surujballi. This isn't dabbling in learning with an evening course - it's an intensive, full-time degree, studying alongside people with ambitions to become lawyers. ""You may look at me and see an older face - as may many young people,"" says Maureen. Craigan and Maureen have begun a three year, full-time law degree ""But through my eyes I'm experiencing the same aspirations that I had before. ""It's always been to engage in involving myself in education,"" she says. Maureen says older people should not be intimidated by the prospect of learning in an environment traditionally associated with the young. Think of the law school film Legally Blonde, but in terms of overturning ageism rather than sexism. ""All older people are capable of being up for a challenge. They've been through life where they've had to meet many challenges,"" says Maureen. If there are practical problems, such as mobility, she says they are never insurmountable and help is available. The law class at the University of West London has a much wider variety of ages than usual ""I would say to older people, recognise the fact that your hearing may have decreased, your eyesight may not be as good as it was before, maybe you can't use the computer very well, but think about strategies that will enable you."" This extended to taking part in the freshers' week events for new students, which she says gave her a chance to socialise with other new students at the university. But this is not a sugar-coated story. Craigan came to England from the Caribbean in the early 1960s, after a long journey by sea. Forget your stereotypes about age, says Millie Mbabazi: ""It is literally just me, but older."" He says it was a time of much discrimination, in housing and work, but he had a deep hunger to keep studying and educating himself. He was in his 30s before he studied for his A-levels - but his ambition to become a lawyer eluded him. At least until now. Even if he doesn't get to practise as a lawyer, he says he might be able to help with legal problems at a Citizens Advice office. When about half of young people now go into higher education, it's easy to forget how much university was once out of reach for the vast majority of people. Law lecturer Mike Derks says the different age groups fit together ""seamlessly"" In the 1950s, when Craigan and Maureen were in their 20s, there were fewer than 20,000 student places each year. Even though the number of older students has increased, it's still only a relatively tiny number grabbing this second chance to learn. The most recent figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency show there were 25 students starting full-time undergraduate degrees after the age of 70, out of a cohort of almost half a million. However, the fees system is in many ways more generous to older students. There is no upper age limit on loans to cover tuition fees - and with repayments based on earnings, it's unlikely that many pensioners will ever pay back what they have borrowed. ""It's crazy how much they know,"" says Patrice Murdoch, impressed by her older classmates The University of West London is unusual in the extent of the diversity of its intake. This is a long way from the Pimms and ivy-clad-buildings end of higher education. Almost three-quarters of students here are over the age of 21 when they enter. It has one of the highest proportions of state school pupils - 98% - and more than half of students are from ethnic minorities and from families where no-one has previously been to university. The university has other students beginning degree courses at a time of life when some of their age group would be thinking about early retirement. Rita is also studying law - and is a university student at the same time as two of her daughters. Rita says she wants to study law to help women in her community She wants to study law because of the injustices she says she has seen facing women in her community, particularly over issues such as domestic violence. Clifford, sitting with her in the university cafe, worked when his son was going through university. Now it's his turn and he wants to be able to understand the law so that he can stand up for people more effectively as a union representative. Law lecturer Mike Derks says the range of ages ""fit together quite seamlessly"". Clifford is taking his chance at university, after seeing his son getting a degree Teaching older students is very rewarding. ""They seem to get more out of it.  It's unusual, but they're still very engaged."" But what do the young students make of finding themselves alongside classmates old enough to be their grandparents? ""At first it was quite weird. But it was actually quite good, because you admire them,"" says Patrice Murdoch. Omar Idrees says the determination of older students to learn is an inspiration ""It shows you can start education at any age and you can always go back. It's crazy how much they know. It makes us look not so up with it,"" she says. ""If anything I feel it's inspirational that they can come back into education and they always seem to have more knowledge,"" said Millie Mbabazi. ""I don't have any negative stereotypes about older people. It is literally just me, but older."" Omar Idrees says: ""Maureen and Craigan are an inspiration to all of us. ""They've proved to us that no matter how old you are, no matter what life has put you through, you can walk in and say, 'This is what I've always wanted to do. I'm still young, I can still do it.'""

"Lewis Hamilton during the Japan F1 Grand Prix Next weekend Britain's Lewis Hamilton could secure his fourth Formula One title at the United States Grand Prix. His Mercedes team is a staggering 145 points ahead of arch-rivals Ferrari despite the sport introducing rules this year which aimed to put the brakes on the dominance of a single outfit. They came at a hefty cost. The new regulations were designed to make for closer racing by increasing aerodynamic and mechanical grip through the introduction of wider tyres and wings. According to one of the teams it has ""rewritten"" the rulebook and the impact is just as noticeable off track as on it. But if some had hoped the rules might stop Mercedes from running away with the F1 championship they will have been disappointed. Ironically, they have also forced up its rivals' costs. Only the frontrunners have had the resources to foot the bill from their cashflow whilst one of the outfits lower down the grid even had to get a driver to cover the cost. Research has revealed that new regulations fuelled a Â£167.6m increase in the F1 teams' costs in 2016. They rose 14.5% to hit a combined Â£1.3bn - the highest-ever total recorded in the sport. F1 cars are designed the year before they race so the bulk of the investment in them is paid for then, too. It means that the cost of this year's campaign is reflected in the teams' 2016 accounts and the final one of them was filed last week. Eight of F1's ten teams have to file publicly-available accounts - the only exceptions are Ferrari as its outfit is run by the car manufacturer itself, and Swiss-based Sauber where firms don't have to release their finances. The costs of the teams' operating companies came to an average of Â£165.9m in 2016, topped by Northamptonshire-based Mercedes which spent Â£274.9m excluding the investment in its engines. F1 teams' costs rose 14.5% to hit Â£1.3bn last year It is the highest ever total recorded on the accounts of a British F1 team and even eclipses the turbocharged spending levels before the 2008 economic crash which drove Toyota and Honda out of the sport. At the other end of the spectrum is last year's new entrant Haas F1 which spent a third as much as the championship leaders. Haas has managed to keep its costs down by taking advantage of a new rule allowing teams to buy in more parts than before. Haas uses a Ferrari engine with a chassis created by Italian manufacturer Dallara which also makes the cars for the F2 junior series. Relying on suppliers reduces research and development expenditure which, along with staffing and engine costs, is one of their biggest costs - it rose across the board in 2016 as teams had to design cars to meet the new regulations. They were introduced by F1's governing body the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) to address criticism that the outcome of races was clear before they started due to the dominance of Mercedes. Haas has kept costs down by buying in more parts than before With Hamilton at the wheel it has won both the constructors' and the drivers' championship for the past three years running. This year is set to be no different but there has been a far higher price to pay. Writing in the introduction to its accounts Mercedes' team boss Toto Wolff notes that there has been ""an increase of Â£27.9m in operating costs mainly due to the impact of technical regulation changes and movement in foreign exchange rates"". The 2016 accounts for Force India, also based in Northamptonshire, give more insight into the effort required to meet the new rules. It says that combined with the change in tyre-sizes ""our traditional method of retaining 50% of the previous season's car and updating the remaining 50% is not possible for 2017"". Over 90% of Force India's car this year is completely new. Force India has helped cover its increased costs with cash from driver Nikita Mazepin The team planned to cover its increased costs with income from an unlikely source: a driver contract signed with Russian youngster, Nikita Mazepin, ""secured a cash injection ahead of significant regulation changes ahead of the 2017 season"", said Force India. Mazepin was just 16 when he signed up last year and he has tested for the team twice since then, most recently in July after the Hungarian Grand Prix. He has ample resources to pay as his father Dmitry became a billionaire through owning the mineral fertiliser producer Uralchem. Despite this, Force India still chalked up a net loss of Â£11.6m -  the largest of any team in 2016. The regulation changes even dented the bottom line of British manufacturing giant McLaren. Its  went from a net Â£3.4m profit in 2015 to an after-tax loss of Â£3.2m the following year. For F1 teams, victory on the track is more important than making a profit Overall the teams made a combined net loss of Â£2m last year. Perhaps surprisingly this is nothing new as unlike most businesses, profit is not the barometer of success in F1. Instead teams judge their performance on racing results and tend to spend all of their income on this in a bid for victory. Some even pump in more than they make, with additional funds usually coming from owners' pockets or debt. The theory is that it is better to win and make no profit than make money and finish low in the standings. Victory on track increases a team's ability to bring in more sponsorship,, as brands are prepared to pay more to be associated with a winner. The teams' revenue generally comes from three sources with two providing the lion's share. They are fuelled by F1's huge television audience (390m viewers last year). The first key revenue source is sponsorship which comprises around a third of the teams' revenue, Another third comes from prize money. F1's parent company, which is owned by American investment firm Liberty Media, pays the teams around 66% of its annual profits as prize money and it came to $985.5m (Â£742m) in 2016. Despite numerous failed attempts there are new proposals to introduce a budget cap for F1 teams Payments from owners represent around half of the teams' remaining revenue and the marketing benefit from the exposure on TV compensates for this investment. If costs increase these payments often rise to compensate and last year Red Bull poured in four times more money into its flagship team. Its investment into Red Bull Racing hit Â£40.6m as costs surged 9.2% to Â£197m. As its owner has deep pockets Red Bull Racing doesn't need to rely on drivers who pay but income from them is the remaining source of revenue for F1 teams. They are a hallmark of teams at the bottom of the grid but their days could be numbered. Despite numerous failed attempts F1 hasn't given up on introducing a budget cap and recent reports suggest that Liberty Media will shortly present plans to the teams for introduction in 2021 when their current race contracts expire. But it will be the sport's governing body, the FIA, that will ultimately decide on any changes A limit of Â£114m has been suggested and this would level the playing field as the smallest teams are already below this whilst the frontrunners would have to scale back. Although it may seem like a logical direction for the sport to go in it would make the recent boost in spending seem all the more pointless.

"They seek it here, they seek it there - but the centrepiece of the government's Brexit legislation, the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, seems to have gone into hiding. Most Westminster observers expected the Commons to embark on eight days of detailed debate, in Committee of the Whole House, pretty much as soon as their conference recess was over. Eyebrows were raised when it was not on this week's agenda - and they shot skywards when it was not put on the agenda for next week. It is not a postponement, because the committee stage has never been scheduled, but something seems to be afoot. EU 'to prepare for trade talks' Barnier: Brexit negotiations deadlocked What might it be? Challenged in Commons business questions by the SNP's Pete Wishart, Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom noted that MPs had proposed more than 300 amendments and 54 new clauses to the Bill and these were being studied by ministers. And there is little doubt that some of these pose a real threat to the government's tenuous Commons majority. The threat-in-chief is posed by amendments from the Conservative former attorney general, Dominic Grieve, to limit ministers' powers to re-write the law in the process of enacting Brexit. Remember, this Bill is designed to allow the government to reprocess four decades of accumulated EU law into British law, so that the UK has functional legislation on all kinds of crucial areas, come Brexit Day. The powers are pretty sweeping, because the Bill provides a toolkit to build an edifice which has not yet been designed - and Mr Grieve's amendments express the qualms of some MPs (including those of many strong Brexiteers) about their extent. He is the man most likely to amend. I suspect the government is already whispering to him, behind the scenes, to produce an appropriate compromise, probably with the helpful endorsement of the Commons Procedure Select Committee behind it. Was that the PM's bag-carrier, Seema Kennedy, I spotted in the public galler, when Mr Grieve set out his stall in evidence to the Procedure Committee on Wednesday? If ministers can craft a compromise amendment, via ProcCom, face can be saved and division averted. But with plenty more amendments still raining down, Mr Grieve is not the only threat. A recent addition is an amendment co-signed by the Nottinghamshire axis of Conservative ex-chancellor Ken Clarke and Labour's arch-Europhile, Chris Leslie. This is a cunning production which takes the PM's commitment to a transition from full EU membership to Brexit, made in her Florence speech, and seeks to put it on the face of the Bill. It follows her words precisely. But the killer point is that, if there's no transition, then a fresh act would be required to trigger Brexit day. In other words, if no transition, then they must come back and ask Parliament ""what next?"" Now the government is not legislating against the clock as it was on the Article 50 Bill, when it was racing to get the measure through Commons and Lords before the end of the last Parliamentary year. But its schedule is clearly slipping a little. Next week is to be devoted to a little humdrum legislation, an opposition day debate and backbench business - that leaves seven debating weeks before Parliament embarks on its Christmas recess. Take out one week to debate the Budget, and another for the November mini-half term (when a lot of select committee visits have been scheduled) and you have six weeks in which to cram the promised eight committee stage days devoted to the Bill, and the minimum of two days needed for report stage and third reading. Not impossible - but it does make for a packed Parliamentary programme, with little room for anything else. There is rising speculation that the continuing delay in getting going reflects ministerial indecision about how to handle the amendments to the Bill - although another theory is that the government is waiting until next week's European summit is done, in the hope that it can firm up the terms of a possible transitional arrangement.

"As allegations ofsexual assaultmount up against Harvey Weinstein, his wife of 10 years has left him. British fashion designer Georgina Chapman said her ""heart breaks"" for all the women who suffered pain because of him. The Hollywood producer's been accused of inappropriate behaviour by a number of actresses, including Angelina Jolie and Gwyneth Paltrow. And now the scandal is hitting his wife's fashion label Marchesa - a favourite with stars on the red carpet. Celebrity fashion stylist Alex Longmore told Newsbeat: ""If any celebrity is seen wearing Marchesa at the moment, it's almost like they're slightly supporting what's gone on before. ""Harvey got his leading ladies like Jennifer Lawrence and Nicole Kidman to wear Marchesa. It was a statement and Georgina's brand kind of went hand in hand with Harvey's."" Georgina Chapman is a co-founder of Marchesa, which launched in 2004 - the same year she started her relationship with Weinstein. The label's dresses cost thousands of pounds and are very popular on red carpet premieres at events like the Oscars and the Golden Globes. Harvey Weinstein was often seen on the front row at Marchesa fashion shows. Mandy Moore (second left), Harvey Weinstein, and Anna Wintour attend the Marchesa fashion show during New York Fashion Week 2017 Alex Longmore, who's styled the likes of Little Mix and Emma Bunton, believes actresses in Hollywood may no longer want to wear Marchesa because ""they will not want anything to do with Harvey, his entourage or his family"". The celebrity stylist met Georgina Chapman in London and told Newsbeat: ""She works very hard. Up until now, her and her business partner have been clever with how they've marketed their brand."" Rita Ora is often seen in Marchesa. She starred in Southpaw alongside Jake Gyllenhaal, which was produced by the Weinstein Company. Others who have worn the label include Selena Gomez and the Duchess of Cambridge. The Duchess of Cambridge has worn Marchesa in the past So how will the allegations against Weinstein affect the Marchesa brand? Helzberg Diamonds introduces Marchesa engagement rings range,external An American jewellery company was due to produce a range with Marchesa but in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter, Helzberg Diamonds said: ""The company is not launching the Marchesa brand at this time."" The diamonds are still available on Helzberg's website but without the name Marchesa. Marchesa has also postponed its Spring Summer 2018 preview. Tyra Banks, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West attend a Marchesa fashion show in 2013 Brand strategist Andi Davids told Newsbeat that Marchesa needs to do damage control and ""make clear that they don't condone his [Weinstein's] behaviour"". ""Her brand started to take off right around the same time as their relationship. ""But if it comes out that she didn't know about these types of allegations, people would actually support her as a potential victim as well."" Newsbeat contacted Marchesa which declined to comment.

"Jameela Jamil stars as Tahana Al-Jamil in the US comedy set in the afterlife Jameela Jamil is in a good place right now. Well, she is - quite literally - in The Good Place, the hit sitcom set in the afterlife that's just reached the UK. Her major role as Tahani Al-Jamil in the show, also starring Cheers star Ted Danson and Frozen's Kristen Bell, has seen her hailed for her comic timing and on-screen presence. She's writing a book and there's a film role on the cards. All this from someone who had never acted before and was previously best known for co-hosting Channel 4 teen show T4 and then BBC Radio 1's chart show. We FaceTimed her to find out about all of the above - as well as finding out why she's a ""weasel"", who she based the ""narcissistic nightmare"" Tahani on and her plans to become US president. Jameela hosted T4 on the Beach with Rick Edwards (left) and Nick Grimshaw ""Wait - is that Jameela Jamil from T4??"" That's a pretty standard question on Twitter from British viewers who are just getting hooked on NBC show The Good Place, screened on Netflix here, and surprised to find a familiar face on the screen. While it launched in the US a year ago, the first series landed in the UK in one go last month with little fanfare, with new episodes in the second series coming every week. ""It's been really cool to watch it unravel,"" she says. ""Because the UK only got the show this year, everyone probably thought I was dead. But I got very lucky."" Very lucky is a bit of an understatement. She moved to LA with no plans to act, but instead ""to read and DJ and maybe just do a radio show again"" and ""travel around"". ""I just wanted to see more of the world and experience new things and make the most of my youth."" Jameela stars alongside Cheers star Ted Danson in the sitcom But it seems the world had other plans, starting with her very first audition for what would turn out to be The Good Place, but all she was told that Mike Schur from Parks and Recreation was behind it. ""I was told about an audition for this role and said 'no way, I've no training and I'm surrounded by people who've devoted their lives to this'. ""My agents pushed me into it and said 'let's see if you can act, if you can't act we won't send you to another one'."" The audition was ""very cloak and daggers"". All she knew was that the character was British, because the team wanted a cast that was ""as diverse and different as possible"". ""I hoped it wouldn't turn out to be a porno,"" she jokes. ""But he [Mike Schur] seemed not to be into that. I don't think there's anyone else in Hollywood I'd have trusted to sign up for, when it was so secretive."" She was so amazed to get a second audition, she thought ""all the actresses in Hollywood must have flu"". Incidentally when she got the phone call, at 10pm on a Friday night, she was in the middle of an ""anxiety walk"" while waiting to hear about the role. She was so overwhelmed to get the part that she had to lie down. In the middle of the pavement. In the middle of West Hollywood. Jameela, second right in the back row with her fellow cast members, can't believe her luck ""I've never been so floored. I mean, I've started my first acting job opposite Ted Danson and Kristen Bell,"" she says. ""I'm a top-level blagger. I feel like my whole career has been one giant blag."" The show centres on Eleanor Shellstrop, played by Bell, a more-naughty-than-nice woman who, having accidentally ended up in heaven (aka The Good Place), tries to earn her place there by being good. This version of heaven doesn't have fluffy clouds and angels playing the harp, but instead, flying lessons, houses designed to reflect your personality, and lots of frozen yoghurt shops. Seriously, they're everywhere. She says her ""mind was blown"" when she finally learned what The Good Place was about. ""The whole thing has been bananas,"" she adds, sounding not quite as posh as Tahani. ""Absolutely terrifying. There's not been a day I've not been going - 'that's Ted Danson, that's Ted Danson'. ""The first season was surreal. I was taking a golf buggy through Universal every day, seeing parts of the Jurassic Park set and knowing Friends was filmed in that lot. ""I managed to somehow take it in my stride. When I left on the last day, I said a very casual goodbye, and 'it's all right if you don't bring me back'. And then I burst into tears and cried all the way home."" Jameela says comedies were a ""lifeline"" when she was ill Asked what was so overwhelming, she explains that when she was 17 she was hit by a car and didn't leave her house in more than a year. ""All I had to keep me company was NBC comedies. They kept me sane in the darkest times of my life. ""I could never have foreseen getting my life back to normal - let alone being in one of these sitcoms that had been so therapeutic and soothing to me, and hopefully soothing people myself. ""These comedies were my lifeline, and now it's gone full circle."" And there are weird coincidences. Ted Danson - who plays Michael, the otherworldly being who designed The Good Place - was one of those comedy actors she'd watch, in Cheers, and Kristen Bell was her first celebrity interviewee on T4. ""It was too much to bear,"" she says of her meltdown. ""I was hysterical. I felt completely traumatised at how lucky I was."" Tahani may look sweet, but is ""passive agressive"" and a ""nightmare"", says Jameela Jameela describes Tahani - who is Eleanor's neighbour and, to her annoyance, lives in a mansion and is ever so slightly condescending - as a ""passive aggressive, well-intentioned narcissistic nightmare"". ""I based her quite heavily on someone I know who's a narcissistic nightmare - and now I'm really afraid because it's on in the UK. ""I was told it would never be shown in the UK so I felt quite safe, like the weasel I am,"" she says. ""Now I'm afraid to come back."" She says she worried British viewers knew her too well. ""I fully expected hesitation,"" she says. ""I didn't expect people to give me a chance."" She also promises some ""insane cameos"" coming up and reveals exclusively: ""I get to kiss someone on the show. The first one on screen, and the seventh ever for me."" Jameela with fellow The Good Place cast members (l-r) William Jackson Harper, Kristen Bell and Manny Jacinto It looks like there may well be a third series, says Jameela, who signed a seven-year contract for the show meaning she'll be in Hollywood for the foreseeable future. She says she finds America has ""a very healthy attitude to women, and women of colour"". And it seems she has taken to America as much as it has taken to her - she admits she initially expected to see headlines like: ""English woman ruins sitcom"". So what does she put her success down to? ""I'm not ambitious, but I'm very tenacious,"" she says. ""I never think I'll get something, but I'm willing to try. ""That's my victory, the willingness to give it a go. Everything else is cake."" She's waiting to hear about a film role and is writing a book, based on thecolumns she wrote for Company magazine,external. Life seems pretty good, but what else is next? ""Will I be president in three years, will I realise a rap album?"" she teases. ""Who knows? It feels like the opportunities are endless.""

"A difficult and disgusting operation to clear London's largest ""fatberg"" from a London sewer raises a number of issues about our approach to waste disposal. Fatbergs are not natural - they are creatures of the modern age - and the blockages they cause can lead to raw sewage flowing up into shops, offices and people's homes. It is not a subject for the faint-hearted but there are 10 large fatbergs in London right now and hundreds of smaller ones across the country. They form when oil and grease, poured down drains, coagulates around the likes of tampons, baby wipes and condoms flushed down toilets. The result is the creation of a pale, tough substance with the strength of rock - a form of artificial geology that in the case of the Whitechapel fatberg has choked 80% of the flow of the sewer. The basic problem is that we inherited a network of underground sewers built 150 years ago that was never designed to cope with what's now thrown into it. However far-sighted Sir Joseph Bazalgette and his fellow Victorian engineers were, they can have had no idea how the populations of our cities would explode and how changes in diet and lifestyles would create a potentially devastating onslaught. The gentle gradients of their designs were meant to create steady streams of human waste and water - not exactly fragrant but ""they don't smell bad if they're working properly,"" one sewage expert told me. The smell from the Whitechapel ""fatberg"" was bad enough to cause David Shukman to gag By contrast, the noxious blast of fetid air that rose when the manhole cover was lifted during yesterday's operation was enough to make me gag and cover my face with my jacket. Three metres beneath the heavy East End traffic, a monstrous mass of fat is acting in the same way that plaque does in arteries and, as with heart trouble, the problem is usually unseen until it's too late. As the engineers donned what looked like spacesuits to head underground - double gloves, hoses bringing fresh air, electronic sensors to spot dangerous gases - a small crowd gathered to watch. The street is lined with fast-food restaurants, just the kind of places that have flourished as the demand for fried takeaways has soared. One of the onlookers wore the striped apron of a chef. London fatbergs 'fuelled by restaurant waste' 'Monster' fatberg found blocking east London sewer How do you clear out a fatberg? The people turning fatbergs into fuel Research by Thames Water mapped the locations of fatbergs and of restaurants, and came up with a remarkable conclusion: if you live within 50 metres of a fast-food place, your chances of being flooded with sewage are eight times higher than if you live further away. So the company has sent teams to visit more than 700 restaurants to explore what steps they're taking to stop the flow of fat leaving their kitchens. The answer? The vast majority are doing nothing at all. Thames Water executives believe this is not through wilfulness but ignorance. There are devices to trap fat, and they cost only a few hundred pounds, but few seem to have heard of them. So the first step in the battle against the bergs is to encourage, cajole or shame restaurant owners into forking out for the small boxes that sit atop a drain and clean the flow. Talks with the big chains are under way. The response so far has been one of surprise that the scale of the problem had not been realised, so maybe the coming months will see fat traps becoming more common. Fatbergs have to be cleared out of narrow tunnels, often by hand But the survey also found that where a small number of restaurants had invested in the devices, few had maintained them. So there lies another challenge. And the key to all this may be our own attitudes - whether any of us demand change. Just as it's become more common for people to expect vegetarian options or food prepared without gluten or dairy products, might anyone demand to know whether a restaurant's kitchen is sewer-friendly before paying for a meal? There's now a term for our unthinking but damaging approach to what we flush away: sewer abuse. One answer is to support and expand schemes to collect restaurant fat and turn it into fuel - a logical form of renewable energy - and this is what will happen to the fatbergs. At the heart of this question is our consumer culture's approach to waste, the belief that we can just chuck anything away without consequence, ""away"" being an abstract and distant concept that we need not care about. But ""away"" is a real place, like an east London sewer jammed with a fatberg weighing the same as 11 buses, and now being chipped away by shovel by brave teams straining in heat so intense they can last only 40 minutes at a time. The image of a dark figure hunched in a tiny tunnel working by hand is startling to us in 21st Century Britain. But in a curious way, it's also an unintended throwback to the grimmer Victorian times when the sewers were built in the first place. The 'monster' fatberg in London's sewers.

"""If you are being paid Â£3.50 an hour, how are you supposed to live?"" asks Tia Spencer Apprenticeship starts this summer weredown almost two thirds,externalon the same period last year despite anew funding schemewhich started in April. Tia Spencer, 20, from Manchester, recently completed a two-year apprenticeship in business administration. ""I think it's the money that puts people off. If you are being paid [the minimum] Â£3.50 an hour, how are you supposed to live? ""I was in care and have been living independently since I was 17. ""I started a two-year apprenticeship in business administration aged 18 but the money was just awful. I got Â£5 an hour. ""I pay all my bills so it was really hard to survive on such low pay. ""I completed the apprenticeship last year and I did think about going on to a level three [advanced] apprenticeship but the pay was rubbish."" ""I am now working in a bar in central Manchester for Â£8.50 an hour which is much better."" ""In the college part of my apprenticeship I learned quite a bit but I didn't really learn much at work. It was all very basic. ""I had to email people and ask for references for jobs, do the filing and the post, answer the phones and do the photocopying. ""I didn't need a two-year apprenticeship to do that, although going to work every day was good experience. ""There should have been more goals to work towards to motivate people and make them feel more involved and appreciated. ""They could have made the apprenticeship shorter and given me more responsibility: 12 months would have been enough and then I could have moved on to a level three apprenticeship. ""I started a college course in health and social care when I was 18 but dropped out after two weeks because I wanted to earn money. ""I started the business administration apprenticeship with a charity because I just knew that I wanted to get a qualification in something at the same time as earning. ""The charity offered me a job at the end of it but I said no because I was the only apprentice there and everyone else was so much older than me. Conversations with people twice my age could be awkward and I felt a bit isolated. ""Towards the end I was just fed up and I couldn't wait for it to finish. ""I am applying for office jobs and temporary contracts. ""I get interviews but I just keep being rejected. I am not sure why as I have a diploma and the apprenticeship."" ""If there were part-time apprenticeships you could earn a living through bar work, for example, and build up your qualifications through apprenticeships at the same time. ""I hoped my apprenticeship would help me get a good job but that hasn't turned out to be the case."" Since April, big UK employers have had to pay a levy to fund up to 3 million new apprenticeships. England's Department for Education points out that employers have 24 months to spend funds from the levy and a spokesman said the government was confident they would hire more apprentices. ""It is right that they are taking their time to plan ahead and maximise the opportunities the apprenticeship levy can bring,"" said the spokesman.

"A fancy dress company has been criticised by psychiatrists for selling a Halloween costume they say stigmatises mental illnesses. Escapade's ""psychotic nympho"" dress has straitjacket sleeves, a lace-up collar and optional face paint for the ""seductive goth"" look. The Royal College of Psychiatrists said it was one of the worst examples of such an outfit it had seen. Escapade has not yet responded to the BBC's requests for a comment. A description of the costume on Escapade's website says it is a ""sensual outfit"" that ""expresses a lot of deep desires without you having to utter a single word"". The company also sells other outfits with the word ""psycho"" in it, including the ""cell block psycho"" costume and ""psycho nurse Sally"". Dr Tony Rao, a psychiatrist and member of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said outfits of this kind stigmatised those with mental illnesses by suggesting people should be afraid of them. He told the BBC: ""If you're going to use words like ""psychotic"" and associate it with ""nympho"", very pejorative, dramatic and shocking terms that are designed to get sales, then I think that is misleading both the perception of mental illness and misleading the public in promoting the idea that it's something we should be afraid of."" In recent years a number of retailers have withdrawn similar items from sale after they were criticised. In 2013,Tesco and Asda withdrew two Halloween outfits- a psycho ward costume and a mental patient outfit - following complaints. The retailers apologised and agreed to make donations to the mental health charity Mind. Dr Rao said there were ""far fewer offensive costumes"" for this year's Halloween, but he said those that are sold set back the public perception of mental illnesses ""several decades"". This could contribute to people being discouraged from seeking treatment, he said. ""The royals, reality TV stars, music stars, have done an excellent job in encouraging people to keep the conversation going about reducing stigma. ""But what these costumes are doing is portraying an ignorance of those with severe mental illness, which is still in some ways seriously misunderstood by the public."" Escapade has yet to respond to requests for a comment. Supermarkets ditch Halloween outfits How safe are Halloween costumes?

"Scientists are now developing an ultra-fast quantum internet that will be partly based on light Imagine super-fast computers that can solve problems much quicker than machines today. These ""quantum computers"" are being developed in laboratories around the world. But scientists have already taken the next step, and are thinking about a light-based quantum internet that will have to be just as fast. It's not easy to develop technology for a device that hasn't technically been invented yet, but quantum communications is an attractive field of research because the technology will enable us to send messages that are much more secure. There are several problems that will need to be solved in order to make a quantum internet possible: Getting quantum computers to talk to each other Making communications secure from hacking Transmitting messages over long distances without losing parts of the message; and Routing messages across a quantum network A quantum computer is a machine that is able to crack very tough computation problems with incredible speed - beyond that of today's ""classical"" computers. In conventional computers, the unit of information is called a ""bit"" and can have a value of either 1 or 0. But its equivalent in a quantum system - the qubit (quantum bit) - can be both 1 and 0 at the same time. This phenomenon opens the door for multiple calculations to be performed simultaneously. However, qubits need to be synchronised using a quantum effect known as entanglement, which Albert Einstein termed ""spooky action at a distance"". There are four types of quantum computers currently being developed, which use: Light particles Trapped ions Superconducting qubits Nitrogen vacancy centres in diamonds Quantum computers will enable a multitude of useful applications, such as being able to model many variations of a chemical reaction to discover new medications; developing new imaging technologies for healthcare to better detect problems in the body; or to speed up how we design batteries, new materials and flexible electronics. Quantum computers might be more powerful than classical computers, but some applications will require even more computing power than one quantum computer can provide on its own. If you can get quantum devices to talk to each other, then you could connect several quantum computers together and pool their power to form one huge quantum computer. However, since there are four different types of quantum computers being built today, they won't be all be able to talk to each other without some help. Some scientists favour a quantum internet based entirely on light particles (photons), while others believe that it would be easier to make quantum networks where light interacts with matter. ""Light is better for communications, but matter qubits are better for processing,"" Joseph Fitzsimons, a principal investigator at the National University of Singapore'sCentre of Quantum Technologies,externaltells the BBC. ""You need both to make the network work to establish error correction of the signal, but it can be difficult to make them interact."" It is very expensive and difficult to store all information in photons, Mr Fitzsimons says, because photons can't see each other and pass straight by, rather than bouncing off each other. Instead, he believes it would be easier to use light for communications, while storing information using electrons or atoms (in matter). Quantum encryption will make communications much more secure One of the key applications of the quantum internet will be quantum key distribution (QKD), whereby a secret key is generated using a pair of entangled photons, and is then used to encrypt information in a way that is impossible for a quantum computer to crack. This technology already exists, and wasfirst demonstrated in space,externalby a team of researchers from the National University of Singapore and the University of Strathclyde, UK, in December 2015. But it's not just the encryption that we will need to build in order to secure our information in the quantum future. Scientists are also working on ""blind quantum computer protocols,external"", because they allow the user tohide anything they want on a computer,external. ""You can write something, send it to a remote computer and the person who owns the computer can't tell anything about it at all except how long it took to run and how much memory it used,"" says Mr Fitzsimons. ""This is important because there likely won't be many quantum computers when they first appear, so people will want to remotely run programs on them, the way we do today in the cloud."" There are two different approaches to building quantum networks - a land-based network and a space-based network. Both methods work well for sending regular bits of data across the internet today, but if we want to send data as qubits in the future, it is much more complicated. To send particles of light (photons), we can use fibre optic cables in the ground. However, the light signal deteriorates over long distances (a phenomenon known as ""decoherence""), because fibre optics cables sometimes absorb photons. It is possible to get around this by building ""repeater stations"" every 50km. These would essentially be miniature quantum laboratories that would try to repair the signal before sending it on to the next node in the network. But this system would come with its own complexities. Artwork: a ground station beams a message contained in a light signal up to the Micius satellite Then there are space-based networks. Let's say you want to send a message from the UK to a friend in Australia. The light signal is beamed up from a ground station in the UK, to a satellite with a light source mounted on it. The satellite sends the light signal to another satellite, which then beams the signal down to a ground station in Australia, and then the message can be transmitted over a ground-based quantum network or classical internet network to the other party. ""Because there's no air between the satellites, there's nothing to degrade the signal,"" says Dr Jamie Vicary, a senior research fellow at Oxford University's department of computer science and a member of the Networked Quantum Information Technologies Hub (NQIT). ""If we want to have a really global-scale quantum internet, it looks like a space-based solution is the only way that will work, but it's the most expensive."" Quantum teleportation via space has been conducted successfully, and scientists are currently vying to demonstrate longer and longer distances. Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences generated headlines in June when they succeeded inteleporting entangled photons between two towns in China,externallocated 1,200km apart. They used a specially developed quantum satellite called Micius. The same Chinese scientists recently topped their own record on 29 September, by demonstratingthe world's first intercontinental video call protected by a quantum key,externalwith researchers at the Austrian Academy of Sciences - over a distance of 7,700km. The call lasted for 20 minutes and the parties were able to exchange encrypted pictures of the Micius satellite and Austrian physicist Erwin SchrÃ¶dinger. Rupert Ursin, senior group leader at the Austrian Academy of Sciences' Institute for Quantum Optics and Quantum Information believes the quantum internet will need land-based and space-based networks to operate in parallel. ""In the cities, we need a fibre network, but long haul connections will be covered by satellite links,"" he explains. The video call between Austrian and Chinese scientists on 29 September 2017 To understand how QKD works, let's go back to the video call made between the Austrian and Chinese scientists. The Micius satellite used its light source to establish optical links with the ground stations in Austria and the ground stations in China. It was then able to generate a quantum key. The great thing about quantum encryption is you can detect whether someone has tried to intercept the message before it got to you, and how many people tried to access it. Micius was able to tell that the encryption was secure and no one was eavesdropping on the video call. It then gave the go ahead to encrypt the data using the secret key and transmit it over a public internet channel. Multiple groups of scientists are developing land-based networks by working on the technologies for quantum repeater stations, which are located every 50km, connected by fibre optic cables. These repeater stations, also known as ""quantum network nodes"", will need to perform several actions in order to route, or direct, messages around the network. First, each node needs to repair and boost the signal that was damaged from the previous 50km stretch of the network. Imagine that you're using an old fax machine to send a one-page document to someone else, and each time you send the page, a different part of the message is missing, and the other party has to piece the message together from all the failed attempts. This is similar to how a single message may have to be sent between different nodes on a quantum network. Fibre optic cables will be used for land-based quantum networks There will be many people on the network, all trying to talk to each other. So the node, or repeater station, will also have to figure out how to distribute its available computing power in order to piece together all the messages being sent. It will also have to send messages between the quantum internet and the classical internet. The University of Delft is building a quantum network using nitrogen vacancies in diamonds, and it has so far shown the ability tostore and distribute the links needed for quantum communications,externalover quite large distances. The University of Oxford and theUniversity of Maryland,externalare both currently building quantum computers that work in a similar way to a network. Their quantum computers consist oftrapped ion nodes that have been networked together,externalto talk to each other. The bigger the computer you want, the more nodes you have to add, but this type of quantum computer only transmits data over a short distance. ""We want to make them small so they can be well-protected from decoherence, but if they're small then they can't hold many qubits,"" says Dr Vicary. ""If we connect the nodes up in a network, then we can still have a quantum computer without being limited by the number of qubits, while still protecting the nodes."" The repeater station will also need to have a quantum memory chip. The nodes create ""links"", which consist of entangled pairs of light particles. These entangled pairs are prepared in advance. While the node calculates the route across the network that the message will need to take, it needs to store the entangled pair of photons somewhere safe, so a quantum memory chip is needed. It has to be able to store the photons for as long as possible. Dr Rose Ahlefeldt and associate professor Matthew Sellars operate a high-resolution dye laser to study rare earth crystals at ANU Researchers from the Australian National University (ANU) have developed atelecom-compatible quantum memory chip,externalusing an erbium-doped crystal. This device is able to store light in the right colour and it is able to do so for longer than one second, which is 10,000 times longer than all other attempts so far. ""The biggest challenge is now to demonstrate a quantum memory with a large data storage capacity,"" associate professor Matthew Sellars, program manager in the Centre for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology (CQC2T) at ANU tells the BBC. ""It will be the memory's storage capacity that will limit the data transmission rate through the network. ""I think it will take about five years before the technology [for the quantum internet] is practical.""

"Clara Starrsjo is a second-year economics student at Cambridge University We hear a lot about the under-representation of women in so-called STEM fields - science, technology, engineering and maths. But the proportion of women in economics isby some measures smaller,external. In the US, onlyabout 13%,externalof academic economists in permanent posts are women; in the UK the proportion is only slightly betterat 15.5%,external. Only one woman has ever won the Nobel Prize in economics - American Elinor Ostrom in 2009. And there wasn't even a single womanon some of the lists,externalfloating about guessing who this year's prize winner would be - it went to the behavioural economist Richard Thaler. Some have argued that these figures aren't necessarily the result of bias. Maybe, they say, women are simply behaving rationally and choosing different disciplines that are perhaps more suited to their temperament and skills, or choosing to work in different but related fields. But Cambridge University economics lecturer Victoria Bateman says that can't really explain all of the gap. ""I think that that way of thinking about the problem is completely false,"" says Dr Bateman, who is a fellow at Cambridge's Gonville & Caius college. ""But I think [it] helps explain why economists have for too long hushed up this problem. ""Because  if economists' models are suggesting that sexism doesn't exist, that it's all a result of people's free choices and... their personal characteristics, then you deny the fact there is a problem."" In fact, there is a growing body of research suggesting that there are some biases - overt and subconscious - that might be contributing to the lack of women in academic economic departments. The proportion of women choosing to study economics at the undergraduate level in the UK has declined over the last decade. A study,externalpublished by University of California, Berkeley's Alice Wu made waves earlier this year. Using natural language processing, Wu analyzed over one million posts on a website calledEconJobRumors.com,external, which is a sort of online forum where academic economists discuss job openings and candidates. Like many places on the internet, the conversations aren't particularly pretty or politically correct. Wu found that when posters on the site discussed female economists, they used starkly different terms than those that were used to discuss male economists. Many of those words are incredibly offensive. Posters tended to discuss a woman's physical appearance (hot and hottie were in the top ten) whereas those terms used with men tended to emphasise their intellectual ability (Wharton and Austrian - for the school of economic thinking - were in the top terms for men). The paper caused a lot of debate within the economic community - with many saying that what people say on the internet isn't necessarily an indication of how they truly think. University of Bristol professor Sarah Smith says: ""I think it's an extreme view. I don't think it's a representation of everyone in the profession."" But, she adds: ""I don't think it's surprising when you tie it up with looking at the proportion of women at different levels."" Prof Smith - who is also the chair of the Royal Economic Society's Women's Committee - cites other evidence that suggested a bias against women in the economics profession, such as a paper published by Harvard researcher Heather Sarsons. Heather Sarsons found that women's contributions to co-authored papers tended to be undervalued That paper,externalfound that an additional co-authored paper on an economist's resume correlates to an 8% increase in the probability of a male economist getting a tenured post -  but only a 2% increase for female candidates. Interestingly, the gap decreased if women co-authored papers with other women. Ms Sarsons wrote in the paper: ""While solo-authored papers send a clear signal about one's ability, co-authored papers do not provide specific information about each contributor's skills. I find that women incur a penalty when they co-author that men do not experience."" Her paper, she added in a footnote, was intentionally single-authored. There are more studies - ones that suggest that female economists' papers takesix months longer,externalto peer review in top journals than their male counterparts; that when women get tenured faculty jobs in economics,they get paid less,external; and that even if a woman makes it to the front of a lecture hall - there might be no men listening to them. Victoria Bateman organised a Women in Economics day at Cambridge in 2015 to encourage more young women to enter the field. ""There was a very interesting and quick bit of number crunching that was done by the Centre for Global Development which has headquarters in both Washington and London,"" says Cambridge's Dr Bateman. ""When they looked at male attendance at the seminars that they run they found that it fell off quite dramatically whenever gender was mentioned in the seminar topic."" Dr Bateman says the fact that there are so few women at the top has meant that many young women can't view themselves in those positions. She notes that in the early 2000s the proportion of women studying economics in British universities was around 30%. It's down to just 26% today. That women aren't even choosing to enter the discipline really surprised me. So I went to Cambridge to speak to some of the current undergraduates in economics. Paulin Nusser says she noticed that there were very few women teaching her economics courses. I met Paulin Nusser, a final year economics, student at the University Centre on a busy Sunday. I asked her what her experience studying economics had been like. ""When I think back to my lectures last year for instance out of the 11 lecturers and supervisors I had throughout the year that are based in the faculty - just one was a woman,"" she says. This is why she says it can sometimes be hard to imagine a career in academic economics, even though she hopes to pursue it at postgraduate level. ""Representation is just something that does affect me because I am subconsciously looking for role models or someone where I can say you know, 'oh that could be me standing up there teaching this lecture'."" Clara Starrsjo, a second-year student says she notices that her male and female classmates approach economics problems differently - which often leads to better, more comprehensive answers. This is why she's become passionate about increasing the number of women who study economics - including meeting with potential female economics students at a Women in Economics day each autumn. I ask her why she tells these women they should enter the field - even if the odds may seem stacked against them. ""For the moment economists have only looked at the world around them through male eyes and this only provides us with half the story,"" she says she tells them. ""And with only half the story how can we get results that will help the whole population?""

"Protesters outside the White House have urged Donald Trump to back the deal US President Donald Trump will accuse Iran of failing to comply with an international nuclear deal, according to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Mr Trump will refuse to certify the deal and refer it to Congress, he told reporters. Such a move would not mean a US withdrawal from the deal that freezes Iran's nuclear programme, but it is part of a tougher strategy on Iran. President Trump was due to speak from the White House at 16:45 GMT. He is under pressure at home and abroad not to scrap the seven-country deal agreed in 2015, under which Iran has halted its nuclear programme in return for the partial lifting of sanctions. In his speech, Mr Trump is expected to accuse Tehran of pursuing ""death and destruction"". It is thought he will also focus on its non-nuclear activities, particularly those of the Revolutionary Guards (RIG), which has been accused of supporting terrorism. During the presidential election campaign in 2016, Mr Trump pledged to throw out the agreement concluded under his predecessor, Barack Obama. But senior cabinet officials advised him not to as Iran was abiding by its terms, so Mr Trump has opted for a middle road, reports the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington. Worshippers shouted anti-US slogans during Friday prayers in Tehran Mr Trump was due to say the agreement did not meet certain conditions of US law, but he would let Congress decide its fate, Mr Tillerson said. Congress could choose to pull out of the deal, but Mr Tillerson said the administration would advise it instead to establish guidelines under which the US could automatically re-impose sanctions: trigger points, he called them. The Trump administration wants to broaden Iran policy beyond the nuclear deal. This, said Mr Tillerson, would include sanctioning members of the powerful Revolutionary Guards force for supporting militant groups and terrorist activities. Among the changes it is seekingis the end to the ""sunset"" clauses in the deal, one of which sees restrictions on Iran's nuclear enrichment programme lifted after 2025, greater access to nuclear sites and the inclusion of Iran's ballistic missile programme. This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran deal Under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (Ingra), Congress requires the US president to certify every 90 days that Iran is upholding its part of the nuclear agreement. Mr Trump has already recertified it twice and has a deadline of Sunday to make his latest report back. Refusal to recertify would give Congress 60 days to decide whether to pull out of the nuclear deal by re-imposing sanctions. Astrategy paper,externalreleased by the White House highlights calls for neutralising Iran's ""destabilising influence and constraining its aggression, particularly its support for terrorism and militants"". The US, it says, will work to revitalise traditional alliances and regional partnerships as ""bulwarks against Iranian subversion"". This video can not be played President Trump and Iran's President Rouhani traded insults at the UN Efforts will be made to deny funding for the Iranian government and the RIG's ""malign activities"" and counter threats from ballistic missiles ""and other asymmetric weapons"". The nuclear deal does not comprehensively cover the missile development programmes, and last monthIran successfully tested a new-medium range missilewith a 2,000km (1,200-mile) range. The IRGC's ""gross violations of human rights"" will be highlighted to the rest of the world,"" the strategy paper says. ""Most importantly, we will deny the Iranian regime all paths to a nuclear weapon."" What will Trump do about the deal? Foreign leaders, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron, have urged Mr Trump to keep the deal. ""We also have to tell the Americans that their behaviour on the Iran issue will drive us Europeans into a common position with Russia and China against the USA,"" German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel warned in a newspaper interview. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that US withdrawal from the nuclear deal would ""damage the atmosphere of predictability, security, stability and non-proliferation in the entire world"". Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt said a US withdrawal from the deal would show it could not be relied upon and could have ramifications elsewhere, for example on efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. The IAEA and Congress currently both agree Iran is complying with the terms of the nuclear agreement. The speaker of the Iranian parliament, Ali Larijani, said on a visit to Russia that a US withdrawal from the deal would signal its end. He warned that the collapse of the deal could result in global chaos, Russian media report. Formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, it is designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon. It lifted some sanctions that stopped Iran from trading on international markets and selling oil. The lifting of sanctions is dependent on Iran restricting its nuclear programme. It must curb its uranium stockpile, build no more heavy-water reactors for 15 years and allow inspectors into the country. Key details of the Iran nuclear deal Set up shortly after the 1979 Iranian revolution to defend the country's Islamic system, they provide a counterweight to the regular armed forces. They are a major military, political and economic force in Iran, with some 125,000 active members, and oversee strategic weapons. They have been accused of supporting Shia Muslim militants in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria. What next for the Iran nuclear deal?

"Ipswich Town Football Club's Portman Road ground was broken into twice Thieves who broke into a football stadium and stole giant TVs raided fridges to stage a food fight with frozen cheesecakes. Police said the break-ins at Ipswich Town Football Club's Portman Road ground took place overnight on Saturday and in the early hours of Wednesday. During the first raid, the intruders partied on wine and food, the BBC understands. A club spokesman said they have increased the stadium's security. It is understood the thieves got into hospitality boxes - one next to chairman Marcus Evans' personal box - and helped themselves to ""expensive vintage"" wine and food. They then took the lift down to the kitchens beneath the stands to raid the fridges. The football club said it has increased its security following the two break-ins The same gang of at least four people carried out the raids on both occasions, it is understood. Suffolk Police said officers were called to the ground at 07:50 BST on Sunday and at 06:00 on Wednesday. A number of plasma television information screens from public areas around the ground were stolen on the gang's second visit, it is understood. Police said no arrests have been made and inquiries are ongoing. An Ipswich Town spokesperson said: ""We can confirm there have been two incidents over the last week of intrusion at the stadium.

"The chancellor has labelled the European Union's Brexit negotiators as ""the enemy"" - a remark he subsequently described as a ""poor choice of words"". During a television interview, Philip Hammond also called the negotiators ""the opponents"" and said they should ""behave like grown-ups"". But he tweeted later: ""I was making the point that we are united at home. I regret I used a poor choice of words."" Mr Hammond is in Washington for an International Monetary Fund meeting. He has been criticised for saying that the Brexit process has created uncertainty, and this week a former chancellor claimed he was trying to sabotage the talks. During a series of media interviews in Washington, Mr Hammond told Sky News that ""passions are high"" in the party ""but we are all going to the same place"". But he added: ""The enemy, the opponents, are out there on the other side of the table. Those are the people that we have to negotiate with to get the very best deal for Britain."" Despite his regrets, Mr Hammond's comments drew fire from political opponents. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said it was an ""inept approach from a failing government. Insulting the EU is not the way to protect our economic interests"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

During his interviews, the chancellor also has described as ""bizarre"" and ""absurd"" accusations he is talking down the economy. Mr Hammond said he was a realist and that he wanted to ""protect and prepare"" the economy for the challenges ahead. The chancellor said: ""It is absurd to pretend that the process we are engaged in hasn't created some uncertainty. But the underlying economy remains robust. ""I am committed to delivering a Brexit deal that works for Britain,"" he added. He refused to answer how he would vote if another referendum was held now. ""We've had the referendum,"" he said. ""You know how I voted in it."" This week, former Conservative Chancellor Nigel Lawson called for Mr Hammond to be sacked, saying he was unhelpful to the Brexit process. Lord Lawson said: ""What he [Mr Hammond] is doing is very close to sabotage"". Responding to these comments, Mr Hammond said: ""Lord Lawson is entitled to his view on this and many other subjects and isn't afraid to express it, but I think he's wrong."" The chancellor, who has been accused of being too pessimistic about Brexit, told the Treasury Committee of MPs this week that a ""cloud of uncertainty"" over the outcome of negotiations was ""acting as a dampener"" on the economy. But speaking on Friday, Mr Hammond said he was optimistic about the UK's economic future and was in Washington to promote it. ""What I'm doing here in Washington is talking Britain up, talking about Britain's future as a champion of free trade in the global economy, seeking further moves on liberalisation on trade in services which will hugely benefit our economy."" He added that Britain had ""a very bright future ahead"", but added that it was ""undoubtedly true"" that the process of negotiations had created uncertainty for business. ""If you talk to businesses, they would like us to get it done quickly so that they know clearly what our future relationship with the European Union is going to look like."" Mr Hammond said the Cabinet was united behind Prime Minister Theresa May's recent speech in Florence setting out her Brexit plans. ""We know what our proposal is, we put it on the table effectively. Now we want the European Union to engage with itâ¦ challenge usâ¦ but let's behave like grown-ups."" he said. Mr Hammond said the government would not spend taxpayers' money preparing for a ""no-deal"" Brexit until the ""very last moment"". He said he would not take money from budgets for other areas such as health or education just to ""send a message"" to the EU. One former minister, David Jones, has said billions of pounds should be set aside in November's Budget for a ""no deal"" scenario. He argued that if this did not happen it would be seen as a ""a sign of weakness"" by EU leaders, who would think the UK was not serious about leaving the EU without a deal.

"This video can not be played Adama Jammeh told the BBC ""every day I'm more angry"" A security guard who claims he was sacked from Tesco after being wrongly accused of stealing has spent the night in the supermarket's roof space. Adama Jammeh has been on the girders above the checkouts in Tesco Extra, Reading, for more than 20 hours, live-streaming on Facebook. Shoppers were told to abandon their trolleys and leave the store as he climbed to the roof yelling. Mr Jammeh told the BBC he was ""stressed and angry"". Tesco said it was ""assisting police with the matter"". The 46-year-old said he was falsely accused of stealing electrical goods worth Â£20,000 by the supermarket chain, which led to his sacking by security firm Total Security Services (TSS). The father-of-two has spent the past six months staging a one-man protest outside the Portman Road store with banners. Mr Jammeh, originally from Gambia, started the roof protest just after 18:00 BST on Thursday and says he has not slept and barely eaten. ""I'm stressed and angry but I'm still surviving up here,"" he said. This video can not be played Mr Jammeh's wife Dawn said her husband ""could be up there for days"" ""I've been protesting my innocence for six complete months and nothing has been done about it, they [Tesco] have ignored me. ""Every day I'm more angry. I'm only alive when I come out here to Tesco protesting my innocence. ""So yesterday I decided it was the last straw for me."" Mr Jammeh said he would only come down if Tesco bosses apologise and ""pay lost earnings"". In one of his videos on Facebook, he apologised to shoppers. ""Sorry for some of you that are supposed to come here shopping in this store,"" he said. ""It's inconvenient, sorry for that people but it's something I have to do."" Mr Jammeh apologised to shoppers in one of his Facebook videos His wife of 18 years, Dawn, is outside the supermarket supporting him. She told BBC Berkshire reporter Nick Johnson ""he will not be coming down willingly"" and they are prepared to ""accept the consequences"". ""He's been wrongfully accused of stealing,"" she said. ""Tesco accused him, told his workplace and his workplace sacked him straight away. ""Police went through CCTV which took them 10 months to go through and said he was an innocent man and that it was somebody else. ""He's had no apology off Tesco, no apology off TSS, and this is why he's protesting now."" Mr Jammeh began streaming his protest online at about 18:15 BST on Thursday The store's management team is also outside but refusing to comment. A Tesco spokesperson said they have nothing further to add. A TSS spokesperson said: ""We are aware of the incident involving a former employee of Total Security Services and are assisting the police and Tesco in this matter."" Thames Valley Police is yet to respond to claims of Mr Jammeh's innocence. Tesco said it was helping police with the matter The security guard has banners outside the supermarket The Tesco Extra West store was evacuated just after 18:00 BST on Thursday after the police received reports concerning the ""welfare of a man"". Tesco said the company was still establishing the circumstances of the incident but believed the man had not been directly employed by Tesco but was a member of security staff.

"Anti-segregation protestors gathered outside the court at an earlier hearing An Islamic faith school's policy of segregating boys and girls is unlawful sex discrimination, a court has ruled. The case was heard at the Court of Appeal as Ofsted challenged a High Court ruling clearing the Al-Hijrah school in Birmingham of discrimination. Ofsted's lawyers argued the segregation left girls ""unprepared for life in modern Britain"". Appeal judges ruled the school was discriminating against its pupils contrary to the Equality Act. However, the court did not accept the argument the school's policy had disadvantaged girls more than boys. Midlands Live: A time to end single-sex schools?; white van man jailed after 100mph M6 police chase The appeal judges also made it clear the government and Ofsted had failed to identify the problem earlier and other schools operating similarly should be given time ""to put their houses in order"". About 20 schools - Islamic, Jewish and Christian - are thought to have similar segregation policies. From Year Five boys and girls are completely separated for lessons, breaks, trips and clubs The three appeal judges heard boys and girls, aged four to 16, attend the Birmingham City Council-maintained Al-Hijrah school, in Bordesley Green. But from Year Five, boys and girls are completely separated for lessons, breaks, school trips and school clubs. In 2016, Ofsted ruled the school was inadequate and it was put in special measures, saying its policy of separating the sexes was discrimination under the 2010 Equality Act. In November, High Court judge Mr Justice Jay overruled the inspectors, saying that they had taken an ""erroneous"" view on an issue ""of considerable public importance"". Ofsted's Amanda Spielman said the policy failed to prepare pupils for life in modern Britain Speaking after the Court of Appeal ruling Amanda Spielman, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools, said educational institutions should never treat pupils less favourably because of their sex. ""The school is teaching boys and girls entirely separately, making them walk down separate corridors, and keeping them apart at all times,"" she said. ""This is discrimination and is wrong. It places these boys and girls at a disadvantage for life beyond the classroom and the workplace, and fails to prepare them for life in modern Britain,"" she said. In the ruling, the appeal judges said Ofsted had made it clear if the appeal succeeded, ""it will apply a consistent approach to all similarly organised schools"". Given their failure to identify the problem earlier, the education secretary and Ofsted had ""de facto sanctioned and accepted a state of affairs which is unlawful"" and should give the affected schools time to ""put their houses in order"", the judges said. The ruling means state schools which segregate pupils risk being given a lower rating by Ofsted. It only applies to mixed-sex schools. During the appeal hearing, Peter Oldham QC, speaking for Al-Hijrah's interim executive board, said the boys and girls at the school were treated entirely equally while segregated. He said Ofsted did not claim separation was discrimination until 2016 and its actions were ""the antithesis of proper public decision-making"". Birmingham City Council said the issue was about schools being inspected against unclear policy and guidelines Birmingham City Council said it took the High Court action it had because it felt Al-Hijrah school had been held to a different standard than other schools with similar arrangements, which had not been downgraded by Ofsted as a consequence. Colin Diamond, corporate director of children and young people at the Labour-run council, said the case had always been about fairness and consistency in the inspection process. ""We would therefore highlight comments made in this judgement about the secretary of state's and Ofsted's 'failure to identify the problem',"" he said. He added the council had a strong history of encouraging all schools to practise equality but if it was national policy that schools with gender separation were discriminating against pupils then local authorities and the schools needed to be told so they knew the standards they were being inspected against. Speaking to Radio 4, Mr Diamond said: ""In questioning the judgement itself, the logic whereby you can say having, in one part of our city here, a boys' school and a girls' school adjacent to each other, with a fence between them... so that's okay is it? ""Whereas it's not okay to have boys and girls in the same school, when parents have signed up for that form of Islamic education. We don't see the logic, the equity in any of that."" Matt Bennett, shadow cabinet member for children and family services, said the verdict did not reflect well on Al-Hijrah, the council, Ofsted or the DfE. ""It is now clear that practices breaching the Equality Act 2010 have been allowed to continue at this school, and others across the country. Action is now required at local and national level,"" he said.

"Mission Beach is a popular stopover for backpackers travelling along the Queensland coast Three skydivers have died in Queensland after they apparently collided mid-air, say Australian authorities. Paramedics and police were called to Mission Beach, a popular skydiving spot about 140km (87 miles) south of Cairns. Two men in their 30s, and a woman in her 50s, were found dead at the scene, Queensland police saidin a statement.,external Police said initial investigations found one person may have collided with tandem skydivers, and their parachutes failed to deploy correctly. Queensland's ambulance service told theAustralian Broadcasting Corporation,externalthat one skydiver was found in the garden of a residence, and the other two were found close by. A resident was also quoted as saying the bodies were found about 1.5km north of the usual landing site. Operating company Skydive Australia toldlocal media,externalthat it had suspended its operations at Mission Beach while an investigation took place. The solo skydiver was a ""highly experienced instructor who had completed thousands of jumps"", while the other two were a customer and another experienced instructor, it said in a statement. ""The company extends its deepest sympathies and heartfelt condolences to the individuals and families involved and the broader skydiving community,"" it added. An unnamed eyewitness toldthe Cairns Post,externalthat he saw one of the skydivers falling. ""You could see one chute was tangled and it wasn't opening."" ""I was just watching him in free fall until he went behind the trees, and that was the last I saw,"" he said. ""It wasn't good to watch. I had my heart in my mouth."" The area's local mayor, John Kremastos, told the ABC that the incident was ""horrible news"", saying: ""Three people in one accident is very, very sad.""

"Tim Cahill made his international debut in 2004 Australia's football association will not take action against Tim Cahill after it was claimed he used a goal celebration to promote a sponsor. The striker made a ""T"" sign after scoring for Australia in theWorld Cup qualifying win over Syriaon Wednesday. In a now-deleted Instagram post, a travel agency hailed the gesture and Cahill replied with eight emojis. ""We don't believe Tim's breached any laws,"" a Football Federation Australia (FFA) spokesman told the BBC. Cahill, who plays for Melbourne City and previously had spells with Millwall, Everton and New York Red Bulls, later tagged the sponsor in an Instagram post of his own. ""Another chapter written and plenty more to come. Amazing team performance and really proud of everyone tonight, team, staff and fans,"" Cahill wrote, before tagging the agency.

"Ian Brady died at Ashworth Hospital, a secure psychiatric unit on Merseyside Moors Murderer Ian Brady's remains must be disposed of with ""no music and no ceremony"", a High Court judge has ruled. Two councils asked the judge to step in to ensure the disposal of the serial killer's body did not cause ""offence and distress"" to his victims' families. Sir Geoffrey Vos said Brady's executor had failed to make proper arrangements for disposal of his remains. Brady died aged 79, on 15 May, but his remains have not yet been disposed of. Brady and Myra Hindley, who died in prison in 2002, tortured and murdered five children in the 1960s. Keith Bennett's body has never been found Sir Geoffrey acted after Oldham and Tameside councils raised concerns that five months after Brady's death his executor, solicitor Robin Makin, had failed to make proper arrangements for the disposal. In his judgement, he noted assurances sought by coroner Christopher Sumner over concerns Brady's ashes might be scattered on Saddleworth Moor, where at least three of his victims were buried. Tameside and Oldham councils brought the action over similar concerns from relatives, with parts of the moor in both boroughs. This was compounded by Mr Makin's reluctance to discuss arrangements for the disposal of the remains. ""We know that the relatives and residents alike found even the suggestion that his ashes may be scattered over Saddleworth Moor to be abhorrent and distressing, especially because 13-year-old Keith Bennett has never been found,"" the councils said after the hearing. As part of his ruling, Sir Geoffrey accepted a proposal for a Tameside council officer to arrange for the disposal was the ""best available"". ""I am satisfied also that it is both necessary and expedient for the matter to be taken out of Mr Makin's hands,"" Sir Geoffrey said. ""Even after a hearing that has lasted for one and a half days, the parties have not been able to agree precisely how the deceased's body should be disposed of."" Saddleworth Moor has been the scene of several searches for the remains of Brady's victims In issuing directions about the body's disposal, Sir Geoffrey said: ""I decline to permit the playing of the fifth movement of the Symphony Fantastique at the cremation, as Mr Makin requested."" He quoted the Wikipedia page for the piece that states the musician sees himself ""at a witches' sabbath, in the midst of a hideous gathering of shades, sorcerers and monsters of every kind who have come together for his funeral"". ""I have no difficulty in understanding how legitimate offence would be caused to the families of the deceased's victims once it became known that this movement had been played at his cremation,"" Sir Geoffrey said. The judge said Mr Makin could not be ""entrusted"" with Brady's ashes because he had been ""so secretive"". Sir Geoffrey said: ""Had he (Mr Makin) discussed the matter openly with the claimants and with Sefton Borough Council and given clear undertakings that he was not intending to scatter the deceased's ashes in their areas, these proceedings might have been avoided. ""Even now, he has refused to say what he intends to do with the ashes if he is allowed custody of them."" Brady was jailed in 1966 for murdering John Kilbride, aged 12, Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17. In 1985, he also admitted killing Pauline Reade, 16, and 12-year-old Keith Bennett, whose body has never been found. Despite pleas from Keith's mother Winnie Johnson, whodied in 2012, Brady did not reveal where her son was buried.

"Springsteen's wife Patti Scialfa joins him on stage for two songs in the show Bruce Springsteen is breaking box-office records with his one-man show, Springsteen on Broadway. The rock star made $2.3m (Â£1.8m) in his first week of previews, behind only Hamilton and Hello, Dolly! - which both played more shows in the same period. Mixing live music and storytelling, the show is set to run for 16 weeks, with The Boss taking up residence in the 960-seat Walter Kerr Theater. ""It's probably the smallest venue I've played in the last 40 years,"" he said. The show officially opens on Thursday night - but the BBC's Elysa Gardner managed to catch one of the previews. The star will play five performances a week until February 2018 Bruce Springsteen's first Broadway show is neither a musical nor a concert in the tradition of his previous solo tours. Written and directed by The Boss, Springsteen On Broadway - which arrives roughly a year after his autobiography, Born To Run - is a meticulously crafted, deeply personal journey with set words and music, with the star alternately accompanying himself on guitar and piano. But the two-hour program is also, in its distinctly intimate, sometimes darkly earnest fashion, an affirmation of the passionate showmanship and vivid storytelling that Springsteen's rock and roll shares with musical theatre. As a songwriter, we're reminded, he's as much an inheritor to Rodgers and Hammerstein as any contemporary pop artist - an unabashed romantic with a probing social conscience, whose soaring tunes give full-throated voice to American dreams and the demons that haunt them. BBC Music: Bruce Springsteen Bruce Springsteen on songwriting How Clive Davis changed Springsteen's career Bruce Springsteen: 'Trump is a conman' The songs in Springsteen On Broadway are clearly chosen less to show off Springsteen's array of memorable characters (or hits, for that matter) than to acknowledge the people and events that shaped them. Not surprisingly, more time and detail are devoted to his youth than his nearly 45 years as one of the most famous people on the planet. ""I come from a boardwalk town where everything is tinged with a bit of fraud,"" he announced at a preview before the official opening night, before tearing into his first number, the early classicGrowin' Up,external. Two verses in, as if to underline the point, he paused to quip, ""I've never held an honest job in my life... and yet that's all I've written about."" Such self-deprecating humour, which extends to tales of Springsteen's wayward youth and early career struggles, was offset by moving, lyrical tributes to his father, a depressive who sought refuge at the local bar, and his defiantly positive mother. ""She gave the world a lot more credit than it deserves,"" Springsteen observed, heading to the piano for an achingly tenderThe Wish,external. The show concentrates on the foundations of Springsteen's career Springsteen also played the rock and roll preacher, naturally, applying a shrewdly scaled-down version of the shamanistic intensity that has whipped packed stadiums into frenzies. The script used winking but seductive repetition, with playful references to the pleasures of the flesh, as well as the general promises of youth - captured in exhilarating readings ofThunder Road,externalandThe Promised Land,external.

"This video can not be played Michel Barnier said there was ""deadlock"" over the UK's Brexit bill The EU is to begin preparing for its post-Brexit trade negotiations with the UK, while refusing to discuss the matter with the British government. An internal draft document suggests the 27 EU countries should discuss trade among themselves while officials in Brussels prepare the details. The draft text could yet be revised. EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said a lack of compromise over the UK's financial commitments was impeding progress - saying ""they have to pay"". Speaking in Luxembourg, Mr Juncker used the analogy of someone covering the bill after ordering 28 beers at a bar to explain the EU's position - and added that the Brexit negotiating process was taking longer than expected. He also dismissed the wrangling over citizens' rights - another sticking point - as ""nonsense"", calling on the UK to adopt a ""common sense"" approach and say ""things will stay as they are"" after Brexit. Downing Street said ""good progress"" was being made in the talks. Battles ahead for government's EU legislation Deadlock over UK's Brexit bill - Barnier Kuenssberg: Brexit talks doomed? Not so fast... What would 'no deal' look like? As the fifth round of talks ended in Brussels on Thursday, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier,said there was ""deadlock""over the UK's Brexit bill. He said there had not been enough progress to move to the next stage of post-Brexit trade talks - as the UK had hoped -  but added that he hoped for ""decisive progress"" by the time of the December summit of the European Council. The draft paper submitted to the 27 EU states by European Council president Donald Tusk, suggests free trade talks could open in December - should Prime Minister Theresa May improve her offer on what the UK pays when it leaves. The government is wading through proposed amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill The BBC's Europe correspondent Adam Fleming said the paper contained ""something for everyone"" - with the reference to trade talks accompanied by a call for the UK to do more to bridge the gap on the key negotiating points. The document calls for talks - about a transition period and the future relationship - to move to the next phase ""as soon as possible"". The draft conclusions - to be put to EU leaders next Friday - also call for more concessions from the UK on its financial obligations and the rights of European nationals who wish to stay after Brexit. Brexit: All you need to know The paper confirms Mr Barnier's assessment, that there has not been ""sufficient progress"" on three key elements of a withdrawal treaty for leaders to agree to open the trade talks now. But it says the leaders would welcome developments on these key issues: the rights of three million EU citizens in the UK, protecting peace in Northern Ireland from the effect of a new border and Britain's outstanding ""financial obligations"". The council would then pledge to ""reassess the state of progress"" at their December summit. Bernd Kolmel, chairman of Germany's Eurosceptic Liberal Conservative Reformers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there appeared to have been little progress between the first and fifth round of talks - something he described as a ""disaster"". He called on the EU to expand the talks to include its future relationships and trade with the UK. Anders Vistisen, a Danish Eurosceptic MEP and vice-chair of the EU Parliament's foreign affairs committee, agreed, adding: ""The most integral thing is the future relationship. If we are making a bad trade deal for Britain we are also hurting ourselves."" The document states that in order ""to be fully ready"", EU leaders would ask Mr Barnier and his officials to start preparing now for a transition - albeit without actually starting to talk to the UK about it. ""The European Council invites the Council (Article 50) together with the Union negotiator to start internal preparatory discussions,"" the draft reads. A Downing Street spokeswoman would not comment on the draft EU document but said Theresa May ""has been clear all along that we need to reach a settlement"", adding that UK would honour its financial commitments. Meanwhile, a crucial plank of the government's Brexit legislation faces a raft of attempted amendments by MPs as ministers seek to steer it through Parliament. The EU (Withdrawal) Bill will end the supremacy of EU law in the UK and incorporate existing Brussels legislation onto the UK statute book. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said going through the proposed changes was ""taking a bit of time"" as she confirmed there would be no debate on the bill next week.

"Springsteen's wife Patti Scialfa joins him on stage for two songs in the show Bruce Springsteen is breaking box-office records with his one-man show, Springsteen on Broadway. The rock star made $2.3m (Â£1.8m) in his first week of previews, behind only Hamilton and Hello, Dolly! - which both played more shows in the same period. Mixing live music and storytelling, the show is set to run for 16 weeks, with The Boss taking up residence in the 960-seat Walter Kerr Theater. ""It's probably the smallest venue I've played in the last 40 years,"" he said. The show officially opens on Thursday night - but the BBC's Elysa Gardner managed to catch one of the previews. The star will play five performances a week until February 2018 Bruce Springsteen's first Broadway show is neither a musical nor a concert in the tradition of his previous solo tours. Written and directed by The Boss, Springsteen On Broadway - which arrives roughly a year after his autobiography, Born To Run - is a meticulously crafted, deeply personal journey with set words and music, with the star alternately accompanying himself on guitar and piano. But the two-hour program is also, in its distinctly intimate, sometimes darkly earnest fashion, an affirmation of the passionate showmanship and vivid storytelling that Springsteen's rock and roll shares with musical theatre. As a songwriter, we're reminded, he's as much an inheritor to Rodgers and Hammerstein as any contemporary pop artist - an unabashed romantic with a probing social conscience, whose soaring tunes give full-throated voice to American dreams and the demons that haunt them. BBC Music: Bruce Springsteen Bruce Springsteen on songwriting How Clive Davis changed Springsteen's career Bruce Springsteen: 'Trump is a conman' The songs in Springsteen On Broadway are clearly chosen less to show off Springsteen's array of memorable characters (or hits, for that matter) than to acknowledge the people and events that shaped them. Not surprisingly, more time and detail are devoted to his youth than his nearly 45 years as one of the most famous people on the planet. ""I come from a boardwalk town where everything is tinged with a bit of fraud,"" he announced at a preview before the official opening night, before tearing into his first number, the early classicGrowin' Up,external. Two verses in, as if to underline the point, he paused to quip, ""I've never held an honest job in my life... and yet that's all I've written about."" Such self-deprecating humour, which extends to tales of Springsteen's wayward youth and early career struggles, was offset by moving, lyrical tributes to his father, a depressive who sought refuge at the local bar, and his defiantly positive mother. ""She gave the world a lot more credit than it deserves,"" Springsteen observed, heading to the piano for an achingly tenderThe Wish,external. The show concentrates on the foundations of Springsteen's career Springsteen also played the rock and roll preacher, naturally, applying a shrewdly scaled-down version of the shamanistic intensity that has whipped packed stadiums into frenzies. The script used winking but seductive repetition, with playful references to the pleasures of the flesh, as well as the general promises of youth - captured in exhilarating readings ofThunder Road,externalandThe Promised Land,external. As the show progressed, though, the emphasis shifted to more mature concerns and rewards. It's here that Springsteen's ability to open his heart and transcend sentimentality - as the most affecting rock and musical theatre artists almost invariably do - came to the fore. Back at the piano for a muscularTenth Avenue Freezeout,external, he held forth without reserve about late E Street Band sax hero Clarence Clemons.

"Anti-segregation protestors gathered outside the court at an earlier hearing An Islamic faith school's policy of segregating boys and girls is unlawful sex discrimination, a court has ruled. The case was heard at the Court of Appeal as Ofsted challenged a High Court ruling clearing the Al-Hijrah school in Birmingham of discrimination. Ofsted's lawyers argued the segregation left girls ""unprepared for life in modern Britain"". Appeal judges ruled the school was discriminating against its pupils contrary to the Equality Act. However, the court did not accept the argument the school's policy had disadvantaged girls more than boys. Midlands Live: A time to end single-sex schools?; white van man jailed after 100mph M6 police chase The appeal judges also made it clear the government and Ofsted had failed to identify the problem earlier and other schools operating similarly should be given time ""to put their houses in order"". About 20 schools - Islamic, Jewish and Christian - are thought to have similar segregation policies. From Year Five boys and girls are completely separated for lessons, breaks, trips and clubs The three appeal judges heard boys and girls, aged four to 16, attend the Birmingham City Council-maintained Al-Hijrah school, in Bordesley Green. But from Year Five, boys and girls are completely separated for lessons, breaks, school trips and school clubs. In 2016, Ofsted ruled the school was inadequate and it was put in special measures, saying its policy of separating the sexes was discrimination under the 2010 Equality Act. In November, High Court judge Mr Justice Jay overruled the inspectors, saying that they had taken an ""erroneous"" view on an issue ""of considerable public importance"". Ofsted's Amanda Spielman said the policy failed to prepare pupils for life in modern Britain Speaking after the Court of Appeal ruling Amanda Spielman, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools, said educational institutions should never treat pupils less favourably because of their sex. ""The school is teaching boys and girls entirely separately, making them walk down separate corridors, and keeping them apart at all times,"" she said. ""This is discrimination and is wrong. It places these boys and girls at a disadvantage for life beyond the classroom and the workplace, and fails to prepare them for life in modern Britain,"" she said. In the ruling, the appeal judges said Ofsted had made it clear if the appeal succeeded, ""it will apply a consistent approach to all similarly organised schools"". Given their failure to identify the problem earlier, the education secretary and Ofsted had ""de facto sanctioned and accepted a state of affairs which is unlawful"" and should give the affected schools time to ""put their houses in order"", the judges said. The ruling means state schools which segregate pupils risk being given a lower rating by Ofsted. It only applies to mixed-sex schools. During the appeal hearing, Peter Oldham QC, speaking for Al-Hijrah's interim executive board, said the boys and girls at the school were treated entirely equally while segregated. He said Ofsted did not claim separation was discrimination until 2016 and its actions were ""the antithesis of proper public decision-making"". Birmingham City Council said the issue was about schools being inspected against unclear policy and guidelines Birmingham City Council said it took the High Court action it had because it felt Al-Hijrah school had been held to a different standard than other schools with similar arrangements, which had not been downgraded by Ofsted as a consequence. Colin Diamond, corporate director of children and young people at the Labour-run council, said the case had always been about fairness and consistency in the inspection process. ""We would therefore highlight comments made in this judgement about the secretary of state's and Ofsted's 'failure to identify the problem',"" he said. He added the council had a strong history of encouraging all schools to practise equality but if it was national policy that schools with gender separation were discriminating against pupils then local authorities and the schools needed to be told so they knew the standards they were being inspected against. Speaking to Radio 4, Mr Diamond said: ""In questioning the judgement itself, the logic whereby you can say having, in one part of our city here, a boys' school and a girls' school adjacent to each other, with a fence between them... so that's okay is it? ""Whereas it's not okay to have boys and girls in the same school, when parents have signed up for that form of Islamic education. We don't see the logic, the equity in any of that."" Matt Bennett, shadow cabinet member for children and family services, said the verdict did not reflect well on Al-Hijrah, the council, Ofsted or the DfE. ""It is now clear that practices breaching the Equality Act 2010 have been allowed to continue at this school, and others across the country. Action is now required at local and national level,"" he said.

"The Patels about to get on their plane A cohort of Indian-Americans who have made their fortune in the US are increasingly turning to large-scale philanthropy. Kiran Patel's giant gift to a Florida university is the new high-water mark. Every day at school, eight-year-old Kiran Patel would watch longingly as his younger brother and friends snacked on chocolate and soda bought with their pocket money. His one shilling a day pocket money could easily pay for those goodies. But to him it was a waste - he dropped it in a piggy bank instead. In a few years, he had saved enough to buy the ship fare from Zambia to India for himself, his parents and his two siblings - their first trip home in 12 years. Six decades later, Dr Kiran C Patel recounts the story aboard his 14-seater private Bombardier jet on his way to Tampa, Florida. He has come a long way from that small town in Zambia. Just hours prior, he and his wife, Dr Pallavi Patel, pledged $200m to a Florida university - the largest donation ever from an Indian-American to a US institution. Nova Southeastern University (NSU) will use the gift to create two medical colleges - one in Florida, another in India. ""I learnt a few very early lessons in life,"" he says. ""A penny saved is a penny earned and one should drop it where it makes the maximum impact."" Dr Kiran Patel and Dr Pallavi Patel Patel grew up in the era of racial segregation in Zambia, where he had to move 80km to go to school as there was none in his town for non-white students. He attended medical school in India and moved to the US with his wife, also a medical doctor, on Thanksgiving Day in 1976. Patel went from cardiologist to businessman when he created a network of physicians with different specialities. But the real breakthrough came in 1992 when he took over a health insurance company on the verge of bankruptcy. Ten years later when the Patels sold the firm, it had more than 400,000 members and revenue in excess of $1bn. His business empire is not without controversy - earlier this year, two of his businessespaid more than $30m,externalin a settlement after accusations of artificially inflating costs for care. The firm has not admitted wrongdoing as part of the settlement. Patel likes to call himself an ""aggressive entrepreneur"" and believes in the old Gujarati adage ""When the goddess of wealth comes knocking, don't run away to wash your face"". ""I'm a risk taker and a 90 miles per hour guy, always pressing the accelerator,"" he says, then points to his wife of 44 years Dr Pallavi Patel. ""She is the one who applies the brakes."" In recent years, many successful Indian-Americans have changed their giving habits, moving from donations to temples and religious institutions to using their newly acquired wealth to shape societies back home and in the United States. The Patels are not alone in the scale of their givings. New York couple Chandrika and Ranjan Tandon pledged $100m to the NYU School of Engineering in 2015. The Sanju Bansal foundation provides backing to a number of non-profits and foundations in the Washington, DC area. Patel says philanthropy would be part of his life even if he wasn't rich. ""My father didn't have a lot but be it in Zambia or Gujarat he was always helping those who were in need,"" he says. Among the biggest beneficiaries of the Patels' largesse is the University of South Florida, where they established a research centre focused on solving problems in the developing world in a sustainable way, and a Tampa arts conservatory. They also fund a number of initiatives in India, including a 50-bed hospital in a Gujarat village. Patel says $50m of his donation to NSU will go directly to the school and $150m will go towards building a medical education complex in nearby Clearwater. The aim is partly to improve healthcare in India and Zambia and to train healthcare professionals in these countries at an affordable cost. The ultimate plan is to have Florida students get practical experience in India, and Indian students spend a year at the Florida school. By bringing American-style education to India, the philanthropist says he will be able to reduce the expenses considerably. ""A Zambian student can stay in India for less than $2,000, including accommodation and food,"" Patel says. ""We are able to help thousands of people, and at the same time provide the same quality of education as imparted in the US."" American students in India will benefit from exposure to a lots of different diseases and health situations, he says. ""To stretch the same dollar to impact 10-fold, 20-fold, 100-fold, that's what I enjoy,"" he says. What he also seems to enjoy, though, is grandiose spending. In the last five years, he purchased four private jets and is halfway through building a palace-like home that's talk of the town in Tampa, Florida. The nearly-40 bedroom mansion, built entirely in red sandstone shipped from India, is impossible to miss. More than 100 people have been working on it for the past five years. When it's finished, Patel hopes three generations of his family will live in it - including his three children and several grandchildren. So what would he say to the child who thought spending a shilling on soda and snacks was a waste? ""I like to have the best,"" he says. ""I know many will criticise me for this extravagance but some will also say -  why not?"" Patel's vast estate, under constrution His wife says flying in private jets or owning beachfront properties doesn't make them any happier than what they felt as a middle-class family. ""He has given more than he has splurged on himself,"" she says. ""I think he has earned the right to enjoy as well."" She says her husband is still frugal at heart, and that's how he's brought up his children. When their son, Shilen, was nine, he returned from school one afternoon and asked, ""Dad, are we rich?"" They were taken aback, but her husband responded: ""Maybe I am rich but you are not."" ""This is how we reminded them that they have to make their life on their own,"" she says.

"Some 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers use the Uber app in London Uber has filed an appeal against the decision by London authorities to deny it a licence to operate in London. Last month, Transport for London (TfL) refused Uber a new private hire licence, saying the ride-hailing firm was not fit and proper. TfL said it took the decision on the grounds of ""public safety and security implications"". The appeal process could take months, during which time Uber can continue to operate in London. ""While we have today filed our appeal so that Londoners can continue using our app, we hope to continue having constructive discussions with Transport for London. As our new CEO [chief executive] has said, we are determined to make things right,"" an Uber spokesperson said. TfL ""noted"" the appeal but said it would not be commenting before the hearings. Some 3.5 million passengers and 40,000 drivers use the Uber app in London. Earlier this month, Uber's new chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi met Mike Brown, who runs Transport for London. Uber described those talks as ""constructive"", while TfL said the talks ""centred on what needs to happen to ensure a thriving taxi and private hire market in London"". When TfL denied Uber its licence last month it listed four main concerns about Uber's operation: The way it reported serious criminal offences Its approach to obtaining medical certificates Uber's procedure for Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) checks for drivers The use of software that TfL claims could block the work of regulators Uber disputed those complaints, saying it had a special procedure for dealing with allegations of criminal offences. It argued that DBS checks were properly handled by a third party organisation and that TfL's concerns over its use of software were unjustified. Uber's trouble in London adds to a long list of problems faced by the company. In July, chief executive Travis Kalanick, who helped found the company in 2009,resigned following a seriesof scandals and criticism of his management style. In June,20 staff weresacked in the US after a law firm investigated complaints made to the company about sexual harassment, bullying and retaliation for reporting problems. Last year, Uber lost a landmarkemployment tribunal in the UK which ruleddrivers should be classed as workers rather than being self-employed.

"Joy for now, but will the truce deal last? Some Palestinians have been taking to the streets of Gaza to celebrate the new reconciliation deal agreed by their rival political factions, Hamas and Fatah. Others I speak to are more cautious, but desperately hope an end is in sight to a decade-long feud they feel has damaged the nationalist cause. The deal, brokered by Egypt, is expected to see the Palestinian Authority (PA), dominated by Fatah, resume full control of the coastal territory by 1 December. The PA and its security forces were ousted from Gaza in 2007, when Hamas seized control, a year after winning legislative elections. Hamas and Fatah end split on Gaza Gaza residents left in the dark Has Hamas changed? For Naim al-Khatib, a father of six, ""Hamas are showing some flexibility which is unprecedented.  It gives us hope that people are being pragmatic, seeing themselves as Palestinians, rather than as part of a global, Islamic group."" ""There are lots of difficult issues still to tackle - but the opposite of reconciliation is a very gloomy situation which I would hate us to step into,"" he adds. Recently, Gaza's nearly two million residents have suffered as political divisions deepened and President Mahmoud Abbas piled financial pressure on Hamas. There is already no electricity in the Gaza Strip for up to 20 hours per day Waste-water treatment has largely halted, resulting in the discharge of sewage into the sea His PA imposed heavy taxes on fuel for the strip's only power plant and reduced the amount of electricity bought from Israel for Gaza. Mains electricity now comes on for just a few hours a day. This leaves water desalination and sewage treatment plants unable to work properly. Over 60,000 civil servants, still getting salaries from the PA even though they cannot work, were cut by a third. Supplies of medicines were halted. The reconciliation deal was signed by Fatah's Azam al-Ahmed (right) and the deputy head of the Hamas politburo Saleh al-Aruri Now it is expected some sanctions will be reversed. ""We hope electricity will come back immediately. It's a basis for normal life,"" says Amal, a teacher. ""I think this will solve our sewage problem. We Gazans are very attached to the sea and we hope it will be clean again."" Israel and Egypt tightened their blockade of Gaza after the Hamas takeover. Who are Hamas? Who are Fatah? Where are the Palestinian territories? The new agreement is expected to see PA forces return to border crossings, which could ease the movement of people and goods. ""We want to see free movement in and out of Gaza - to the West Bank, Egypt and Israel for medical purposes and for education,"" Amal says. ""Such steps will make us feel reconciliation is serious."" Previous reconciliation deals have quickly fallen apart, and the latest announcements from Cairo have not made clear how some long-standing sticking points can be resolved. They include the fate of Hamas's 25,000-strong military wing, the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades. Hamas is also classed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the United States and the European Union. The latter are both major donors to the PA - but would find it difficult to support a unity government that includes Hamas. Will Mahmoud Abbas now visit Gaza - for the first time in a decade? More tricky negotiations are now due to be held ahead of a meeting of all the Palestinian political movements in Cairo on 21 November. ""What's happened is a good step, it's positive, but this is just the beginning,"" says Mustafa Barghouti, general secretary of the Palestinian National Initiative. ""The next few weeks are very crucial because what's been agreed must be implemented. All the Palestinian factions, not just Hamas and Fatah, must then decide on a unified government and a date for elections."" Some reports suggest that if all goes to plan President Abbas could soon visit Gaza for the first time in a decade as part of the reconciliation effort. That would be a huge turnaround: a recent Palestinian opinion poll indicated that demand for his resignation stood at 67% overall and 80% in Gaza. Which, paradoxically, brings out one of the reasons why some commentators believe this bid at reconciliation has better chances of success. At 82, some reason that Mr Abbas has an eye on his political legacy and little to lose. Likewise Hamas, an ideological offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood, has found itself on the wrong side of recent regional events. Faced with increased isolation, it has reached out to Cairo for help. In turn, Egyptian leaders are very keen to improve security in the restive Sinai Peninsula, which borders Gaza, and after the turbulent years following the Arab Spring, they are looking to restore their role as regional power brokers.

"Anne Cameron was reported missing on Tuesday Police searching for a missing woman in Australia say she is likely to have been killed by a crocodile. Anne Cameron, 79, was reported missing from a nursing home near the Queensland town of Port Douglas on Tuesday. Clothes and a walking stick bearing the name of Ms Cameron, who suffers from dementia, were found next to a creek. On Friday, police said remains found nearby had been confirmed as human and they were ""highly likely"" to belong to Ms Cameron. ""We strongly suspect now that there has been involvement of a crocodile attack,"" Acting Inspector Ed Lukin said. ""There will be forensic tests done on those remains, but I will stress that there are no other missing persons in the Port Douglas area."" Police suspect that Ms Cameron was attacked after walking into bushland about 2km (1.2 miles) from the nursing home. She had moved to the nursing home recently to be closer to relatives, local media said. Wildlife officers will set crocodile traps in the area where the remains were found.

"Samsung Electronics chief executive Kwon Oh-hyun has resigned citing an ""unprecedented crisis"". It is the latest management upheaval at the firm after the heir of the entire Samsung Group was imprisoned for corruption in August. Mr Kwon is one of three co-chief executives of Samsung Electronics. His resignation comes on the same day the firm forecast record quarterly profits, citing higher memory chip prices. Mr Kwon said he had been thinking about his departure ""for quite some time"" and could ""no longer put it off."" ""As we are confronted with unprecedented crisis inside out, I believe that time has now come for the company [to] start anew, with a new spirit and young leadership to better respond to challenges arising from the rapidly changing IT industry,"" he said in a statement. He will remain on the board of Samsung Electronics until March 2018. Ryan Lim, founding partner of the Singapore technology consultancy QED said ""Samsung is in a leadership crisis situation"". Mr Lim said ""the current management structure seems to be a complicated web that does not clarify, but rather confuses"". ""This needs to be resolved soon as it can be worrying not to know who is truly steering the Samsung behemoth into the future,"" he said. In response to the criticism, a spokesperson for Samsung Electronics told the BBC that a successor would be appointed ""soon"" but could not give a timeframe. Samsung Electronics is regarded as the jewel in the crown of the Samsung Group conglomerate, which is made up of 60 interlinked companies and is one of South Korea's massive family-run businesses known as chaebols. In August, the group's heir apparent Lee Jae-yong was convicted of bribery and corruption and sentenced to five years in jail. Mr Lee was accusedof giving donations worth 41bn won ($36m; Â£29m) to non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a friend of South Korea's former President Park Geun-hye, in return for political favours. He was back in court on Thursday, appealing against his jail term. Lee Jae-yong was convicted in August on corruption and bribery charges Andrew Milroy, head of advisory services at technology consultancy Ovum, said Samsung needed to regain the confidence of the government and financial markets in the aftermath of the corruption scandal. ""This may mean new senior management who are not associated with the past,"" he said. However, the leadership troubles do not appear to have hit the company's bottom line yet. Ahead of the announcement from Mr Kwon, Samsung Electronics said it would report a record quarterly profits thanks to surging chip prices. The world's largest smartphone maker said operating profit in the three months to the end of September is expected to have tripled from a year earlier. The forecast profit of 14.5tn won (Â£9.65bn; $12.81bn) beats market expectations for the quarter. While memory chips were the main driver of Samsung's profits, its mobile phone business was given a boost by itsnew Note 8 smartphonewhich received the firm's highest number of pre-orders. But scope for continued earnings growth from smartphones is likely to narrow. Ovum's Mr Milroy said the market was slowing and despite record results the company ""faces a lot of risk"". ""It may be felt that someone new can drive greater innovation and manage the firms move into new areas as the smartphone market matures,"" he said.

"George Weah is senator for Montserrado County in Liberia Partial results from Liberia's presidential election show former football star George Weah has taken an early lead. Figures from the National Elections Commission (NEC) put Mr Weah ahead in 11 out of 15 counties, although most votes have yet to be counted. His main rival, incumbent Vice-President Joseph Boakai, leads in one county and is second in most others. A candidate needs more than 50% of the votes for outright victory. If no-one achieves that, a second round will be held in November. The election is to choose a successor to Ellen Johnson Sirleaf - Africa's first elected female president and a Nobel Peace laureate. As the results came in, the manager of Arsenal Football Club, Arsene Wenger, was apparentlyduped by false reportsthat Mr Weah had won. Arsene Wenger coached George Weah in the 1990s when he was in charge of French club Monaco ""I would like to congratulate one of my former players, who became president of Liberia,"" Mr Wenger told reporters. ""It's not often you have a former player who becomes president of a country. So well done, Georgie."" Is ex-warlord pulling Liberia's election strings from UK prison? Find out more about Liberia NEC Chairman Jerome Korkoya hit out at false reports and said his officials were doing their best to get accurate official results out as quickly as possible. ""This commission has not declared any winner,"" he stressed. International election observers said they had not identified any major problems with Tuesday's voting. However, parties supporting three of the 20 candidates have alleged irregularities and said they would contest the result, Reuters reported. Vice-President Joseph Boakai says the Liberian people want to see more development Ms Sirleaf, 78, who is stepping down at the end of two terms, hailed the election as a success. ""We believe that all Liberians are ready for this process. I thank them for participating in this process,"" she said. George Weah, 51: Former Fifa World Footballer of the Year Arsene Wenger, now at Arsenal, was Weah's coach at Monaco in 1990s Has the political backing of jailed warlord and former President Charles Taylor Taylor's ex-wife, Jewel Howard Taylor, is his running mate. Joseph Boakai, 73: Nicknamed ""Sleepy Joe"" Denies it is because he is often caught napping at public events, says it is because he is a dreamer Vice-President under Ellen Johnson Sirleaf since 2005 Has distanced himself from her record, saying ""a lot more needs to be achieved"". Liberia, which was founded by freed US slaves in the 19th Century, has not had a smooth transfer of power in 73 years. Ms Sirleaf took office in 2006, after her predecessor, Charles Taylor, was forced out of office by rebels in 2003, ending a long civil war. Taylor is currently serving a 50-year prison sentence in the UK for war crimes related to the conflict in neighbouring Sierra Leone.

"The award was presented by Ian Walker and Julian La Bastide, who had both met the princess Prince Harry has paid tribute to his late mother's work in raising awareness of HIV and Aids, and urged more people to ""embrace regular testing"". The prince was speaking at the Attitude magazine awards, where Princess Diana was posthumously honoured with the Legacy award, 20 years after her death. Prince Harry said if his mother were still alive, she would be ""standing alongside"" those living with HIV. The prince collected the award on Thursday night on her behalf. In April 1987, Princess Diana opened the UK's first purpose built HIV/Aids unit that exclusively cared for patients infected with the virus, at London Middlesex Hospital. In front of the world's media, she shook the hand of a man suffering with the illness. She did so without gloves, publicly challenging the stigma and notion that HIV/Aids was passed from person to person by touch. ""She knew that Aids was one of the things that many wanted to ignore and seemed like a hopeless challenge,"" he told the awards ceremony in London. ""She knew that the misunderstanding of this relatively new disease was creating a dangerous situation when mixed with homophobia. ""So, when, that April [in 1987], she took the hand of a 32-year-old man with HIV, in front of the cameras, she knew exactly what she was doing."" How Princess Diana changed attitudes to Aids Prep: HIV 'game-changer' to reach NHS in England from September Prince Harry and Rihanna get HIV tests in Barbados Princess Diana visiting the London Lighthouse, a centre for people affected by HIV in October 1996 The prince said he and his brother, the Duke of Cambridge, were ""incredibly proud of what our mother achieved"". If she were still alive, he said she ""would be demanding"" free and available testing and treatment for people all across the world. ""I believe that she would be telling everyone across society - not just those most at risk - that with effective treatment being free and available in the UK, that we must all embrace regular testing - both for our own sake and for those that we love,"" he added.

"Protesters outside the White House have urged Donald Trump to back the deal US President Donald Trump will accuse Iran of failing to comply with an international nuclear deal, according to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Mr Trump will refuse to certify the deal and refer it to Congress, he told reporters. Such a move would not mean a US withdrawal from the deal that freezes Iran's nuclear programme, but it is part of a tougher strategy on Iran. President Trump was due to speak from the White House at 16:45 GMT. He is under pressure at home and abroad not to scrap the seven-country deal agreed in 2015, under which Iran has halted its nuclear programme in return for the partial lifting of sanctions. In his speech, Mr Trump is expected to accuse Tehran of pursuing ""death and destruction"". It is thought he will also focus on its non-nuclear activities, particularly those of the Revolutionary Guards (RIG), which has been accused of supporting terrorism. During the presidential election campaign in 2016, Mr Trump pledged to throw out the agreement concluded under his predecessor, Barack Obama. But senior cabinet officials advised him not to as Iran was abiding by its terms, so Mr Trump has opted for a middle road, reports the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington. Worshippers shouted anti-US slogans during Friday prayers in Tehran Mr Trump was due to say the agreement did not meet certain conditions of US law, but he would let Congress decide its fate, Mr Tillerson said. Congress could choose to pull out of the deal, but Mr Tillerson said the administration would advise it instead to establish guidelines under which the US could automatically re-impose sanctions: trigger points, he called them. The Trump administration wants to broaden Iran policy beyond the nuclear deal. This, said Mr Tillerson, would include sanctioning members of the powerful Revolutionary Guards force for supporting militant groups and terrorist activities. Among the changes it is seekingis the end to the ""sunset"" clauses in the deal, one of which sees restrictions on Iran's nuclear enrichment programme lifted after 2025, greater access to nuclear sites and the inclusion of Iran's ballistic missile programme. This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran deal Under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (Ingra), Congress requires the US president to certify every 90 days that Iran is upholding its part of the nuclear agreement. Mr Trump has already recertified it twice and has a deadline of Sunday to make his latest report back. Refusal to recertify would give Congress 60 days to decide whether to pull out of the nuclear deal by re-imposing sanctions. Astrategy paper,externalreleased by the White House highlights calls for neutralising Iran's ""destabilising influence and constraining its aggression, particularly its support for terrorism and militants"". The US, it says, will work to revitalise traditional alliances and regional partnerships as ""bulwarks against Iranian subversion"". This video can not be played President Trump and Iran's President Rouhani traded insults at the UN Efforts will be made to deny funding for the Iranian government and the RIG's ""malign activities"" and counter threats from ballistic missiles ""and other asymmetric weapons"". The nuclear deal does not comprehensively cover the missile development programmes, and last monthIran successfully tested a new-medium range missilewith a 2,000km (1,200-mile) range. The IRGC's ""gross violations of human rights"" will be highlighted to the rest of the world,"" the strategy paper says. ""Most importantly, we will deny the Iranian regime all paths to a nuclear weapon."" What will Trump do about the deal? Foreign leaders, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron, have urged Mr Trump to keep the deal. ""We also have to tell the Americans that their behaviour on the Iran issue will drive us Europeans into a common position with Russia and China against the USA,"" German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel warned in a newspaper interview. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that US withdrawal from the nuclear deal would ""damage the atmosphere of predictability, security, stability and non-proliferation in the entire world"". Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt said a US withdrawal from the deal would show it could not be relied upon and could have ramifications elsewhere, for example on efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. The IAEA and Congress currently both agree Iran is complying with the terms of the nuclear agreement. The speaker of the Iranian parliament, Ali Larijani, said on a visit to Russia that a US withdrawal from the deal would signal its end. He warned that the collapse of the deal could result in global chaos, Russian media report. Formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, it is designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon. It lifted some sanctions that stopped Iran from trading on international markets and selling oil. The lifting of sanctions is dependent on Iran restricting its nuclear programme. It must curb its uranium stockpile, build no more heavy-water reactors for 15 years and allow inspectors into the country. Key details of the Iran nuclear deal Set up shortly after the 1979 Iranian revolution to defend the country's Islamic system, they provide a counterweight to the regular armed forces. They are a major military, political and economic force in Iran, with some 125,000 active members, and oversee strategic weapons. They have been accused of supporting Shia Muslim militants in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria. What next for the Iran nuclear deal?

"This video can not be played Adama Jammeh told the BBC ""every day I'm more angry"" A security guard who claims he was sacked from Tesco after being wrongly accused of stealing has spent the night in the supermarket's roof space. Adama Jammeh has been on the girders above the checkouts in Tesco Extra, Reading, for more than 20 hours, live-streaming on Facebook. Shoppers were told to abandon their trolleys and leave the store as he climbed to the roof yelling. Mr Jammeh told the BBC he was ""stressed and angry"". Tesco said it was ""assisting police with the matter"". The 46-year-old said he was falsely accused of stealing electrical goods worth Â£20,000 by the supermarket chain, which led to his sacking by security firm Total Security Services (TSS). The father-of-two has spent the past six months staging a one-man protest outside the Portman Road store with banners. Mr Jammeh, originally from Gambia, started the roof protest just after 18:00 BST on Thursday and says he has not slept and barely eaten. ""I'm stressed and angry but I'm still surviving up here,"" he said. This video can not be played Mr Jammeh's wife Dawn said her husband ""could be up there for days"" ""I've been protesting my innocence for six complete months and nothing has been done about it, they [Tesco] have ignored me. ""Every day I'm more angry. I'm only alive when I come out here to Tesco protesting my innocence. ""So yesterday I decided it was the last straw for me."" Mr Jammeh said he would only come down if Tesco bosses apologise and ""pay lost earnings"". In one of his videos on Facebook, he apologised to shoppers. ""Sorry for some of you that are supposed to come here shopping in this store,"" he said. ""It's inconvenient, sorry for that people but it's something I have to do."" Mr Jammeh apologised to shoppers in one of his Facebook videos His wife of 18 years, Dawn, is outside the supermarket supporting him. She told BBC Berkshire reporter Nick Johnson ""he will not be coming down willingly"" and they are prepared to ""accept the consequences"". ""He's been wrongfully accused of stealing,"" she said. ""Tesco accused him, told his workplace and his workplace sacked him straight away. ""Police went through CCTV which took them 10 months to go through and said he was an innocent man and that it was somebody else. ""He's had no apology off Tesco, no apology off TSS, and this is why he's protesting now."" Mr Jammeh began streaming his protest online at about 18:15 BST on Thursday The store's management team is also outside but refusing to comment. A Tesco spokesperson said they have nothing further to add. A TSS spokesperson said: ""We are aware of the incident involving a former employee of Total Security Services and are assisting the police and Tesco in this matter."" Thames Valley Police is yet to respond to claims of Mr Jammeh's innocence. Tesco said it was helping police with the matter The security guard has banners outside the supermarket The Tesco Extra West store was evacuated just after 18:00 BST on Thursday after the police received reports concerning the ""welfare of a man"". Tesco said the company was still establishing the circumstances of the incident but believed the man had not been directly employed by Tesco but was a member of security staff. A statement said: ""We're aware of an incident at our Reading West Extra store and are assisting police with the matter.""

"Fire crews battle the fast-moving flames near the evacuated town of Calistoga The number of people confirmed dead in wildfires sweeping northern California has climbed to 31, as officials warned that conditions would worsen. Hundreds of people remain missing as at least 22 fires rampaged across the state's famous wine country. More than 8,000 firefighters are now battling the flames. The wildfires have destroyed more than 3,500 buildings and homes over 190,000 acres (77,000 hectares) and displaced about 25,000 people. Seventeen people are now confirmed killed in Sonoma County, with another eight in Mendocino County, four in Yuba County and two in Napa County, officials said. The updated casualty figures mean the wildfires are the deadliest in California since 1933, when 29 people died in fires at Griffith Park in Los Angeles. Strong winds that have fanned the flames eased in recent days, but forecasters warned they were set to pick up again on Friday night. This video can not be played California districts wiped out by wildfires Prison inmates have been called in to help fight the fires ""We are not even close to being out of this emergency,"" Mark Ghilarducci, state director of emergency services, told reporters. State fire chief Ken Pimlott warned of ""erratic, shifting winds all weekend"". Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano said recovery teams with cadaver dogs were searching the smouldering ruins of homes. Wineries count cost of wildfires disaster The prisoners fighting wildfires in California ""We have found bodies that were completely intact, and we have found bodies that were no more than ash and bone,"" he said. Ten victims, with an average age of 75 years old, have been identified so far, Sheriff Giordano said. Some of the elderly victims were identified by ""a piece of metal left from somebody's surgery, like a hip replacement, with an ID number that helped us identify the person"", he added. It is not yet clear what started the fires on Sunday night, but officials say power lines blown over by strong winds could be the cause. One of the greatest threats to life is believed to be around the town of Calistoga, Napa County, where the entire population of 5,000 has been ordered to evacuate. Calistoga Mayor Chris Canning warned residents to stay away since rescuers would not be able guarantee their safety. ""You are on your own,"" said Mayor Canning. Only chimneys remain standing in fire-ravaged districts of Santa Rosa Geyserville, a town of around 800 people, and the community of Boyes Hot Springs, both in Sonoma, were also evacuated. The huge fires have sent smoke and ash over San Francisco, about 50 miles away, and over some towns and cities even further south. At least 13 Napa Valley wineries have been destroyed, a vintners' trade group says. Cannabis plantations in fire-scorched Mendocino County could lose millions as many are uninsured, according to Nikki Lastreto of the local industry association. Marijuana farmers cannot insure their businesses since federal law bans the drug. Though recreational cannabis was legalised in the state in 2016, California's retail market does not open until next January.

"Protesters outside the White House have urged Donald Trump to back the deal US President Donald Trump will accuse Iran of failing to comply with an international nuclear deal, according to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Mr Trump will refuse to certify the deal and refer it to Congress, he told reporters. Such a move would not mean a US withdrawal from the deal that freezes Iran's nuclear programme, but it is part of a tougher strategy on Iran. President Trump was due to speak from the White House at 16:45 GMT. He is under pressure at home and abroad not to scrap the seven-country deal agreed in 2015, under which Iran has halted its nuclear programme in return for the partial lifting of sanctions. In his speech, Mr Trump is expected to accuse Tehran of pursuing ""death and destruction"". It is thought he will also focus on its non-nuclear activities, particularly those of the Revolutionary Guards (RIG), which has been accused of supporting terrorism. During the presidential election campaign in 2016, Mr Trump pledged to throw out the agreement concluded under his predecessor, Barack Obama. But senior cabinet officials advised him not to as Iran was abiding by its terms, so Mr Trump has opted for a middle road, reports the BBC's Barbara Plett Usher in Washington. Worshippers shouted anti-US slogans during Friday prayers in Tehran Mr Trump was due to say the agreement did not meet certain conditions of US law, but he would let Congress decide its fate, Mr Tillerson said. Congress could choose to pull out of the deal, but Mr Tillerson said the administration would advise it instead to establish guidelines under which the US could automatically re-impose sanctions: trigger points, he called them. The Trump administration wants to broaden Iran policy beyond the nuclear deal. This, said Mr Tillerson, would include sanctioning members of the powerful Revolutionary Guards force for supporting militant groups and terrorist activities. Among the changes it is seekingis the end to the ""sunset"" clauses in the deal, one of which sees restrictions on Iran's nuclear enrichment programme lifted after 2025, greater access to nuclear sites and the inclusion of Iran's ballistic missile programme. This video can not be played A timeline of what Trump's said about the Iran deal Under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (Ingra), Congress requires the US president to certify every 90 days that Iran is upholding its part of the nuclear agreement. Mr Trump has already recertified it twice and has a deadline of Sunday to make his latest report back. Refusal to recertify would give Congress 60 days to decide whether to pull out of the nuclear deal by re-imposing sanctions. Astrategy paper,externalreleased by the White House highlights calls for neutralising Iran's ""destabilising influence and constraining its aggression, particularly its support for terrorism and militants"". The US, it says, will work to revitalise traditional alliances and regional partnerships as ""bulwarks against Iranian subversion"". This video can not be played President Trump and Iran's President Rouhani traded insults at the UN Efforts will be made to deny funding for the Iranian government and the RIG's ""malign activities"" and counter threats from ballistic missiles ""and other asymmetric weapons"". The nuclear deal does not comprehensively cover the missile development programmes, and last monthIran successfully tested a new-medium range missilewith a 2,000km (1,200-mile) range. The IRGC's ""gross violations of human rights"" will be highlighted to the rest of the world,"" the strategy paper says. ""Most importantly, we will deny the Iranian regime all paths to a nuclear weapon."" What will Trump do about the deal? Foreign leaders, including UK Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macron, have urged Mr Trump to keep the deal. ""We also have to tell the Americans that their behaviour on the Iran issue will drive us Europeans into a common position with Russia and China against the USA,"" German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel warned in a newspaper interview. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that US withdrawal from the nuclear deal would ""damage the atmosphere of predictability, security, stability and non-proliferation in the entire world"". Former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt said a US withdrawal from the deal would show it could not be relied upon and could have ramifications elsewhere, for example on efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue. The IAEA and Congress currently both agree Iran is complying with the terms of the nuclear agreement. The speaker of the Iranian parliament, Ali Larijani, said on a visit to Russia that a US withdrawal from the deal would signal its end. He warned that the collapse of the deal could result in global chaos, Russian media report. Formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, it is designed to prevent Iran developing a nuclear weapon. It lifted some sanctions that stopped Iran from trading on international markets and selling oil. The lifting of sanctions is dependent on Iran restricting its nuclear programme. It must curb its uranium stockpile, build no more heavy-water reactors for 15 years and allow inspectors into the country. Key details of the Iran nuclear deal Set up shortly after the 1979 Iranian revolution to defend the country's Islamic system, they provide a counterweight to the regular armed forces. They are a major military, political and economic force in Iran, with some 125,000 active members, and oversee strategic weapons. They have been accused of supporting Shia Muslim militants in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria. What next for the Iran nuclear deal?

"The UK economy grew at a muted rate in the third quarter of 2017 despite progress in the manufacturing sector, the British Chambers of Commerce says. The number of manufacturers reporting improved domestic sales and orders rose in the quarter to its highest level since early 2015, the BCC said. Export sales and orders in the sector also improved. But in services, domestic sales and orders remained static, as did the sector's employment expectations. The BCC said its survey also showed the prevalence of recruitment difficulties facing UK businesses, which worsened further during the quarter. Almost three-quarters of manufacturers reported difficulties hiring staff, and in services, the percentage rose to its highest since early 2016. BCC director general Dr Adam Marshall said: ""The uninspiring results we see in our third-quarter findings reflect the fact that political uncertainty, currency fluctuations and the vagaries of the Brexit process are continuing to weigh on business growth prospects. ""The chancellor's autumn Budget is a critical opportunity to demonstrate that the government stands ready to incentivise investment and support growth here at home. ""While much of Westminster and Whitehall is distracted by Brexit, business needs action now on the home front. The solutions to some of the biggest issues currently facing our firms - including high up-front costs, a lack of incentive to invest, and a need for better infrastructure - are entirely within the power of the UK government to deliver."" The BCC also said that in the current economic climate, it seemed ""extraordinary"" that the Bank of England was considering raising interest rates. ""We'd caution against an earlier than required tightening in monetary policy, which could hit both business and consumer confidence and weaken overall UK growth,"" said BCC head of economics Suren Thiru. ""While interest rates need to rise at some point, it should be done slowly and timed to not harm the UK's growth prospects."" Buoyancy in the UK manufacturing sector is not universal at the moment, one company said. Andrew Varga, managing director of Seetru, a Bristol-based manufacturer of safety valves for industry, told the BBC's Today programme his firm was ""slightly more pessimistic"" than the BCC. ""We see some startling results. Despite the buoyant European economy, we see an accelerating reduction in order pull from Europe. Clearly uncertainty is having a really significant effect on customers' choices of which country they buy from, and they're not buying from the UK any more."" He added that the UK market was ""depressed"". ""Like-for-like sales are clearly down - down about 10%,"" he said. ""This is all due to [Brexit] uncertainty at the moment."" Clare Flynn Levy, founder and chief executive of financial behavioural analytics software firm Essentia Analytics, told the BBC that for her company ""life's a bit more optimistic"". ""But I'm not surprised to hear that the services sector is static, because there is a massive energy suck toward people decisions and mobility decisions that are caused by Brexit, and the uncertainty is just causing energy that would otherwise be devoted to selling and delivering services to clients to be pulled into scenario planning... so people are sort of frozen,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Friday 13th: Why is it unlucky? It's Friday 13th - allegedly the most cursed day of the calendar and when everything is fated to go wrong. But where did we get the idea that it's a date when bad things happen? Walking through Birmingham city centre, everyone I ask has heard the myth that dark forces are at work on this ""dreaded day"". But do they really believe it? John and Gillie Hemmer say they have ""no qualms"" about Friday 13th Sitting on a bench in Victoria Square are John and Gillie Hemmer who say they have ""no qualms"" about the date. ""My mum was actually born on Friday 13th,"" says Mrs Hemmer. ""She always thought it was a lucky day - and so do I."" Sitting nearby is Niall Johnstone, who thinks the whole idea is a joke. ""It was put there as something else to worry about,"" says the 26-year-old. ""It's Friday - you've got to love a Friday."" Niall Johnstone thinks every Friday is something to celebrate Not everyone is so relaxed about it. In the shadow of the cathedral I find a woman who does believe, even though her sceptical companions cast their doubts. ""It's just a feeling,"" says Aurora Marin, from Romania. But where does the myth come from? The belief that Fridays were unlucky stems from it being the day of the crucifixion, according to one expert Friday and the number 13 have always been unlucky in their own right, says Steve Roud, author of The Penguin Guide to the Superstitions of Britain and Ireland. ""Because Friday was the day of the crucifixion, Fridays were always regarded as a day of penance and abstinence. ""This religious belief spilled over into a general dislike of starting anything - or doing anything important - on a Friday."" To further compound the chance of peril, an urban legend started circulating sometime in the 1690s that it was unlucky to have 13 people around a table or in a group, he explains. Folklorist Anne Marie Lagram - herself a ""strong believer"" - says theories behind ""unlucky 13"" include the number of people present at the Last Supper or the number of witches to make a coven. But it was the Victorians who put the two together, says the author of the Country Wisdom and Folklore Diary. ""They were intrigued by folklore and put Friday and 13 together and created a doubly unlucky day."" Georgian Diaconu and Alina Gheorghita are not superstitious but Aurora Marin says she is There are numerous well-known superstitions, involving black cats, ladders and cracks in the pavement. But where does the sense of foreboding come from? ""Superstition comes from a time when life was uncertain and you felt you didn't have control,"" says Mr Roud. ""There became a notion of fate as being something you could control by doing lucky things or avoiding doing unlucky things."" For example, Ms Marin - ever the cautious - makes sure to complete a ritual if she sees a black cat. ""If I see one I go back three steps."" A black cat crossing your path can be lucky or unlucky according to superstition Why Friday 13th is lucky for me English rainy day phrases explained Why does the school year start in September? Many superstitions are to do with the idea of upsetting the order of the world, says Mr Roud. ""Opening umbrellas indoors is unlucky and a spade or a wild bird in the house means death. It's the same with shoes on the table - they belong on the floor."" Some stay in our minds as they have become part of our language, he adds. ""Although I count myself as the least superstitious man in the country, I say 'fingers crossed' and 'touch wood'."" The idea that it is bad luck to put shoes on a table is down to objects being out of place and upsetting the order of the world Superstitions are learned from other people and persist because they are as good as any other strategy in situations beyond our control, says Michael Aitkin, psychology lecturer at Kings College London. ""Whatever action an individual is doing just before they experience something rewarding might become a superstitious behaviour, which is later repeated even if it is unrelated to the reward,"" he says. These personal superstitions are common among people who have dangerous jobs or those that leave a lot to chance, says Mr Roud. Indeed, some footballers are slaves toridiculous rituals. Mrs Hemming says once a lucky or unlucky notion gets into your head it is ""very hard to un-know it"" and more of an effort to avoid it than go along with it. ""If you know it's unlucky to walk on the cracks in the pavement and you've got an important interview that day you wouldn't take a chance on it,"" she says. Joan Carthy and Paulette Hall say they think Friday 13th is ""just another day"" Joan Carthy and Paulette Hall are sitting on a windowsill in Birmingham city centre waiting to go to work. ""The only one I won't do is walk under ladders,"" says Ms Carthy. ""It's common sense, there's always something going to fall on you. And knowing my luck it'd be a house brick."" ""I've never had bad luck on Friday 13th,"" says Ms Hall.  ""It's just another day,"" Ms Carthy replies. Mrs Lagram errs on the side of caution. ""I always feel a bit wary when I'm out and about and will send a message to my daughter to be doubly careful on that day."" Couldn't hurt, could it?
