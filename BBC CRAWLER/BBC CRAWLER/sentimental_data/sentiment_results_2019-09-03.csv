"Officials appear to have dismissed having mobile food standards checks away from the Irish border The prime minister has suggested he is open to an all-Ireland food standards zone as part of a solution to replace the Brexit backstop. Food standards are one of the most difficult border issues. That is due to strict EU rules that say products from a non-member state must be checked at the point of entry. If Northern Ireland was to align with the Republic of Ireland, it would effectively continue to follow EU rules. What is the Irish border backstop? Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? How could backstop alternatives work? That would mean that some food products coming from elsewhere in the UK would be subject to new checks and controls at Northern Ireland ports. It came as Boris Johnson faced MPs in the Commons ahead of a showdown over Brexit. In a blow to the prime minister,Tory rebels and opposition MPs defeated the government in the first stage of their attempt to pass a law designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson has said he will visit Dublin on Monday to meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. The prime minister said he wants to discuss the issue with the EU, and during the meeting with Mr Varadkar next week. By John Campbell, BBC News NI economics and business editor Would an all-island food standards zone be the backstop by another name? Not quite. The backstop would involve Northern Ireland following a range of single market rules beyond food and agriculture. There's also the question of consent by unionist parties in Northern Ireland. The prime minister said an all-island arrangement would have to ""clearly enjoy the consent of all parties and institutions with an interest"". That suggests unionists would have to be convinced that the governance of such an arrangement would give them a greater say than have under the current backstop. And remember, the backstop is only supposed to be temporary. Would this food standards zone be intended as a permanent arrangement, just like the existing all-island animal health zone? Mr Johnson said he recognises that ""for reasons of geography and economics, agrifood is increasingly managed on a common basis across the island"". He told the Commons: ""We are ready to find ways forward that recognises this reality, provided it clearly enjoys the consent of all parties and institutions with an interest."" That suggests any arrangement would need to have the support of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and other unionists. DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds told BBC Newsline that the party would be ""willing to sit down and look at what Boris is looking at and what can be done"". ""We want to get a deal provided it's within the parameters of ensuring that it's not economically and constitutionally injurious to the union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland,"" he added. The island of Ireland is already a single zone for animal health, which meansall livestock coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain is checked on entry. If it was also to be a single zone for food standards, it would mean that some products coming from elsewhere in the UK would be subject to new checks and controls at Northern Ireland ports. Earlier this week, a leaked government document suggested an all-Ireland food standards zone is being considered as part of a solution to replace the Brexit backstop. The document states that alignment of standards between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is seen as ""one of the most practical, deliverable and negotiable facilitations"". Livestock that enters Northern Ireland from Great Britain is checked on entry However, it cautions that such an arrangement comes with many of the same political challenges as the backstop. In relation to the document, a government spokesperson declined to comment. ""We have been clear that we stand ready to negotiate in good faith an alternative to the backstop, with provisions to ensure that the Irish border issues are dealt with where they should always have been, in the negotiations on the future agreement between the UK and the EU,"" the spokesperson said. ""We have likewise always said that these issues will require a package of measures addressing different customs and regulatory aspects, rather than just one single solution."" The backstop is a position of last resort to prevent the hardening of the Irish border in the absence of other solutions. It would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market and the whole of the UK forming a ""temporary single customs territory"" with the EU. The prime minister has said the backstop cannot form part of any Brexit deal. Meanwhile, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there was now an inevitability about a general election in the coming weeks after Mr Johnson's government lost its working majority. On Tuesday night, the Commons voted 328 to 301 to take control of the agenda, meaning they can bring forward a bill seeking to delay the UK's exit date. In response, the prime minister said he would bring forward a motion for an early general election. ""If the general election is forced because of Brexit, then inevitably Brexit is going to be front and centre in the election,"" Sir Jeffrey said.

"The claim:Delaying Brexit would cost the UK Â£1bn a month in payments to the EU budget. Reality Check verdict:Mr Raab is right that staying in the EU would cost Â£1bn a month in budget payments. But his figure excludes any money the government gets back from the EU in grants for things like regional development or supporting farmers. When you factor these in, the figure comes down to about Â£744m a month. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab spoke to the BBC on Tuesday about the attempts by Members of Parliament to pass a bill to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The bill would try to force the government to seek an extension to Brexit (scheduled to happen on 31 October 2019) until 31 January 2020. Mr Raab said that would cost taxpayers Â£1bn per month. He's right that if Brexit were delayed and the UK continued to be a member of the European Union (EU) it would carry on paying into the EU budget. According to the UK Treasury's,externallatest figures, in 2018 the UK's gross contribution to the EU budget was Â£17.4bn. However, the UK did not transfer this amount to the EU because before any money is sent to Brussels, the UK rebate is deducted first. The rebate is the UK's discount on its contributions to the EU, negotiated by Margaret Thatcher in 1984. The rebate in 2018 was Â£4.2bn, so the UK actually paid Â£13.2bn into the EU budget. The Treasury then received Â£4.3bn from the EU, for payments to farmers, development and other projects (money allocated by the EU and distributed by the UK government). When you factor this in it brings the UK's net contribution to Â£8.9bn, or Â£744m a month. The EU also makes some payments directly to the private sector in the UK, to fund research for example. These payments do not appear in the Treasury's accounts, but the Treasury estimated that in 2016 these payments were around Â£2.3bn, or Â£192m a month. Staying in the EU beyond 31 October and continuing to make payments would also have an impact on any Brexit ""divorce payment"" the UK agrees to make to the EU. Theresa May agreed to settle the UK's financial obligations to the EU as part of her Withdrawal Agreement. This was originally calculated at about Â£39bn, much of which covered the UK's contributions to the EU Budget up to the end of the planned transition period at the end of 2020. Does the UK owe the EU Â£39bn? The Office for Budget Responsibility said as a result of the delay to the Brexit date from the original 29 March to 31 October, the current bill would be about Â£33bn because the UK's continuing membership of the EU means that some of those payments have been made as normal budget contributions instead of as part of the divorce payment. If Brexit were to be delayed further, the payments that Mr Raab referred to would further reduce this bill. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Greenland's massive ice sheet may have melted by a record amount this year, scientists have warned. During this year alone, it lost enough ice to raise the average global sea level by more than a millimetre. Researchers say they're ""astounded"" by the acceleration in melting and fear for the future of cities on coasts around the world. One glacier in southern Greenland has thinned by as much as 100 metres since I last filmed on it back in 2004. Essentially because its ice sheet is seven times the area of the UK and up to 2-3km thick in places. It stores so much frozen water that if the whole thing melted, it would raise sea levels worldwide by up to 7m. No one is suggesting that could happen for hundreds or even thousands of years but even a small increase in the rate of melting in coming decades could threaten millions of people living in low-lying areas. Bangladesh, Florida, and eastern England are among many areas known to be particularly vulnerable to rises in sea level over the course of the century. And although the island of Greenland is remote, stretching from the north of the Atlantic high into the Arctic, its fate could have major implications for the severity of future flooding and may even alter coastlines and force communities to move inland. The stark photo highlighting Greenlandâs ice loss Rain melts Greenland ice even in winter Mighty Greenland glacier slams on brakes This video can not be played A visit to the Sermilik glacier, which is rapidly melting One of the scientists studying the ice sheet, Dr Jason Box of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), says he's unnerved by the potential dangers and that coastal planners need to ""brace themselves"". ""Now that I'm starting to understand more of the consequences, it's actually keeping me awake at night because I realise the significance of this place around the world and the livelihoods that are already affected by sea level rise,"" he told me. Dr Jason Box, Geological Survey of Denmark Until recently, the ice sheet was generally in a state of balance - the amount of snow falling in winter was roughly equal to the amount of ice melting in summer. Last year, there was actually a gain in ice but that was relatively unusual. Over the last 30 years, decade-by-decade, Greenland has tended to shed more ice. Either the ice melts at the surface which sends torrents of water down to the surrounding seas or huge chunks of ice break off from the margins and float away as icebergs, gradually to melt. Recent years have seen hundreds of billions of tonnes of ice lost - and a rough guide to the effect on sea level is that 362 billion tonnes of melt raises the average ocean level by a millimetre. That doesn't sound a lot but in 2012 Greenland's loss totalled about 450 billion tonnes, and this year's melt is on course to produce about the same, or even slightly more, with some researchers suggesting it could raise sea levels by up to 2mm. And on top of that you have to factor in the ice melting in Antarctica plus the effect of water expanding as it warms. It all raises the level of the oceans. According to Dr Box, it's the recent increase in the average temperature that's being felt in Greenland's ice: ""Already effectively that's a death sentence for the Greenland ice sheet because also going forward in time we're expecting temperatures only to climb,"" he said. ""So, we're losing Greenland - it's really a question of how fast."" I've seen for myself what's happened to one corner of it. Sermilik glacier at the southern end is not one of Greenland's largest but it does rank as one of the fastest-shrinking streams of ice anywhere in the world. To reach it back in 2004, we flew past towering cliffs of ice, the front of the glacier an immense wall of pale grey and blue standing high above the sea. At that time, we accompanied a scientist who checked instruments positioned on the ice and he was stunned to see how the surface of the glacier was dropping by as much as a metre every month. And over the past 15 years, that rate of shrinking has continued so aggressively that now, on a return visit to the same glacier, the ice looks diminished, almost battered, and far less dominating in the landscape. Jason Box is with me and he gathers the latest readings which show that over this summer alone the glacier has shrunk by an estimated 9m. ""That's an astounding rate of loss,"" he said. Since my last visit, the surface of this margin of the ice sheet has lowered by an extraordinary 100m, more than halving in thickness, exposing the remaining ice to the relatively warmer temperatures of lower altitudes. While you might think of the Arctic as a pristine white landscape, the startling feature of the surface is how dirty it looks. Walking on it feels like arriving on the Moon. There are big areas of pale grey and smaller patches that are much darker, covered with what appears to be mud or silt - it's a grim and rather depressing sight. Algae growing on the Sermilik glacier It used to be thought that this darkness was mainly caused by a mix of dust and pollution particles carried on the winds from distant power stations and industrial centres. But since my last visit to Sermilik glacier, scientists have made an important breakthrough in understanding that a major cause of the darkening is in fact biological - algae,microscopically small plants that are flourishing in the melting ice. By turning the surface grey, or black, from its usual bright white, the algae make it less reflective, so it absorbs more of the Sun's rays. This accelerates the warming and in turn leads to even more melting. With the stakes so high for so many millions of people around the world, Greenland is the target of a major international research effort involving satellites, monitoring flights and expeditions on the ice itself. This video can not be played Nasa visualisation of the melting Greenland ice sheet The US space agency Nasa has for years run projects investigating exactly what's causing the ice to melt and what could happen to it in future. Back in 2005, I reported on a Nasa-funded team that made an important discovery about the movement of the ice sheet. Although the great mass of ice looks immobile, it's actually always inching down towards the coast and the team found that this movement doubles in speed in summer - as meltwater from the surface works its way to the bottom of the ice and helps it to slide along. Another revelation is that the ice is not only being melted by the air, as the atmosphere heats up, but also by warmer water reaching underneath the fronts of the glaciers. One Nasa scientist describes the ice as being under a hair-dryer and at the same time also on a cooker. And Jason Box and his colleagues at GEUS run a network of sensors on the ice to record details of the height of the surface and its reflectivity, and how they're changing. The hardest challenge for the scientific community is understanding enough of the mechanisms of the ice sheet to be able to offer reliable forecasts of sea level rise. Dr Masashi Niwano, a researcher with the Japan Meteorological Agency, is just back from a field trip to gather data to try to validate his computer simulations of the ice. ""The ice sheet mass is decreasing - that is very certain. And these results affect global sea-level rise - that is also very certain,"" he said. ""But maybe there are several physical processes that we don't understand, so developing future projections is very difficult."" There are only 56,000 Greenlanders, and they live in communities perched on the narrow band of land at the edge of the ice sheet which, though close, is usually out of sight. Inutsiaq Ibsen, 18, Naja-Theresia HÃ¸egh, 19, and Caroline Hartmann Hansen, 21, in Qaqortoq In the village of Narsaq, Christian Mortensen tells me a glacier that was visible when he was younger has since retreated and that icebergs seem to ""break more and more"" into the waters. Warmer conditions would allow more farming and, as we talk, cattle are grazing around us on pasture that's beside bright white chunks of ice bobbing in the sea. But for some young Greenlanders, climate change is becoming a big concern, partly because of the impact of ""their"" ice on other areas of the planet. Naja-Theresia HÃ¸egh, who's just finished school, was inspired by the Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg to lead a climate strike in her town of Qaqortoq, a pretty port of brightly painted houses. She describes a boat trip to the edge of the ice sheet where she found it ""astonishing and scary"" that so much water could flow out. ""All of that is ending up in our waters, into the sea, and to the rest of the world and, if this continues, it will someday just cover a whole country,"" Ms HÃ¸egh explained. Her friend Caroline Hartmann Hansen also talked about her fears over the uncontrolled nature of the melting. ""It's not our fault; it's everyone's,"" she said. If the calculations of Jason Box and his colleagues are right, the ice sheet is already crossing a threshold into an era in which there may still be years with net gains of ice - like last year - but the new normal will see more big losses. Even with a rapid move to cut emissions of warming gases - as outlined in the 2015 Paris climate agreement - Greenland could still see a growing rate of melting, though that could possibly be slowed. So, as with the young Greenland climate campaigners, the scientists feel the need to take action of their own. They have started a scheme to try to absorb some of the carbon dioxide emitted by the flights they take to conduct their research; Jason said he has been criticised for his high carbon footprint and ""feels guilty about it"". Dr Faezeh Nick plants tree saplings near Narsarsuaq Close to the airport at Narsarsuaq, which connects them to the glaciers of southern Greenland, the researchers are planting 6,000 saplings of Siberian larch, a type of tree known to do well in conditions here. They admit that 10 of the trees would need to grow for 60 years to absorb the carbon produced by a return flight from London to San Francisco, but they say it's a start and that if the project later leads to a much larger forest, it might ""make a dent"" in climate change. Meanwhile, as memories of last month's polar heatwave fade, the scientists are leaving ahead of the winter nights, to try to hone their predictions for what the scarred and darkened ice sheet is likely do next.

"The UN experts investigated a coalition air strike on a bus carrying children in August 2018 The UK, US, France and Iran may be complicit in possible war crimes in Yemen over their support for parties to the conflict there, UN experts say. A new report warns the countries they could be held responsible,externalfor aiding or assisting the commission of violations. The Western powers provide weapons and logistical support to the Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen's government, while Iran backs the Houthi rebels. The experts say both sides continue to commit violations with impunity. Their report documents air strikes on civilian infrastructure, indiscriminate shelling, snipers, landmines, as well as arbitrary killings and detention, torture, sexual and gender-based violence, and the impeding of access to humanitarian aid in the midst of the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. The UN says the four-year conflict has claimed the lives of at least 7,290 civilians and left 80% of the population - 24 million people - in need of humanitarian assistance or protection, including 10 million who rely on food aid to survive. Yemen conflict explained in 400 words Why is there a war in Yemen? Yemen war: Has anything been achieved? The Group of International and Regional Eminent Experts on Yemen conducted 600 interviews with victims and witnesses, and examined documentary and open-source material, for their second report for the UN Human Rights Council. It says they found reasonable grounds to believe Yemen's government and the Saudi-led coalition, as well as the Houthis, had enjoyed a ""pervasive lack of accountability"" for violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. This video can not be played The hidden victims of the Yemen war The experts investigated a number of coalition air strikes on rebel-held areas in which civilians were killed. Such strikes raised concerns about the identification of military objectives and respect for the principles of proportionality and precautions in attack, they say. If there were breaches of the latter, which the experts consider highly likely, they would amount to serious violations of international law. The experts also found reasonable grounds to believe that the Houthis were responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law for having launched indiscriminate attacks resulting in the death or injury of civilians and, in some cases, by directing attacks against civilians. All parties may also have used starvation as a method of warfare. The experts call for the immediate cessation of all acts of violence committed against civilians and urge other states to refrain from providing weapons. The third city of Taiz has been besieged by the Houthis since 2015 ""States are obliged to take all reasonable measures to ensure respect for international humanitarian law by other states. Furthermore, the Arms Trade Treaty, to which France and the United Kingdom are parties, prohibits the authorization of arms transfers with the knowledge that these would be used to commit war crimes,"" they note. ""The legality of arms transfers by France, the United Kingdom, the United States and other states remains questionable, and is the subject of various domestic court proceedings,"" they add. Melissa Parke, an Australian member of the Group of Experts, told reporters in Geneva: ""It is clear that the continued supply of weapons to parties to the conflict is perpetuating the conflict and prolonging the suffering of the Yemeni people."" Where possible, the experts have identified ""individuals who may be responsible for international crimes"" and submitted a confidential list of their names to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. There was no response to the report from the coalition, the Yemeni government or the Houthis. But they have all previously denied carrying out war crimes. A UK government spokesperson said: ""The UK has been at the forefront of international efforts to bring a diplomatic solution to the appalling conflict in Yemen. We operate one of the most robust export control regimes in the world."" UK government ministers have said in the past they cannot determine whether any civilian deaths have been the result of British bombs or planes becausethe coalition does not track their use,external. The US has argued against halting arms sales or assistance to the coalition, saying thatcontinuing them is more likely to help limit civilian casualties,external.

"Kathryn Lewek plays Eurydice in Orpheus in the Underworld A German theatre critic has refused to back down after US soprano Kathryn Lewek accused some reviewers of ""fat shaming"" her. Lewek said Manuel Brug's description of ""fat women in tight corsets spreading their legs"" was ""derogatory"". But in a piece written in Die Welt on Tuesday, Brug said he ""wasn't referring to any particular character on stage"". He then added: ""If she shows her body on stage she has to deal with being described like that."" Brug wrote inTuesday's article,externalthat he had described her portrayal of Eurydice in a production of Orpheus in the Underworld ""as a character in an aesthetic universe. Just not as being slim. This is my duty and task as a journalist"". The singer was widely praised for her performance at the Salzburg Festival in Austria. Brug continued: ""I wasn't referring to any particular character on stage. But rather to the principle of the staging itself. The American singer in the role of Eurydice clearly didn't understand this, as she probably can't speak German. ""The singer in the role of Eurydice appeared mainly and ostentatiously in either a flesh-toned or a black corset. These were so tight and short that they made it deliberately and abundantly clear that this was a woman who was being shown as fat. He added that ""it didn't and doesn't matter to me as a critic how thin or fat singers are, as long as they excel at singing their roles"". Some other reviewers had called Lewek ""fat"", ""stocky-looking"" and ""buxom"". US soprano shames 'body-shaming' critics Speaking to the BBC earlier this week, Lewek called the comments ""antiquated"" and ""ridiculous"". She said her role in Orpheus in the Underworld was clearly a sexualised one (""she has sex with everyone on stage"") so she had been prepared for ""some comments"". But the soprano, who recently gave birth, was stunned to read reviews that she said critiqued her ""postpartum mom-bod instead of reviewing the show"". She said Brug's column in particular ""really lit my fire"" adding: ""It was such a derogatory way of describing what my character was all about."" Without naming Brug, she lashed out at ""body-shaming and fat-shaming"" on Twitter, writing: ""Time's up on these juvenile bullies."" Allow Twitter content?

""Commenting on anything that is unrelated to the performance is irrelevant,""added Brit Award-winner Camilla Kerslake,external, noting that ""male singers rarely have to put up with this"". In response, the paper's editor, Dr Ulf Poschardt, said Brug's review had been misinterpreted.

"Philip Hammond, Dominic Grieve, David Gauke and Rory Stewart Boris Johnson has warned Tory MPs threatening to rebel over Brexit they will be barred from standing as Conservatives at the next general election and effectively thrown out of the party. Up to 20 former ministers, including ex-Chancellors Philip Hammond and Ken Clarke and former Justice Secretary David Gauke, face the prospect of being ""deselected"" if they support Labour attempts to block a no-deal exit from the EU. If an MP is deselected, it means they are removed as a candidate and cannot represent their party at a general election. It's not a new phenomenon - Winston Churchill faced deselection in 1904 in a row over free trade - but happens rarely. The next election is not scheduled to take place until May 2022. But with Boris Johnson's government seemingly on a collision course with Parliament over Brexit, the chance of a snap poll happening in the next couple of months is growing. Tory MPs have been told if they defy the government in a series of Commons votes this week, they will have the parliamentary whip withdrawn and will not be able to apply to be a candidate. No 10 hopes this ultimate sanction will force rebels into line. Government 'wants to purge Tory Brexit rebels' Conservative election candidates are traditionally chosen at a local level. Each constituency has what is known as a Conservative Association which is responsible for deciding who they want to represent them at general elections. An existing MP who wants to stand again must apply in writing to be re-adopted as the party candidate. The executive council of the association then votes, by secret ballot, on whether to choose them again. In many cases, this is a relative formality and MPs are re-adopted with a minimum of fuss. But Brexit tensions have led to a growing number of grassroots attempts to oust MPs. Four former Conservatives who left the party earlier this year - Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen, Sarah Wollaston and Nick Boles - either faced explicit deselection threats or were coming under local pressure from activists to call a by-election. Why is Johnson planning to deselect Tory rebels? More than 40 Conservative MPs have openly said they will do everything they can to oppose a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Some, such as Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve, have gone further by suggesting they might be prepared to bring the government down in a vote of confidence. Mr Grieve is already facing calls from activists in his Beaconsfield constituency to stand down, more than 35,000 people having signed a petition urging him to go. The biggest name under threat is Philip Hammond, who just over a month ago was one of the most powerful figures in the government.The Sun reported the ex-chancellor,externalwas seeking to secure his re-adoption as quickly as possible. Mr Gauke has accused Downing Street of trying to ""purge"" critical voices. He suggested the government was ""almost goading people into voting against"" it to pave the way for a general election. He also pointed out that many of those demanding loyalty now repeatedly defied Theresa May by voting against her Brexit deal. Ex-ministers insist they are entitled to express their opinions without being hounded out of Parliament, while some, such as ex-Development Secretary Rory Stewart, have almost appeared to welcome the looming confrontation.

Deselection is not a straightforward process and MPs have several weapons at their disposal to fight it. MPs who lose the confidence of their constituency associations can appeal to the wider membership of their local party for support. In the past few years, a number of MPs have won votes of confidence and remained in place that way. However, this unlikely to be an option for any MP barred from standing and opposed by Conservative Central Office. Some MPs opposed to a no-deal exit - such as Guto Bebb, Richard Harrington and Oliver Letwin - have taken pre-emptive action and already announced they will not contest the next election. Whether this will influence their future actions remains to be seen. MPs who are barred from standing as Conservatives could, theoretically, stand as independents, but independents have an extremely poor record in general elections. Until recent weeks, most talk about deselection surrounded the Labour Party. More than a dozen Labour MPs at odds with the party over Brexit and other issues have quit in the past year. Some, like Chuka Umunna, have joined the Liberal Democrats, while Frank Field intends to stand as an independent whenever an election comes. Unlike the Tories, Labour MPs can be made to compete for selection as a candidate against all comers. Thethreshold for so-called ""trigger ballots""has been reduced, making MPs potentially more vulnerable. There are not currently thought to be any SNP or Lib Dem MPs facing the threat of deselection.

"The pound has made gains on currency markets after Prime Minister Boris Johnson lost his majority in the House of Commons. Tory MP Phillip Lee's defection to the Liberal Democrats lifted sterling to above $1.20 and â¬1.10. Earlier, the pound had touched its lowest level since October 2016 before recovering to erase the day's losses. Rebel Tories and Labour MPs want to pass a bill to stop the UK leaving the EU on 31 October without a deal. No 10 has threatened a snap general election on 14 October if MPs succeed in seizing control of Commons business. Addressing Parliament on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Johnson that if they managed to block a no-deal exit, it would ""destroy any chance of negotiating a new deal"". The bill would force the prime minister to ask for Brexit to be delayed until 31 January, unless MPs had approved a new deal, or voted in favour of a no-deal exit, by 19 October. The pound's fall: A tale of two cities How does Brexit affect the pound? Can no-deal Brexit be stopped? Why the pound is getting weaker Under Mr Johnson, the government has toughened its stance on a no-deal Brexit, which it has said is ""now a very real prospect"". Excluding the so called ""flash crash"" in October 2016, when the pound briefly fell sharply to $1.15 against the dollar before rapidly rebounding, the pound has not traded regularly below $1.20 since 1985. The pound was trading at about $1.50 against the dollar before the EU referendum in June 2016. Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank, told the BBC's Today programme that while anything that made a no-deal Brexit less likely would boost sterling, an election would have the opposite effect. ""Currencies, as a rule, do not like uncertainty. The idea is that there could of course be a no-deal Brexit, which investors do not like. They do not like the idea of the uncertainty or the potential chaos that that could bring,"" she said. ""If the members of Parliament do manage to block a no-deal Brexit at the end of next month, then that is likely to push sterling up,"" Ms Foley added. ""That said, political uncertainty and a general election will likely push sterling down. ""Sterling will remain a very vulnerable currency."" Political earthquakes inevitably cause tremors in the currency markets. After all, the value of the currency broadly reflects the faith investors have in the prospects of a country. And with the City just a mile or two from Westminster, it's physically impossible for traders to ignore the turmoil. But do wobbles on foreign exchange markets matter to the rest of us? They do - and perhaps more than we want to know. A weaker pound, of course, makes holidaying abroad more expensive (but cheaper for overseas tourists to visit the UK). But it also makes imports dearer, bumping up the cost of our shopping list. Take food, for instance. About half of what we eat comes from overseas. The pound has fallen over 10% against the euro and about 20% against the dollar since 2016. Big companies tend to try to insure or ""hedge"" against currency movements, but within a matter of a few months, those changes in price tend to feed through. It's enough to make everyday staples or impulse buys feel a bit more like little luxuries. PM faces Commons showdown over election threat Why has the pound tumbled?

"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""We will seek agreement to the transfer of power that will put the referendum beyond legal challenge."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to demand Holyrood be given the power to hold a second independence referendum. Ms Sturgeon confirmed to MSPs that she would ""seek agreement to the transfer of power that will put the referendum beyond legal challenge"". As she unveiled hergovernment's plans for the year,external, she said the parliament had a clear, democratic mandate. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has indicated his opposition to a second vote on Scotland leaving the UK. Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament it ""now seems inevitable that there will be an early UK general election"". She added: ""Let me be crystal clear today - the SNP will put Scotland's opposition to Brexit and our right to choose independence at the very heart of that contest."" Look back on Nicola Sturgeon's address to Holyrood Ms Sturgeon said the referendum bill that was introduced to Holyrood earlier this year was about to resume its parliamentary progress. The bill is expected to be passed before the end of the year and the first minister has previously said she could hold a referendum in the second half of 2020. The UK government would need to transfer power - through a Section 30 order - to allow a second referendum to be held but it has so far rejected such an agreement Ms Sturgeon told MSPs her government intended to offer the choice of independence within this term of parliament, which ends in May 2021. Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said it was ""typical"" that the first minister's programme for government statement ""both began and ended with independence"". ""It really is the be-all-and-end-all for her nationalist government."" he said. ""The people of Scotland have had enough of this. They simply want Nicola Sturgeon to give it a rest."" Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said the statement ""both began and ended with independence"" The first minister's speech detailed the 14 bills and other measures the Scottish government intends to bring forward over the next year. The ""centrepiece"" of that would be work to tackle the climate emergency, she said. Ms Sturgeon promised a ""Scottish Green New Deal"" that would start to create the right conditions to kick-start investment and make a ""significant impact"" on greenhouse gas emissions. Its commitments include Â£500m for improved bus priority lanes to tackle congestion and increase usage. It would also see further electrification of the railways and increase low carbon heating in new homes. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs in the Scottish Parliament that while the Westminster government was shutting down, the Scottish government was ""stepping up"". Animal Health and Welfare (Amendment) Bill- will increase the maximum penalties for the most serious animal welfare offences to five years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. Budget Bill- Annual legislation which provides parliamentary approval for the Scottish government's spending plans and allocation of resources. Circular Economy Bill- includes encouraging re-use of products and resource waste. It will allow charges to be applied to single-use coffee cups. Civil Partnership Bill- will make civil partnerships available to mixed-sex couples in Scotland. Continuity Bill- provides ability to maintain alignment with EU law in devolved areas after Brexit. Defamation and Malicious Publications Bill- will simplify and modernise the law of defamation. Uefa European Championship Bill- ahead of Glasgow's participation as a host city in the Uefa European Football Championships in 2020, the bill will prohibit ticket touting and make provisions to protect commercial interests. Forensic Medical Services (Victims of Sexual Offences) Bill- will aim to improve services for victims of sexual offences, including ensuring their cases are handled more effectively by the justice and healthcare systems. Good Food Nation Bill- introduces a statutory framework as part of efforts to promote healthier and more sustainable local produce. Hate Crime Bill- consolidates and updates existing hate crime legislation. Heat Networks Bill- brings regulation of the heat network sector to support, facilitate and create controls in development of district and communal heating infrastructure in Scotland. Redress (Survivors of In Care Abuse) Bill- establishes a financial redress scheme for survivors of historical child abuse whilst in care in Scotland. Rural Support Bill- introduces regulation-making powers for Scottish ministers to amend or replace the EU Common Agricultural Policy elements of retained EU law. Transient Visitor Levy Bill- creates a discretionary power for local authorities to apply a tax or levy on overnight visitor stays. In April, Ms Sturgeon declared a ""climate emergency"" in her speech to the SNP conference. She later said the Scottish government would legislate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2045. The package of measures includes: More than Â£500m in improved bus priority infrastructure Putting the Highlands and Islands on a path to becoming the world's first net-zero aviation region by 2040 (trials of low or zero emission flights will begin in 2021) reduce emissions from Scotland's railways to zero by 2035 through the continued electrification of the network, as well as battery-powered trains and exploring the potential of hydrogen-powered trains An additional Â£17m to support the demand for ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs). ensuring that from 2024, all new homes must use renewable or low carbon heat. The Scottish National Investment Bank's ""primary mission"" will be helping Scotland's economy reduce carbon emissions to net-zero. Legislation that will allow charges to be applied to single-use coffee cups will be brought in under the Circular Economy Bill, the first minister added. The Scottish Greens said the programme for government ""lacked the ambition, scale and courage"" required to tackle the climate emergency. The party's co-leader Patrick Harvie said: ""Scotland needs a Scottish Green New Deal which recognises the purpose, scale and bravery required of an emergency response."" The Holyrood head count thus far today? One insult (at least). One apology. Tame, of course, by comparison with the visceral, permanent feud that is Westminster. But give them time. I write ""head count"" advisedly. The topic was tonsorial. Raised, very unwisely, by Jackson Carlaw, he who once again finds himself the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives. Under teasing attack from the first minister, Mr Carlaw retorted: ""At least I've got a full head of my own naturally coloured hair!"" The chamber, Tories included, squirmed and glanced furtively at their neighbours. Did he just say that? Read more from Brianhere. Meanwhile, other measures in the programme for government include: bringing forward the date for the first Scottish Child Payments to Christmas 2020 making the first Job Start Payments in spring 2020 announcing the first wave of new or refurbished schools via a Â£1bn school investment programme Other bills include one that will enable councils to introduce a tourist tax. To help improve mental health care, the first minister said her promise to install 350 counsellors in schools - a commitment made last year - would be achieved by this time next year. The Scottish government will also work with councils on a ""community wellbeing service"", with this supported by Â£17m of additional funding, she said. In addition, Â£10m will be made available in each of the next two years to try to deal with the ""public health emergency"" caused by drug abuse. There was a record 1,187 drugs deaths in Scotland last year. Another bill will see men and women able to have civil partnerships rather than marriage in Scotland. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said that the government had taken its eye ""off the ball"" because its primary focus was on independence. He said: ""Communities shouldn't lose out because of the SNP's constitutional obsessions. Liberal Democrats demand better for our public services."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard welcome the commitments on climate change but asked what the first minister was doing about rising housing costs and the reliance on food banks.

"Ariana Grande Singer Ariana Grande is asking for $10m (Â£8.3m) in damages from Forever 21, saying the retailer ""stole her name"" to promote its clothing and beauty products. She said the firm published at least 30 ""unauthorised"" images and videos that suggested she had endorsed the brand. It also hired a model with an ""uncanny"" resemblance to Ms Grande for some of its social media posts, she said. Her lawsuit comes after a breakdown in talks over a joint marketing campaign. Ms Grande said the firm, which has stores in more than 50 countries around the world, approached her in 2018 about endorsement. However, she said talks broke down because ""the amounts that Forever 21 offered to pay for the right to use Ms Grande's name and likeness were insufficient for an artist of her stature."" ""Rather than pay for that right as the law requires, defendants simply stole it,"" she said in the complaint, which was filed in federal court in California. The ""misleading campaign"" occurred primarily in January and February of 2019, before the release of Ms Grande's album, 'Thank U, Next', according to the suit. Forever 21 declined to comment on the specifics of the lawsuit. ""That said, while we dispute the allegations, we are huge supporters of Ariana Grande and have worked with her licensing company over the past two years,"" it said. ""We are hopeful that we will find a mutually agreeable resolution and can continue to work together in the future."" Ms Grande is a Grammy Award winner and best-selling singer. She also has more than 200 million followers on Instagram and Twitter. Billboard named her ""Woman of the Year"" in 2018 after she raised $29m for victims of the Manchester suicide bombing attack, the lawsuit said. Ms Grande is one of a long line of celebrities to sue over trademarks. For example, in July,Kim Kardashian-West won $2.7m in damagesafter accusing fashion brand Missguided USA of ripping off her outfits and using her name to sell clothes. John Coldham, a partner at law firm Gowling WLG, said the Ariana Grande case ""should act as a stark warning to brand owners to be very careful about using celebrity images and ensuring they are not implying an endorsement.""

"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar stands firm on Ireland's Brexit stance during a joint press conference with US Vice President Mike Pence The Republic of Ireland must stand its ground on the Brexit deal amid a ""critical"" period in political history, Leo Varadkar has said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmed he will visit Dublin on Monday to meet the taoiseach. Mr Johnson later faced a showdown in Westminster that led tono-deal opponents defeating the government. Mr Varadkar made his remarks during a press conference with US Vice President Mike Pence, who is on a two-day visit. But Mr Pence urged Ireland and the EU to ""negotiate in good faith"" with the UK. Live: MPs return ahead of key Brexit vote Tory MP defects ahead of crucial Brexit vote US 'supports Brexit plan that protects peace deal' Doonbeg gives US president 'Irish welcome' The Irish government has repeatedly said it respects the UK's decision to leave the EU, but that it took more than two years to negotiate a withdrawal agreement and that it could not be re-opened. This video can not be played Mr Johnson is facing a showdown in Westminster Speaking at Farmleigh House, the country's official guest house, Mr Varadkar asked Mr Pence to take that message back to the US government. ""The divergence between the UK and the EU means the return of a hard border (between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland) is a very real risk,"" said the taoiseach. He insisted the Irish government had to ""stand its ground"" on the withdrawal agreement and the backstop - despite opposition to it from the British government. This is Mike Pence's first visit to the Republic of Ireland in his role as vice-president of the United States Vice-president Pence said the US recognised the ""unique challenges"" regarding the Irish border. ""We will continue to encourage the UK and Ireland to ensure any Brexit deal respects the Good Friday Agreement,"" he added. However, he said that as the Brexit deadline approached, the White House would ""urge Ireland and the EU to negotiate in good faith with Prime Minister Johnson"". Westminster has rejected the withdrawal agreement three times and MPs are deadlocked over the issue mainly because of the backstop proposal in the deal. The backstop is the insurance policy aimed at maintaining a seamless Irish border unless and until another solution is found. Mr Johnson wants it removed from the withdrawal deal as it is ""anti-democratic"". The DUP is also opposed to it, arguing it would create a border down the Irish Sea and risk the integrity of the union of the UK. However, other Stormont parties have backed it, as well as a majority of business and agri-food groups. Mr Pence added the US would play whatever ""helpful role"" it could in order to try and reach an agreement that respected the UK's sovereignty and minimised disruption to trade. Mike Pence shakes hands with Irish President Michael D Higgins in the company of his wife Karen and Mr Higgins' wife Sabina Earlier, Mr Pence met Irish President Michael D Higgins in Dublin during the second day of his visit. The vice president signed the official visitor's book, in which he paid tribute to his Irish grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley. He was accompanied to the Irish president's official residence by his wife, Karen Pence, his mother, Nancy Pence-Fritsch, and his sister, Ann Poynter. They were greeted at Ãras an Uachtarain by Mr Higgins and his wife, Sabina. It is Mr Pence's first visit to Ireland as vice president, but not his first visit to the country. He has family roots in Ireland - his maternal grandfather Richard Michael Cawley emigrated from County Sligo to Chicago in the early 1920s and his grandmother Mary Maloney's family had historic links with Doonbeg. In the Ãras an Uachtarain guest book , the vice-president wrote: ""In the memory of a great Irishman, Richard Michael Cawley and on behalf of the United States of America, we are delighted to be back in Ireland."" At Farmleigh, the taoiseach showed Mr Pence and his family the military service record of his grandfather, who served with distinction in the Irish Defence Forces during the Irish Civil War. The vice-president had lunch with Mr Varadkar and his partner Matthew Barrett, as well as Mr Varadkar's parents. The vice-president and his mother were shown the service records of his grandfather During his visit, Mr and Mrs Pence are staying in Doonbeg, where US President Donald Trump owns a luxury golf resort. His trip comes three months after Mr Trump visited Ireland for the first time as president. His arrival was met with protests in Dublin and in Shannon. Mr Pence is also not without controversy. He has previously come under fire by gay rights activists for his Christian evangelical beliefs which include opposition to gay marriage. The vice-president's visit was originally due to take place on Friday, but was brought forward after it was announced that he would visit Poland over the weekendto attend World War Two commemorations in place of President Trump. Mr Trump has remained in the USto monitor Hurricane Dorian. Mr Pence is due to visit the UK later in the week for a series of engagements and discuss the Brexit deadlock.

"It is the end of an era for Marks and Spencer, which has been relegated from the FTSE 100 index of Britain's biggest listed companies. It is the first time the retailer has not been a FTSE 100 member since the index was launched in 1984. Based on the closing price of its stock on Tuesday, its market value fell below the threshold for inclusion. The official announcement was made on Wednesday night, with the decision implemented on 23 September. The food and fashion giant has had a hard year, with its shares down 40%. M&S to start home delivery next year M&S sales and profits fall amid shake-up Its all-important clothing business has continued to struggle, and its food business has shown signs of weakness. ""Symbolically, falling out of the FTSE is just another milestone in the slow-but-steady decline of what used to be a great British institution,"" says retail expert Richard Hyman. The FTSE 100 contains the 100 largest UK-listed firms, ranked by market value. Membership of the index is seen as a mark of prestige. The index is reshuffled four times a year, allowing a handful of companies to enter, while a number of stragglers slip out into the lower tier FTSE 250. M&S has been close to relegation for about a year as investors have steadily lost faith in the brand. As of Tuesday evening, it had a market value of Â£3.7bn - less than half of what it was worth back in November 2015. By comparison FTSE-listed fashion rival Next was worth Â£7.9bn. Demotion will be a huge fall from grace for M&S, which in 1998 became the first British retailer to make a pre-tax profit of more than Â£1bn. The biggest issue, say analysts, has been the decline of its clothing business, which accounts for a large portion of profits. M&S boss Steve Rowe is trying to turn the business around ""There has been a decade-long complaint by investors and customers that it has failed to revamp its clothing lines, especially within womenswear, and lacks appeal for the younger generations,"" says Helal Miah, an analyst at the Share Centre. ""The group has also been too slow to adapt to online retailing and has been left behind by others who offer a more compelling online service."" M&S now faces enormous competition from fashion giants such as Primark on the High Street and Asos online. Accusations that its clothing is too dowdy and conservative still linger, too. However, for Richard Hyman the issue goes deeper - he thinks the brand has lost touch with its customers. ""M&S was about quality at an unbeatable price, not fashion for fashion's sake. But over time they have sacrificed those values to try and cut costs and become too corporate."" This has created a ""negative spiral"", he says, where less is invested in its product, quality falls, and design goes by the wayside. ""Your sales keep falling so you cut costs further. It is very hard to get out of."" Until recently M&S's food business had been a bright spot amid the gloom, but over the past few years sales in this part of the business have struggled as well. Falling food sales hit Marks & Spencer To stem the decline, in February this year M&S forged a joint venture with Ocado, agreeing to buy 50% of its retail business for a whopping Â£750m. Laith Khalaf, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says the deal makes sense in many ways, as it will allow M&S to offer a much broader range of food. Online shopping is also a growth area. However, he says investors have been sceptical about the partnership and many think M&S has overpaid. ""Ocado is not yet making a profit from food sales so the rewards of this partnership are uncertain. On top of these problems, M&S is dealing with a nationwide consumer spending slowdown that has forced some High Street retailers to close stores. To try to revive the business, chief executive Steve Rowe launched a ""radical"" turnaround plan last year which will see 100 under-performing stores closed by 2022 - although the number could be higher. However, analysts are sceptical that this will be enough to get it back on track. ""I think it is possible but unfortunately a lot of things are outside of their control,"" says Mr Khalaf. ""One of those is the UK economy and all the uncertainty about Brexit, which has also been big factor in denting the share price. ""If there is a further fall in the pound [because of Brexit] that could hit retailers as they buy many imported goods in dollars. A wider downturn in the economy could also hit M&S."" Mr Hyman also has his doubts about the strategy. ""M&S used to be the pivotal player on the High Street but they are going down the wrong road in my opinion. When you see a business which is more about cutting costs than driving sales the alarm bells should be ringing.""

"The pound has made gains on currency markets after Prime Minister Boris Johnson lost his majority in the House of Commons. Tory MP Phillip Lee's defection to the Liberal Democrats lifted sterling to above $1.20 and â¬1.10. Earlier, the pound had touched its lowest level since October 2016 before recovering to erase the day's losses. Rebel Tories and Labour MPs want to pass a bill to stop the UK leaving the EU on 31 October without a deal. No 10 has threatened a snap general election on 14 October if MPs succeed in seizing control of Commons business. Addressing Parliament on Tuesday afternoon, Mr Johnson that if they managed to block a no-deal exit, it would ""destroy any chance of negotiating a new deal"". The bill would force the prime minister to ask for Brexit to be delayed until 31 January, unless MPs had approved a new deal, or voted in favour of a no-deal exit, by 19 October. The pound's fall: A tale of two cities How does Brexit affect the pound? Can no-deal Brexit be stopped? Why the pound is getting weaker Under Mr Johnson, the government has toughened its stance on a no-deal Brexit, which it has said is ""now a very real prospect"". Excluding the so called ""flash crash"" in October 2016, when the pound briefly fell sharply to $1.15 against the dollar before rapidly rebounding, the pound has not traded regularly below $1.20 since 1985. The pound was trading at about $1.50 against the dollar before the EU referendum in June 2016. Jane Foley, senior currency strategist at Rabobank, told the BBC's Today programme that while anything that made a no-deal Brexit less likely would boost sterling, an election would have the opposite effect. ""Currencies, as a rule, do not like uncertainty. The idea is that there could of course be a no-deal Brexit, which investors do not like. They do not like the idea of the uncertainty or the potential chaos that that could bring,"" she said. ""If the members of Parliament do manage to block a no-deal Brexit at the end of next month, then that is likely to push sterling up,"" Ms Foley added. ""That said, political uncertainty and a general election will likely push sterling down. ""Sterling will remain a very vulnerable currency."" Political earthquakes inevitably cause tremors in the currency markets. After all, the value of the currency broadly reflects the faith investors have in the prospects of a country. And with the City just a mile or two from Westminster, it's physically impossible for traders to ignore the turmoil. But do wobbles on foreign exchange markets matter to the rest of us? They do - and perhaps more than we want to know. A weaker pound, of course, makes holidaying abroad more expensive (but cheaper for overseas tourists to visit the UK). But it also makes imports dearer, bumping up the cost of our shopping list. Take food, for instance. About half of what we eat comes from overseas. The pound has fallen over 10% against the euro and about 20% against the dollar since 2016. Big companies tend to try to insure or ""hedge"" against currency movements, but within a matter of a few months, those changes in price tend to feed through.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""We will seek agreement to the transfer of power that will put the referendum beyond legal challenge."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon is to demand Holyrood be given the power to hold a second independence referendum. Ms Sturgeon confirmed to MSPs that she would ""seek agreement to the transfer of power that will put the referendum beyond legal challenge"". As she unveiled hergovernment's plans for the year,external, she said the parliament had a clear, democratic mandate. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has indicated his opposition to a second vote on Scotland leaving the UK. Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament it ""now seems inevitable that there will be an early UK general election"". She added: ""Let me be crystal clear today - the SNP will put Scotland's opposition to Brexit and our right to choose independence at the very heart of that contest."" Look back on Nicola Sturgeon's address to Holyrood Ms Sturgeon said the referendum bill that was introduced to Holyrood earlier this year was about to resume its parliamentary progress. The bill is expected to be passed before the end of the year and the first minister has previously said she could hold a referendum in the second half of 2020. The UK government would need to transfer power - through a Section 30 order - to allow a second referendum to be held but it has so far rejected such an agreement Ms Sturgeon told MSPs her government intended to offer the choice of independence within this term of parliament, which ends in May 2021. Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said it was ""typical"" that the first minister's programme for government statement ""both began and ended with independence"". ""It really is the be-all-and-end-all for her nationalist government."" he said. ""The people of Scotland have had enough of this. They simply want Nicola Sturgeon to give it a rest."" Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw said the statement ""both began and ended with independence"" The first minister's speech detailed the 14 bills and other measures the Scottish government intends to bring forward over the next year. The ""centrepiece"" of that would be work to tackle the climate emergency, she said. Ms Sturgeon promised a ""Scottish Green New Deal"" that would start to create the right conditions to kick-start investment and make a ""significant impact"" on greenhouse gas emissions. Its commitments include Â£500m for improved bus priority lanes to tackle congestion and increase usage. It would also see further electrification of the railways and increase low carbon heating in new homes. Ms Sturgeon told MSPs in the Scottish Parliament that while the Westminster government was shutting down, the Scottish government was ""stepping up"". Animal Health and Welfare (Amendment) Bill- will increase the maximum penalties for the most serious animal welfare offences to five years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. Budget Bill- Annual legislation which provides parliamentary approval for the Scottish government's spending plans and allocation of resources. Circular Economy Bill- includes encouraging re-use of products and resource waste. It will allow charges to be applied to single-use coffee cups. Civil Partnership Bill- will make civil partnerships available to mixed-sex couples in Scotland. Continuity Bill- provides ability to maintain alignment with EU law in devolved areas after Brexit. Defamation and Malicious Publications Bill- will simplify and modernise the law of defamation. Uefa European Championship Bill- ahead of Glasgow's participation as a host city in the Uefa European Football Championships in 2020, the bill will prohibit ticket touting and make provisions to protect commercial interests. Forensic Medical Services (Victims of Sexual Offences) Bill- will aim to improve services for victims of sexual offences, including ensuring their cases are handled more effectively by the justice and healthcare systems. Good Food Nation Bill- introduces a statutory framework as part of efforts to promote healthier and more sustainable local produce. Hate Crime Bill- consolidates and updates existing hate crime legislation. Heat Networks Bill- brings regulation of the heat network sector to support, facilitate and create controls in development of district and communal heating infrastructure in Scotland. Redress (Survivors of In Care Abuse) Bill- establishes a financial redress scheme for survivors of historical child abuse whilst in care in Scotland. Rural Support Bill- introduces regulation-making powers for Scottish ministers to amend or replace the EU Common Agricultural Policy elements of retained EU law. Transient Visitor Levy Bill- creates a discretionary power for local authorities to apply a tax or levy on overnight visitor stays. In April, Ms Sturgeon declared a ""climate emergency"" in her speech to the SNP conference. She later said the Scottish government would legislate to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero by 2045. The package of measures includes: More than Â£500m in improved bus priority infrastructure Putting the Highlands and Islands on a path to becoming the world's first net-zero aviation region by 2040 (trials of low or zero emission flights will begin in 2021) reduce emissions from Scotland's railways to zero by 2035 through the continued electrification of the network, as well as battery-powered trains and exploring the potential of hydrogen-powered trains An additional Â£17m to support the demand for ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs). ensuring that from 2024, all new homes must use renewable or low carbon heat. The Scottish National Investment Bank's ""primary mission"" will be helping Scotland's economy reduce carbon emissions to net-zero. Legislation that will allow charges to be applied to single-use coffee cups will be brought in under the Circular Economy Bill, the first minister added. The Scottish Greens said the programme for government ""lacked the ambition, scale and courage"" required to tackle the climate emergency. The party's co-leader Patrick Harvie said: ""Scotland needs a Scottish Green New Deal which recognises the purpose, scale and bravery required of an emergency response."" The Holyrood head count thus far today? One insult (at least). One apology. Tame, of course, by comparison with the visceral, permanent feud that is Westminster. But give them time. I write ""head count"" advisedly. The topic was tonsorial. Raised, very unwisely, by Jackson Carlaw, he who once again finds himself the interim leader of the Scottish Conservatives. Under teasing attack from the first minister, Mr Carlaw retorted: ""At least I've got a full head of my own naturally coloured hair!"" The chamber, Tories included, squirmed and glanced furtively at their neighbours. Did he just say that? Read more from Brianhere. Meanwhile, other measures in the programme for government include: bringing forward the date for the first Scottish Child Payments to Christmas 2020 making the first Job Start Payments in spring 2020 announcing the first wave of new or refurbished schools via a Â£1bn school investment programme Other bills include one that will enable councils to introduce a tourist tax. To help improve mental health care, the first minister said her promise to install 350 counsellors in schools - a commitment made last year - would be achieved by this time next year. The Scottish government will also work with councils on a ""community wellbeing service"", with this supported by Â£17m of additional funding, she said. In addition, Â£10m will be made available in each of the next two years to try to deal with the ""public health emergency"" caused by drug abuse. There was a record 1,187 drugs deaths in Scotland last year. Another bill will see men and women able to have civil partnerships rather than marriage in Scotland. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said that the government had taken its eye ""off the ball"" because its primary focus was on independence. He said: ""Communities shouldn't lose out because of the SNP's constitutional obsessions. Liberal Democrats demand better for our public services."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard welcome the commitments on climate change but asked what the first minister was doing about rising housing costs and the reliance on food banks.

"HS2 platforms in Manchester Piccadilly would be covered by a folded roof The HS2 high-speed rail link between Birmingham and Manchester will be scrapped, Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said. Another part of the route, between the East Midlands and Leeds,has already been cancelled. Instead, Â£36bn funding will be put into alternative transport projects, Mr Sunak said. HS2 was intended to create high-speed rail links between London and major cities in the Midlands and North of England. That has been pared down to a high-speed link between Birmingham and London. It is aimed at cutting journey times, creating more space on the rail network and more jobs outside London. But HS2 has faced delays, spiralling costs and cuts. HS2 was meant to connectLondonwithBirmingham,ManchesterandLeeds. Lots of work has been done on the section linking London and Birmingham. Butthe government scrapped the Leeds leg in 2021,external. It decided to upgrade existing routes for HS2 trains, instead of building new ones. In June, the government said it would still build HS2 from London Euston to Manchester and the East Midlands. However,Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said recently that costs were getting ""totally out of control"". Now, thealready-delayedBirmingham to Manchester leg has been cancelled. The 13-mile (21km) Golborne Link to connect HS2 and the West Coast Main Line in Cheshire and Greater Manchesterhad already been scrapped. Speaking at the Conservative party conference, Mr Sunak said the latest decision would save Â£36bn, which would be used instead in ""hundreds of new transport projects in the North and the Midlands, and across the country"". This will include road and rail schemes. HS2 will now eventually run from London to Birmingham Interchange, with branches to central Birmingham and Handsacre, near Lichfield. HS2 trains for Manchester, Liverpool and Scotland will join the West Coast Main Line at Handsacre. The government previously said HS2 would cut Birmingham to London journey times from one hour 21 minutes, to 52 minutes. Before the link was scrapped, HS2 was projected to take an hour off Manchester to London journeys - from just over two hours to just over one hour. HS2 trains will still run to Manchester, and journey times will be cut between Manchester, Birmingham and London by up to 30 minutes, Mr Sunak said. HS2 was originally meant to reach Euston in central London, although demolition work was paused due to rising costs. The government said it would ""get a grip"" on plans for the station's ""unaffordable designs"". It has already cut the number of planned platforms for high-speed trains from 11 to six. But if cash is not put forward by private investorsthen the high-speed line will only run from Birmingham to Old Oak Commonin London's western suburbs. It is unclear whether the same capacity across the line will be needed now the HS2 line to Manchester has been discarded. The cost of the project, the biggest of its kind in Europe, has grown. The first estimate in 2010 was for about Â£33bn. The government's most recent official estimate was about Â£71bn in 2019 prices. But this included Â£26bn for Birmingham to Manchester, which will now not be built. The government is currently updating its cost estimates. About Â£24.7bn had been spent on HS2 as of February 2023. This includes at least Â£22.5bn on Phase 1 and Â£2.3bn on Phase 2, including on the purchase of more than 400 properties between Birmingham and Manchester. HS2: Six reasons why the rail route is so expensive HS2 was due to open by 2026. Under current plans, HS2 trains would carry their first passengers between Old Oak Common and Birmingham, between 2029 and 2033. Timescales for when Euston will open have yet to be announced. The government has announced the ""Network North"" scheme, with Â£36bn redirected from HS2 to road and rail projects. This will allow the objectives of the previous ""Northern Powerhouse Rail"" project to be met, it said. ""Network North"" plans including upgraded and electrified lines between Manchester and Sheffield, Sheffield and Leeds, Sheffield and Hull, and Hull and Leeds. In addition, there will be an extra Â£12bn set aside for faster links between Liverpool and Manchester. A section of the HS2 line was due to run from Manchester Airport to Manchester Piccadilly, the city's main station. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham recently said scrapping the Manchester link ""rips the heart"" out of Northern Powerhouse Rail. However, the government said Northern Powerhouse Rail, including high speed rail links, will be delivered ""as previously planned"". Big decisions await as HS2 row simmers on What is levelling up and who is it helping? Mr Sunak diverting money from HS2 to road schemes ""shows how little he really cares about tackling air pollution, traffic and cutting carbon emissions"", Greenpeace says. Previously the HS2 project said it could provide ""zero carbon rail travel"" and create new wildlife habitats along its route. But environmental campaigners and conservation organisations had objected, saying it would destroy irreplaceable natural habitats. How much?

In addition, there will be an extra Â£12bn set aside for faster links between Liverpool and Manchester. A section of the HS2 line was due to run from Manchester Airport to Manchester Piccadilly, the city's main station.

"Supporters staged protests as the club's league future hung in the balance A fraud investigation has been launched involving Bury Football Club, police have confirmed. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it received a report of fraud on 18 June and inquiries were ongoing but no arrests had been made. The club were expelled from the English Football League (EFL) on 27 August after a late takeover bid from C&N Sporting Risk failed. Bury were the first club to drop out of the league since Maidstone in 1992. The Greater Manchester club were members of the EFL for 125 years. The allegation of fraud was made to GMP exactly one month before current owner Steve Dale reached aCompany Voluntary Arrangement,externalto repay the club's creditors 25% of the Â£9m they owed. However, the arrangement was dependant on the Shakers being able to play their fixtures this season. EFL 'to consult clubs' over Bury's future 'EFL must learn from Bury expulsion' Bury expulsion 'dark day' for football The club were also handed a 12-point penalty by the EFL for entering into an insolvency agreement. The EFL was not satisfied Bury had provided sufficient evidence of their financial viability, so it postponed a string of the club's fixtures while it awaited ""the clarity required"". The club were given a deadline to complete a sale but after the bid collapsed, they were expelled from the league. Bury fans gathered at Gigg Lane when the club was expelled from the EFL last week 30 July:EFL suspends club's first game of the season asks them to prove financial viability 9 Aug:Bury are given until 23:59 on 23 August to provide ""clarity required"" as third game is called off 20 Aug:Sixth Shakers game suspended, while owner Steve Dale rejects offer to buy club 23 Aug:Bury granted extension until 17:00 on 27 August in light of bid from C&N Sporting Risk 27 Aug:EFL expel Bury after C&N Sporting Risk withdraws interest 29 Aug:Bury claim EFL will not rescind expulsion, despite the club revealing a further Â£7m takeover bid 30 Aug:Bury write to EFL as club ""actively considers"" legal action 2 Sept: Bury North MP reveals plan to submit a proposal to the EFL by 20 September in a bid to have Bury reinstated to League Two in 2020-21 EFL 'to consult clubs' over Bury future MP to put forward Bury proposal MP calls for League Two place for Bury Bury threaten EFL with legal action Bury expelled by English Football League Bury Football Club Common injury may trigger Alzheimerâs disease by awakening hidden virus, study warns Man charged with violent disorder Hathershaw College works with Oldham Sixth Form College for peer supported revision The Mancunian Way: 'I can't stay on the streets... it's absolutely freezing' Police swoop on Â£1m cannabis farm in Royton Man confirmed dead as police probe into early morning collision continues LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"The suicide rate was highest in men aged 45-49 The suicide rate in the UK has risen for the first time since 2013, official figures show. Office for National Statistics data for 2018 showed 11.2 deaths from suicide per 100,000 people - up from 10.1 in 2017. Changes to the way suicides are recorded were brought in midway through last year and may account for some of the rise, the ONS says. However, the suicide rate is still lower than its 1980s peak. The ONS found three-quarters of deaths from suicide registered in 2018 were of men, with 17.2 deaths from suicide per 100,000, up from 15.5 per 100,000 in 2017. Those in their late 40s remain the age group with the highest suicide rate, but young men aged 20-24 and those aged 80-84 saw significant increases. A significant rise was also seen among young girls and women aged 10 to 24. Scotland had the highest suicide rate with 16.1 deaths per 100,000 people; England had the lowest, with 10.3 deaths per 100,000. Deaths from suicide are not registered until a coroner reports, which can take months or even years. Nick Stripe, head of health analysis and life events at the ONS, said: ""We saw a significant increase in the rate of deaths registered as suicide last year which has changed a trend of continuous decline since 2013. ""While the exact reasons for this are unknown, the latest data shows this was largely driven by an increase among men who have continued to be most at risk of dying by suicide. ""In recent years, there have also been increases in the rate among young adults, with females under 25 reaching the highest rate on record for their age group."" But he added: ""Looking at the overall trend since the early 80s, we are still witnessing a gradual decline in the rate of suicide for the population as a whole. ""We will continue to monitor the recent increase, to help inform decision-makers and others that are working to protect vulnerable people at risk."" Ruth Sutherland of the Samaritans said it was ""extremely worrying"" that the suicide rate had increased. ""Every single one of these deaths is a tragedy that devastates families, friends and communities. Whilst the overall rise has only been seen this year, and we hope it is not the start of a longer-term trend, it's crucial to have a better understanding of why there has been such an increase. ""We know that suicide is not inevitable, it is preventable and encouraging steps have been made to prevent suicide, but we need to look at suicide as a serious public health issue. Tom Madders, from the charity YoungMinds, said: ""It's concerning that there has been a reported rise in the number of young people dying by suicide. ""The reasons why young people feel suicidal are often complex, but we know that traumatic experiences at a young age - like bereavement, bullying or abuse - can have a huge impact on mental health. School pressure, concerns about how you look and difficult relationships with family or friends can also have a significant effect. ""We're seeing some much-needed investment in NHS mental health services - but we need much more action to ensure young people can get early help, long before they reach crisis point.""

"This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian rips into Bahamas Hurricane Dorian is moving very slowly north west over the Bahamas, leaving devastation and flooding in its wake. Satellite images showed large areas under water, including the Grand Bahama International airport and the town of Marsh Harbour on Abaco Island. Dorian fell in strength on Tuesday to category two, but the northwest islands continue to endure heavy rain, high winds and storm surges. Five people were killed when the storm hit the Abaco Islands. Residents of the northern Bahamas, some trapped on roofs, sent out pleas for help as the storm thrashed the islands on Monday night, stalling at category five with 185mph winds. The eastern US coast remains on alert for the hurricane. Queen Elizabeth, the head of state of the Bahamas, said she and Prince Philip were ""shocked and saddened to learn of the devastation caused by Hurricane Dorian"" and she sent condolences to families and friends of the victims. ""At this very difficult time, my thoughts and prayers are with those who have seen their homes and property destroyed and I also send my gratitude to the emergency services and volunteers who are supporting the rescue and recovery effort,"" she said in a statement to the country's governor-general, Sir Cornelius Smith. Hurricane Dorian: Who's at risk? Residents share images of devastation Are you in the affected region? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. The most recent update fromthe US National Hurricane Center (NHC),externalplaced Dorian just north of Grand Bahama, home to about 50,000 people, having moved barely 20km (12 miles) in a day. The BBC Weather service said that having remained stationary for many hours, the storm was now moving at 1mph (1.6kph) with maximum sustained winds of 115mph. But the NHC warned the storm was still producing higher gusts at 140 mph, with storm surges of 10ft-15ft (3m to 4.5m) above normal, and the agency advised residents to remain in shelter on Grand Bahama throughout Tuesday. This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian approaches the US The winds at the core of the storm were spinning so fast that the centre of the storm was collapsing on itself, causing it to expand and damage a larger area, according to the BBC Weather service. Steve McAndrew, of the International Red Cross, told the BBC he had been involved in rescue operations for 20 years and could not recall a hurricane ever being listed as stationary. Palm Beach county in Florida - less than 100 miles to the west - saw gusts of up to 60mph on Tuesday. Meanwhile,the UK has sent a team of three humanitarian experts,externalto help assess damage caused by the hurricane, the government said. A Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship, equipped with a helicopter and loaded with relief supplies, is also on standby if needed by the Bahamian authorities, a statement added. Eyewitness videos and reports painted a picture of massive and widespread flooding, with panicked families fleeing to their roofs to escape rising floodwaters. The Bahamas Press showed video of the Rand Memorial Hospital in Freeport under water, with patients forced to evacuate. The news site also relayed calls for help from residents trapped on roofs for hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Freeport resident Yasmin Rigby told the Reuters agency: ""People who thought they were safe are now calling for help"". A map from the Finnish satellite company ICEYE showed the extent of the flooding on the island: Grand Bahama's international airport was under 6ft of water, while residents posting on Twitter said a church in Freeport had lost its roof and scores of people were in danger. Another Twitter posting called for the rescue of an aunt and nine others from rising waters in the town. Video posted on Twitter from Pine Bay showed the extent of the storm there.

Clint Watson, a journalist based in the capital Nassau, said people in Grand Bahama were being hit with ""buckets of rain"" and posting videos online showing water rising to the windows of their attics. ""You can't fathom that but that's what people are showing us with their videos,"" he told the BBC. ""And you can see the water outside pressing in. It's stories like that and images like that that you can't get out of your mind."" One radio station told the Associated Press news agency it had received more than 2,000 distress messages. The Bahamas Press said the entire town of Marsh Harbour in the Abaco Islands had been swamped and warned that the confirmed death toll of five could rise as the situation became clearer.

The islands, with a population of about 17,000, bore the brunt of the storm. No hurricane had ever made landfall with greater wind speeds. Only the 1935 Labor Day hurricane can match Dorian's 185mph. Officials said 21 injured people were airlifted to the capital Nassau by the US Coast Guard. The capital, Nassau, was also affected by flooding Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said on Monday that reports from the Abaco Islands suggested the devastation was ""unprecedented"", calling the hurricane a ""historic tragedy"". Rescue operations were reportedly under way in areas it was safe to enter. How do hurricanes form? Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Neither the Abacos nor Grand Bahama are much higher than 40ft above sea level at their highest points. The International Red Cross said it feared wells may have flooded, making clean water unavailable. The organisation said 13,000 houses were feared damaged or destroyed across the nation. Images from the capital Nassau to the south showed extensive flooding. Matthew Cochrance, a spokesman for the Red Cross, said aid workers were expecting ""significant humanitarian needs"" in the Bahamas once the storm passed. Aerial photos show a harbour with many of the boats pushed out of the sea and destroyed There were concerns on Twitter for US hurricane chaser Josh Morgerman, who had not been heard from since Sunday when his last tweet sent from Marsh Harbour said the storm was ""pounding"" and ""crashing"".

A woman from Nassau, New Providence, said on Facebook that she had taken in 97 stray dogs as the storm hit the island, with 79 staying in her bedroom overnight. The latest update from the NHC predicts Dorian will begin a slow north-west move on Tuesday, with a further turn north on Wednesday. ""The hurricane will move dangerously close to the Florida east coast late [Tuesday] through Wednesday evening, very near the Georgia and South Carolina coasts Wednesday night and Thursday, and near or over the North Carolina coast late Thursday,"" it said. The BBC Weather service said the storm's current track shows it should stay offshore in Florida and Georgia but may affect South Carolina later in the week, although it is likely to have weakened by then. Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina will still feel the impact of the storm and have all declared states of emergency, with mandatory evacuation orders across many areas. Walt Disney World, Legoland and other tourist parks have announced early closures in anticipation of the hurricane. Skies darken in Florida as Hurricane Dorian looms in the Atlantic Scientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, said BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker. Here's why: An increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump Sea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms Use our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured: A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!""Tweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/hSome minor flooding, little structural damage.Storm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/hRoofs and trees could be damaged.Storm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/hHouses suffer damage, severe floodingStorm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/hSome roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.Storm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+Serious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.Storm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless ""For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.""Mayor of New Orleans Ray Nagin ahead of Hurricane Gustav, 2008 Click arrow to proceed Loading ...

"President Ashraf Ghani (pictured) was briefed on the US-Taliban deal on Monday The United States would withdraw 5,400 troops from Afghanistan within 20 weeks as part of a deal ""in principle"" with Taliban militants, Washington's top negotiator has said. Zalmay Khalilzad revealed details of the long-awaited deal for the first time in a TV interview after briefing Afghan leaders on the agreement. But he said final approval still rested with US President Donald Trump. A huge blast rocked Kabul as the interview aired. The Taliban said it was behind the attack, which used a bomb strapped to a tractor to kill at least 16 people and injure at least another 119. The target was a residential compound housing foreigners, just outside the city's heavily-fortified Green Zone. However, it was Afghan civilians who paid the highest price. By morning, about 400 foreigners had been escorted out of the area as anger bubbled over onto the streets. Locals set fire to tyres and blocked a main road, demanding foreigners leave the area for good. ""This is not the first time we suffer because of them,"" resident Abdul Jamil told news agency AFP. ""We don't want them here any more."" What could peace look like? Can Taliban and Afghan leaders share peace? The cost of the US war The attack - the third in as many days - highlights fears that US negotiations with the Taliban won't end the daily violence in Afghanistan and its terrible toll on civilians. The militants now control more territory than at any time since the 2001 US invasion and have so far refused to talk to the Afghan government, whom they deride as American puppets. Ejaz Malikzada, a researcher at the Afghan Institute for Strategic Studies in Kabul, told the BBC he had little hope of change. ""As far as the Taliban are concerned: we can hear them in Doha, we can hear them in Facebook, we can hear them in media, they have not changed, they will keep bombing,"" Mr Malikzada said. ""They say: 'we'll fight even if we sign an agreement with the Americans we'll keep fighting and we'll kill, no matter what'. So the Taliban have not changed, the only change that I can see is their bombs have got bigger."" Protesters took to the streets after the Taliban attack The deal outlined by Mr Khalilzad in an interview with Tolo News is the product of nine rounds of peace talks that have been held in the Gulf state of Qatar. In exchange for the US troop withdrawal, the Taliban would ensure that Afghanistan would never again be used as a base for militant groups seeking to attack the US and its allies. ""We have agreed that if the conditions proceed according to the agreement, we will leave within 135 days five bases in which we are present now,"" Mr Khalilzad said. This video can not be played The view from Lashkar Gah province on whether peace with the Taliban is possible The US currently has about 14,000 troops in the country. A Taliban spokesman confirmed in a text message to the BBC that the details of the troop withdrawal as outlined by Mr Khalilzad were correct. A pullout of the remaining forces would depend on conditions, including the start of peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban as well as a ceasefire, reports the BBC's Lyse Doucet from Kabul. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani will study the deal before giving any opinion, his spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said earlier on Monday. He said the government still needed proof the Taliban were committed to peace. This video can not be played Tens of thousands of Afghan soldiers have been killed and injured. This is their story Many in Afghanistan fear that a US-Taliban deal could see hard-won rights and freedoms eroded. The militants enforced strict religious laws and treated women brutally under their rule from 1996 to 2001. It began when the US launched air strikes one month following the 11 September 2001 attacks and after the Taliban had refused to hand over the man behind them, Osama Bin Laden. The US was joined by an international coalition and the Taliban were quickly removed from power. However, they turned into an insurgent force and continued deadly attacks, destabilising subsequent Afghan governments. The international coalition ended its combat mission in 2014, staying only to train Afghan forces. But the US continued its own, scaled-back combat operation, including air strikes. The Afghan women determined not to lose out Why Afghanistan is more dangerous than ever The Taliban have however continued to gain momentum and last year the BBC found they were active across 70% of Afghanistan. This video can not be played Zan TV presenter Ogai Wardak: ""If the Taliban come, I will fight them"" Nearly 3,500 members of the international coalition forces have died in Afghanistan since the 2001 invasion, more than 2,300 of them American.

In a February 2019 report, the UN said that more than 32,000 civilians had died.The Watson Institute at Brown University,externalsays 58,000 security personnel and 42,000 opposition combatants have been killed.

"Have you been asked by your bank recently to input a one-time passcode in order to complete an online transaction? It seems more and more of us have, as lenders and credit card companies gradually start to roll out new measures to reduce card fraud known as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). On Monday, John Lewis alerted customers to potential changes they might see when making payments in its stores or via its website. A number of banks and credit card providers - as well as the likes of Apple and payments solution provider Stripe - have also published advice. SCA originates from an EU directive designed to reduce payment card fraud across the continent. Banks and retailers had been expected to introduce the measures on 14 September, when the law will officially change, but many were not ready. Instead the Financial Conduct Authority has effectively delayed it, saying it won't enforce the law until March 2021. However, it still expects providers to introduce the measures in a staggered approach over the next 18 months - although when you start noticing changes will depend on who you bank with and where you shop. An estimated Â£671m was lost to fraud on UK payment cards in 2018, a 19% increase on the previous year. Under SCA, if an online shopper spends more than about Â£28 in one transaction, payment providers will be required to ask for an extra form of verification. This will usually be sent by your bank as a one-time password by text to a mobile phone. Alternative forms of verification could include a thumbprint on a smartphone or voice recognition. Shoppers will also see changes in stores: for example, you may find yourself occasionally being asked to enter your pin number when making either a contactless payment or using a mobile wallet. Retailers and banks lobbied the government saying the 14 September start date was unrealistic. According to the British Retail Consortium, the fact providers would not have been ready would have created ""significant disruption to online payments"". Online shopping anti-fraud scheme delayed As a result, it estimated the number of e-commerce transactions carried out in the UK would have dived by 25-30%. ""The technical solutions weren't going to be ready on time, nor the guidance to go with them,"" said Andrew Cregan, the consortium's payments policy advisor. ""You could have seen online transactions abandoned due to people simply not receiving the passcode if their bank didn't hold the correct phone number or if there was no mobile signal."" That said, providers are increasingly likely to contact you to remind you about SCA changes over the next 18 months. Asked about John Lewis's decision to contact its customers this week, a spokeswoman for the retailer said: ""We are trying to give customers the heads-up, so there won't be any barriers to transacting.

"After months of negotiations, the UK and European Union finally agreed a deal that will define their future relationship, which comes into effect at 23.00GMT on 31 December. It has. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on 31 January 2020. However, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, to allow enough time to agree to the terms of a new trade deal. It was a complex, sometimes bitter negotiation, but they finally agreed a deal on 24 December. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across EU borders without paying taxes and there were no limits on the amount of things which could be traded. Under the terms of the deal, that won't change on 1 January, but to be sure that neither side has an unfair advantage, both sides had to agree to some shared rules and standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. You can read more detail on other aspects of the deal, including more on travel, fishing, and financial services,here. What's in the Brexit deal? Freedom to work and live between the UK and the EU also comes to an end, and in 2021, UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with the Republic of Ireland. This will mean however that new checks will be introduced on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Now that it's no longer in the EU, the UK is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate deals with other countries. Talks are being held with the US, Australia and New Zealand - countries that currently don't have free trade deals with the EU. UK leader Boris Johnson signed the deal after the document was flown to the UK from Brussels in an RAF plane There may not be new taxes to pay at the border, but there will be new paperwork, and the potential for it to cause delays is a serious concern. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" according to William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. The UK says it will delay making most checks for six months, to allow people to get used to the new system, but the EU will be checking paperwork and carrying out checks from day one. So if businesses are not prepared, or do not fill in the new paperwork correctly, it could cause delays and backlogs at ports like Dover. The government has known about this for years, and has made plans to divert trade to other ports around the country and has built lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. It's difficult to predict what the scale of any disruption might be, but government minister Michael Gove has said that UK businesses should prepare for some ""bumpy moments"". Sadly, no. Decisions are still to be made on data sharing and on financial services, and the agreement on fishing only lasts five years. Also while the UK and EU have agreed to some identical rules now, they don't have to be identical in the future, and if one side takes exception to the changes, they can trigger a dispute, which could ultimately lead to tariffs (charges on imports) being imposed on some goods in the future. Expect the threat of disputes to be a new constant in UK-EU relations. The last few years have seen many words and phrases enter our lives. We haven't used them here, but politicians do use them. Here's what some of them mean: Transition period:The 11-month period following the UK's exit from the EU (finishing at the end of 2020), during which time the UK has followed EU rules, to allow leaders to make a deal. Free trade:Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. Level playing field:A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements like the Brexit deal often include level playing field measures. Tariff:A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders.

"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

"Brexit delay bill passes the House of Commons It would force Boris Johnson to ask EU for delay to Brexit to prevent no deal PM says there must now be a general election But his bid to hold one on 15 October fails due to lack of opposition support Earlier, chancellor set out spending plans for coming year Hamish Mackay, Kate Whannel and Matt Cannon That ends our rolling coverage for today on yet another eventful day in the Commons. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced a double defeat in the Commons after MPs turned down his motion for a general election. There has been a lot to take in, so if you're still catching up - and who would blame you - here's a quick reminder of the major happenings: The Daily Mirror uses its front page to declare Mr Johnson ""Britain's worst PM (since the last one)"". An image of what the paper calls a ""deflated"" Mr Johnson looking downward fills the front page. Theresa May smiles out from an inset picture. A more animated photo of the prime minister fills the front page of the Daily Express. ""Boris urges 'people power' to force election,"" is the headline. It calls Jeremy Corbyn's decision not to support a general election until a bill designed to help avert a no-deal Brexit is passed ""an extraordinary act of cowardice"". The front pages of the Daily Mail and the Sun both pick up on Boris Johnson calling Jeremy Corbyn a ""chicken"" for refusing to back a general election before the Hilary Benn's bill is passed into law. The Sun goes as far as superimposing the Labour leader's face onto a chicken, alongside the headline ""Is this the most dangerous chicken in Britain?"". Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph opts for the headline ""'Hypocrite' Corbyn rejects election to break deadlock"". The newspapers are responding to another momentous day in Parliament. The front pages of the i, the Guardian and the Financial Times all say the prime minister has been left ""cornered"" by MPs after losing three votes in the Commons.

Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is reported to have told European diplomats that negotiations with London over the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU are in a state of paralysis. He also advised the meeting that Britain appeared intent on reducing the level of ambition in the political declaration that will steer the next stage of the negotiations. The statement is in stark contrast with claims by the UK government that progress has been made in redrafting elements of the agreement painstakingly negotiated over the past two years. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said it was leading EU leaders to think Mr Johnson ""cannot have a solution up his sleeve - despite all the rhetoric"". Find our how your local MP voted on the bill to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and on the PM's call for an early general election. MPs have voted on an early general election and a bill that could delay Brexit. Sir Michael Fallon has been the MP for Sevenoaks since 1997 Former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has announced he will be standing down at the next election. In a statement he said: ""Sadly I have decided that this parliament will be my last.  I have served as an MP, for both Darlington and Sevenoaks, for more than 30 years - quite long enough. ""I want to thank all my constituents for their support and encouragement. ""Wendy and I will continue to live in the constituency and to be involved locally. If an immediate election is called, I will not therefore be a candidate."" Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert ""I think the truth is the argument about no-deal is just a
re-hash of the debate about whether we want to remain or leave in the first
place."" ""With Brexit there is no point in talking about the electorate as a whole. ""We have two different electorates: we have a remain electorate and we have a leave electorate. ""Seventy five per cent of remain voters think that leaving without a deal is a bad idea and they oppose it. And around 75% of leave voters think that it is a good idea and they favour it. ""We're now seeing that divide remain/leave divide very, very clearly articulated in their preference for a general election."" The government has announced that some EU nationals will be able to apply to stay in the UK for three years in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Those arriving in the UK before the end of next year will be able to apply to the new scheme, the government confirmed on Wednesday evening. This would allow EU nationals who arrive before the end of 2020 to stay until December 2023. You canread the full story here.

"This video can not be played ""We need help"": Video shows missing roofs and flooded roads At least five people have been killed in the Bahamas, as Hurricane Dorian continues to batter the country. Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said the deaths were confirmed at the north-eastern Abaco Islands, which bore the brunt of the storm. Some 13,000 houses are feared damaged or destroyed, according to the International Red Cross. Dorian, the second-strongest Atlantic hurricane on record, remains ""extremely dangerous"", Mr Minnis said. Pictures showed surging floodwaters, upturned cars and snapped trees. Eyewitness videos and reports paint a picture of massive and widespread flooding, with panicked families fleeing to their roofs to escape rising floodwaters. Streets are flooded throughout the Bahamas Dorian is the most powerful storm to hit the Bahamas since records began and will later move ""dangerously close"" to the US east coast, according to forecasters. It hit the Bahamas as a category five hurricane but has now weakened to a category four with maximum sustained winds near 150mph (240 km/h),says the US National Hurricane Center (NHC) in its latest update,external. Dorian will however remain ""a powerful hurricane during the next couple of days"". The NHC said that only a slight deviation in the path of the storm could bring Dorian directly over Florida's east coast, which is already expected to face life-threatening storm surges and dangerous winds over the next couple of days. The US states of Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina have all declared states of emergency. The storm is hovering over Grand Bahama, having earlier made landfall on the Abaco Islands. It has brought ferocious winds and massive amounts of water to both areas, which are in the north of the Bahamas archipelago. Grand Bahama, with a population of about 50,000, is only 100km (60 miles) east of West Palm Beach in Florida. Forecasters had warned the storm could create ""life-threatening"" storm surges as high as 23ft (7m). Dorian is the most powerful storm to hit the island nation since records began Clint Watson, a journalist based in the capital Nassau, said people in Grand Bahama were being hit with ""buckets of rain"" and posting videos online showing water rising to the windows of their attics. ""You can't fathom that but that's what people are showing us with their videos, saying 'Please, come and rescue me. I'm in the roof of my home and this is where the water is'. And you can see the water outside pressing in. It's stories like that and images like that that you can't get out of your mind,"" he told the BBC. Local media report that the international airport is under water. Hurricane Dorian: Who's at risk? Residents share images of devastation Are you in the affected region? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Dorian is stationary over the archipelago, the NHC said,external, and ""continues to thrash Grand Bahama Island"". Wind gusts and storm surges will continue into Tuesday morning, ""causing extreme destruction"". The winds at the core of the storm are spinning so fast that the centre is collapsing on itself, stalling over the area and weakening the storm's eye. This is making it expand and cause damage over a larger area, says BBC Weather. On Monday morning, Mr Minnis said reports from the Abaco Islands suggested the devastation was ""unprecedented"". The Abacos are home to about 17,000 people. It is unclear how many ignored evacuation orders and pleas from officials to leave low-lying areas. How do hurricanes form? Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? The International Red Cross also said as many as 13,000 houses could have been destroyed. ""There might no longer be any clean water readily available on Abaco because of storm surges flooding wells,"" spokesman Matthew Cochrane told the BBC.

TV station Eyewitness News carried an interview with one woman,externalwho said her eight-year-old grandson had drowned on the Abaco Islands. The Bahamas is one of the countries most regularly hit by hurricanes, and homes are required to be reinforced to withstand the winds of a category four storm. The storm is currently moving west but it is forecast to make a gradual turn north or north-west, taking it along the eastern US seaboard. But its path is difficult to predict and it's unclear if it will make landfall. ""Surge-related flooding depends on the how close the centre of Dorian comes to the Florida east coast,"" the NHC said. President Donald Trump told reporters on Sunday that the storm ""looks monstrous"" and the US east coast would ""be ultimately impacted and some of it very, very severely"". Florida Governor Ron DeSantis warned people not to be complacent following the change in the storm's predicted path.  ""This storm at this magnitude could really cause massive destruction,"" he said. Popular attractions, including Disney World in Orlando, have said they are ""closely monitoring"" the storm. Miami has ordered the removal of electric rental scooters from the streets to avoid them becoming projectiles. South Carolina on Sunday issued a mandatory evacuation of the entire coast, effective of noon on Monday and affecting 830,000 people. Georgia then followed suit. Scientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes. But the ones that do happen are more likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, says BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker.

"This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian rips into Bahamas Hurricane Dorian is moving very slowly north west over the Bahamas, leaving devastation and flooding in its wake. Satellite images showed large areas under water, including the Grand Bahama International airport and the town of Marsh Harbour on Abaco Island. Dorian fell in strength on Tuesday to category two, but the northwest islands continue to endure heavy rain, high winds and storm surges. Five people were killed when the storm hit the Abaco Islands. Residents of the northern Bahamas, some trapped on roofs, sent out pleas for help as the storm thrashed the islands on Monday night, stalling at category five with 185mph winds. The eastern US coast remains on alert for the hurricane. Queen Elizabeth, the head of state of the Bahamas, said she and Prince Philip were ""shocked and saddened to learn of the devastation caused by Hurricane Dorian"" and she sent condolences to families and friends of the victims. ""At this very difficult time, my thoughts and prayers are with those who have seen their homes and property destroyed and I also send my gratitude to the emergency services and volunteers who are supporting the rescue and recovery effort,"" she said in a statement to the country's governor-general, Sir Cornelius Smith. Hurricane Dorian: Who's at risk? Residents share images of devastation Are you in the affected region? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. The most recent update fromthe US National Hurricane Center (NHC),externalplaced Dorian just north of Grand Bahama, home to about 50,000 people, having moved barely 20km (12 miles) in a day. The BBC Weather service said that having remained stationary for many hours, the storm was now moving at 1mph (1.6kph) with maximum sustained winds of 115mph. But the NHC warned the storm was still producing higher gusts at 140 mph, with storm surges of 10ft-15ft (3m to 4.5m) above normal, and the agency advised residents to remain in shelter on Grand Bahama throughout Tuesday. This video can not be played Hurricane Dorian approaches the US The winds at the core of the storm were spinning so fast that the centre of the storm was collapsing on itself, causing it to expand and damage a larger area, according to the BBC Weather service. Steve McAndrew, of the International Red Cross, told the BBC he had been involved in rescue operations for 20 years and could not recall a hurricane ever being listed as stationary. Palm Beach county in Florida - less than 100 miles to the west - saw gusts of up to 60mph on Tuesday. Meanwhile,the UK has sent a team of three humanitarian experts,externalto help assess damage caused by the hurricane, the government said. A Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship, equipped with a helicopter and loaded with relief supplies, is also on standby if needed by the Bahamian authorities, a statement added. Eyewitness videos and reports painted a picture of massive and widespread flooding, with panicked families fleeing to their roofs to escape rising floodwaters. The Bahamas Press showed video of the Rand Memorial Hospital in Freeport under water, with patients forced to evacuate. The news site also relayed calls for help from residents trapped on roofs for hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Freeport resident Yasmin Rigby told the Reuters agency: ""People who thought they were safe are now calling for help"". A map from the Finnish satellite company ICEYE showed the extent of the flooding on the island: Grand Bahama's international airport was under 6ft of water, while residents posting on Twitter said a church in Freeport had lost its roof and scores of people were in danger. Another Twitter posting called for the rescue of an aunt and nine others from rising waters in the town. Video posted on Twitter from Pine Bay showed the extent of the storm there.

The islands, with a population of about 17,000, bore the brunt of the storm. No hurricane had ever made landfall with greater wind speeds. Only the 1935 Labor Day hurricane can match Dorian's 185mph. Officials said 21 injured people were airlifted to the capital Nassau by the US Coast Guard. The capital, Nassau, was also affected by flooding Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said on Monday that reports from the Abaco Islands suggested the devastation was ""unprecedented"", calling the hurricane a ""historic tragedy"". Rescue operations were reportedly under way in areas it was safe to enter. How do hurricanes form? Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Neither the Abacos nor Grand Bahama are much higher than 40ft above sea level at their highest points. The International Red Cross said it feared wells may have flooded, making clean water unavailable. The organisation said 13,000 houses were feared damaged or destroyed across the nation. Images from the capital Nassau to the south showed extensive flooding. Matthew Cochrance, a spokesman for the Red Cross, said aid workers were expecting ""significant humanitarian needs"" in the Bahamas once the storm passed. Aerial photos show a harbour with many of the boats pushed out of the sea and destroyed There were concerns on Twitter for US hurricane chaser Josh Morgerman, who had not been heard from since Sunday when his last tweet sent from Marsh Harbour said the storm was ""pounding"" and ""crashing"".

A woman from Nassau, New Providence, said on Facebook that she had taken in 97 stray dogs as the storm hit the island, with 79 staying in her bedroom overnight. The latest update from the NHC predicts Dorian will begin a slow north-west move on Tuesday, with a further turn north on Wednesday. ""The hurricane will move dangerously close to the Florida east coast late [Tuesday] through Wednesday evening, very near the Georgia and South Carolina coasts Wednesday night and Thursday, and near or over the North Carolina coast late Thursday,"" it said. The BBC Weather service said the storm's current track shows it should stay offshore in Florida and Georgia but may affect South Carolina later in the week, although it is likely to have weakened by then. Florida, Georgia and North and South Carolina will still feel the impact of the storm and have all declared states of emergency, with mandatory evacuation orders across many areas. Walt Disney World, Legoland and other tourist parks have announced early closures in anticipation of the hurricane.

"Brexit delay bill passes the House of Commons It would force Boris Johnson to ask EU for delay to Brexit to prevent no deal PM says there must now be a general election But his bid to hold one on 15 October fails due to lack of opposition support Earlier, chancellor set out spending plans for coming year Hamish Mackay, Kate Whannel and Matt Cannon That ends our rolling coverage for today on yet another eventful day in the Commons. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced a double defeat in the Commons after MPs turned down his motion for a general election. There has been a lot to take in, so if you're still catching up - and who would blame you - here's a quick reminder of the major happenings: The Daily Mirror uses its front page to declare Mr Johnson ""Britain's worst PM (since the last one)"". An image of what the paper calls a ""deflated"" Mr Johnson looking downward fills the front page. Theresa May smiles out from an inset picture. A more animated photo of the prime minister fills the front page of the Daily Express. ""Boris urges 'people power' to force election,"" is the headline. It calls Jeremy Corbyn's decision not to support a general election until a bill designed to help avert a no-deal Brexit is passed ""an extraordinary act of cowardice"". The front pages of the Daily Mail and the Sun both pick up on Boris Johnson calling Jeremy Corbyn a ""chicken"" for refusing to back a general election before the Hilary Benn's bill is passed into law. The Sun goes as far as superimposing the Labour leader's face onto a chicken, alongside the headline ""Is this the most dangerous chicken in Britain?"". Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph opts for the headline ""'Hypocrite' Corbyn rejects election to break deadlock"". The newspapers are responding to another momentous day in Parliament. The front pages of the i, the Guardian and the Financial Times all say the prime minister has been left ""cornered"" by MPs after losing three votes in the Commons.

Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is reported to have told European diplomats that negotiations with London over the terms of Britain's withdrawal from the EU are in a state of paralysis. He also advised the meeting that Britain appeared intent on reducing the level of ambition in the political declaration that will steer the next stage of the negotiations. The statement is in stark contrast with claims by the UK government that progress has been made in redrafting elements of the agreement painstakingly negotiated over the past two years. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said it was leading EU leaders to think Mr Johnson ""cannot have a solution up his sleeve - despite all the rhetoric"". Find our how your local MP voted on the bill to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and on the PM's call for an early general election. MPs have voted on an early general election and a bill that could delay Brexit. Sir Michael Fallon has been the MP for Sevenoaks since 1997 Former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon has announced he will be standing down at the next election. In a statement he said: ""Sadly I have decided that this parliament will be my last.  I have served as an MP, for both Darlington and Sevenoaks, for more than 30 years - quite long enough. ""I want to thank all my constituents for their support and encouragement. ""Wendy and I will continue to live in the constituency and to be involved locally. If an immediate election is called, I will not therefore be a candidate."" Professor Sir John CurticePolling expert ""I think the truth is the argument about no-deal is just a
re-hash of the debate about whether we want to remain or leave in the first
place."" ""With Brexit there is no point in talking about the electorate as a whole. ""We have two different electorates: we have a remain electorate and we have a leave electorate. ""Seventy five per cent of remain voters think that leaving without a deal is a bad idea and they oppose it. And around 75% of leave voters think that it is a good idea and they favour it. ""We're now seeing that divide remain/leave divide very, very clearly articulated in their preference for a general election."" The government has announced that some EU nationals will be able to apply to stay in the UK for three years in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Those arriving in the UK before the end of next year will be able to apply to the new scheme, the government confirmed on Wednesday evening. This would allow EU nationals who arrive before the end of 2020 to stay until December 2023. You canread the full story here.

"Have you been asked by your bank recently to input a one-time passcode in order to complete an online transaction? It seems more and more of us have, as lenders and credit card companies gradually start to roll out new measures to reduce card fraud known as Strong Customer Authentication (SCA). On Monday, John Lewis alerted customers to potential changes they might see when making payments in its stores or via its website. A number of banks and credit card providers - as well as the likes of Apple and payments solution provider Stripe - have also published advice. SCA originates from an EU directive designed to reduce payment card fraud across the continent. Banks and retailers had been expected to introduce the measures on 14 September, when the law will officially change, but many were not ready. Instead the Financial Conduct Authority has effectively delayed it, saying it won't enforce the law until March 2021. However, it still expects providers to introduce the measures in a staggered approach over the next 18 months - although when you start noticing changes will depend on who you bank with and where you shop. An estimated Â£671m was lost to fraud on UK payment cards in 2018, a 19% increase on the previous year. Under SCA, if an online shopper spends more than about Â£28 in one transaction, payment providers will be required to ask for an extra form of verification. This will usually be sent by your bank as a one-time password by text to a mobile phone. Alternative forms of verification could include a thumbprint on a smartphone or voice recognition. Shoppers will also see changes in stores: for example, you may find yourself occasionally being asked to enter your pin number when making either a contactless payment or using a mobile wallet. Retailers and banks lobbied the government saying the 14 September start date was unrealistic. According to the British Retail Consortium, the fact providers would not have been ready would have created ""significant disruption to online payments"". Online shopping anti-fraud scheme delayed As a result, it estimated the number of e-commerce transactions carried out in the UK would have dived by 25-30%. ""The technical solutions weren't going to be ready on time, nor the guidance to go with them,"" said Andrew Cregan, the consortium's payments policy advisor. ""You could have seen online transactions abandoned due to people simply not receiving the passcode if their bank didn't hold the correct phone number or if there was no mobile signal."" That said, providers are increasingly likely to contact you to remind you about SCA changes over the next 18 months. Asked about John Lewis's decision to contact its customers this week, a spokeswoman for the retailer said: ""We are trying to give customers the heads-up, so there won't be any barriers to transacting. We want to be on the front foot.""

"This video can not be played Student flats: Are there too many in Cardiff's skyline? Cardiff could be left with a skyline of empty buildings after an ""oversaturation"" of luxury student flats, a leading architect has said. Plans to create about 7,400 new student rooms have been approved in the city in the past five years. But a number of schemes have since been let to professionals and tourists after a struggle to fill rooms. Jonathan Adams, who designed the Wales Millennium Centre, said the buildings may have to be demolished. Cardiff council said despite a number of applications for new student blocks, the number of beds remained fewer than the student population. BBC analysis showed about 7,400 new rooms, the majority in purpose-built student accommodations (PBSAs), have gained permission or been granted on appeal since 2014. The 25-storey tall Zenith development has 675 rooms, but for now the developers are allowed to rent 401 studios as serviced apartments to non-students This includes Custom House - a 42-storey student block near Central Station which, if built, would be Wales' tallest building. But five developments have changed use to let some rooms to non-students on a temporary basis after developers struggled to fill rooms due to construction delays. Another PBSA in Cathays Parkchanged permanently to a residential hotel,externalafter developers said they could not fill a quarter of the rooms last year. With more applying to change use, some schemes not yet built and plans for more student rooms on City Road, there are concerns the city will be left with student rooms that cannot be filled. Jonathan Adams said some of the buildings were ""terrifically awful"" Mr Adams fears PBSAs will have a limited lifespan and does not believe they have been designed for alternative use. PBSAs are classed as sui generis,external, meaning they are treated differently from other types of accommodation and standards for light, space and outside areas are often lower. Mr Adams said this meant converting them into flats was not straightforward and developers could face hefty bills to adapt them. Students taking out loans to afford 'luxury' flats Wales' tallest building will be built ""The problem is they will be dated, they are made cheaply, standards will move on,"" he said. ""It is difficult not to see a scenario in the future where we would not know what to do with them."" Last year Cardiff council introducedguidance advising PBSA developers to submit adaptability statements,externalwhen applying for planning permission  - to say how buildings could be changed into hotels or homes. But this is not a statutory requirement and Mr Adams fears the buildings may stand empty in a few years. ""It could easily be the case that they could all end up being dismantled in 20 to 30 years' time, or be substantially altered,"" he added. This student block was allowed to let to non-students until the end of August Cardiff Civic Society said the city's unique identity could be lost to high-rise buildings and student flats. Dr Elaine Davey said: ""We have wonderful buildings in Cardiff and this is spoiling the city."" In a bid to drive up standards, the Welsh Government set up theDesign Commission for Wales,externalto offer advice to councils. Despite the commission objecting formally - for the first time - to student scheme Bradley Court, which involved the demolition of a Grade II-listed building, the council approved it. The authority said it had detailed policies for the preservation and enhancement of heritage assets and there were a number of cases where buildings had been adapted for alternative use. Diana Finley lived in the Eclipse building while studying at the University of South Wales Traditionally, Cardiff students mostly live in house shares - or Houses of Multiple Occupation (HMOs) - around Cathays and Roath. But recently, PBSAs have been built, mainly aimed at international students. Some hoped this would free up HMOs for families, but property expert David Feeney, of Cushman and Wakefield, said this was not really happening as rents were too high and the market was ""oversaturated"". Amarket report by Saville's,externallast year said the volume of PBSAs under construction or awaiting permission had reached record levels in Cardiff and supply was significantly below the anticipated growth in student numbers. While many offer incentives, including reduced rents, cash back and free breakfasts, Mr Feeney said it was not yet enough to entice students from traditional house shares. ""If you are charging Â£150 a week for these flats, you are not going to get them out of the Â£80 a week HMOS, they cannot afford it,"" said Mr Feeney. ""There is going to be a lot of people going to be hurting and a lot of empty buildings."" Diana said she had to wear headphones in her room and spent most of her time at university after construction of another student building started next door University of South Wales student Diana Finley, from Nevada, paid about Â£650 a month to live in the Eclipse development - which has a private dining room, cinema and gym and offered trips to north Wales. Her friend Ellie Tipples lives in a traditional house share, paying about Â£350 a month. Diana said she enjoyed her time living there, but did not think it was value for money as she did not make it on any of the trips due to her studies. Collegiate, who manage Eclipse, said its accommodation was affordable and in high demand, and that the trips and extras it offered helped to support the physical and mental welfare of students. Watkin Jones - the developer behind Custom House - said it did not recognise claims the demand was no longer there. A spokeswoman said Cardiff remained a ""vibrant and attractive student city and destination"" with investor appetite remaining close to record levels. CRM Students, which manages seven PBSAs in Cardiff, said it had achieved high levels of occupancy across all properties and expected them to be full or nearly full for the start of the academic year. How the tower will look when seen from the Great Western Hotel When a developer applies to build student housing there is no requirement to contribute towards affordable housing - automatically triggered in residential developments. And - unlike hotels - owners of student flats do not pay business rates. Some are concerned developers could be building PBSAs to get around standards and paying contributions, but developers dismissed this. Mr Feeney said: ""People are trying to play the system, they know they wouldn't get it through if it wasn't a student scheme."" Managing company CRM Students is offering Â£1,000 cashback when rooms are booked at this development on City Road Residents believe the latest application, by DG1 Developments Ltd, to temporarily change flats on City Road to serviced apartments would set a ""shocking precedent"" for ""unwanted"" student flats. The company said it had been unable to fill the rooms due to construction delays. Last year it applied to turn theblocks to residential on a permanent basis,external, saying student rooms could become unviable because of lack of demand - the council refused and developers have appealed. DG1 Developments Limited did not respond to a request for comment. The former Gaiety Grand Cinema on City Road, which opened in 1912, is due to be demolished to make way for an eight-storey student development Dr Neil Harris, planning expert at Cardiff University, dismissed fears developers could be abusing a loophole to avoid contributions, saying it was ""not a means of circumventing rules"". ""The temporary change of use is a potential, and plausible solution to developers not being able to fill buildings if they can't get people in that year."" The Gaiety Cinema through the years A council spokesman said claims developers could ""short change"" the planning process was ""completely incorrect"". ""[The applicant] would also be liable for new planning, architects and other professional fees, and in many cases could involve significant redesign to the inside and outside of the building. ""In other words it is a lengthier and more expensive way for a developer,"" he added. There are more plans for student housing in the pipeline with a number of developments not yet built Councils are legally obliged to consider every application on an individual basis and can only refuse an application on planning grounds such as highway safety. Cardiff council has put policies in place for HMOs, student flats and tall buildings to advise the committee and developers. A spokesman said: ""A planning authority cannot refuse an application because we don't believe there is a need for the development. ""Whilst Cardiff has seen a number of applications for new PBSA in recent years, the number of bed spaces remains significantly less than the student population of Cardiff.""
