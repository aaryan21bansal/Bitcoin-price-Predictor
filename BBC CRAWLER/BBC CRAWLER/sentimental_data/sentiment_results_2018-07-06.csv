"US lobsters are among goods subject to Chinese retaliatory tariffs China has hit back after US tariffs on Chinese goods came into effect and President Donald Trump threatened to impose more. China's commerce ministry said it had lodged a new complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO). Meanwhile, Russia has announced extra duties on US imports in retaliation for earlier US steel tariffs. Beijing has accused the US of starting the ""largest trade war in economic history"". Charting the US-China trade battle How a US-China trade war could hurt us all Trade row: What has happened so far? US tariffs on $34bn (Â£25.7bn) of Chinese goods came into effect on Friday. China retaliated by imposing a similar 25% tariff on 545 US products - including cars, soya beans and lobsters - also worth a total of $34bn. Russia is introducing extra duties on a range of products imported from the US that can be replaced by locally made equivalents. They include road-building equipment, products for the oil and gas industry, and tools used in mining. This video can not be played Why the US-China trade war will hit most of our pockets Mr Trump has already imposed tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels, and started charging levies on the imports of steel and aluminium from the European Union, Mexico and Canada. The US tariffs imposed so far would affect the equivalent of 0.6% of global trade and account for 0.1% of global GDP, according to Morgan Stanley. The US president said America might target Chinese goods worth $500bn - the total value of Chinese imports in 2017. The White House had previously said it would consult on tariffs on another $16bn of products, which Mr Trump has suggested could come into effect later this month. Mr Trump said: ""You have another 16 [billion dollars] in two weeks, and then, as you know, we have $200bn in abeyance and then after the $200bn, we have $300bn in abeyance. OK? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300."" Donald Trump says US tariffs will protect US jobs The American tariffs are the result of Mr Trump's attempt to protect US jobs and stop what he calls ""unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China"". By Tara McKelvey, White House reporter Behind the trade war, there is conflict within the Trump administration. Hardliners such as Peter Navarro, a trade policy adviser, says the US is defending itself against an ""aggressive"" China. Meanwhile, some of the officials who previously worked for the Obama administration - known as ""holdovers"" - are hoping to tamp down the US-China conflict. The tension between these factions is occasionally on display in the West Wing. I've seen two hardliners struggle over a podium, vying for a chance to broadcast Trump's harsh message on economic issues, while the holdovers sit quietly at the side of the room. This reflects a larger division in the White House: Trump and his closest aides are trying to bring about radical change, while those who support a more cautious approach find themselves sitting in silence. ""Trade war is never a solution,"" said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. ""China would never start a trade war, but if any party resorts to an increase of tariffs then China will take measures in response to protect development interests."" The government-run English language China Daily newspaper said: ""The Trump administration is behaving like a gang of hoodlums with its shakedown of other countries, particularly China."" Russia says US tariffs on steel and aluminium, introduced in March, will cost its companies more than half a billion dollars. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecast only a modest escalation in the US-China battle, adding: ""However, we can't rule out a full-blown, recession-inducing 'trade war'."" Rob Carnell, chief Asia economist at ING, said: ""This is not economic Armageddon. We will not have to hunt our food with pointy sticks. ""But it is applying the brakes to a global economy that has less durable momentum than appears to be the case."" Carmaker BMW said it could not absorb all of the 25% tariff on the cars it exports to China from a plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina and would have to raise prices. The new tariffs had little impact on Asian stock markets. The Shanghai Composite closed 0.5% higher, but ended the week 3.5% lower - its seventh consecutive week of losses. Tokyo closed 1.1% higher and European markets were up more than 1% in morning trading before turning negative on Friday afternoon. Please upgrade your browser to view this content.

"A picture of the fire-test A popular cladding brand failed a safety test this week - despite being seen as so fire-safe that it is permitted on tall buildings without any extra tests, Newsnight has learned. Cladding removed for failing tests may be being replaced by this brand, which has now failed the same test. Valcan, the UK distributor of Vitracore G2, said the product is safe and had passed the required testing. The housing ministry said it would look ""closely"" at the results. The test that took place this week was unusual: a fire-test took place in Dubai of a cladding design that, ordinarily, would not be expected to be tested.  It was a cladding system made up of Vitracore G2 cladding over a mineral wool insulation. UK building rules would presuppose this design to be safe without the test, since all the parts have fire safety ratings of at least ""limited combustibility"". This rating of ""limited combustibility"" is assigned based on lab assessments of the materials' chemistry. These ratings mean that, if this design were to be specified for a building, it could be installed without any need for a full system test.  It is only designs that use components deemed to have weaker fire ratings that are obliged to go through them. Our regulations assume a design using components of ""limited combustibility"" would pass the test - a test known in the jargon as the ""BS-8414"". This is the normal system test: cladding is fixed over a wall, and a fire is lit underneath it to test its resistance to the blaze. The test is intended to simulate the response to a fire spilling out of a window. It was the BS-8414 test that was used last year to determine which cladding systems were safe or unsafe after the Grenfell fire. The test was carried out at a facility run by an independent testing company called Exova and commissioned by Kingspan, a company that makes cladding products.  When the cladding was tested, the Exova engineers found that the temperature inside the cladding breached the upper limits required to pass the test. Adrian Buckmaster of Tetraclad, a cladding company, said he has observed a marked rise in the popularity of Vitracore G2, explaining: ""the sort of buildings it's going on to is where existing cladding that has failed the recent tests wants to be replaced with a similar type of finish."" This means that LAs and housing associations may have replaced cladding systems that have failed the BS 8414 test with a design that would also fail that test. A fire engine outside a tower block in Camden Vitracore G2 is a panel with honeycomb structure: it has a structure similar to corrugated cardboard - but is made out of aluminium. The panel has no solid core - and especially no combustible core, such as those used in the panels on the Grenfell Tower. Vitracore G2 is much safer than plastic-cored products like those used at Grenfell - but there have been concerns within the industry about how honeycomb-style cladding can safely be used. Vitracore G2 is made of thin aluminium and melts away rapidly in fire. This limits its ability to protect other components in the same way that more solid A2 panels can.  Vitracore G2 also has glue inside, holding it together. The glue, according to Vitracore's official test certificates, is highly combustible. This is permitted for a product of limited combustibility, if there is very little of it. Valcan, which distributes Vitracore G2 in the UK, said that the product had passed a BS-8414 test previously.  They also noted that because it has a ""limited combustibility"" rating, their cladding could be used in some circumstances without needing a test. They told Newsnight: ""Vitracore G2 was testedâ¦ by Exova Warringtonfire in November 2017. The panel did not spread flame, and temperature results were safely below requirements."" ""This test of Vitracore G2 demonstrates that the panels will not cause a fire to spread through the exterior or interior of a high-rise building."" The fire test rig during the test This is a broader issue than Vitracore G2, however. Newsnight has also learned of two other tests where a cladding system exclusively using limited combustibility components failed fire tests - one conducted in Australia and one in the UK. These results further challenge the assumption that a system made from products rated as ""limited combustibility"" or better can be assumed to be safe if the overall system has not been tested. This episode raises questions for the government. Ministers are minded to ban all combustible components in cladding. If it is still possible to create cladding systems that are unsafe without using anything deemed ""combustible"", this ban may not be effective. Mr Buckmaster said: ""maybe this is the situation where not only do you have to achieve a classification of non or limited combustibility but you also have to pass a large scale test."" The housing ministry said: ""We are consulting on banning the use of combustible materials in cladding systems on high-rise residential buildings. We will be looking at these test results closely.""

"2018 Fifa World Cup quarter-final: Sweden v England Venue: Samara Arena Date: Saturday, 7 July Time: 15:00 BST Coverage: Watch live on BBC TV, Red Button andiPlayer,BBC Sport websiteand app;listen on Radio 5 live; follow text updates online Millions of football fans are following the match between England and Sweden as they battle for a place in the World Cup semi-finals. The game - taking place in the Russian city of Samara - kicked off at 15:00 BST and can be followed across the BBC. England have not reached the last four of the tournament for 28 years and their sole World Cup win came in 1966. Before the match, manager Gareth Southgate said: ""We're improving and want to make history."" England are favourites to reach the last four from what is considered the easier side of the draw, with the winners of the match facing Russia or Croatia - who play later at 19:00 BST. Live updates: Sweden v England Analysis: 'England's golden chance to make giant leap forward' In Pictures: The nation watches big match 'Psychic' animals predict England v Sweden result How are you watching the game today? Email your pictures or video toyourpics@bbc.co.uk or use WhatsApp: +44 7555 173285 With the country basking in a heatwave, thousands of fans are watching the game on big screens at events up and down the country; barbecues have been prepared and pub gardens are experiencing bumper business. The climax of England's World Cup penalty shootout win over Colombia on Tuesday was seen by 23.6 million viewers on ITV. One England fan preparing a barbecue for the game had a shock this afternoon when his wife went into labour with their first child. ""The due date was nine days ago, but I was hoping she might be able to hold out until tomorrow,"" said Gaz, who married his wife Amy a year ago. ""I'm still hoping to catch the odd sneaky glance of the match from my phone. ""I wonder if my new daughter will be watching England in the semis with me."" Supermarkets could have seen a 5% uplift in grocery sales and 25% in alcohol as football fans stocked up on beer and barbecue food for the match. Tesco's the UK's largest retailer has predicted selling 3.5 million sausages this week along with four million burgers and three million punnets of strawberries. Asda, meanwhile, estimates a 1,966% rise in the sales of sausages, meatballs and barbecues compared with last week. British Airways says its website has seen a 700% increase in searches for flights to the host nation, Russia. England are in their first World Cup quarter-final for 12 years and are aiming to reach the semi-finals for the first-time since 1990. Sweden, the 1958 runners-up, last reached the quarter-finals in 1994 when they went on to finish third. England are the only side left in their side of the draw who have a won a World Cup before. Tuesday's victory over Colombia was England's first in a World Cup penalty shootout. England have scored nine goals already at this World Cup - the only time they have scored more is in 1966 when they won the tournament. This video can not be played The EastEnders cast cheer on England ahead of the match This video can not be played The last time England played Sweden at a World Cup Ashley Young, Kyle Walker and Dele Allie will start the game, having overcome minor injuries. Despite a groin injury, striker Jamie Vardy is fit enough to be named on the bench. Captain Harry Kane is aiming to become only the second Englishman after Lineker to win the Golden Boot for the World Cup's top scorer. He needs one goal to break Lineker's feat of scoring six times in 1986. ""My target isn't the Golden Boot,"" Kane told reporters. ""The target is to win the tournament. That's always been the target."" Sweden are 24th in Fifa's rankings - 12 places below England - and are without national hero Zlatan Ibrahimovic - who retired from international football two years ago. But they finished ahead of the Netherlands in qualifying, beat Italy in the subsequent play-offs and topped their group in Russia containing defending champions Germany. After Sweden's 1-0 win over Switzerland which sealed a spot in the last eight, coach Janne Andersson said: ""We're not satisfied with what we've done - we want to win the next match too."" The team had a rude awakening on Saturday when their hotel fire alarm went off first thing in the morning. Though there have been no suggestions of foul play, it follows an earlier incident in the tournament when police were called afterIran fans tried to stop the Portuguese team from sleepingby making noise outside their hotel. Matches 24: England won 8; drawn 9; lost 7. Team news and preview All you need to know about Sweden Belgium 'are the team to beat' Expectation levels among England fans were relatively low ahead of the tournament, after a series of previous disappointments including a humiliating knockout defeat by Iceland at Euro 2016. However, an early exit for defending champions Germany, as well as the shock departure of five-time victors Brazil on Friday, has boosted optimism in the England camp. In fact, it is the first time in history of the competition that none of Brazil, Germany or Argentina have made the semi-finals. Former England players including Rio Ferdinand, Ian Wright, Ray Clemence and Peter Shilton tweeted their support on Saturday morning. Many supporters have been chanting, singing or simply declaring ""it's coming home"" in reference to theThree Lions songwritten for Euro 96 by comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner with the band the Lightning Seeds. Skinner has uploaded a video of himself dancing to the song with his shirt over his head. Former England captain David Beckham recorded a video in which he tells his followers: ""It's coming home."" But the feeling of optimism has not been shared by all. Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher has insisted, in his own colourful way, that football will not be returning home. The World Cup match is taking place on a busy sporting afternoon that also includes Wimbledon tennis, qualifying for Formula One's British Grand Prix at Silverstone and the first stage of cycling's Tour de France. Southgate and Colombia coach Jose Pekerman console Mateus Uribe after the penalty shootout defeat to England England manager Southgate has been winning fanswith his calm demeanour, sporting behaviour and a nice line in waistcoats. Retailer Marks & Spencer, which supplies the England team's official World Cup suit, reckons the Southgate effect has seen waistcoat sales rise 35%. Fans on social media have been sharing polite letters sent to them by Southgate - and the Twitter hashtag #GarethSouthgateWould was trending. #GarethSouthgateWould - Manager takes social media by storm Why some people won't be watching England v Sweden Southgate, 47, has said England must ""make the most"" of their World Cup opportunity, but warned against under-estimating an ""older, more experienced"" Sweden. ""You have to enjoy the good moments, but I am a long way from perfect, there are plenty of mistakes we have made while we have been here and we will make moving forward, so I think it is dangerous territory if we get carried away with things,"" said Southgate. That has not stopped England fans singing a tribute to the manager to the tune of Atomic Kitten's 2001 hit 'Whole Again': Looking back on when we first met, I cannot escape and I cannot forget, Southgate you're the one, you still turn me on, You can bring it home again! Southgate, who famously missed a penalty shootout against Germany in Euro '96, has welcomed the altered song: ""It's not as questionable as most of the lyrics that have been sung about me in the past,"" he quipped.

"This video can not be played Pickford saves, Dier scores - England win penalty shootout 2018 Fifa World Cup quarter-final: Sweden v England Venue:Samara Arena, SamaraDate:Saturday 7 July, 15:00 BST Coverage:Live on BBC One and online; full radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 live and text commentary and in-play clips online and on BBC Sport app England captain Harry Kane said a ""band of brothers"" spirit is driving Gareth Southgate's side towards World Cup glory as they prepare toface Swedenin the quarter-final on Saturday. Kane is the tournament's leading scorer with six goals and the 24-year-old will carry England's biggest threat in the searing Samara heat, as they attempt to reach a first World Cup semi-final since Italia 90. And while Kane is happy to share his responsibility, he believes England's progress to the last eight for the first time in 12 years is also down to the special bond among this group of players. ""We are just like family,"" said Kane, who is expected to line up in an unchanged starting XI on Saturday. ""We spend a lot of time together and we all get on with each other very well. It is about togetherness and trust. ""I look at them like my brothers and they look at me the same. We will do anything for each other."" England's dramaticvictory on penalties against Colombiain the last 16 - in which Kane scored from the spot in normal time and again in the shootout - ended a run of three defeats from three in World Cup shootouts for the national team. The match was also full of controversy, with England defender John Stones saying Colombia were probably the ""dirtiest team"" he has faced. ""When you go through a battle like that and come through it, that gives you so much energy, so much belief to go and do it again,"" said Kane. ""The feeling after is amazing. We're hungry for more. We want that feeling. If it goes to extra time and penalties, then we'll be ready for that."" England's World Cup through the ages Country set to come to a standstill Why the Golden Boot fits for England's Harry Kane England will face either Croatia or hosts Russia if they overcome the under-rated Swedes, who beat Italy in a play-off to reach Russia and finished above holders Germany in their group. There is, however, a quiet confidence about England. ""We have that togetherness and trust but we always want to prove it on the pitch and we have done that so far and that has just made us even stronger,"" added Kane. ""It was great to come through that game the other night and just to see the joy in everyone's faces. We have worked so hard to come through that and it makes us even more proud of each other."" ""There is definitely a hunger because of the other night. When you go through a battle like that, it gives you so much energy and belief to go and do it again. ""We're hungry for more. We love that feeling. If it goes to extra time and penalties, we'll be ready for that. We're ready to do whatever it takes."" Social media has been filled with clips of fans celebrating the victory against Colombia, as a new-found belief begins to take hold that England can go even further in Russia. And Kane says the scenes at home are having an impact on the team. ""It's massive,"" he said of the images from back home. ""After the games we all see the videos going around social media. I said after the Tunisia game that I was one of those fans not too long ago and getting drink thrown over me and jumping about, going wild. ""It's what we want. We set out to make the country proud and we feel like we've done that so far. ""It's about bringing the whole country together and to see them enjoying it as they are is fantastic for us."" Only once since 1974 - when Ronaldo scored eight in Korea and Japan in 2002 - would Kane's current tally of six goals not have been enough to win him the Golden Boot. He admitted: ""I didn't know that. It's been a great campaign so far. The job is to help the team as much as possible, with and without the ball, scoring goals or getting assists. ""Hopefully it can continue and I carry on scoring. That would be amazing, but the focus is on helping the team. ""Hopefully I carry on scoring and we go far. We're not really thinking about being world champions yet. We've got a long way to go. We're only just in the second half of the tournament. We've done great up until now, but we have another step to overcome."" Southgate told 5 live's World Cup Daily Podcast: ""I feel calm as I did the other night. I felt complete trust in the players. ""I'm surrounded by a really good support team which is great for bouncing ideas off and for advice. Organisationally, our set-up has been brilliant. You can't lead a group of this many people on your own so it's a team effort. ""And I try and disappear for a bit as well so I'm back running now and I have to ensure I get time to refresh and regain the energy you need to lead the group."" Southgate, who reported striker Jamie Vardy as England's only fitness concern, is seeking better things from his side, who have yet to keep a clean sheet at this World Cup. ""It just shows we still have room for improvement,"" he said. ""We've made progress. The style of our play has improved enormously over the last 12 months. ""We're controlling games with the ball, but we can create more chances and we can defend better. We've got to continually look to improve. We're an emerging and evolving side, a long way from perfect. ""This is another great test for us on a fantastic stage. We have to focus on those things. The way Sweden play, we have to be concentrating all the time. We've been disappointed not to keep clean sheets, and the value of those in a tournament is clear, especially towards the latter stages.""

Gareth Southgate (top left) went from being a ""thoughtful and able"" pupil... ... to England manager Mr Parry, who is now the assistant priest of Worth Parish, in West Sussex, said the young Southgate ""liked to analyse things he was dealing with before he spoke about them"".

""All those, I think, are distinctive gifts for someone in his position using it to very good effect."" The Reverend Gordon Parry said following Southgate's career had been ""hugely rewarding"" Mr Parry, who taught Southgate for two years, said he would be ""offering up a few words"" of prayer ahead of Saturday's important match.

"Patients, including children, were hosed down with water to remove chemicals on their skin A report by the chemical weapons watchdog suggests chlorine may have been used in April's suspected chemical attack on the Syrian town of Douma. The interim report,externalby the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said ""various chlorinated organic chemicals"" had been found (in samples taken from two locations), but there was no evidence of nerve agents. Medics say dozens of civilians were killed in the alleged attack by government forces on the rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region near Damascus. The Syrian government denies carrying out any chemical weapons attacks. Following the Douma incident, US, British and French warplanes launched strikes against government facilities they said were involved in chemical weapons development and storage. The OPCW was recently given new powers by member statesto name those responsible for using chemical weapons. Its investigation into what happened in Douma is continuing. Medics in Douma reported on 7 April that more than 500 patients had been brought to medical facilities with symptoms suggesting exposure to a chemical agent. Rescue workers also reported a strong smell of chlorine in the air following air strikes that targeted two locations in Douma. The OPCW sent a Fact-Finding Mission team to Douma about a week later, but inspectors did not visit any sites of interest until 21 April. Douma 'chemical attack': What we know Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space ""Along with explosive residues, various chlorinated organic chemicals were found in samples from two sites,"" the preliminary report said. ""Work by the team to establish the significance of these results is on-going. The FFM team will continue its work to draw final conclusions."" The report said industrial gas cylinders were present at the two sites where chlorinated organic chemicals were detected. Following the alleged attack, a UN investigation said evidence pointed to the use of chlorine but that some people had exhibited symptoms more consistent with exposure to a nerve agent. The OPCW report, however, said that ""no organophosphorous nerve agents or their degradation products were detected"" at the sites. The five-year siege of the Eastern Ghouta, an agricultural region outside the capital where at least 265,000 civilians lived, was the longest in modern history. It came to an end in April, after a two-month offensive by pro-government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, that decimated homes, businesses and hospitals and reportedly left more than 1,700 men, women and children dead. Correction 23 July 2018: An earlier version of this article inaccurately summarised the findings of the OPCW's report. It has since been amended to clarify that their report suggests that chlorine may have been used in April's suspected chemical attack in Douma. Correction 4 October 2018: The article's headline has been amended to correct a misleading impression about the conclusions of the OPCW report, following a complaint to the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit. Clarification 12 October 2018: Following a further investigation, the BBC's Executive Complaints Unitfound the original headline to the article was materially inaccurate.This was a separate finding to the investigation which to led to the correction posted on 4 October.

"Sixty-six people were killed in the crash The crash of EgyptAir flight MS804 in 2016 was probably caused by a fire in the cockpit, French investigators say. They said onboard recorders suggested that the blaze had spread rapidly through the plane. The findings contradict Egypt's earlier statements that explosives had been found on victims' remains, suggesting the aircraft had been bombed. Sixty-six passengers and crew died when the flight from Paris to Cairo came down over the eastern Mediterranean. Who were the victims of MS804? EgyptAir flight MS804: What we know France's civil aviation accident bureau, known as BEA, said in a press release on Friday that ""the most likely hypothesis is that a fire broke out in the cockpit while the aeroplane was flying at its cruise altitude and that the fire spread rapidly resulting in the loss of control of the aeroplane"". The agency said that the crew could be heard discussing a fire on the cockpit voice recorder and that systems on board had detected smoke inside the aircraft. Egyptian officials previously said that the crash - which came seven months after aRussian plane was brought down by a bombover the Sinai peninsula - was likely to have been a terrorist incident. The BEA has said it is awaiting Egypt's final report into the crash to understand the differences in their conclusions. Thirty Egyptians, 15 French nationals and one Briton were among the dead.

"Police have arrested a suspect in an attack on a teenage Trump fan at a burger bar in the US state of Texas. Kino Jimenez, 30, is alleged to be the assailant shown stealing a 16-year-old's ""Make America Great Again"" cap at a Whataburger in San Antonio. The suspect was filmed taunting victim, Hunter Richard, and hurling a fizzy drink in his face before walking off with the hat. The bar where Mr Jimenez works says he has been fired. US mother alleges racism at private pool Mr Jimenez was arrested near San Antonio on Thursday, a day after the alleged late-night encounter at the fast-food chain. He is facing a charge of theft. In the video shot by one of Hunter's friends, a man is seen uttering expletives while waving the red hat made famous by US President Donald Trump. Kino Jimenez, 30 In the clip, Hunter and his friends sit in stunned silence as the man leaves the restaurant with the hat, saying it will ""go great"" in his fireplace. Hunter said his attacker had snatched the hat from his head with so much force that some of his hair was ripped out. The boy says the attack was completely unprovoked. In an interview with NBC, the boy said he supports President Trump. ""And if you don't, let's have a conversation about it instead of ripping my hat off,"" Hunter said. In a statement, the Texas fast-food chain said that none of its employees had been involved. ""We were shocked to see this video and certainly don't condone this type of customer behaviour in our restaurants,"" the company said. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr, called the attack ""a disgrace"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"A US photo shows the U-boat under attack on 10 November 1943 Divers have found wreckage from a German World War Two U-boat near the coast of Galicia in north-west Spain. U-966 was heavily damaged by Allied bombers in November 1943, so the crew blew it up with timed charges and all but eight reached dry land. US Navy and RAF Liberator bombers targeted U-966 with depth charges for a whole day, as the German submarine zig-zagged and fired its anti-aircraft gun. One Allied plane was shot down - reportedly an RAF Catalina flying boat. An RAF Wellington bomber also took part in the submarine chase and dropped depth charges. The three divers who found the wreckage after years of searching The three divers' discovery in late June followed years of searching in a very rocky area where rough weather often makes diving impossible. The debris was photographed at a depth of 24-26m (79-85ft). One of the divers, naval historian Yago Abilleira, said they had found the wreckage near Estaca de Bares and it was spread over a wide area. They are not revealing the exact location, as it is a war grave. He told the local paper La Voz de Galicia (in Spanish),externalthat the crew had scuttled U-966, nicknamed ""Gut Holz"" (Good Wood), ""in desperation, as Allied planes were attacking them on all sides and they knew time was running out"". The U-boat's violent end scattered debris over a wide area of seabed Spanish media say the divers now want to find the downed Allied plane, believed to be near the U-boat wreck. A German naval history website, Ubootarchiv.de, says (in German),externalthat three local fishing boats rescued submariners who were clinging to rocks offshore. The crew totalled 52, eight of whom died. U-boat commander Eckehard Wolf flew back to Germany in November 1944 from Spain under a false name, the website reports.

Secret listeners who bugged the Nazis BBC History - World War Two Diver Eduardo Losada took this photo of debris from U-966 The U-boat was returning from an operation off the coast of North America when it was detected by the Allies. Bombers attacked it repeatedly on 10 November 1943, crippling it. U-boats had inflicted enormous damage on Allied shipping earlier in the war. They attacked supply convoys as well as naval vessels. The Gut Holz, 67m (220ft) long, was nearly brand new. It had been launched in January 1943, and had a career lasting just 10 months. Its emblem was a bowling pin and ball - ""good wood"" is a German bowling phrase. Spain's fascist dictator, Gen Francisco Franco, was not officially allied with Nazi Germany, but the supposedly neutral country was known to assist the Nazi war effort in various ways.

"This video can not be played A look back at England's previous six World Cup quarter-finals 2018 Fifa World Cup quarter-final: Sweden v England Venue:Samara Arena, SamaraDate:Saturday 7 July, 15:00 BST Coverage:Live on BBC One and online; full radio commentary on BBC Radio 5 live and text commentary and in-play clips online and on BBC Sport app England will step out in the steamy heat of Samara on Saturday to face Sweden in what is their biggest World Cup game since losing to West Germany on penalties in the semi-finals at Italia 90. Yes, they have reached World Cup quarter-finals since, losing to eventual winners Brazil in Shizuoka in Japan in 2002 and in a penalty shootout to Portugal in Germany four years later. But this just feels different. This feels like a pathway towards their first World Cup final since 1966 has opened up in front of England thanks to the failures of holders Germany and a kinder draw thanks to finishing second behind Belgium in Group G. England were underdogs against Brazil in Japan and giants like France awaited even if they had passed Portugal in Gelsenkirchen in 2006. Here, at what is turning into a classic World Cup, England must find a way past Sweden then beat the winners of the other last-eight game between Croatia and hosts Russia to reach the final on Sunday week. England will feel they can achieve that - they would have settled for this in a heartbeat before the World Cup started. And Sweden, Croatia and Russia will be feeling exactly the same. When England started the serious work in Russia at their secluded and peaceful Zelenogorsk training base almost four weeks ago, the wisdom stated that a place in the quarter-final would represent respectability, an outcome manager Gareth Southgate and the Football Association could present as tangible progress. England could still do that - but what an opportunity has presented itself for Southgate and this popular group of players, who have none of the egos, cliques and sideshows that have overtaken them at previous tournaments. Southgate and his squad will still return home with reputations intact, and some enhanced, no matter how events unfold in Samara. There will, however, be a burning disappointment if they do not take this World Cup campaign into its final week. Country set to come to a standstill We'll do anything for each other - Kane Sweden v England - team news and preview This video can not be played What can England expect from Sweden? Analysis by Shearer & Jenas As he conducted his final media briefing before Sweden, Southgate summed up England's World Cup campaign when quizzed on the lack of clean sheets in their four games. ""It just shows we still have room for improvement,"" said Southgate. ""We've made progress. The style of play has improved enormously over the last 12 months. We're controlling games with the ball but we can create more chances and we can defend better."" Two key issues. Two valid points. England have looked reasonably solid in defence but clean sheets count in this knockout stage and there is no doubt they must create more in open play. Captain Harry Kane leads the race for the World Cup's Golden Boot with six goals but three have been penalties, two as a result of corners and another an unwitting deflection from Ruben Loftus-Cheek's shot. Kane relishes the weight on his shoulders as captain but now is the time for Raheem Sterling to come to the party after 23 England games without a goal. Southgate himself praised Dele Alli's work without the ball against Colombia but accepted England need to work to benefit from his late runs into the area that mark him out as a special talent. Kieran Trippier has been an outstanding supply line but Kane now needs and deserves more from others. The upside for Southgate and England is if they have come this far carrying those two very curable flaws, how far can they go once the solution has been found? Lack of pressure means England can win World Cup says Eriksson Ibrahimovic sends Beckham Ikea Instagram challenge England have shown why we can win this World Cup - Shearer This video can not be played England may not get this chance again - Southgate Russia has offered another dramatic shift in climate for England after they landed in Samara, on the banks of the River Volga, from their headquarters at Repino, on the Gulf of Finland. Repino was hit by heavy rain in the days before departure and England arrived in Samara to scorching heat, with temperatures predicted to be around 30C at kick-off time on Saturday. There has even been a kilometre-long beach constructed in Samara to enhance the carnival atmosphere of Russia's hugely successful World Cup and England will hope the party does not end here. England have coped with similar changes in temperature against Tunisia in Volgograd and Panama in Nizhny Novgorod and, of course, it is the same for Sweden. Southgate, as he has been throughout, was measured and self-effacing as he completed media duties in the magnificent Samara Stadium but there is that inner steel and he senses this England team has an opportunity to write history. While Southgate outlined the improvements he wants on the pitch, captain Kane gave an insight into the mood off the pitch and the unity that has characterised England's squad. He talked of them being like brothers - Kane presumably the head of that particular branch of the family - and he will hope this happy band can have more stories to share when they return to Repino. Harry Kane addresses the media before England's quarter-final with Sweden England might have to dig in for another attritional battle against the country that almost always seems to make life difficult for them. They have met 24 times in total, England winning eight, drawing nine and losing seven. In World Cups and Euros they played four times - winning one, drawing two and losing one. England, apart from the rout against hapless Panama, have hardly been peppering the goal while Sweden, the epitome of defensive discipline, advanced by digging out a 1-0 win against Switzerland thanks to a deflected shot from Emil Forsberg, their main creator. There will be no shortage of tension no matter how this World Cup quarter-final plays out - that will be provided by the huge stakes on offer. England have their golden chance.

"David Davis' unhappiness has been not secret for some time After many months of rumours that he would pull the plug, David Davis has actually quit as Brexit Secretary. His unhappiness in government has been no secret for some time, but after the prime minister's Chequers agreement with cabinet ministers to pursue closer ties with the EU than he desired, he found his position untenable. After a visit to Downing Street on Sunday he concluded that he had no choice but to walk. Junior ministerial colleague Steve Baker has also quit alongside him from the Brexit department. David Davis' move, while not completely surprising, throws doubt on to how secure the government's Brexit strategy is. Some of Theresa May's colleagues had urged her to face down her Brexiteer ministers but Number 10 had hoped to keep them all on side, and a carefully designed strategy to move them to her position brokered an agreement in cabinet at the end of their day-long meeting at Chequers on Friday . Theresa May secured her cabinet's support at a meeting at Chequers on Friday But Mr Davis, who was meant to be responsible for Brexit policy, felt,  according to colleagues, that he was ""wondering if he really had a proper job"" after Number 10 chose to follow a very different path to the now former Brexit secretary's intention. Mr Davis has been frustrated for some time after the most senior official at the Department for Exiting the EU - Olly Robbins - was moved into Number 10 to work directly for Theresa May. To some former Remainers, Mr Davis' departure could even be considered a temporary relief. One of his fellow ministers remarked, ""it's just a personal outburst"", adding: ""He is not exactly the cleverest, he has always struggled to muscle into any of the complicated arguments."" But conditions in the Tory party are febrile. Theresa May had carefully constructed her cabinet with a balance of Brexiteers and former Remainers. With no majority, and unhappiness on the back benches, it adds instability at a time when the prime minister was pursuing calm. And when she was hoping to project an image to Brussels of authority and stability, it is a headache she could well do without. He could provide a rallying point from outside government for those forces in the Tory party who believe the Brexit plan the prime minister is pursuing is not the Brexit that a clear but narrow majority of the public chose. Michael Gove was tipped as a replacement for David Davis Westminster being Westminster, eyes will immediately turn to who will replace him. The most likely candidate it seems at this stage is Michael Gove who has pitched himself as the Brexiteer that ""remainers can do business with"". His public appearances defending the Brexit policy over the weekend make him certainly near the top of the list for one of the most important jobs in government.

"Brien O'Keeffe has been with the London Fire Brigade for 25 years Evacuating Grenfell Tower after fire had taken hold would have been a ""huge catastrophe"", an inquiry has heard. Watch manager Brien O'Keeffe said the advice for residents to stay in their homes helped firefighters find them. He toldthe public inquiryinto the blaze on 14 June 2017 that he ""wasn't in favour"" of evacuation as there would have been bodies throughout the tower. The ""stay-put"" strategy was in place until 02:47 BST - nearly two hours after the fire started. The only escape route from the tower - a single stairwell - was filled with smoke by 02:00 and it would have been ""unsafe and dangerous"" to use, Mr O'Keeffe said. A total of72 people died as a result of the blaze in west London. Firefighter wanted to drop stay-put advice 'Catastrophic' Grenfell failures outlined What happened at Grenfell Tower? Listen: The Grenfell Tower Inquiry with Eddie Mair The watch manager - who has been with the London Fire Brigade for 25 years - told the hearing at Holborn Bars that the fire had ""outstripped the event and outstripped our ability to rescue everybody"". Between 02:00 and 02:30 he asked his manager if the stay-put policy was still in place. Mr O'Keeffe said: ""I didn't have an opinion, other than if people started to evacuate it would become multiple casualties in the stairs and that we would have great difficulty in finding out where people were. ""But if people start evacuating - when the entire building is on fire or most of it is on fire and the only way down is impossible - that will have been a huge catastrophe."" He added: ""It would have really impeded our rescue operations and if my guys didn't know where people were, I couldn't say, 'go to this floor'. You just have - as you did afterwards - people deceased in the stairwell and various parts of the building."" Mr O'Keeffe told the inquiry he ""wasn't in favour"" of the advice being ditched, but he just ""needed to know what was going on"" to do his job. Residents were collapsing in the stairwell during rescues and had to be carried the rest of the way down, he said.

"This video can not be played What's it like in a Chiang Rai cave? Twelve boys and their football coach trapped in waterlogged caves in Thailand will not be rescued overnight as they cannot dive, an official says. An air line has been installed to the cave where the group has been trapped for nearly two weeks in a chamber in the Tham Luang cave complex. The group had ventured in while the cave was dry but rain then flooded it. Earlier, a former Thai navy diver died on his way out of the caves after delivering air tanks to those trapped. Speaking to reporters on Friday, the governor of the Chiang Rai region, where the cave is situated, said the boys had enough strength to walk but could not swim to safety. Narongsak Osotthanakorn said the health of most of the boys had ""improved to normal"", and that divers were continuing to teach diving and breathing techniques. When asked if a rescue attempt would be made overnight if it started to rain, he said: ""No, the boys can't dive at this time."" Locals long to see missing Thai cave boys What are the rescue options? Mr Narongsak said the boys were ""OK"" and the air they were breathing was good. On Thursday their parents sent letters in for the boys to read - but the governor said he was not sure if these had reached them yet. Rescuers have dug more than 100 holes, hoping to reach the cave by a direct route. There were 18 promising ones, the deepest at 400m, but Mr Narongsak said he was not sure if it would reach the boys, who are believed to be about 600m below the surface. The group was found in the cave by British rescue divers 10 days after they went missing. They were perched on a rock shelf in a small chamber about 4km (2.5 miles) from the cave mouth. Teams of Thai and international divers have since supplied them with food, oxygen and medical attention, but there are mounting concerns about the oxygen level in the chamber, which officials said had fallen to 15%. The usual level is 21%. The Brits behind the Thai cave boys search Elon Musk offers to help Mr Narongsak said discussions regarding the lowest risk rescue attempts were ongoing, but acknowledged that time was against them. ""We will try to set the best plan, when the risk is minimal, we will try to bring them out,"" he said. He added that the rains had stopped in the past few days, giving the rescue operation some space to make several areas in the cave dry enough for rescue workers to access. He also said that when teams had stopped pumping water for 12 minutes during the day on Friday, the water level in the cave rose by 10cm (4in). On the surface, a huge military and civilian rescue operation is racing against the clock to bring the boys to safety. Heavy monsoon rains are expected on Sunday, threatening further flooding. Officials had initially considered leaving the boys in the chamber to wait out the rainy season - which could have seen them trapped there for up to four months. Saman Gunan - a highly trained diver - lost consciousness on his way out of the cave complex on Thursday. His death underscored the danger of moving from the chamber to mouth of the cave, and raised serious doubts about the safety of bringing the boys out through the cramped, flooded passageways. This video can not be played Saman Gunan lost consciousness on his way out of the flooded cave The diver died in one of the passageways, said Passakorn Boonyaluck, deputy governor of the Chiang Rai region. ""His job was to deliver oxygen. He did not have enough on his way back,"" Mr Passakorn said. He said that Saman's dive partner had tried to revive him but was unable to. Saman, who was reportedly 38, had left the navy but returned to aid in the rescue operation. Said to be an avid runner and cyclist, he was part of the massive rescue operation launched after the group became stranded in the Tham Luang cave.

"This video can not be played Theresa May speaks after 12-hour cabinet meeting The cabinet has reached a ""collective"" agreement on the basis of the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit, Theresa May has said. Ministers have signed up to a plan to create a free trade area for industrial and agricultural goods with the bloc, based on a ""common rule book"". They also supported what could amount to a ""combined customs territory"". The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the plan, agreed after a 12-hour meeting, would ""anger many Tory Brexiteers"". Our political editor said the prime minister had ""picked a side"" by opting for a closer relationship with the EU than many colleagues desired - and she now had to sell it to her party and the other European leaders. No 10, she added, hoped the new commitments would unlock the next phase of talks with the rest of the EU but it was not yet clear how many, or what kind, of objections were raised. Laura Kuenssberg analysis: The deal is done Brexit: All you need to know Brexit jargon explained Downing Street said the proposals marked a ""substantial evolution"" in the UK's position and would resolve outstanding concerns about the future of the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. ""This is a proposal that I believe will be good for the UK and good for the EU, and I look forward to it being received positively,"" Mrs May told the BBC. One pro-Brexit cabinet minister told the BBC there was ""no point"" pushing for a vote as ""we were well and truly outnumbered by 20 to seven"". Nicholas Watt, political editor of BBC Newsnight, said the minister also warned that ""it will be a problem"" if there is any attempt to ""water down plans even further"" should the EU reject the UK's proposals. The marathon cabinet meeting at Chequers lasted nearly 12 hours The UK said it now wanted to accelerate the negotiations in an effort to secure an agreement by October, but also warned it will step up preparations for leaving on 29 March 2019 without a deal. The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier, who earlier suggested the EU would be willing to shift its position if the UK relaxed some of its ""red lines"", tweeted his reaction: Allow Twitter content?

Barnier: 'Realistic' Brexit plan needed As it happened: Reaction to cabinet deal The prime minister had gathered her 26 cabinet ministers together at her country residence to try and resolve differences over the shape of the UK's relations with the EU and break the current deadlock with the EU. The main details of theChequers statement,externalare as follows: The UK would accept continuing ""harmonisation"" with EU rules on the trade in goods, covering only those necessary to ensure frictionless trade Parliament would have the final say over how these rules are incorporated into UK law, retaining the right to refuse to do so There will be different arrangements for trade in services, including financial products, with greater ""regulatory flexibility"" and ""strong reciprocal arrangements"" Freedom of movement as it stands will come to an end but a ""mobility framework"" will ensure UK and EU citizens can continue to travel to each other's territories and apply for study and work A new customs arrangement will be phased in, with the goal of ""a combined customs territory"" The UK will be able to control its own tariffs and develop an independent trade policy The jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice will end but the UK will pay regard to its decisions in areas where common rules were in force. Mrs May said this was an ""important step"" in the process of negotiating the UK's smooth exit from the EU. ""Of course we still have work to do with the EU in ensuring that we get to that end point in October. But this is good we have come today, following our detailed discussions, to a positive future for the UK,"" she said. She said the proposals, to be formally published in a white paper next week, would give the UK the freedom to strike trade deals with other countries while maintaining regulatory, environmental and consumer standards. This video can not be played Brexit: How will remainers and leavers react to cabinet customs agreement? In a letter sent to all Conservative MPs, she said she had allowed colleagues to express their views while policy was developed but ""agreement on this proposal marks the point where this is no longer the case and collective responsibility is fully restored"". There is no mention in the document of eitherthe single market or the customs union, which the UK has committed to leave after the end of a transition period in December 2020. Under plans for a free trade zone, the UK would be committed legally to following EU law for a large part of the economy, including manufacturing and farming. While Parliament would retain the right to diverge from EU regulations in these areas, the document makes clear that ""choosing not to pass the relevant legislation would have consequences for market access, security co-operation or the frictionless border"". Michael Gove, Penny Mordaunt and David Davis among those listening to Theresa May The document also commits the government to step up preparedness for a no-deal scenario, as one of a range of possible outcomes, ""given the short period remaining before the necessary conclusion of negotiations"". The CBI employers group welcomed the proposals for a free trade area in goods which it said would provide a ""confidence boost"" to business. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said there was ""a danger that this is a lowest common denominator plan"" designed to hold the cabinet together, rather than ""secure the strong negotiating position that we need with the EU"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Once upon a time we were told 'Brexit means Brexit', now we are told it means maintaining a common rulebook for all goods, a joint institutional framework for interpreting the agreement and the UK and EU forming this combined customs territory. ""That looks very much like regulatory alignment, the ECJ (European Court of Justice) and half a customs union to me."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, who backed Brexit in the referendum, said the deal would end free movement of people and would end the remit of the European Court of Justice in the UK - saying that UK judges always pay regards to other countries' courts, such as Canada or Hong Kong. He added, on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, that the cabinet had agreed to step up preparations for the UK leaving the EU without a Brexit deal. Fellow cabinet Brexiteer Andrea Leadsom also tweeted her backing for the deal: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Leading Tory backbench Brexiteer, Jacob Rees-Mogg told the same programme that it was difficult to say whether or not the agreement was meeting the party's manifesto commitments on Brexit because he had seen only a three page summary rather than the full 100-plus page document. He said it was ""possible"", when the detail emerged, that the proposal could be ""worse than no deal"". And Sir Vince Cable, leader of the Liberal Democrats, said it could be the case that ""Brexiteers have signed up to it knowing perfectly well that it is not going to pass the European Union and they'll then be able to blame Europe for the fact that it won't work"". Pro-Brexit campaign group Leave Means Leave said it would represent a ""bad deal for the UK"" which would ""only slide further as the EU takes more and more"". Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the plan amounted to a ""sell-out to global corporates"" and would do nothing for the 90% of British firms which do not export to Europe. Veteran Eurosceptic Tory MP Sir Bill Cash said he was ""deeply disappointed to say the least"" about the plans, which he suggested could contradict the terms of the EU Withdrawal Act passed by MPs last month.

"The boys have been trapped for nearly two weeks On Friday morning, the army of volunteers at the mouth of the Tham Luang cave in Thailand had the worst news so far - a former Thai navy diver, Saman Gunan, had died. He had been delivering air tanks to the 12 young boys and their football coach trapped underground. The joy and elation that came after the group were found alive earlier this week has faded away. Now the mood at the rescue site is sombre, with diving volunteers saying they are saddened by Gunan's death. For the local community, and those who watched the boys grow up, the plight of the group has been deeply upsetting. ""You never imagine someone you know could get trapped in a cave,"" says shopkeeper Patcharee Khumngen. One of the boys used to buy snacks from Patcharee Khumngen One of the boys, known as most Thai children are by a nickname - his was Note - rode a bike to her shop to buy snacks when he was eight years old. ""He's a good boy, very friendly, and always liked to joke around,"" she told the BBC. Hope grows for daring rescue What are the rescue options? How will the boys cope underground? ""Now that he's in his teens he looks quite handsome,"" she added, with the fondness of an auntie. ""I've known his parents since he was a little boy."" The story has hit the community particularly hard because the cave is just 4km (2.5 miles) away from the local neighbourhood, Maesai, where some of the boys went to school. It's a spot popular with day trips and visited by local children. When the news first emerged two weeks ago that the local boys - all members of the same football team, the Wild Boars - and their coach were lost in the vast cave, the village rallied together, donating food and money. Patcharee prepared sticky rice and deep fried pork - two popular local dishes. In Thai culture, this is a common way of showing care for someone. Nearby, at Ban Pa Muat School, teacher Bunjob Chai-arm was also worried. Teacher Bunjob Chai-arm worries about the youngest of the boys He taught one of the boys, nicknamed Mark, back when he was in primary school. He was a ""cheerful, energetic and friendly"" student, and they had stayed in touch as he began secondary school, he told the BBC. Mark loves playing volleyball and, along with another one of the boys, is a member of a local team that came second in a tournament featuring teams from across northern Thailand. Bunjob said he was particularly worried about Mark, ""one of the youngest in the cave"". At school, once they learned that their classmate was missing, students asked Bunjob to turn on the TV so they could follow the news - as they are not allowed to use phones in class. ""For a whole week, some students were in class while others were following the news on TV,"" he says. Meanwhile, the school came together, donating money to help the parents of the missing boys with rent and living expenses, as many had stopped work to wait at the cave and follow news of their sons. The plight of the boys appears to have united the community. Koywilai Promwijit said she couldn't sleep after hearing the boys had been found alive ""Every house here has been talking about the news of the boys,"" says Koywilai Promwijit, who works in a local salon. ""The village has donated hundreds of packages of food."" She and her sister helped prepare fried pork, chicken, sticky rice and chilli paste, eating less during some of their own meals so they could help. Koywilai's face lights up when she recalls the moment she learned the boys were still alive late last Sunday. ""I was about to go to bed when I heard the news - and then I couldn't sleep."" Video shows Thai cave boys in good health The Brits behind the Thai cave boys search The site of the rescue operations in Tham Luang Forest Park, near the entrance of the cave, is buzzing with activity. The first thing you see as you get near is a steady stream of water. The efforts to save the boys have been described as a ""race against the water"" - and engineers have been working around the clock, pumping out millions of gallons of water from the cave. Pumping water out of the cave is a race against time Hundreds of volunteers and journalists have been drawn to the small rural district in Chiang Rai province. Given the huge numbers of people crowded into a small country park area, it is surprising how well organised and orderly the public areas are. The site is divided into several zones - restricted areas are where the Thai Navy Seals, other military personnel and civilian rescuers are based. The public areas include first-aid tents with medics and mental health first aiders, registration points for volunteers, a media zone, and several food stalls where workers from the Thai royal kitchen have been preparing food for volunteers. The relatives of the boys are also in the public areas - but their tents are guarded to ensure their privacy. There is a friendly mood among the volunteers - and a keen sense from everyone that they would like to help however they can. At one point, some volunteers offered massages to those at the site. Others distributed bottles of water and ice lollies to journalists. Volunteers are preparing food for everyone There is even a system to keep the toilets clean. Everyone is required to step into a basin of water, to wash the mud off their boots, before entering. Varee Srichai, a farmer in Chiang Mai, was one of the volunteers washing down the area. Varee Srichai wants to stay and help however she can She takes pride in her role in the rescue operations, and told me: ""I plan to stay here until the boys are rescued."" There are countless stories like hers. Sam Chareanphol, a village police assistant from Maesai district, headed to the cave on the second day after the boys went missing, and has been shuttling volunteers, journalists and rescuers up and down the hill on his motorcycle. Sam Chareanphol has been driving volunteers to and from the cave Saran Churat, a local public servant, said he decided to volunteer because ""I consider the boys in the caves as my brothers"". He added: ""As you can see, everyone is ready to gather here and give a hand."" Rafael (left) and his son help as divers and translator Rafael Aloush and his son Shlomi travelled up from Udon Thani province. Rafael, who is Israeli, has been cave diving before and went into Tham Luang cave 25 years ago, although he did not travel as deep as the boys. ""I've seen the mothers of the kids on TV and it just breaks my heart. I have to do something about it,"" he said. Saran Churat says he considers the trapped boys his brothers He is volunteering as a diver and translator, while Shlomi, who is studying business management in Bangkok, also hopes to help with translating. The early days of the rescue operations were particularly chaotic, as teams struggled to find the right equipment and divers with cave-diving experience. Local Max Yuttapong Kumsamut drove to the site overnight when he saw the difficulties rescuers were facing. Max was able to help with his mining experience He'd seen photos of the operation, and could tell that the water pump was too small for the rescue operations. ""I have experience in mining and underground water... so I wanted to help however I could,"" he told the BBC. ""At the time when the incident happened, no-one really had any idea what to do. ""Everything had happened so quickly [and] this had never happened in Thailand before. Officials did whatever they could, they brought together equipment, even though it's not the right equipment - small water pumps, long pipes, short pipes, agricultural piping, knives, shovels - with limited time and planning."" Because of his experience in installing pumps, Max helped examine the set-up inside the cave, radioing a team outside with what parts and fittings needed to be ordered. He has stayed on at the site to help with translation work and transporting goods. Further up the hill leading to the cave, there are Navy Seals and other rescue divers - and a regular stream of soldiers carrying supplies to and from the cave. A rescue base has been set up far inside. The boys are safe for now, perched on a tall ledge in the cave, surrounded by water. Video footage from earlier this week shows the boys looking thin and tired, but in good spirits. Many of them were wearing football shirts. But rescuers still need to find a way to bring them out. The route is a long and windy path with narrow openings that is fully submerged in water in places. It's an extremely difficult operation. The cave is dark, and the boys are several kilometres deep inside. They don't know how to swim - and some parts of the cave are too narrow to wear scuba tanks. It's a perilous journey, as diver Gunan's death illustrates only too well. He fell unconscious as he was making the difficult five-hour journeyback after taking air tanks into the cave. He was reportedly 38, and fit and well. He was an avid runner and cyclist - and was once a member of Thailand's national triathlon team. He was popular within the trail-running community in Thailand. PO Saman Gunan lost consciousness during the return part of the dive Thai Seal commander Rear Adm Arpakorn Yookongkaew has vowed that ""we will not let the sacrifice of our friend go to waste"". Officials say their priority is now to get a pipe carrying oxygen into the boys' cave, as the air quality is deteriorating. Rescuers have also been trying to set up cables leading to the cave - including a communications line so they can speak to their parents, and a line providing more air. Efforts to get cables into the cave have so far failed But the cave is long, with too many twists and turns - and they have been unable to connect the cables to them so far. While rescue efforts have been helped by mostly dry weather for the past few days, water levels could rise again once the monsoon rains start. This video can not be played Families have been shown new footage of the 12 boys and their coach stuck in a cave in Thailand. Unless the water levels drop, or the boys learn to dive - a difficult task even for adults in these circumstances - they could be there for months. If and when the boys and their coach are safely rescued, they'll face an immense amount of media attention. The local area has also become famous - and Thai tourism officials have said they plan to promote the cave as a tourist attraction. For locals, the incident is primarily an important reminder about safety. After this, ""everyone will know you are not supposed to go in the cave during the rainy season"", says Koywilai. Meanwhile, Bunjob hopes that Mark will soon be able to share his experiences with the classmates waiting desperately for news. ""I wish they could come out soon,"" he says. 'I am dying to see him.

"David Davis' unhappiness has been not secret for some time After many months of rumours that he would pull the plug, David Davis has actually quit as Brexit Secretary. His unhappiness in government has been no secret for some time, but after the prime minister's Chequers agreement with cabinet ministers to pursue closer ties with the EU than he desired, he found his position untenable. After a visit to Downing Street on Sunday he concluded that he had no choice but to walk. Junior ministerial colleague Steve Baker has also quit alongside him from the Brexit department. David Davis' move, while not completely surprising, throws doubt on to how secure the government's Brexit strategy is. Some of Theresa May's colleagues had urged her to face down her Brexiteer ministers but Number 10 had hoped to keep them all on side, and a carefully designed strategy to move them to her position brokered an agreement in cabinet at the end of their day-long meeting at Chequers on Friday . Theresa May secured her cabinet's support at a meeting at Chequers on Friday But Mr Davis, who was meant to be responsible for Brexit policy, felt,  according to colleagues, that he was ""wondering if he really had a proper job"" after Number 10 chose to follow a very different path to the now former Brexit secretary's intention. Mr Davis has been frustrated for some time after the most senior official at the Department for Exiting the EU - Olly Robbins - was moved into Number 10 to work directly for Theresa May. To some former Remainers, Mr Davis' departure could even be considered a temporary relief. One of his fellow ministers remarked, ""it's just a personal outburst"", adding: ""He is not exactly the cleverest, he has always struggled to muscle into any of the complicated arguments."" But conditions in the Tory party are febrile. Theresa May had carefully constructed her cabinet with a balance of Brexiteers and former Remainers. With no majority, and unhappiness on the back benches, it adds instability at a time when the prime minister was pursuing calm. And when she was hoping to project an image to Brussels of authority and stability, it is a headache she could well do without. He could provide a rallying point from outside government for those forces in the Tory party who believe the Brexit plan the prime minister is pursuing is not the Brexit that a clear but narrow majority of the public chose. Michael Gove was tipped as a replacement for David Davis Westminster being Westminster, eyes will immediately turn to who will replace him. The most likely candidate it seems at this stage is Michael Gove who has pitched himself as the Brexiteer that ""remainers can do business with"". His public appearances defending the Brexit policy over the weekend make him certainly near the top of the list for one of the most important jobs in government.

"Melania Trump is joining her husband on the visit Donald Trump will meet the Queen at Windsor and hold talks with the prime minister at Chequers on his four-day visit to the UK next week. The itinerary for Thursday and Friday confirms the US president will stay at the US Ambassador's House in Regent's Park overnight. But he will spend much of his time outside London at formal events. Protests in the capital will go ahead as planned, organisers have said, with others set to demonstrate in Scotland. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said it would be ""the most controversial visit ever made by an American president to Britain"". Despite some pomp and ceremony, it will be ""far from the original state visit promised to President Trump"" and remains what is deemed a working trip, Robbins added. Treasury to cover Trump visit police bill One million sign Stop Trump petition President Trump's Scotland visit confirmed Robbins said it was also ""really noticeable that he will barely spend any time in London"" - perhaps to avoid the protests. But US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, said there was no deliberate plan to keep Mr Trump out of the capital or away from protests, and he was ""focused on his objectives"". He added that it was a ""short trip, packed with things he has to do"", but that President Trump ""will be spending a lot of time in central London"". Groups organising protests on Friday have vowed to ""be heard"" whether he is in the capital or not. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

President Trump will fly in to the UK on Thursday afternoon with First Lady Melania Trump, following a Nato summit in Brussels. The couple will attend a black-tie dinner on Thursday hosted by Theresa May at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire - the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill. The president will be greeted with a military ceremony in the Great Court, with the bands of the Scots, Irish and Welsh Guards playing the Liberty Fanfare, Amazing Grace and the National Emblem. A black-tie dinner will be held at Blenheim Palace Invited guests, including a number of business leaders, will eat dinner to the sounds of the Countess of Wessex's Orchestra, which will play a ""series of classic British and American hits"", according to Mrs May's deputy spokeswoman. Mr Trump,whose mother was Scottish, will then be piped out at the end by the Royal Regiment of Scotland. After spending the night at Winfield House in London, hosted by his ambassador Mr Johnson, the president will join the prime minister to watch a UK military exercise, before the pair travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for bilateral talks. The president and first lady will then travel to Windsor to meet the Queen on Friday afternoon. On the final leg of the tour, the couple will fly to Scotland, where they plan to spend the weekend. BBC diplomatic correspondent Robbins said while the government realises it is a controversial trip, President Trump is ""fully entitled"" to be welcomed into the UK in this way. The government also stressed that previous presidents have met prime ministers at Chequers rather than at No 10, including Richard Nixon and both the Bushes. US ambassador Mr Johnson said the ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US was ""as strong as ever"", and that Mr Trump knows the UK ""better than any other modern president"". Mrs May announced President Trump would be coming for a state visit to the UKin January 2017 after she became the first foreign leader to meet with him in Washington following his inauguration. But after a lot of backlash from MPs and more than one million people signing a petition against the trip, a date has still not been set for the state visit.

"This video can not be played Chequers and Brexit - what's going on at the country retreat? Cabinet ministers are meeting at Chequers in a bid to thrash out an agreement on the shape of the UK's future relationship with the EU. Theresa May has said they have ""a duty"" to reach agreement on Friday, amid splits over how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after Brexit. She is expected to propose keeping the UK aligned with the EU on trading rules for goods but not services. An ex-minister warned that would mean ""something less than the full Brexit"". If ministers reach an agreement, the EU can then choose to accept or reject their proposals. Speaking on Friday, the EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""ready to adapt our offer should the UK's red lines change"" but insisted there could be no ""unravelling"" of the single market. Barnier: 'Realistic' Brexit plan needed No 10 bid to see off post-Chequers splits Will the UK leave the European Court's jurisdiction in 2019? Airbus: Ministers have 'no clue' on Brexit Ministers are expected to be at Chequers, a 16th Century house in Buckinghamshire which is the PM's country residence, until about 22.00 GMT. They had to hand in their phones and any smartwatches on arrival. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the proposal would include a common rulebook on some sectors - like industrial goods and agricultural goods - for ""practical"" supply chain reasons. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I'm pretty confident we will end up with a concrete position which everybody is able to sign up to."" Cabinet ministers are expected to be in talks at Chequers all day But Brexiteer ministers are understood to be unhappy. Seven cabinet ministers met at the Foreign Office on Thursday evening to discuss the proposal. There have also been suggestions that the prime minister's proposal would make a US trade deal more difficult. No 10 says it is ""categorically untrue that we will not be able to strike a trade deal with the US"". David Jones, a former minister at the Department for Exiting the EU, said Mrs May's proposal looked set to breach her ""red lines"" on leaving the customs union, single market and jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Between meetings, the PM and other ministers took a breath of fresh air BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg If this was easy, Theresa May would not need the cloistered environment of Chequers to get her cabinet to agree. She would not need the tranquil quiet of the Buckinghamshire countryside to broker peace. She is vulnerable because her plan is hardly Brexit to some of those who campaigned to leave. Vulnerable in her party because her authority is in short supply and there is intense disagreement. Vulnerable then in Parliament because without a majority, a small faction can wreak havoc on either side. Read more fromLaura on her blog Kamal Ahmed: Treasury plays 'softest' Brexit card Ahead of the meeting, Mrs May said the cabinet had ""a great opportunity - and a duty. To set an ambitious course to enhance our prosperity and security outside the European Union - and to build a country that genuinely works for everyone"". Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said a workable agreement that could be taken to the EU was needed and ""simply a truce in the cabinet was not good enough for Britain"". Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said time was running out for the UK and the worst outcome would be ministers emerging ""arm in arm, saying they've agreed, because that means there's another helping of fudge being served up and what is being put forward is likely to be rejected by Europe"". Boris Johnson is said to have met former Prime Minister David Cameron on Thursday Meanwhile sources close to David Cameron confirmed the former PM met Boris Johnson on Thursday and discussed Brexit. But they said there was ""no grand view"" on the negotiations and disputed reports Mr Cameron had agreed that Theresa May's plan was the ""worst of all worlds"". The UK has been told to ""lay its cards on the table"" There have been differing views within the cabinet about how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after Brexit, and what compromises should be made to achieve ""as frictionless as possible"" trade. The aim is to agree a UK proposal on how future relations should work on Friday, the details of which would then be published in a White Paper net week. That would then be the subject of negotiations with the EU - which might have different ideas. Reality Check: Why services matter in any deal What kind of Brexit do voters want? Brexit: All you need to know Under standard cabinet protocol, ministers had to hand in their phones before the meeting started Ministers have yet to agree what they want to replace the UK's membership of the EU's customs union, which allows for tariff-free trading between members. One of the key issues is the need to avoid new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when the UK is outside the customs union. The EU and UK say there can be no return to a hard border. But Eurosceptic MPs say tying the UK to the EU after it leaves will prevent it from striking its own trade deals with other countries. Meanwhile 46 other Conservative MPs have urged Mrs May to listen to businesses and target a deal which enables ""frictionless trade to continue"". Please upgrade your browser The ""facilitated customs arrangement"" is understood to be a proposal for a post-Brexit customs agreement which would allow the UK the freedom to set its own tariffs on goods arriving into the country. Technology would be used to determine where the goods will ultimately end up - and therefore whether UK or EU tariffs should be paid. It would keep the UK aligned to EU regulations in some sectors- such as industrial and agricultural goods - but Parliament would be able to decide where to deviate. The 120-page plan is also understood to propose an end to the free movement of people but to say the UK would have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in some areas. Details of how the plan would work in practice have yet to be published. But Downing Street says it is confident the arrangement would be partly in place by the end of the proposed transition period in December 2020 - with the system being fully operational by the next general election, due in 2022. It is not clear whether the EU will agree to it. The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on 29 March 2019. But to allow time for parliaments in the UK and the EU to approve whatever deal is agreed, the aim is for the framework for future relations to be agreed this autumn. This video can not be played What is the EU customs union? But the UK government has not, as yet, settled on what its post-Brexit relationship with the EU should look like. EU leaders last week told Mrs May it was time to ""lay the cards on the table"" if a Brexit deal was to be done on time. Businesses, including Jaguar Land Rover, Airbus and BMW, have also been stepping up the pressure on the government to provide more detail.

"The recall includes bags of frozen sweetcorn and frozen mixed vegetables Supermarkets have recalled bags of frozen vegetables over fears they could contain a deadly bacteria. The 43 sweetcorn-based products have been withdrawn by major supermarket supplier Greenyard Frozen UK. The Food Standards Agency said the veg may contain listeria monocytogenes which can cause listeriosis, a rare illness responsible for the death of two people in the UK last year. Own-brand products for Tesco, Aldi and Sainsbury's are among those affected. A list of the 43 products recalled from UK supermarkets, which also include some from Lidl, Iceland and Waitrose,has been posted on the Food Standards Agency (FSA) website.,external Greenyard Frozen UK, based in King's Lynn, Norfolk, has been approached for comment. The FSA said the recall was a ""precautionary measure"". It advised anyone who has bought the products to not eat them and to ""return the product to the store from where it was bought for a full refund"". According to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) 11 people in the UK have been affected by listeriosis since 2015, including two people who died last year. Listeria monocytogenes bacteria The listeria bacteria can develop into the rare but serious listeriosis illness It has symptoms that are similar to flu, including high temperature, muscle ache, sickness and diarrhoea It can be more serious for people with weakened immune systems and also the elderly, pregnant women and infants Earlier this week, the FSA said frozen sweetcorn and other frozen vegetables were the likely source of the outbreak in five countries, including the UK. It advised consumers that most frozen vegetables need to be cooked before eating, in line with manufacturers' instructions. The EFSA said listeria has been affecting Austria, Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the UK since 2015. To date, 47 cases and nine deaths have been reported. The same strain of listeria was detected in frozen vegetables produced by a Hungarian company in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the EFSA said. It added: ""This suggests that the strains have persisted in the processing plant despite the cleaning and disinfection procedures that were carried out.""

Five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams became the eighth of the top 10 seeds to be knocked out after a third-round defeat by Kiki Bertens. Ninth seed Williams, 38, was beaten 6-2 6-7 (5-7) 8-6 by the 26-year-old Dutchwoman on Court One. Williams' fellow American Madison Keys lost nine consecutive games in her defeat to qualifierEvgeniya Rodina. The 10th seed lost 7-5 5-7 6-4 in two hours 10 minutes against the Russian, who is ranked 120th in the world. However, younger sisterSerenawent on to reach the last 16. Why are so many seeds out of Wimbledon? Monfils overcomes injury to beat Querrey Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Venus Williams made a sluggish start to the contest and her body language in the first set belied her frustration. At 5-1 Williams, who won Wimbledon in 2000, 2001, 2005, 2007 and 2008, saved a set point on her serve to avoid being broken for a third time. However, 20th seed Bertens remained unflustered and clinically closed out the set with an ace. World number nine Williams eventually found some rhythm in the second set as the pair twice traded breaks - Beterns missing a chance to serve out for the match at 5-4 up. In the tie-break that followed, Williams won two mini breaks to have a 6-2 advantage only to fluff a chance to close out the set before she eventually levelled the match. The pair exchanged early breaks in the third set before Bertens squandered two break points in the eighth game as Williams held. Williams saved two match break points on deuce at 7-6 down, but the pressure told and she struck a return low into the net to hand Bertens the victory in two hours and 40 minutes. ""It means a lot, I cannot really believe it. It was a tough match, a big fight but I am so happy I won this one,"" Bertens said. ""I will have a little celebration, rest a little, but I can celebrate a little because I am in the second week of Wimbledon."" This video can not be played Wimbledon 2018: Madison Keys out in shock defeat - highlights Keys, 23, had seemingly been cruising to the first set at 5-2 up only for the momentum to dramatically swing back to unheralded Russian Rodina. The world number 11 made numerous unforced errors which allowed 29-year-old Rodina to come back into the match and take the first set. Keys continued to struggle early in the second set as her losing streak of games continued and at 4-0 down the match appeared Rodina's for the taking. However, the American suddenly rediscovered her mojo and produced a superb fightback to win the second set. Rodina received lengthy treatment from the physio early in the third set and did not move around the court as freely. Both players regularly exchanged breaks in a scrappy third set, before Rodina kept her nerve at 5-4 up to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time in her career. Seventh seedKarolina Pliskovawas given a scare by Mihaela Buzarnescu of Romania after she lost the first set. However, the Czech regained her composure to triumph 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 against the 29th seed. Ekaterina Makarova, who knocked out second seed Caroline Wozniacki in the third round, also progressed. The Russian beat Lucie Safarova of the Czech Republic 4-6 6-4 6-1 to seal her place in the last 16.

"Some of the biggest names in English football have streets named after them, Brian Clough and Alan Shearer to name but two. But what of those roads that coincidently share their name with an England star? BBC News has taken a tour of the country to see if World Cup fever is unusually torrid in, say, Kane Close or Pickford Way. Megan Wheeler says she would like to see the name adopted officially and permanently The England boss can seemingly do no wrong at the moment, especially if you look at how#GarethSouthgateWould has captivated Twitter. Maybe that's why a mystery England fan decided to honour the waistcoat-wearing wonder by adding a ""Gareth"" to Southgate Street in Gloucester. Passer-byMegan Wheelersaid she would like to see the name adopted officially and permanently, especially if England continued to do well at the World Cup. ""You do see street names associated with famous people,"" she said. ""I'd like to see it stay. Why not? It's fun."" However, she admitted she was not the biggest football fan in the world. ""I actually slept through the game against Colombia, but I'll possibly be watching on Saturday. We have got quite far. ""This is the [quarter-final], isn't it? You can't ignore that."" (Left to right) Linda Parkinson, Anthony Kerr and Cheryl Shearer The traffic rattles busily along this street, one of the football-mad city's main arteries. A couple of England flags hang from upstairs windows, flapping in the breeze, and speaking to some of the residents there are hopes the team can bring the trophy home. Sharing a surname with a Geordie hero of England's recent past, it's perhaps to be expectedCheryl Sheareris more familiar with the exploits of former skipper Alan than current defender Kyle Walker. ""There are a lot of flags on one of the next streets, so people in the area are backing them,"" she says. ""I think there might be more local support if players from Newcastle were involved,"" her friendLinda Parkinsonpoints out. ""But you hope they can win it."" Anthony Kerragrees: ""It's the furthest they've gone in a long time. I hope they can keep it going. ""It was like a ghost town the other night. I think everyone must've been watching the match."" The mood on this street, which is only a few miles from Ramsbottom where Kieran Trippier grew up, is decidedly upbeat, with 23-year-old school sports coachSam Smedleybelieving that England can go all the way, ""It is great to be working in a street with the same name as an England player,"" he said. ""I would love to see him bring the cup to our school, as he is from Greater Manchester. ""The kids would be really excited; they are loving the World Cup. ""I think we have a good chance of winning."" Not only is football crazyAzad Miahfollowing the World Cup with huge interest, he's also a fan of Manchester United, the club Ashley Young has played for since 2011. The 25-year-old, who works for a bank, has lived on Young Street for five years. ""I play left back and that's where he's ended up playing, so that's my relation to Ashley Young,"" he said. ""If we were to win the World Cup and he came to this this street, that would be epic."" And his prediction for the outcome of the tournament? ""It's coming home!"" There doesn't seem to be much excitement about the World Cup in this corner of Surrey, according toPaul Banks. The 52-year-old accounts clerk said: ""There's no street parties or anything really - it's pretty quiet around here, actually."" He admitted that Guildford isn't exactly a football town, but believes the enthusiasm levels might be boosted if England make the semi-finals. ""I think it all depends on Saturday's match, really. I think it might progress but I haven't seen it on these roads or even locally. ""I think people in this area are a bit pessimistic at the moment."" If another Jordan Henderson is living on this street, though, he wouldn't be able to play football here because no ball games are allowed on Henderson Avenue. ""That's a real shame, because there seems to be a lot of restrictions for the children around here for allowing them to play on the streets,"" said Mr Banks, adding that he'd like to think that England's success at the World Cup might encourage a few youngsters to get out and kick a ball about. On this quiet cul-de-sac is a house where the England flag is flying, the home of 19-year-oldJoshua Strongwho lives with his parents and two brothers. ""Me and my grandad actually think we are going to win it,"" he said. ""I think we will get to the final and we have a chance. ""I really like Southgate. I like his passion; he makes the players feel happy and comfortable."" The Chelsea season ticket-holder, who attends Bournemouth University, added he thought Harry Maguire had been ""solid"" alongside John Stones in England's back three. ""It's been a good tournament. It was quite negative at the start about football hooliganism and VAR, but it's been the best one since I have been alive. ""There's a whole hype around the country."" While this part of the country isn't traditionally a hotbed of football fanaticism, it wasn't long before BBC News bumped into 38-year-old Liverpool and Oxford United fanAnnie Orr. How does she feel about this road sharing its name with the Manchester City forward? ""Sterling Road, Raheem Sterling - I've never really thought about it in that way before,"" she said. ""It's quite cool."" ""I don't really like him because I support Liverpool. I liked him when he was at Liverpool but I went off him when he went to Man City. He's still a good player."" In this corner of Devon, excitement is building ahead of England's quarter-final with Sweden. George Mercer, 16, who has lived on the street with his family his whole life, hadn't previously made the connection with the England and Manchester City central defender John Stones. ""I hadn't paid attention to our street being a 'Stones' street at all, but that's pretty cool,"" he said. ""The last game was so tense, my mum had to step outside because it was so close. There seemed to be a lot more Colombian fans at the game then English. ""I'm going to watch the quarter-final at home. I usually invite some friends around and we all watch it together. ""I've been watching most of the World Cup games which affect England, so I've watched the Croatian games, as we could meet them in the semi-final. ""England are going to make it to the final."" Trainee mechanicStevie Rawlingssays he's been enjoying the World Cup, although he thinks the best might yet to be to come from Gareth Southgate's players ""I've watched pretty much every England game possible,"" the 32-year-old said. ""England's performance has been very mixed. Sometimes they can show what they are actually capable off, then they will show you a side that will turn a nation against them. It's been a crazy World Cup."" What are England fans singing? Mapping England's World Cup squad How much do you know about the squad? But what does he think about England's talismanic striker Harry Kane? ""I'm not one of his biggest fans, probably because I'm a Leicester City supporter,"" he said. ""But you can't knock his skills and he tries his hardest. He does what every England player should do."" Paul Garratt, who's lived on this road for 12 years, had already made the connection with the England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford. ""I'm a football fan so it had occurred to me I'm living on a street with the same name. ""He's an excellent goalkeeper, and only going to get better. A talent, no doubt about it. I run a fantasy football league in my spare time and he's someone I should have bought way back, I think."" The semi-retired 53-year-old has high hopes for the rest of the tournament. ""The excitement is starting to build now,"" he said. ""There's the tension first, and now we're in the final eight and you think it's not far away now. We could really do something."" Diehard England fan Peter Jackson, 58, who has lived in Lingard Close in the Birmingham suburb of Nechells for 40 years, says he's amused at the connection with Jesse Lingard. The Birmingham City supporter said: ""He is superb and he hasn't played too bad - he scored a cracking goal in our World Cup match against Panama. ""He was also great when he was on loan at Birmingham City and scored four goals in his debut game."" The carer, who proudly hangs the St George's flag from his home, is hopeful that England will bring the World Cup home. ""England have been magic and we are going all the way,"" he said. ""If the trophy does not come home something is wrong, as all the big teams are being knocked out. ""I hope Lingard scores the winner in the final."" There are no roads in England that share their name with the 22-year-old Tottenham forward. Delly Close in Witney, Oxfordshire, is about as near as we could find. Close, it seems, but no cigar. Let's try not to get too carried away, but imagine if he scored the winning goal in a World Cup Final? Surely then it wouldn't be long before he joined the ranks ofBrian CloughandAlan Shearerin having a road named in his honour? Maybe it could even be called Dele Alli Alley?

"Patients, including children, were hosed down with water to remove chemicals on their skin A report by the chemical weapons watchdog suggests chlorine may have been used in April's suspected chemical attack on the Syrian town of Douma. The interim report,externalby the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said ""various chlorinated organic chemicals"" had been found (in samples taken from two locations), but there was no evidence of nerve agents. Medics say dozens of civilians were killed in the alleged attack by government forces on the rebel-held town in the Eastern Ghouta region near Damascus. The Syrian government denies carrying out any chemical weapons attacks. Following the Douma incident, US, British and French warplanes launched strikes against government facilities they said were involved in chemical weapons development and storage. The OPCW was recently given new powers by member statesto name those responsible for using chemical weapons. Its investigation into what happened in Douma is continuing. Medics in Douma reported on 7 April that more than 500 patients had been brought to medical facilities with symptoms suggesting exposure to a chemical agent. Rescue workers also reported a strong smell of chlorine in the air following air strikes that targeted two locations in Douma. The OPCW sent a Fact-Finding Mission team to Douma about a week later, but inspectors did not visit any sites of interest until 21 April. Douma 'chemical attack': What we know Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space ""Along with explosive residues, various chlorinated organic chemicals were found in samples from two sites,"" the preliminary report said. ""Work by the team to establish the significance of these results is on-going. The FFM team will continue its work to draw final conclusions."" The report said industrial gas cylinders were present at the two sites where chlorinated organic chemicals were detected. Following the alleged attack, a UN investigation said evidence pointed to the use of chlorine but that some people had exhibited symptoms more consistent with exposure to a nerve agent. The OPCW report, however, said that ""no organophosphorous nerve agents or their degradation products were detected"" at the sites. The five-year siege of the Eastern Ghouta, an agricultural region outside the capital where at least 265,000 civilians lived, was the longest in modern history. It came to an end in April, after a two-month offensive by pro-government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, that decimated homes, businesses and hospitals and reportedly left more than 1,700 men, women and children dead. Correction 23 July 2018: An earlier version of this article inaccurately summarised the findings of the OPCW's report. It has since been amended to clarify that their report suggests that chlorine may have been used in April's suspected chemical attack in Douma. Correction 4 October 2018: The article's headline has been amended to correct a misleading impression about the conclusions of the OPCW report, following a complaint to the BBC's Executive Complaints Unit. Clarification 12 October 2018: Following a further investigation, the BBC's Executive Complaints Unitfound the original headline to the article was materially inaccurate.This was a separate finding to the investigation which to led to the correction posted on 4 October.

Charting the US-China trade battle How a US-China trade war could hurt us all Trade row: What has happened so far? US tariffs on $34bn (Â£25.7bn) of Chinese goods came into effect on Friday. China retaliated by imposing a similar 25% tariff on 545 US products - including cars, soya beans and lobsters - also worth a total of $34bn. Russia is introducing extra duties on a range of products imported from the US that can be replaced by locally made equivalents. They include road-building equipment, products for the oil and gas industry, and tools used in mining. This video can not be played Why the US-China trade war will hit most of our pockets Mr Trump has already imposed tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels, and started charging levies on the imports of steel and aluminium from the European Union, Mexico and Canada. The US tariffs imposed so far would affect the equivalent of 0.6% of global trade and account for 0.1% of global GDP, according to Morgan Stanley. The US president said America might target Chinese goods worth $500bn - the total value of Chinese imports in 2017. The White House had previously said it would consult on tariffs on another $16bn of products, which Mr Trump has suggested could come into effect later this month. Mr Trump said: ""You have another 16 [billion dollars] in two weeks, and then, as you know, we have $200bn in abeyance and then after the $200bn, we have $300bn in abeyance. OK? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300."" Donald Trump says US tariffs will protect US jobs The American tariffs are the result of Mr Trump's attempt to protect US jobs and stop what he calls ""unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China"". By Tara McKelvey, White House reporter Behind the trade war, there is conflict within the Trump administration. Hardliners such as Peter Navarro, a trade policy adviser, says the US is defending itself against an ""aggressive"" China. Meanwhile, some of the officials who previously worked for the Obama administration - known as ""holdovers"" - are hoping to tamp down the US-China conflict. The tension between these factions is occasionally on display in the West Wing. I've seen two hardliners struggle over a podium, vying for a chance to broadcast Trump's harsh message on economic issues, while the holdovers sit quietly at the side of the room. This reflects a larger division in the White House: Trump and his closest aides are trying to bring about radical change, while those who support a more cautious approach find themselves sitting in silence. ""Trade war is never a solution,"" said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang. ""China would never start a trade war, but if any party resorts to an increase of tariffs then China will take measures in response to protect development interests."" The government-run English language China Daily newspaper said: ""The Trump administration is behaving like a gang of hoodlums with its shakedown of other countries, particularly China."" Russia says US tariffs on steel and aluminium, introduced in March, will cost its companies more than half a billion dollars. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecast only a modest escalation in the US-China battle, adding: ""However, we can't rule out a full-blown, recession-inducing 'trade war'."" Rob Carnell, chief Asia economist at ING, said: ""This is not economic Armageddon. We will not have to hunt our food with pointy sticks. ""But it is applying the brakes to a global economy that has less durable momentum than appears to be the case."" Carmaker BMW said it could not absorb all of the 25% tariff on the cars it exports to China from a plant in Spartanburg, South Carolina and would have to raise prices. The new tariffs had little impact on Asian stock markets. The Shanghai Composite closed 0.5% higher, but ended the week 3.5% lower - its seventh consecutive week of losses. Tokyo closed 1.1% higher and European markets were up more than 1% in morning trading before turning negative on Friday afternoon. Please upgrade your browser to view this content.

"We asked you to select the team to face Sweden and you have made three changes: In come Rose, Loftus-Cheek and Rashford The impossible job? We asked you to become the England manager - temporarily - and pick the side to face Sweden in Saturday's World Cup quarter-final, which is live on BBC One from 14:00 BST. After the shootout win over Colombia you decided there was no need for wholesale changes, but did make three switches, perhaps with an eye on fitness concerns in the camp. Tottenham's Danny Rose, who came close to an extra-time winner against Colombia, has been picked to start on the left ahead of Manchester United's Ashley Young, who limped off on Tuesday night. Also missing out on selection is Dele Alli - with the Tottenham man also struggling for fitness in Russia. Alli was the 12th most popular selection, but misses out to Ruben Loftus-Cheek in midfield, meaning that Eric Dier has to settle for a place on the bench despite his historic winning penalty. And up front Raheem Sterling was only 14th name on the sheet - behind Young - as you went with Manchester United youngster Marcus Rashford instead. Fewer than 250 people took the maverick step of NOT selecting captain and Golden Boot chasing Harry Kane alongside him.

Five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams became the eighth of the top 10 seeds to be knocked out after a third-round defeat by Kiki Bertens. Ninth seed Williams, 38, was beaten 6-2 6-7 (5-7) 8-6 by the 26-year-old Dutchwoman on Court One. Williams' fellow American Madison Keys lost nine consecutive games in her defeat to qualifierEvgeniya Rodina. The 10th seed lost 7-5 5-7 6-4 in two hours 10 minutes against the Russian, who is ranked 120th in the world. However, younger sisterSerenawent on to reach the last 16. Why are so many seeds out of Wimbledon? Monfils overcomes injury to beat Querrey Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Venus Williams made a sluggish start to the contest and her body language in the first set belied her frustration. At 5-1 Williams, who won Wimbledon in 2000, 2001, 2005, 2007 and 2008, saved a set point on her serve to avoid being broken for a third time. However, 20th seed Bertens remained unflustered and clinically closed out the set with an ace. World number nine Williams eventually found some rhythm in the second set as the pair twice traded breaks - Beterns missing a chance to serve out for the match at 5-4 up. In the tie-break that followed, Williams won two mini breaks to have a 6-2 advantage only to fluff a chance to close out the set before she eventually levelled the match. The pair exchanged early breaks in the third set before Bertens squandered two break points in the eighth game as Williams held. Williams saved two match break points on deuce at 7-6 down, but the pressure told and she struck a return low into the net to hand Bertens the victory in two hours and 40 minutes. ""It means a lot, I cannot really believe it. It was a tough match, a big fight but I am so happy I won this one,"" Bertens said. ""I will have a little celebration, rest a little, but I can celebrate a little because I am in the second week of Wimbledon."" This video can not be played Wimbledon 2018: Madison Keys out in shock defeat - highlights Keys, 23, had seemingly been cruising to the first set at 5-2 up only for the momentum to dramatically swing back to unheralded Russian Rodina. The world number 11 made numerous unforced errors which allowed 29-year-old Rodina to come back into the match and take the first set. Keys continued to struggle early in the second set as her losing streak of games continued and at 4-0 down the match appeared Rodina's for the taking. However, the American suddenly rediscovered her mojo and produced a superb fightback to win the second set. Rodina received lengthy treatment from the physio early in the third set and did not move around the court as freely. Both players regularly exchanged breaks in a scrappy third set, before Rodina kept her nerve at 5-4 up to reach the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time in her career. Seventh seedKarolina Pliskovawas given a scare by Mihaela Buzarnescu of Romania after she lost the first set. However, the Czech regained her composure to triumph 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 against the 29th seed. Ekaterina Makarova, who knocked out second seed Caroline Wozniacki in the third round, also progressed. The Russian beat Lucie Safarova of the Czech Republic 4-6 6-4 6-1 to seal her place in the last 16.

"Brien O'Keeffe has been with the London Fire Brigade for 25 years Evacuating Grenfell Tower after fire had taken hold would have been a ""huge catastrophe"", an inquiry has heard. Watch manager Brien O'Keeffe said the advice for residents to stay in their homes helped firefighters find them. He toldthe public inquiryinto the blaze on 14 June 2017 that he ""wasn't in favour"" of evacuation as there would have been bodies throughout the tower. The ""stay-put"" strategy was in place until 02:47 BST - nearly two hours after the fire started. The only escape route from the tower - a single stairwell - was filled with smoke by 02:00 and it would have been ""unsafe and dangerous"" to use, Mr O'Keeffe said. A total of72 people died as a result of the blaze in west London. Firefighter wanted to drop stay-put advice 'Catastrophic' Grenfell failures outlined What happened at Grenfell Tower? Listen: The Grenfell Tower Inquiry with Eddie Mair The watch manager - who has been with the London Fire Brigade for 25 years - told the hearing at Holborn Bars that the fire had ""outstripped the event and outstripped our ability to rescue everybody"". Between 02:00 and 02:30 he asked his manager if the stay-put policy was still in place. Mr O'Keeffe said: ""I didn't have an opinion, other than if people started to evacuate it would become multiple casualties in the stairs and that we would have great difficulty in finding out where people were. ""But if people start evacuating - when the entire building is on fire or most of it is on fire and the only way down is impossible - that will have been a huge catastrophe."" He added: ""It would have really impeded our rescue operations and if my guys didn't know where people were, I couldn't say, 'go to this floor'. You just have - as you did afterwards - people deceased in the stairwell and various parts of the building."" Mr O'Keeffe told the inquiry he ""wasn't in favour"" of the advice being ditched, but he just ""needed to know what was going on"" to do his job. Residents were collapsing in the stairwell during rescues and had to be carried the rest of the way down, he said.

"David Norris is serving a life sentence for Stephen Lawrence's murder One of Stephen Lawrence's killers has settled a claim with the Ministry of Justice after he was attacked in prison. David Norris suffered a broken nose and ribs at HMP Belmarsh in 2011 where he was being held on remand ahead of his trial for murder. He sued for damages - reported to be Â£8,000 - after the assault. Norris and another man, Gary Dobson, were found guilty of murdering the teenager in a racist attack in 1993. The pair were given life sentences in 2012. It's understood that David Norris was awarded around Â£8,000 compensation. He was also entitled to legal aid. But the amount he received in compensation will have counted as his income, therefore it's thought he would have had to pay some of his legal fees himself. In 2017-18, a total of 4,957 offenders received ""special payments"" from HM Prison and Probation Service amounting to more than Â£10m. The previous year, Â£8.7m was paid out to 4,936 offenders. The figures - contained in the HMPPS annual report published last week - do not contain any further detail, but officials say the vast majority of the payments were compensation to prisoners and other offenders. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: ""We robustly defend all claims and are successful in two-thirds of cases brought against us by prisoners."" During Norris's murder trial, defence lawyer Stephen Batten QC said the prisoner had been attacked several times while on remand in jail. Stephen Lawrence was murdered in 1993 He told jurors at the Old Bailey that on one occasion his client's nose was broken, teeth were knocked out, and four ribs were broken. Stephen, a black British 18-year-old from Plumstead, south-east London,was waiting for a buson the evening of 22 April 1993 when he was stabbed to death. His death sparked a national outrage and probes into police conduct after a number of failures were identified in the handling of the case. Stephen's parents recently called for further investigations into their son's death as they believe he was stabbed by a group of up to six people. But The Met said probesinto Stephen's murder were ""unlikely to progress"" without new information.

"This video can not be played Police search John Baker House where victim Dawn Sturgess lives Police in hazmat suits have been searching a Salisbury hostel as they try to find the item contaminated with a nerve agent that poisoned a couple. Investigators entered John Baker House, where one of the victims, Dawn Sturgess, 44, lives, on Friday afternoon. Police believe Charlie Rowley, 45, and Ms Sturgess were exposed toNovichokafter handling the unknown object. The pair remain in a critical condition in hospital. Police said the ""unique challenges"" surrounding the operation meant ""police activity is expected to take weeks and months to complete"". They added they are looking through more than 1,300 hours of CCTV footage to help them find the source of the contamination. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said no objects have been collected for testing yet. Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Salisbury reacts to fresh case Conspiracy theories abound in Russia media What are Novichok nerve agents? A government scientist told BBC News that the contaminated item was unlikely to have been left in the open before the couple touched it. Novichok can be degraded by rainwater and sunlight over time - meaning it was probably discovered by the pair in a contained space, the government source added. But other experts have said the nerve agent was designed to be persistent and not break down. Speaking to BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, the government scientist also said the Novichok was so toxic it was able to pass through the skin and did not need to be ingested. The source added that Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess's symptoms were the same as those shown by Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. They were both poisoned with Novichok in nearby Salisbury in March. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley fell ill on Saturday in Amesbury, Wiltshire The Amesbury investigation is entering a new phase. Scientists and chemical weapons experts atPorton Downin Wiltshire are bracing themselves for an influx of countless objects all needing forensic analysis. Investigators, led by the Met Police's counter-terrorism detectives, are working on the basis that the pair - now critically ill from Novichok poisoning - handled a contaminated item that caught their interest. They need to find it. The item - or possibly items - are thought to be something found and touched by the pair, possibly something as innocuous as a perfume bottle or other luxury toiletry. The search for this ""source item"" is likely to be extensive, painstaking and could last through the summer. This video can not be played Footage shows Ms Sturgess in Salisbury days before her collapse Ms Sturgess is understood to be a mother of three who lives at the Salisbury hostel, which offers supported accommodation. A close friend of Ms Sturgess's, who also lived at John Baker House, described her as a ""loving and caring person"". Mr Rowley's brother Matthew told the BBC: ""He's a lovely guy and would do anything for you. He's a sweetheart basically."" This video can not be played Charlie Rowley's brother Matthew describes how he found out what had happened On Saturday, paramedics were called twice to a flat in Muggleton Road in Amesbury - first at 11:00 BST after Ms Sturgess collapsed. Medics attended again several hours later, after Mr Rowley also fell ill. A friend of the couple, Sam Hobson, said after Ms Sturgess was taken to hospital, he and Mr Rowley went to a chemist in Amesbury to collect a prescription before going to an event at a nearby Baptist church. The two men returned to the flat and planned to visit the hospital but Mr Rowley ""started feeling really hot and sweaty"" and began ""acting all funny"", Mr Hobson, 29, said. ""He was rocking against the wall and his eyes were red, pinpricked, and he started sweating loads and dribbling, so I had to phone an ambulance for him,"" said Mr Hobson. This video can not be played Sam Hobson, a friend of one of the Amesbury poisoning victims, describes the symptoms he witnessed Based on information from a friend and items found at the flat, Wiltshire Police initially thought the pair had fallen ill after using a contaminated batch of heroin or crack cocaine. But after tests at the government's military research facility at Porton Down, a major incident was declared and it was confirmed they had been exposed to Novichok. Police do not believe Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess were victims of a targeted attack, but instead came into contact with the substance in Amesbury or Salisbury. On Friday night, police revealed more details around the victim's movements. They said the pair were both at John Baker House on Friday lunchtime, before visiting a number of shops in Salisbury and heading to Queen Elizabeth Gardens. They returned to the hostel at around 16:20 BST before heading to Amesbury by bus at around 22:30. At midday on Friday, there was an increased police presence in Muggleton Road - where the couple were found - with fire engines also attending Police believe they were there until emergency services were called on Saturday. Five areas have been cordoned off: Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Amesbury; John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the ""strong working assumption"" was that the pair came into contact with Novichok in a location which had not been cleaned up following the Skripal poisoning. Assistant Commissioner of Specialist Operations Neil Basu said that ""around 100 detectives"" from the Counter Terrorism Policing Network were working on the investigation. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the latest incident was a result of a ""war crime"" by Russia - and that using a nerve agent in a civilian area was a ""vile act of terror"". Mr Javid called on Russia to explain ""exactly what has gone on"". The home secretary added he was ""comfortable"" the ""exact same nerve agent"" had been used in both the Salisbury and Amesbury poisonings - but added it was not yet known if they were from the same batch. But Russia - which denies involvement in either incident - said the UK was trying to ""muddy the waters"" and ""intimidate its own citizens"". Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played 'I don't want this to happen to anyone else' - diabetic woman whose drink was confiscated A Belfast woman with Type 1 diabetes has been awarded Â£2,000 after security staff at a rock concert confiscated her fizzy drink. Kayla Hanna, 20, was at a Red Hot Chili Peppers concert in Belfast in 2016. The student always carries Lucozade for her blood sugar levels, but staff employed by Eventsec Ltd removed it, despite her showing them her diabetes tattoo and insulin pack. Eventsec said it was disappointed by the ruling. Deadly diabetes in 'unrelenting march' Diabetes blood test 'could mean end to daily insulin jabs' The judge ruled it was discrimination. Miss Hanna, who was 18 at the time of the incident, told the court she was going into the Boucher Road concert when she was told she could not bring in her bottle. ""I told her [ the security guard] of my condition and showed her the tattoos on my wrist which indicate I have diabetes,"" she said. ""She said that 'anyone could have that' so I also showed her my insulin pack and the meter used to check my levels. ""She consulted with another guard and they insisted that they had a strict policy and they would not allow me to bring the drink inside."" Miss Hanna took a case under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland supported her. She told the court she had been ""very anxious and upset"" throughout the gig. ""I really hope that now this issue has been brought to light it won't happen again to me or other people who live with diabetes,"" she added. Judge Gilpin said that Eventsec Ltd had failed to provide a reasonable adjustment to its policy of not allowing liquids to be brought into the concert. An Eventsec spokesperson said it was pleased that the judge had acknowledged that the company had ""considered what reasonable adjustments needed to be put in place in order to meet the needs of those patrons with diabetes"". ""The facts surrounding this case were an isolated incident,"" the company noted. Mary Kitson, senior legal officer at the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland said: ""These are the kind of circumstances in which the reasonable adjustment provisions in the Disability Discrimination Act can be most beneficial"". She added: ""They are in the act to ensure that people with disabilities are not denied access to services by reason of general policies which can, in themselves, be otherwise justifiable and necessary. ""In this case, the company should have made arrangements to ensure that Kayla could have accessed Lucozade during the concert if needed, for example by directing her to its own medical centre at the venue and providing her with a bottle of Lucozade. ""That would have been a simple adjustment and would have met her medical needs."" Jay Perks is a keen footballer who is a type 1 diabetic ""My 16 year old son Jay is a type 1 diabetic and was diagnosed at 9. ""He is a huge Arsenal fan and regularly attends games at the Emirates Stadium in London. They too have the same policy about drinks bottles, but as soon as they realise Jay is diabetic, they allow him to take in whatever he needs. ""Obviously his bag is always checked by different security guards. ""He always gets the same positive and helpful reaction, which shows the staff have been trained appropriately to know diabetics need something on their person to raise their blood sugar levels if necessary."" Amy Rose and her fiancÃ© James Cockburn ""On holiday the venue staff were adamant that I couldn't bring in some biscuits and a can of coke, I was showing them my insulin, my blood monitor, but they were relentless. ""I've been to countless places where I've had my bag searched and people have said 'you're not allowed to take drinks in' and you really have to explain they're there not there just because I want to consume them, they're there as a medical necessity. ""As a diabetic, it is frustrating because if I am not allowed to bring a sugary drink into a venue, it means I have to pay their inflated prices. ""Taking a hypo (a fall in blood sugar level) at something like a gig or concert could be as serious as life or death."" There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 - where the pancreas does not produce any insulin Type 2 - where the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body's cells do not react to insulin Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. About 10% of all diabetes is type 1, but it is the most common type of childhood diabetes, so it is sometimes called juvenile diabetes or early onset diabetes Type 2 diabetes tends to develop later in life and is often linked to lifestyle and being overweight or having a family history of type 2 diabetes.

"Melania Trump is joining her husband on the visit Donald Trump will meet the Queen at Windsor and hold talks with the prime minister at Chequers on his four-day visit to the UK next week. The itinerary for Thursday and Friday confirms the US president will stay at the US Ambassador's House in Regent's Park overnight. But he will spend much of his time outside London at formal events. Protests in the capital will go ahead as planned, organisers have said, with others set to demonstrate in Scotland. BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins said it would be ""the most controversial visit ever made by an American president to Britain"". Despite some pomp and ceremony, it will be ""far from the original state visit promised to President Trump"" and remains what is deemed a working trip, Robbins added. Treasury to cover Trump visit police bill One million sign Stop Trump petition President Trump's Scotland visit confirmed Robbins said it was also ""really noticeable that he will barely spend any time in London"" - perhaps to avoid the protests. But US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, said there was no deliberate plan to keep Mr Trump out of the capital or away from protests, and he was ""focused on his objectives"". He added that it was a ""short trip, packed with things he has to do"", but that President Trump ""will be spending a lot of time in central London"". Groups organising protests on Friday have vowed to ""be heard"" whether he is in the capital or not. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

President Trump will fly in to the UK on Thursday afternoon with First Lady Melania Trump, following a Nato summit in Brussels. The couple will attend a black-tie dinner on Thursday hosted by Theresa May at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire - the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill. The president will be greeted with a military ceremony in the Great Court, with the bands of the Scots, Irish and Welsh Guards playing the Liberty Fanfare, Amazing Grace and the National Emblem. A black-tie dinner will be held at Blenheim Palace Invited guests, including a number of business leaders, will eat dinner to the sounds of the Countess of Wessex's Orchestra, which will play a ""series of classic British and American hits"", according to Mrs May's deputy spokeswoman. Mr Trump,whose mother was Scottish, will then be piped out at the end by the Royal Regiment of Scotland. After spending the night at Winfield House in London, hosted by his ambassador Mr Johnson, the president will join the prime minister to watch a UK military exercise, before the pair travel to Chequers - the PM's country residence in Buckinghamshire - for bilateral talks. The president and first lady will then travel to Windsor to meet the Queen on Friday afternoon. On the final leg of the tour, the couple will fly to Scotland, where they plan to spend the weekend. BBC diplomatic correspondent Robbins said while the government realises it is a controversial trip, President Trump is ""fully entitled"" to be welcomed into the UK in this way. The government also stressed that previous presidents have met prime ministers at Chequers rather than at No 10, including Richard Nixon and both the Bushes. US ambassador Mr Johnson said the ""special relationship"" between the UK and the US was ""as strong as ever"", and that Mr Trump knows the UK ""better than any other modern president"". Mrs May announced President Trump would be coming for a state visit to the UKin January 2017 after she became the first foreign leader to meet with him in Washington following his inauguration. But after a lot of backlash from MPs and more than one million people signing a petition against the trip, a date has still not been set for the state visit. This video can not be played What is a state visit? Frankie McCamley explains Thousands are expected to protest in London on Thursday and Friday against the president's working visit. Police forces from across the country have been asked to send officers to assist the Metropolitan Police, including 400 from the West Midlands force. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has granted permission fora giant inflatable figuredepicting Mr Trump as a baby to fly over Westminster for two hours on the second day of the president's visit. Daniel Jones, part of the group that organised the blow-up caricature, said he hoped Mr Trump would take note of their efforts online, even if he could not see it in person. He added that, ""like it or not"", the government would not be able to ""smuggle"" the president around the country ""without him seeing anything"".

"The blaze has been burning near major communication masts A second man arrested over a large moorland fire on Winter Hill has been released while inquiries continue. The 20-year-old, from Wigan, had been detained on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life. Hundreds of firefighters, aided by helicopter crews, have been tackling the Lancashire blaze since 28 June. Another man, 22, from Bolton, was arrested the following day on suspicion of the same offence and has been released under investigation. The blaze has been burning near major communication masts, which transmit TV services to north-west England. Firefighters have been tackling the Lancashire blaze since 28 June Fire crews have created an exclusion zone to encourage people to stay away. They said people were still visiting the site, at a popular beauty spot after a used disposable barbecue was found on unburnt land nearby. Steve Morgan, from Lancashire fire service, said it ""beggars belief"" someone would risk causing another huge fire. The exclusion zone covers 3 sq miles (8 sq km) from Pigeon Tower, Rivington, to Wilton Quarries near Bolton. Firefighters have been praised for their work Russell Hedley, from the Woodland Trust,said whole ecosystems had been wiped out by the blaze. Crews from around the country joined local firefighters to tackle the flames and another blaze 30 miles away at Saddleworth Moor. Soldiers sent to assist crews at Saddleworth for the past week were stood down on Friday because firefighters are ""making good progress"", a Manchester fire service spokesperson said.

"Lucy Letby pictured in 2013 A nurse held on suspicion of the murder of eight babies and the attempted murder of another six has been bailed. Lucy Letby, 28, was arrested on Tuesday after the deaths of 17 infants at the Countess of Chester Hospital between March 2015 and July 2016. Police are also investigating 15 non-fatal collapses at the hospital's neonatal unit during that period. ""This is an extremely difficult time for all the families,"" Cheshire Police said. ""We continue to recognise that this investigation has a huge impact on all of the families, staff, and patients at the hospital as well as members of the public."" Police officers searched Lucy Letby's house A spokesman for the Countess of Chester Hospital said it was supporting Cheshire Police's investigation. ""In line with the trust's current policies, the member of staff involved will not be returning to work while this matter is ongoing,"" he added. Officers have been searching Ms Letby's house in Chester, about a mile from the hospital, and were seen at her parents' property in Hereford. Lucy Letby, 28, was arrested on Tuesday Her arrest is part of a long inquiry into a higher than expected number of baby deaths at the hospital. The cases involve families from Cheshire and north Wales. Cheshire Police has not officially named the suspect. Police are said to have arrived at Ms Letby's home at about 06:00 on Tuesday. A neighbour said: ""I saw lots of police cars arrive, a few cars then a big police van, and gradually more and more came and they put up the tent."" Chester hospital says the neonatal unit was ""safe to continue in its current form"" In a 2013 interview with the Chester and District Standard, Ms Letby said she began working on the unit after graduating and cared for babies requiring various levels of support. She had worked on the unit as a student nurse during three years of training before qualifying as a children's nurse at the University of Chester in 2011. Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust has confirmed Ms Letby did training placements with them. A trust spokesperson said it was co-operating with the police investigation, which includes a ""routine review of patients cared for on our neonatal unit during the time of these placements"". ""There is currently no suggestion that any patients at Liverpool Women's came to any harm in relation to this investigation."" Police were asked to investigate the deaths of eight babies at Chester in May 2017 - an investigation that has since widened to include nine more.

"This video can not be played The 'run, hide, tell' film shows holidaymakers what to do in the event of a terror attack The UK's top counter-terrorism officers have issued a fresh plea to British holidaymakers to stay alert for attacks while abroad this summer. Afour-minute safety video,externaladvising tourists how to react in the event of a terror attack has been re-launched. The clip, which was first issued last year, tells people to follow the official ""run, hide, tell"" guidance. The chances of being involved in an attack ""are still low"", said police - but people should ""know what to do"". Chief Superintendent Nick Aldworth, of the Metropolitan Police, said: ""We want people to think of this in the same way they do the safety film airlines show before take-off. ""They don't expect anything bad to happen but it is a sensible safety precaution to show people what to do."" What should you do in an attack? Is it safe to go on holiday in Tunisia? The video,which was released in July last yearand has now been watched by seven million people, outlines what to do during a gun attack at a hotel. It shows families and hotel staff fleeing the sound of gunshots, barricading themselves into rooms and being treated as potential suspects by armed police. The clip came two years afterthe terror attack in the beach resort of Sousse, Tunisiain June 2015, when a gunman killed 38 people, including 30 Britons. There is no specific information that British people travelling abroad will be targeted this summer, police said. Security minister Ben Wallace reassured Britons that ""there is no need to be alarmed"" and the majority will never experience an attack while on holiday. But he said it is important to ""remain vigilant"" and watch the video, which could be ""life-saving"". He also suggested holidaymakers ""read the small print on their travel insurance"" to ensure they are covered.

"The star advised fans to seek medical advice if they were worried about their health Elvis Costello has cancelled the remaining dates of his European tour as he recovers from surgery to remove a ""very aggressive"" tumour. The singer-songwriter went under the knife in May, but decided to go ahead with his tour dates in June. ""The spirit has been more than willing,""he said in a statement,externalannouncing the cancellation. ""But I have to now accept it is going to take longer than I would have wished for me to recover my full strength."" The 63-year-old, whose best known songs include Oliver's Army, Shipbuilding and I Can't Stand Up For Falling Down, is one of the most influential and prolific artists to emerge from the 1970s punk and new wave scene. Over the years, he has collaborated with the likes of Paul McCartney, Green Day and Burt Bacharach; and he received an Oscar nomination for writing The Scarlet Tide from the Nicole Kidman movie Cold Mountain in 2003.

His 31st studio album is scheduled to be released in October. He had already cancelled concerts in Southend and Plymouth before deciding to scrap all future dates, including shows in Manchester, Croatia and Sweden. In a statement, Costello said: ""Six weeks ago my specialist called me and said, 'You should start playing the Lotto'. ""He had rarely, if ever, seen such a small but very aggressive cancerous malignancy that could be defeated by a single surgery. ""I was elated and relieved that our European summer tour could go ahead. ""Post-surgical guidelines for such surgery recommend three weeks to four weeks recovery depending on whether you are returning to a desk job or an occupation that involves physical work or travel. ""It was impossible to judge how this advisory would line up with the demands on a travelling musician, playing 90-minute to two-hour plus performances on a nightly basis but by the time we reached the Edinburgh Playhouse [on 24 June], I was almost fooled into thinking that normal service had been resumed. ""The spirit has been more than willing but I have to now accept that it is going to take longer than I would have wished for me to recover my full strength. Therefore, I must reluctantly cancel all the remaining engagements of this tour."" He also advised fans to seek advice if they were worried about their health. ""Take very good care of your loved ones but gentleman, do talk to you friends - you'll find you are not alone - seek your doctor's advice if you are in doubt or when it is timely and act as swiftly as you may in these matters.

"This video can not be played 'I don't want this to happen to anyone else' - diabetic woman whose drink was confiscated A Belfast woman with Type 1 diabetes has been awarded Â£2,000 after security staff at a rock concert confiscated her fizzy drink. Kayla Hanna, 20, was at a Red Hot Chili Peppers concert in Belfast in 2016. The student always carries Lucozade for her blood sugar levels, but staff employed by Eventsec Ltd removed it, despite her showing them her diabetes tattoo and insulin pack. Eventsec said it was disappointed by the ruling. Deadly diabetes in 'unrelenting march' Diabetes blood test 'could mean end to daily insulin jabs' The judge ruled it was discrimination. Miss Hanna, who was 18 at the time of the incident, told the court she was going into the Boucher Road concert when she was told she could not bring in her bottle. ""I told her [ the security guard] of my condition and showed her the tattoos on my wrist which indicate I have diabetes,"" she said. ""She said that 'anyone could have that' so I also showed her my insulin pack and the meter used to check my levels. ""She consulted with another guard and they insisted that they had a strict policy and they would not allow me to bring the drink inside."" Miss Hanna took a case under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland supported her. She told the court she had been ""very anxious and upset"" throughout the gig. ""I really hope that now this issue has been brought to light it won't happen again to me or other people who live with diabetes,"" she added. Judge Gilpin said that Eventsec Ltd had failed to provide a reasonable adjustment to its policy of not allowing liquids to be brought into the concert. An Eventsec spokesperson said it was pleased that the judge had acknowledged that the company had ""considered what reasonable adjustments needed to be put in place in order to meet the needs of those patrons with diabetes"". ""The facts surrounding this case were an isolated incident,"" the company noted. Mary Kitson, senior legal officer at the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland said: ""These are the kind of circumstances in which the reasonable adjustment provisions in the Disability Discrimination Act can be most beneficial"". She added: ""They are in the act to ensure that people with disabilities are not denied access to services by reason of general policies which can, in themselves, be otherwise justifiable and necessary. ""In this case, the company should have made arrangements to ensure that Kayla could have accessed Lucozade during the concert if needed, for example by directing her to its own medical centre at the venue and providing her with a bottle of Lucozade. ""That would have been a simple adjustment and would have met her medical needs."" Jay Perks is a keen footballer who is a type 1 diabetic ""My 16 year old son Jay is a type 1 diabetic and was diagnosed at 9. ""He is a huge Arsenal fan and regularly attends games at the Emirates Stadium in London. They too have the same policy about drinks bottles, but as soon as they realise Jay is diabetic, they allow him to take in whatever he needs. ""Obviously his bag is always checked by different security guards. ""He always gets the same positive and helpful reaction, which shows the staff have been trained appropriately to know diabetics need something on their person to raise their blood sugar levels if necessary."" Amy Rose and her fiancÃ© James Cockburn ""On holiday the venue staff were adamant that I couldn't bring in some biscuits and a can of coke, I was showing them my insulin, my blood monitor, but they were relentless. ""I've been to countless places where I've had my bag searched and people have said 'you're not allowed to take drinks in' and you really have to explain they're there not there just because I want to consume them, they're there as a medical necessity. ""As a diabetic, it is frustrating because if I am not allowed to bring a sugary drink into a venue, it means I have to pay their inflated prices. ""Taking a hypo (a fall in blood sugar level) at something like a gig or concert could be as serious as life or death."" There are two main types of diabetes: Type 1 - where the pancreas does not produce any insulin Type 2 - where the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body's cells do not react to insulin Type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, but usually appears before the age of 40, particularly in childhood. About 10% of all diabetes is type 1, but it is the most common type of childhood diabetes, so it is sometimes called juvenile diabetes or early onset diabetes Type 2 diabetes tends to develop later in life and is often linked to lifestyle and being overweight or having a family history of type 2 diabetes.

"Nawaz Sharif denies any wrongdoing A Pakistani court has sentenced former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to 10 years in prison on corruption charges related to four luxury London flats. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) court handed down the verdict after a series of delays. His daughter and son-in-law were also convicted. Sharif, who is currently in London and was sentenced in absentia, says the charges are politically motivated and has vowed to return to Pakistan. ""I will go back. I will continue my struggle even in the jail,"" he told reporters. Sharif gave no date for his return. His wife,Kulsoom Nawaz, is receiving treatment in London for cancer. Sharif's lawyer Abdul Rashid Sheikh, speaking in Pakistan, confirmed that they would appeal against the conviction. Nawaz Sharif's Panamagate explained How a font exposed 'fake' documents Profile: Nawaz Sharif Judge Mohammad Bashir ordered Sharif to serve 10 years for owning assets beyond income and one year for not co-operating with the NAB. The sentences are to be served concurrently. Daughter Maryam Nawaz Sharif, also in London, received seven years for abetting a crime and one year for not co-operating - again to run concurrently - while son-in-law Safdar Awan was given a one-year sentence for not co-operating. Sharif and Maryam also received fines of Â£8m ($10.6m) and Â£2m respectively. Supporters of Nawaz Sharif protested against the sentence in Karachi and other cities The case, known as the Avenfield Reference, relates to a number of properties in the UK capital. The Panama Papers leak in 2015revealed several of Sharif's children had links to offshore companies, which were allegedly used to channel funds and buy foreign assets - including luxury flats in Avenfield House, on London's Park Lane. His family, however, insist they legitimately acquired the four properties. As part of the ruling, the court ordered they be confiscated for the federal government. Members of the Pakistani media set up outside the Avenfield House properties, where the family reportedly watched the verdict: Allow Twitter content?

The UK has no formal extradition treaty with Pakistan, butSection 194 of the Extradition Act 2003 allows special extradition arrangements,externalin exceptional circumstances. Fearing unrest, the Pakistani authorities reportedly closed roads around the Federal Judicial Complex in Islamabad and imposed a ban on public assemblies or rallies in the area. The court repeatedly delayed the decision, initially pushing the ruling back after Friday prayers and then several times again, sparking speculation about the wait. However, the judge reportedly said part of the delay was because of the need to photocopy the judgement - which is more than 100 pages long - for both the defence and the prosecution. On Twitter, the hashtag #AvenfieldReference became one of the highest worldwide trends as Pakistanis awaited the verdict. Security was tight outside the court in Islamabad Pakistan holds a general election on 25 July. Sharif is disqualified from standing for his centre-right party, the PML-N. His brotherShahbaz Sharif now heads the PML-N, and is running in the election. Analysis by M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad The ruling comes just a couple of weeks ahead of national elections and is seen by many as the culmination of a process that first saw Sharif disqualified by the Supreme Court last year on questionable grounds. The PML-N party has blamed the military for this process, saying it was conspiring to annihilate it for its criticism of the military's links with militant groups and its policy to improve ties with India. With elections approaching, the party is likely to use Sharif's conviction as proof of this ""conspiracy"" with an aim to preserve its substantial but increasingly jittery bloc of voters. Much will depend on Sharif's next move. If he decides to return to the country he will certainly be jailed, but it may also animate his party's election campaign and earn a sympathy vote. Shahbaz Sharif defended his brother at a press conference following the verdict, calling it ""politically motivated"" and saying the election in July would serve as a people's court that would condemn the decision. The country's Supreme Court ousted Nawaz Sharif from the premiership  in July 2017following the Panama Papers revelations. At the time, he was less than a year away from becoming the first head of government in Pakistani history to complete a full term in office. Sharif held the office from November 1990 to July 1993 and from February 1997 until he was toppled in a bloodless coup in October 1999.

"Katharine, Ellie and the Most Reverend Justin Welby The Church needs to do more to embrace disability and mental health, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby says, drawing on the experience of two of his daughters. Justin - he insists we use his first name - reveals that Katharine's mental health difficulties and Ellie's learning disabilities, had ""really brought it to the front of [his] mind"". He was speaking to theBBC Ouch podcast, made by the BBC's disability team. Sitting beside his daughters, Ellie, 24, and Katharine, 32, Justin encourages them to speak openly, even if what they say makes uncomfortable listening. He begins by taking Ellie's hand - this is the first time she has spoken publicly. Taking part in a discussion about exclusion with other disabled studio guests, Ellie says: ""The church I go to now, I sit at the back because I don't really feel comfortable. ""They're very friendly in my church, but sometimes I can feel a bit out of place there."" Archbishop hopes 'not to do Queen's funeral' Archbishop criticises grammar schools Ellie also has dyspraxia, which impacts co-ordination, but can be confused with clumsiness. Her disability, not being an obvious physical impairment, is often referred to as invisible. Because of this, she feels her needs are often misunderstood or overlooked. ""I have struggled a lot. People have looked at me and basically - I know the look now - it's literally like, 'You're not disabled, why are you sitting there?' Or, 'Why can't you do this?'. ""I've been discriminated against quite a few times because they don't understand it."" Justin gives Ellie - who confesses she is a ""Daddy's girl"" - a friendly punch on the shoulder to acknowledge that she's made a good point. He, himself, has struggled at times with what he calls ""the black dog"" - a phrase Winston Churchill used to describe episodes of depression. In 1983, the Welbys lost a seven-month-old baby, Johanna, in a car crash. Twelve months later another of his children was critically ill. It has often led him to question his faith. ""There have been moments where it's been a huge test,"" he says. ""You read the Bible and life's not simple."" This video can not be played Archbishop of Canterbury talks with daughters on disability and mental health Does the Archbishop prefer listening to S Club 7 or the Backstreet Boys? Also on the show: Co-writer of The Vicar of Dibley and Spitting Image, Paul Mayhew-Archer, talks about living with Parkinson's 10-year-old Frasier talks about the book he has published about the refugee crisis A full transcript isavailable here. For more Disability News, follow BBC Ouch onTwitter,externalandFacebook,external, andsubscribe to the weekly podcast. Religion hasn't always been so important to him. At boarding school he used chapel time to finish homework, hidden behind the hymn books. The only interesting thing that ever happened, he says, was the ""headmaster falling out of the pulpit"". It was years later, when he worked in Kenya as an oil investor, that he met people with a great connection to God. It was the first step on the path to being ordained in 1989. Katharine has spoken openly about her mental health struggle, suicidal thoughts, and of not being able to confide in her parents about them. She says the Church does not always know how to respond to these struggles. She says people offer to pray for her, but feels this masks important conversations and opportunities to help. ""If your first response is, 'Can I pray for your healing?', then you're not listening,"" she says. ""Because actually - A, you don't need to say to someone you're praying for their healing for God to be able to work, God's bigger than that. And B, it really shuts down the conversation. ""I now actually only let a very few people pray for my healing, because I've had so many really awful experiences."" The most hurtful thing, she says, was when someone prayed for her ""addiction to negative thinking"". ""I'm not addicted to negative thinking, I'm depressed and anxious medically,"" she says. ""It's a chemical thing going on with me, it's not an addiction. And that was really unhelpful. I felt very unsettled by that. ""They're trying to be helpful, but they're not listening. And inclusion and welcome in Church is about so much more than accessibility physically."" Archbishop criticises BBC over Savile Archbishop praises compassion shown in 2017 Many disabled people experience unwanted prayers, often in the street or on public transport. Even the Archbishop has been offered prayers. ""I've had times when people have said, 'Could we pray for you?' And if I wasn't the Archbishop I'd have actually said, 'I'd really prefer that you didn't'. ""But I feel that I can't always say that."" But does he include his own children's disabilities in his prayers? He says he prays for Katharine and her mental health on a daily basis, but for Ellie it is more nuanced. ""I haven't prayed for Ellie,"" he says. ""I haven't talked to Ellie about this [but] we had this discussion once around the [family] table when Ellie wasn't there, because someone had asked me the question."" He asked the family what they thought about praying for Ellie. Turning to Ellie, he says: ""Your younger sister said, 'If God changed Ellie she wouldn't be Ellie, and we love Ellie'. So there's that thing that Ellie's Ellie, she's precious."" He sees Katharine's mental illness as something she's not always had, but Ellie has always had the disability and it's part of her. Ellie, herself, is ambivalent about disability and prayer. ""I have felt a bit like, well if God heals why am I still dyspraxic? Why do I still find it really difficult to do things? But at the same time it doesn't change the way I trust God."" Justin reveals that he needs to compile a list of ""awkward questions"" to ask God ""when I meet Him"". And while he's at it, perhaps he might try to persuade God to watch the sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys, which the Archbishop says he watches and is a ""good way of unwinding"". Justin is conscious the Church needs to be aware of, and embrace, people's differences and needs. Katharine, who also has chronic fatigue syndrome, says she has felt embarrassed at times when she has been unable to stand during services. ""You can feel quite uncomfortable, like people are looking at you, like you're not paying attention or not engaging properly."" She says more flexibility and acceptance is needed. ""If someone goes in and the first week they're there they get tutted at, then they're not going to come back."" More parishes have started to use the phrase ""stand if it's convenient"", Justin says, because, when it comes down to it, ""it doesn't matter tuppence"" how someone worships. ""You do have to go through a process of educating people,"" he says. ""Get rid of the frowns and the tuts."" Justin hopes to find more solutions to these problems when he hosts a conference in July at Lambeth Palace on disability and inclusion. One question he really wants to address is the physical accessibility of churches. Many of the Church of England's 9,000 buildings are ill-equipped and inaccessible, but heritage protection currently trumps accessibility law. ""I find it absolutely extraordinary that disability access comes second to heritage,"" he says. ""I really find that bizarre. Well, that's one way of saying we don't care about you, isn't it?"" Ahead of the conference he has another important event - the christening of Prince Louis on 9 July, which he says is ""very nerve wracking"" but ""a great privilege"". ""You know, if you're at the wedding don't drop the rings and if you're at the baptism don't drop the baby. They're a wonderful family, there's lots of love and it'll be a great occasion.""

Uruguay v France (15:00) If Edinson Cavani does not win his fitness race to take part today, more responsibility will fall to Luis Suarez, who has two goals at the World Cup this time around. He ran relentlessly against Portugal last time out in a selfless display and there is no doubt he will again have to be at his best if France are to be toppled. The French are unbeaten in their last nine World Cup matches against South American sides (W5, D4), keeping a clean sheet in seven of those games. They've got the measure of teams from that part of the world it seems. Rio Ferdinand's column about his old Manchester United team-mate Jesse Lingard today is well worth a read. He explains why he believes the forward is the right man to help England beat Sweden in their quarter-final tomorrow. ""What makes him so good are the things he has always had, since I first saw him play as a young boy: game intelligence, speed of movement as well as speed of thought, the ability to play one or two-touch football and an eye for goal."" It's all here. Rio Ferdinand and Jesse Lingard in Manchester United training in 2013 Uruguay v France (15:00) The French dressing room is ready and they'll be in their away colours. The big question is in the other dressing room, will Edinson Cavani's shirt hang where the starting line-up sit or with the substitutes? Their two-goal hero against Portugal, will he win his fitness battle? His team could equal a national record by winning five consecutive games at a single World Cup and reach the semi-final for the fifth time in history.

"David Norris is serving a life sentence for Stephen Lawrence's murder One of Stephen Lawrence's killers has settled a claim with the Ministry of Justice after he was attacked in prison. David Norris suffered a broken nose and ribs at HMP Belmarsh in 2011 where he was being held on remand ahead of his trial for murder. He sued for damages - reported to be Â£8,000 - after the assault. Norris and another man, Gary Dobson, were found guilty of murdering the teenager in a racist attack in 1993. The pair were given life sentences in 2012. It's understood that David Norris was awarded around Â£8,000 compensation. He was also entitled to legal aid. But the amount he received in compensation will have counted as his income, therefore it's thought he would have had to pay some of his legal fees himself. In 2017-18, a total of 4,957 offenders received ""special payments"" from HM Prison and Probation Service amounting to more than Â£10m. The previous year, Â£8.7m was paid out to 4,936 offenders. The figures - contained in the HMPPS annual report published last week - do not contain any further detail, but officials say the vast majority of the payments were compensation to prisoners and other offenders. A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: ""We robustly defend all claims and are successful in two-thirds of cases brought against us by prisoners."" During Norris's murder trial, defence lawyer Stephen Batten QC said the prisoner had been attacked several times while on remand in jail. Stephen Lawrence was murdered in 1993 He told jurors at the Old Bailey that on one occasion his client's nose was broken, teeth were knocked out, and four ribs were broken. Stephen, a black British 18-year-old from Plumstead, south-east London,was waiting for a buson the evening of 22 April 1993 when he was stabbed to death. His death sparked a national outrage and probes into police conduct after a number of failures were identified in the handling of the case. Stephen's parents recently called for further investigations into their son's death as they believe he was stabbed by a group of up to six people. But The Met said probesinto Stephen's murder were ""unlikely to progress"" without new information.

"Mr Hill's weight has plummeted since he has fallen ill A British backpacker who got sepsis after a mosquito bite has been stuck in a hospital in Cambodia for more than two months, his family has said. Calvin Hill, 27, from Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, came out of a coma and has been declared fit to fly by hospital staff, according to relatives. They want him home soon amid concern his condition could deteriorate. But his insurer Flexicover said it did not want to put Mr Hill at any ""unnecessary risk"". Mr Hill's mother Tracey said he was found unconscious and ""not breathing properly"" by roommates at a hostel. Shortly before the collapse, he had complained of ""feeling groggy"" after being bitten by mosquitoes, she said. He spent two weeks in a coma, with doctors telling his family to expect the worst. ""He was on life support,"" his mother said. ""On three different occasions we were told he wouldn't make it, and that his liver, kidneys and lungs were failing."" Widow calls for more awareness of sepsis Sepsis: Why can it be so hard to spot? Sepsis: Antibiotics 'not working' Mr Hill pictured in Cambodia before he was taken ill Despite doctors' predictions he has since come out of the coma and is now able to talk and move his limbs. ""It was a miracle,"" Ms Hill said. ""I'm not a religious person, but these things do really happen."" But she said he had been left half of his original weight and he has a hole in his foot. ""The state of Calvin's foot is unbelievable - it's quite a big hole where he had the infection - like the size of a 2p piece,"" she added. ""It has gone black and now the skin has died on it."" Flexicover has agreed to pay for Mr Hill's treatment and fly him to a facility in Thailand before he makes the 14-hour flight back to the UK. ""They are saying he's too unwell to bring home, but he's never going to get better until he comes home,"" his mother said. ""It's such a simple thing to be bitten by a mosquito, but life has changed for us - Calvin will never be the same person."" Flexicover said its emergency team was liaising with the hospital in Cambodia, but would not make any decisions its medical experts thought could complicate Mr Hill's health or recovery. A spokesman added: ""We appreciate that Mr Hill's friends and family are keen for his return to the UK which we will fully support at a time that is medically appropriate. ""We never put our customers in situations which could lead to unnecessary risk."" Calvin Hill was in a coma for two weeks, according to his family The body's reaction to an infection Starts with an infection that can come from anywhere - even a contaminated cut or insect bite If an infection spreads quickly through the body, the immune system launches a massive response This response can have catastrophic effects on the body, leading to septic shock, organ failure and even death Sepsis needs to be spotted and treated quickly, usually with antibiotics, before it spreads Holiday health bill row 'traumatic' Derek meets experts fighting sepsis Met Office issues another weather warning as temperatures drop below freezing Met Office weather maps show exact time temperatures will fall to -6C in Wales Fit and Fed project supports more than 2000 Pembrokeshire kids Food hygiene ratings handed to seven Pembrokeshire establishments Pembrokeshire theatre group starting new term for young people Woman in court accused of manslaughter over paddleboarder deaths LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Nawaz Sharif denies any wrongdoing A Pakistani court has sentenced former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to 10 years in prison on corruption charges related to four luxury London flats. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) court handed down the verdict after a series of delays. His daughter and son-in-law were also convicted. Sharif, who is currently in London and was sentenced in absentia, says the charges are politically motivated and has vowed to return to Pakistan. ""I will go back. I will continue my struggle even in the jail,"" he told reporters. Sharif gave no date for his return. His wife,Kulsoom Nawaz, is receiving treatment in London for cancer. Sharif's lawyer Abdul Rashid Sheikh, speaking in Pakistan, confirmed that they would appeal against the conviction. Nawaz Sharif's Panamagate explained How a font exposed 'fake' documents Profile: Nawaz Sharif Judge Mohammad Bashir ordered Sharif to serve 10 years for owning assets beyond income and one year for not co-operating with the NAB. The sentences are to be served concurrently. Daughter Maryam Nawaz Sharif, also in London, received seven years for abetting a crime and one year for not co-operating - again to run concurrently - while son-in-law Safdar Awan was given a one-year sentence for not co-operating. Sharif and Maryam also received fines of Â£8m ($10.6m) and Â£2m respectively. Supporters of Nawaz Sharif protested against the sentence in Karachi and other cities The case, known as the Avenfield Reference, relates to a number of properties in the UK capital. The Panama Papers leak in 2015revealed several of Sharif's children had links to offshore companies, which were allegedly used to channel funds and buy foreign assets - including luxury flats in Avenfield House, on London's Park Lane. His family, however, insist they legitimately acquired the four properties. As part of the ruling, the court ordered they be confiscated for the federal government. Members of the Pakistani media set up outside the Avenfield House properties, where the family reportedly watched the verdict: Allow Twitter content?

The UK has no formal extradition treaty with Pakistan, butSection 194 of the Extradition Act 2003 allows special extradition arrangements,externalin exceptional circumstances. Fearing unrest, the Pakistani authorities reportedly closed roads around the Federal Judicial Complex in Islamabad and imposed a ban on public assemblies or rallies in the area. The court repeatedly delayed the decision, initially pushing the ruling back after Friday prayers and then several times again, sparking speculation about the wait. However, the judge reportedly said part of the delay was because of the need to photocopy the judgement - which is more than 100 pages long - for both the defence and the prosecution. On Twitter, the hashtag #AvenfieldReference became one of the highest worldwide trends as Pakistanis awaited the verdict. Security was tight outside the court in Islamabad Pakistan holds a general election on 25 July. Sharif is disqualified from standing for his centre-right party, the PML-N. His brotherShahbaz Sharif now heads the PML-N, and is running in the election. Analysis by M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad The ruling comes just a couple of weeks ahead of national elections and is seen by many as the culmination of a process that first saw Sharif disqualified by the Supreme Court last year on questionable grounds. The PML-N party has blamed the military for this process, saying it was conspiring to annihilate it for its criticism of the military's links with militant groups and its policy to improve ties with India. With elections approaching, the party is likely to use Sharif's conviction as proof of this ""conspiracy"" with an aim to preserve its substantial but increasingly jittery bloc of voters. Much will depend on Sharif's next move. If he decides to return to the country he will certainly be jailed, but it may also animate his party's election campaign and earn a sympathy vote. Shahbaz Sharif defended his brother at a press conference following the verdict, calling it ""politically motivated"" and saying the election in July would serve as a people's court that would condemn the decision. The country's Supreme Court ousted Nawaz Sharif from the premiership  in July 2017following the Panama Papers revelations.

"UK house prices rose at the slowest pace since March 2013 in the year to June, according to the country's largest lender, the Halifax. Prices increased by just 1.8%, equalling the pace of growth seen in the year to February. In the last three months, the cost of an average house or flat actually fell by 0.7%, the largest quarterly decline since February 2012. Prices have now fallen in four out of the five last quarters. The typical UK home now costs Â£225,654. However, the Halifax said there was little change in the annual growth figure from last month. ""House prices continue to remain broadly flat, with the annual rate of growth marginally slowing from 1.9% in May to 1.8% in June,"" said Russell Galley, managing director of the Halifax. ""Activity levels, like house price growth, have softened compared with the final months of last year. Mortgage approvals have been in the low range of 63,000 to 67,000 since the start of the year, whilst home sales have remained flat so far this year."" However, he added that the UK jobs market was still growing, and that household incomes were rising in real terms. Other commentators are warning that the likelihood of an interest rate rise next month could dampen house prices still further. ""With buyer interest in decline and further interest rate hikes ahead, we think house price growth will cool a little more over the rest of the year,"" said Hansen Lu at Capital Economics. He estimates that prices in 2018 will rise by 1.5% across the UK, but fall by 3% in London. This interactive content requires an internet connection and a modern browser.

"We're singing for England, Eng-er-land! With England's footballers managing at long last to win a World Cup penalty shootout, supporters of Gareth Southgate's men remain in fine voice as their heroes' Russian sojourn is extended. But what songs are fans hollering before, during and after matches? This England World Cup campaign has had no official record released to mark it,external. As a result, there isn't an obvious tune to belt out along the lines of a World in Motion from 1990, or Three Lions '98 from the World Cup of that year. Not that this has put off the faithful from exercising their vocal chords - and even if their singing often lacks tunefulness, these spirited followers of the Three Lions surely make up for this with sheer exuberance.

It's February 2001 and England have just appointed Sven-Goran Eriksson as their manager after yet another dismal performance at a major football championships. Atop the UK singles charts sit Atomic Kitten with their smash hit Whole Again. But what's that tune I can hear England fans singing during this World Cup? Yes, it's Whole Again - again - but this time with a lyrical twist. Looking back on when we first met, I cannot escape and I cannot forget, Southgate you're the one, you still turn me on, You can bring it home again! The idea that the girl group's saccharine hit record would be revived as a paean to the England manager would have seemed improbable before the tournament kicked off, but World Cup fever can have rather strange symptoms.

A chant that's proved even more popular, so much so that it's arguably the unofficial anthem for fans of the Three Lions in Russia, is England's Going All The Way. To the chorus from September by Earth, Wind & Fire, spirited supporters have changed the lyrics to reflect both the location of the tournament and their conviction that this time it really is going to be England's year. Woah, England are in Russia, Woah, drinking all your vodka, Woah, England's going all the way! And it's not just those out in Russia who've been getting in on the act. Aukestra, a Gateshead bandmade up of mostly autistic musicians,have recorded their own version of the song. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As England have at last got past the hurdle of the first knockout round - for the first time since 2006 - supporters are scenting the possibility of an extended stay in Russia. Who knows, maybe they'll still be there on 15 July, the day of the World Cup Final? This taste for experiencing all Russian culture has to offer was expressed throatily by these fans in the Spartak Stadium. Staying behind tosavour England's triumphant penalty shootout, they belted out a stirring rendition of Please Don't Take Me Home - a chant also adopted by Wales fans during Euro 2016.

Any expression of optimism about England's World Cup chances is likely to be vocalised at some point with a butchering ofThree Lions by Baddiel & Skinner and The Lightning Seeds- as this video of supporters taken after the vanquishing of Colombia on Tuesday night amply demonstrates. And talking of timeless classics, who's to say the England faithful won't return to another old favourite as Southgate's men take on Sweden at the Samara Arena on Saturday? When the two sides met in Kiev during Euro 2012, groups of fans from both nations serenaded each other in the city centre ahead of the match. How much do you know about the players? Mapping England's World Cup squad England 'must make most of opportunity' To the tune of the chorus from Go West by the Village People, a choir of English patriots made it clear how little they thought of Sweden's footballers while at the same time expressing their attraction to Swedish women. As the BBC News website has rules about this kind of thing, we can't show you this encounter - but we can provide you with a sanitised version of the chant. You're poor, but your women - phwoar!(Repeat until hoarse.)

"Katharine, Ellie and the Most Reverend Justin Welby The Church needs to do more to embrace disability and mental health, the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby says, drawing on the experience of two of his daughters. Justin - he insists we use his first name - reveals that Katharine's mental health difficulties and Ellie's learning disabilities, had ""really brought it to the front of [his] mind"". He was speaking to theBBC Ouch podcast, made by the BBC's disability team. Sitting beside his daughters, Ellie, 24, and Katharine, 32, Justin encourages them to speak openly, even if what they say makes uncomfortable listening. He begins by taking Ellie's hand - this is the first time she has spoken publicly. Taking part in a discussion about exclusion with other disabled studio guests, Ellie says: ""The church I go to now, I sit at the back because I don't really feel comfortable. ""They're very friendly in my church, but sometimes I can feel a bit out of place there."" Archbishop hopes 'not to do Queen's funeral' Archbishop criticises grammar schools Ellie also has dyspraxia, which impacts co-ordination, but can be confused with clumsiness. Her disability, not being an obvious physical impairment, is often referred to as invisible. Because of this, she feels her needs are often misunderstood or overlooked. ""I have struggled a lot. People have looked at me and basically - I know the look now - it's literally like, 'You're not disabled, why are you sitting there?' Or, 'Why can't you do this?'. ""I've been discriminated against quite a few times because they don't understand it."" Justin gives Ellie - who confesses she is a ""Daddy's girl"" - a friendly punch on the shoulder to acknowledge that she's made a good point. He, himself, has struggled at times with what he calls ""the black dog"" - a phrase Winston Churchill used to describe episodes of depression. In 1983, the Welbys lost a seven-month-old baby, Johanna, in a car crash. Twelve months later another of his children was critically ill. It has often led him to question his faith. ""There have been moments where it's been a huge test,"" he says. ""You read the Bible and life's not simple."" This video can not be played Archbishop of Canterbury talks with daughters on disability and mental health Does the Archbishop prefer listening to S Club 7 or the Backstreet Boys? Also on the show: Co-writer of The Vicar of Dibley and Spitting Image, Paul Mayhew-Archer, talks about living with Parkinson's 10-year-old Frasier talks about the book he has published about the refugee crisis A full transcript isavailable here.

At boarding school he used chapel time to finish homework, hidden behind the hymn books. The only interesting thing that ever happened, he says, was the ""headmaster falling out of the pulpit"". It was years later, when he worked in Kenya as an oil investor, that he met people with a great connection to God. It was the first step on the path to being ordained in 1989. Katharine has spoken openly about her mental health struggle, suicidal thoughts, and of not being able to confide in her parents about them. She says the Church does not always know how to respond to these struggles. She says people offer to pray for her, but feels this masks important conversations and opportunities to help. ""If your first response is, 'Can I pray for your healing?', then you're not listening,"" she says. ""Because actually - A, you don't need to say to someone you're praying for their healing for God to be able to work, God's bigger than that. And B, it really shuts down the conversation. ""I now actually only let a very few people pray for my healing, because I've had so many really awful experiences."" The most hurtful thing, she says, was when someone prayed for her ""addiction to negative thinking"". ""I'm not addicted to negative thinking, I'm depressed and anxious medically,"" she says. ""It's a chemical thing going on with me, it's not an addiction. And that was really unhelpful. I felt very unsettled by that. ""They're trying to be helpful, but they're not listening. And inclusion and welcome in Church is about so much more than accessibility physically."" Archbishop criticises BBC over Savile Archbishop praises compassion shown in 2017 Many disabled people experience unwanted prayers, often in the street or on public transport. Even the Archbishop has been offered prayers. ""I've had times when people have said, 'Could we pray for you?' And if I wasn't the Archbishop I'd have actually said, 'I'd really prefer that you didn't'. ""But I feel that I can't always say that."" But does he include his own children's disabilities in his prayers? He says he prays for Katharine and her mental health on a daily basis, but for Ellie it is more nuanced. ""I haven't prayed for Ellie,"" he says. ""I haven't talked to Ellie about this [but] we had this discussion once around the [family] table when Ellie wasn't there, because someone had asked me the question."" He asked the family what they thought about praying for Ellie. Turning to Ellie, he says: ""Your younger sister said, 'If God changed Ellie she wouldn't be Ellie, and we love Ellie'. So there's that thing that Ellie's Ellie, she's precious."" He sees Katharine's mental illness as something she's not always had, but Ellie has always had the disability and it's part of her. Ellie, herself, is ambivalent about disability and prayer. ""I have felt a bit like, well if God heals why am I still dyspraxic? Why do I still find it really difficult to do things? But at the same time it doesn't change the way I trust God."" Justin reveals that he needs to compile a list of ""awkward questions"" to ask God ""when I meet Him"". And while he's at it, perhaps he might try to persuade God to watch the sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys, which the Archbishop says he watches and is a ""good way of unwinding"". Justin is conscious the Church needs to be aware of, and embrace, people's differences and needs. Katharine, who also has chronic fatigue syndrome, says she has felt embarrassed at times when she has been unable to stand during services. ""You can feel quite uncomfortable, like people are looking at you, like you're not paying attention or not engaging properly."" She says more flexibility and acceptance is needed. ""If someone goes in and the first week they're there they get tutted at, then they're not going to come back."" More parishes have started to use the phrase ""stand if it's convenient"", Justin says, because, when it comes down to it, ""it doesn't matter tuppence"" how someone worships. ""You do have to go through a process of educating people,"" he says. ""Get rid of the frowns and the tuts."" Justin hopes to find more solutions to these problems when he hosts a conference in July at Lambeth Palace on disability and inclusion. One question he really wants to address is the physical accessibility of churches. Many of the Church of England's 9,000 buildings are ill-equipped and inaccessible, but heritage protection currently trumps accessibility law. ""I find it absolutely extraordinary that disability access comes second to heritage,"" he says. ""I really find that bizarre. Well, that's one way of saying we don't care about you, isn't it?"" Ahead of the conference he has another important event - the christening of Prince Louis on 9 July, which he says is ""very nerve wracking"" but ""a great privilege"". ""You know, if you're at the wedding don't drop the rings and if you're at the baptism don't drop the baby. They're a wonderful family, there's lots of love and it'll be a great occasion.""

"Airbus chief executive Tom Enders says any form of Brexit will be damaging The chief executive of planemaker Airbus has accused the government of having no idea how to take the UK out of the EU without damaging the country. Tom Enders said it ""still has no clue, or at least no consensus, on how to execute Brexit without severe harm"". He was speaking as ministers prepare to meet at the prime minister's country residence toagree a blueprint for the UK's future relationship with the EU. Airbus is taking steps to mitigate the impact of Brexit, Mr Enders said. ""Brexit in any form, soft or hard, light or clean - whatever you call it - will be damaging,"" he added. A government spokesperson said it was confident of reaching a good Brexit deal, adding: ""We do not expect a no-deal scenario to arise."" Mr Enders' comments follow a warning given last month thatAirbus could leave the UKif the country leaves the single market and customs union without a transition deal. At the time, the company said: ""This scenario would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country."" Airbus makes wings for the A320, A330/A340, A350 and A380 passenger planes in the UK and has 14,000 staff. By Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent Tom Enders made his comments in a light-hearted fashion - with a reference to England and France potentially facing each other in the World Cup final thrown in. But the message was deadly serious. The gloves have come off. It seems Airbus has lost patience with what it perceives as government infighting, and is demanding at least a degree of clarity over what the future will bring. In June, the European aerospace giant warned that a hard Brexit could force it to reconsider its investments in the UK. That produced a slap-down from the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who said its ""threats"" were ""completely inappropriate"". In response, Mr Enders pointed out today that if there was one company that made its voice heard, not only in London but in European capitals as well, it was Airbus. No plans to stay quiet then - and so a forthright message was delivered just as ministers gathered ahead of that oh-so-important meeting at Chequers. Airbus said the current planned transition period, due to end in December 2020, was too short for it to make changes to its supply chain. Mr Enders said he had a duty to Airbus shareholders to speak up: ""We have been very clear about what the consequences particularly of a hard Brexit would be."" His comments are the latest warning on Brexit by big business. On Thursday, Jaguar Land Rover - the UK's biggest carmaker -said a ""bad"" Brexit deal could force it to close factoriesand would threaten Â£80bn of investment plans for the UK.

"Shoko Asahara headed the Aum Shinrikyo cult Seven members of the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult which carried out a deadly chemical attack on the Tokyo underground in 1995 have been executed, including cult leader Shoko Asahara. The Sarin attack, Japan's worst terror incident, killed 13 people and injured thousands more. The executions took place at a Tokyo detention house on Friday morning. Japan does not give prior notice of executions, but they were later confirmed by the justice ministry. Shoko Asahara, 63, and his followers were also accused of several other murders and an earlier Sarin gas attack in 1994 which killed eight and left 600 injured. Choking, vomiting, blinded. Tokyo's Sarin attack in pictures Blood initiation and WW3 paranoia. The truth behind Japan's doomsday cult Their execution, by hanging, had been postponed until all those convicted had completed their final appeals. That happened in January. Another six members of the cult are still on death row. Injured victims and the families of those killed have welcomed the executions. ""I reacted calmly... But I did feel the world had become slightly brighter,"" said Atsushi Sakahara, a film director who was caught in the attack. ""It will be impossible to ever forget the incident, but the execution brings a kind of closure."" On 20 March 1995, cult members released the Sarin on the subway in the Japanese capital. They left punctured bags filled with liquid nerve agent on train lines going through Tokyo's political district. Witnesses described noticing the leaking packages and soon afterwards feeling stinging fumes hitting their eyes. The toxin struck victims down in a matter of seconds, leaving them choking and vomiting, some blinded and paralysed. Thirteen people died. Aum Shinrikyo, often shortened to Aum, believed that the end of the world was coming and that those outside the cult would go to hell - unless they were killed by cult members. Cult leader Asahara styled the attack as a ""holy attempt to elevate the doomed souls of this world to a higher spiritual stage"", the Japan Times reports. In the months after, members of the cult made several failed attempts to release hydrogen cyanide in various stations. This video can not be played Witness: Tokyo attack The attack shocked Japan, a country that prided itself on low crime rates and social cohesion. Scores of Aum members have faced trial over the incident and 13 were sentenced to death, including Asahara. Another six are serving life sentences. The cult, whose name means ""supreme truth"", began in the 1980s as a spiritual group mixing Hindu and Buddhist beliefs, later working in elements of apocalyptic Christian prophesies. Shoko Asahara, also known as Chizuo Matsumoto, declared himself to be both Christ and the first ""enlightened one"" since Buddha. Aum Shinrikyo is believed to still have thousands of followers Aum Shinrikyo gained official status as a religious organisation in Japan in 1989 and picked up a sizeable global following. At its peak, Asahara had tens of thousands of followers worldwide. The group gradually became a paranoid doomsday cult, convinced the world was about to end in a global war and that only they would survive. The cult went underground after the 1995 attack, but did not disappear, eventually renaming itself Aleph or Hikari no Wa. Aum Shinrikyo is designated a terrorist organisation in the US and many other countries, but Aleph and Hikari no Wa are both legal in Japan, although designated as ""dangerous religions"" subject to surveillance. It still has followers both in Japan and also worldwide, in particular in some countries of the former Soviet Union. In 2016,police in Russia conducted a number of raidson suspected cult members in Moscow and St Petersburg. Shizue Takahashi, the widow of a subway worker killed in the attack, said she felt Asahara's execution was fitting. ""He of course deserves death,"" she told reporters. ""The execution was processed as it should be... so no tears for me at all."" Japan has executed as many as eight people a year since an effective moratorium ended in 2010. The death penalty is only used for serious cases of murder. Officials do not give advance public notice of executions, and those condemned usually learn they are scheduled to die just a few hours beforehand. Who are Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo?

The chances of being involved in an attack ""are still low"", said police - but people should ""know what to do"". Chief Superintendent Nick Aldworth, of the Metropolitan Police, said: ""We want people to think of this in the same way they do the safety film airlines show before take-off. ""They don't expect anything bad to happen but it is a sensible safety precaution to show people what to do."" What should you do in an attack? Is it safe to go on holiday in Tunisia? The video,which was released in July last yearand has now been watched by seven million people, outlines what to do during a gun attack at a hotel. It shows families and hotel staff fleeing the sound of gunshots, barricading themselves into rooms and being treated as potential suspects by armed police. The clip came two years afterthe terror attack in the beach resort of Sousse, Tunisiain June 2015, when a gunman killed 38 people, including 30 Britons. There is no specific information that British people travelling abroad will be targeted this summer, police said. Security minister Ben Wallace reassured Britons that ""there is no need to be alarmed"" and the majority will never experience an attack while on holiday. But he said it is important to ""remain vigilant"" and watch the video, which could be ""life-saving"". He also suggested holidaymakers ""read the small print on their travel insurance"" to ensure they are covered. It depicts a firearms attack unfolding at a hotel Since the Tunisia attack, the number of UK counter-terrorism police liaison officers working overseas has doubled. There are now 46 such officers working abroad, compared with 23 two years ago. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office urges holidaymakers to readthe travel advice,externalfor the place they are travelling. The video has been translated into 15 different languages by the Association of British Travel Agents to brief holiday representatives as well as hotel and security staff. Police previouslyreleased a similar ""run, hide, tell"" videoadvising what to do during a terror attack on UK soil. Thecurrent threat level for terrorism in the UK is severe,,externalmeaning an attack is highly likely. The Metropolitan Police told people to ""run, hide, tell"" during theLondon Bridge attackin June 2017. In May this year, counter-terrorism policepublished advice,externalfor people attending events in the UK over the summer. Run: If there is a safe route, leave your belongings behind and run away. Insist others go with you, but don't let their indecision slow you down Hide: If you cannot move to safety, then hide somewhere with a solid, physical barrier between you and the attacker. Lock and barricade yourself in, turn your mobile phone to silent and stay quiet Tell: If you are in safe place, call the police with details of the attackers and location.

"The toad has been found only on one mountainside in Malaysia A toad named after the character Gollum in the fantasy novel Lord of the Rings has joined the latest list of animals deemed at risk of extinction. The amphibian lives not in the Misty Mountains, but on a Malaysian mountain. The toad got its name from Gollum, also known as SmÃ©agol, in Tolkien's trilogy because scientists saw similarities between the two. ""Smeagol from Lord of the Rings is a semi-aquatic creature,"" said Dr Chan Kin Onn of the University of Singapore. ""[It has] large eyes, occurs up in the mountains and has long thin limbs. And funnily enough his digits are also extended. These are all characters that this little stream-toad also has."" The toad, which goes by the scientific name,Ansonia smeagol, is classed as Vulnerable on the latestInternational Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN,externalRed List. Wild banana on the brink of extinction 'Living fossil' heading for extinction Wild crops pushed to brink of extinction It lives only in upland streams on the top of a mountain in mainland Malaysia, where it is threatened by the expansion of tourist resorts. Unless something is done to protect its habitat and the water quality of the streams it relies on for survival, it might be lost forever. ""The fact they are so specialised and they have only been found so far on top of the one mountain makes them very unique and very special, but also very vulnerable to potential threats,"" said Chan Kin Onn, who carried out conservation assessments for theIUCN,external. The Carchi Andes toad has been rediscovered Despite the bleak picture for many of the world's amphibians, there is some good news. Four species thought to be extinct or on the brink of extinction have been spotted in Colombia and Ecuador. They include the Carchi Andes toad, which was last seen in Ecuador in September 1984, and feared lost forever. ""While these rediscoveries are encouraging news, the species are still negatively impacted by human-induced threats,"" said Jennifer Luedtke, of the Amphibian Red List at the IUCN. The threats include destruction of habitat, the disease chytridiomycosis, and the effects of a changing climate. Other animals on the latest IUCN RedList include the Mauritian flying fox, a large bat found only on the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius and RÃ©union. The Mauritian flying fox (Pteropus niger) has been subject to culling The population has plummeted after a government-backed culling programme and threats from deforestation, cyclones, illegal hunting and collision with power lines. Another mammal, the Jamaican Hutia, has moved from Vulnerable to Endangered on The IUCN Red List. The secretive, nocturnal animal is rarely seen in the wild and very little is known about it. The Jamaican Hutia is found in rocky, forested areas of Jamaica Hunting pressure and habitat loss and degradation are thought to be behind its decline, as well as hunting by cats, dogs and mongoose, which have been introduced to the island. Queen Alexandra's Birdwing - the world's largest butterfly - remains endangered. Loss of habitat due to cocoa, rubber and oil palm plantations are now the main threats to the insect. Queen Alexandra's Birdwing (Ornithoptera alexandrae) is the world's largest butterfly In the plant world, demand for perfume is threatening a tree behind one of the world's most valuable woods. TheAquilaria malaccensistree is deemed Critically Endangered due to logging and the clearing of forests. These trees are sought-after because some produce a type of wood known as Agarwood when they are infected by a mould. This produces a fragrant, dark resin used in perfume and incense. Agarwood is a fragrant dark resinous wood used in incense, perfume, and small carvings However, it is difficult to tell which wild trees contain agarwood, meaning large numbers of trees can be destroyed. The yellow fatu (Abutilon pitcairnense) is assessed as Extinct in the Wild. The plant was first discovered on Pitcairn Island in the southern Pacific Ocean in 1898. Despite conservation efforts, the last wild surviving plant died in a landslide in 2005. The yellow fatu (Abutilon pitcairnense) is extinct in the wild However, cuttings of the plant had been taken and seeds stored in Kew's Millennium Seed Bank at Wakehurst. This should result in plants being grown on the island once again. ""There's no species left in the native habitat,"" said Sara Barrios of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. ""We will have to propagate this species and do habitat restoration work in order to be able to send this species back and re-plant in the wild."" Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"Tens of thousands of people were told to avoid London Victoria station on Thursday because of delays and cancellations Commuters travelling to London have faced train delays and cancellations for a second day. Tens of thousands of passengersfaced ""nightmare"" overcrowding and long delays on Thursdaydue to a signalling fault in Streatham, south London. Passengers were advised to travel as normal on Friday, but were warned services could be cancelled or delayed. Engineers are yet to work out why a panel providing power to signalling equipment ""burned out"" on Wednesday. Govia Thameslink Railway, (GTR), which operates rail firms Southern, Gatwick Express and Thameslink, said several Southern services into London Victoria were cancelled on Friday morning as a knock-on effect of Thursday's chaos.

"This video can not be played Why the US-China trade war will hit most of our pockets US tariffs on $34bn (Â£25.7bn) of Chinese goods have come into effect, signalling the start of a trade war between the world's two largest economies. The 25% levy came into effect at midnight Washington time. China has retaliated by imposing a similar 25% tariff on 545 US products, also worth a total of $34bn. Beijing accused the US of starting the ""largest trade war in economic history"". ""After the US activated its tariff measures against China, China's measures against the US took effect immediately,"" said Lu Kang, a foreign ministry spokesman. Two companies in Shanghai told the BBC that customs authorities were delaying clearance processes for US imports on Friday. The American tariffs are the result of President Donald Trump's bid to protect US jobs and stop ""unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China"". The White House said it would consult on tariffs on another $16bn of products, which Mr Trump has suggested could come into effect later this month. This video can not be played The US soya farmers taking on Trump Live: Trade war begins Charting the US-China trade battle How a US-China trade war could hurt us all Trade row: What has happened so far?

Tokyo closed 1.1% higher, but Hong Kong fell 0.5% in late trading. Hikaru Sato at Daiwa Securities said markets had already factored in the impact of the first round of tariffs. Mr Trump has already imposed tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels, and started charging levies on the imports of steel and aluminium from the European Union, Mexico and Canada. He has also threatened a 10% levy on an additional $200bn of Chinese goods if Beijng ""refuses to change its practices"". The president upped the stakes on Thursday, saying the amount of goods subject to tariffs could rise to more than $500bn. ""You have another 16 [billion dollars] in two weeks, and then, as you know, we have $200bn in abeyance and then after the $200bn, we have $300bn in abeyance. OK? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300,"" he said. The US tariffs imposed so far would affect the equivalent of 0.6% of global trade and account for 0.1% of global GDP, according to Morgan Stanley in a research note issued before Mr Trump's comments on Thursday.

"Mr Hill's weight has plummeted since he has fallen ill A British backpacker who got sepsis after a mosquito bite has been stuck in a hospital in Cambodia for more than two months, his family has said. Calvin Hill, 27, from Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, came out of a coma and has been declared fit to fly by hospital staff, according to relatives. They want him home soon amid concern his condition could deteriorate. But his insurer Flexicover said it did not want to put Mr Hill at any ""unnecessary risk"". Mr Hill's mother Tracey said he was found unconscious and ""not breathing properly"" by roommates at a hostel. Shortly before the collapse, he had complained of ""feeling groggy"" after being bitten by mosquitoes, she said. He spent two weeks in a coma, with doctors telling his family to expect the worst. ""He was on life support,"" his mother said. ""On three different occasions we were told he wouldn't make it, and that his liver, kidneys and lungs were failing."" Widow calls for more awareness of sepsis Sepsis: Why can it be so hard to spot? Sepsis: Antibiotics 'not working' Mr Hill pictured in Cambodia before he was taken ill Despite doctors' predictions he has since come out of the coma and is now able to talk and move his limbs. ""It was a miracle,"" Ms Hill said. ""I'm not a religious person, but these things do really happen."" But she said he had been left half of his original weight and he has a hole in his foot. ""The state of Calvin's foot is unbelievable - it's quite a big hole where he had the infection - like the size of a 2p piece,"" she added. ""It has gone black and now the skin has died on it."" Flexicover has agreed to pay for Mr Hill's treatment and fly him to a facility in Thailand before he makes the 14-hour flight back to the UK. ""They are saying he's too unwell to bring home, but he's never going to get better until he comes home,"" his mother said. ""It's such a simple thing to be bitten by a mosquito, but life has changed for us - Calvin will never be the same person."" Flexicover said its emergency team was liaising with the hospital in Cambodia, but would not make any decisions its medical experts thought could complicate Mr Hill's health or recovery. A spokesman added: ""We appreciate that Mr Hill's friends and family are keen for his return to the UK which we will fully support at a time that is medically appropriate. ""We never put our customers in situations which could lead to unnecessary risk."" Calvin Hill was in a coma for two weeks, according to his family The body's reaction to an infection Starts with an infection that can come from anywhere - even a contaminated cut or insect bite If an infection spreads quickly through the body, the immune system launches a massive response This response can have catastrophic effects on the body, leading to septic shock, organ failure and even death Sepsis needs to be spotted and treated quickly, usually with antibiotics, before it spreads Holiday health bill row 'traumatic' Derek meets experts fighting sepsis Met Office issues another weather warning as temperatures drop below freezing Met Office weather maps show exact time temperatures will fall to -6C in Wales Fit and Fed project supports more than 2000 Pembrokeshire kids Food hygiene ratings handed to seven Pembrokeshire establishments Pembrokeshire theatre group starting new term for young people Woman in court accused of manslaughter over paddleboarder deaths LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

A court case over sexual abuse at the festival rocked Spanish society this year, leading to protests nationwide. The case involved five men who were sentenced to nine years in prison for sexual abuse of a young festival attendee.

In theory, that means they could be at the festival again this year - though there is no evidence to suggest any plan to attend. Some feminist groups have called on women to wear black and a purple scarf to the opening event, instead of the traditional white and red. Others called for a total boycott. On Wednesday, women in Pamplona dressed in black with head coverings to mimic the traditional red San Fermin scarf But local feminist activists in Pamplona, where the attack took place, have pushed back against the calls for protest. They have asked for their traditional festival to be respected, and said that protests were planned ""without consensus, without any confirmation and without a clear goal"", according to Spanish newspaper El Pais. Animal rights protesters have also staged a protest over the running of the bulls, objecting to their killing in the bullring later in the day. The incident at the heart of the sexual abuse scandal happened at the festival in 2016 - but the court case concluded only months ago.

"The fetch rover would look something like this UK engineers will design a robot that can retrieve rock samples on Mars so they can be sent to Earth for study. The European Space Agency is issuing contracts to industry to spec the technology needed for what will be a complex joint undertaking with the US. Aerospace giant Airbus will scope the concept for a surface ""fetch rover"" at its Stevenage centre north of London. Esa and the American space agency (Nasa) expect to send the sample-return equipment to the Red Planet in 2026. ""It will be a relatively small rover - about 130kg; but the requirements are very demanding,"" said Ben Boyes who will lead the feasibility team at Airbus. ""The vehicle will have to cover large distances using a high degree of autonomy, planning its own path ahead day after day,"" he told BBC News. Esa and Nasa signed a letter of intent in April committing themselves to bringing back pieces of Martian rock and soil to Earth before the end of the next decade. It will be a daring venture that will be done in stages and take several years to complete. Agencies aim to bring back rocks from Mars Europe's Mars rover takes shape Sky At Night: Mars - Red and Dead? Nasa will send a rover to Mars in 2020. This will search for interesting materials, drilling and scooping them from the surface and caching them in canisters. These will be dropped at various depot points. There could be 30-plus of these pen-sized tubes awaiting pick-up. In 2026, the recovery mission will be launched. The Americans will land an ""ascent vehicle"" (essentially a rocket) on Mars together with the European fetch rover. The latter will trundle off to find and gather up the canisters, delivering them back to the rocket. Within roughly 150 days, the space agencies want the canisters lifted off Mars by the ascent vehicle. It will rendezvous with a European orbiter that will take charge of the samples and carry them to Earth. A descent capsule will bring down the precious cargo somewhere over the US. This ""architecture"" is still being worked on, and the technologies have to be shown to be achievable. So, the concepts will likely evolve, as could the timing of the different stages. The agencies might stretch the schedules to spread out what will be a considerable financial cost. Artwork: A rocket would be needed to get the samples off Mars Numerous satellites have been sent to study Mars from above, and seven landers have so far touched down to sift its surface materials. But scientists say some of the biggest questions about the planet - such as whether it has ever hosted life - can only really be answered if rock and soil is brought to Earth. No amount of miniaturisation can give Martian landers the capabilities of the most modern analytical tools now available in research laboratories. Mars Sample Return is the next big thing in planetary science. The Americans have been devising methods to cache samples for later collection Airbus in Stevenage has been selected for the â¬4.45m (Â£3.90m) feasibility work because it is already building Esa's ExoMars rover, which will go to the Red Planet to do in-situ science, starting in 2021. The requirements for the fetch rover will be very different, however. Unlike the 220kg ExoMars robot, the new vehicle will not carry a suite of research instruments; its one job will be to retrieve the cache canisters. ""One of the cool new technologies we want for the rover is to be able to detect the canisters visually from a distance and then drive over and automatically pick them up,"" explained Mr Boyes. ""A robot arm will reach out and lift them into a store on the front of the rover."" Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California is working with American industry to spec its hardware. Esa is issuing contracts to European industry for its own mission elements. As is Esa's normal practice, parallel feasibility studies are done in different companies to find the best hardware solutions. The French-Italian firm Thales Alenia Space (TAS) will also examine aspects of the rover design. Likewise, TAS and Airbus will examine possibilities for the Earth-delivery orbiter. The aim is to have concepts and costings that Europe's space ministers can approve when they meet for their big council gathering at the end of 2019. Speed is of the essence; it takes time to build and test space technology, and the fetch rover needs to be delivered to JPL to be integrated with the ascent vehicle and landing mechanism early in 2025 - if the 2026 launch target is to be met. Once the fetch rover has handed over the sample canisters to the ascent vehicle, it will retire to a safe distance to film the ascent. ""That's going to be very exciting - to record the first ever rocket launch on Mars. It's a nice-to-have at the end of the programme,"" said Mr Boyes. David Parker is director of human and robotic exploration at Esa. He told BBC News: ""There has long been an interest in doing Mars Sample Return, but this is really the first time we've been working with Nasa in such a systematic way; and let's cross our fingers that it all works out. ""I have to say the science is really fantastic. Someone showed me what they could do with 50-year-old Apollo samples brought back from the Moon. So, samples returned from Mars will be used in another 50 years' time.""

"Nessie is often described as resembling a plesiosaur, an extinct prehistoric animal A Scottish government-funded body has a plan in place if the Loch Ness Monster should ever be found. Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) prepared the ""partly serious, partly fun"" code of practice in 2001 amid a period of intense interest in Nessie. This year's interest has been piqued by scientists gathering DNA from the loch, and Scotland's first minister saying she believes there is a monster. SNH said it would ""dust off"" the plan if Nessie was discovered. The code of practice was drawn up to offer protection to new species found in the loch, including a monster. It stipulates that a DNA sample should be taken from any new creature, and then it should be released back into the loch. This photograph of Nessie was taken in 1934 but was later exposed as a hoax The story of the monster can be traced back 1,500 years when Irish missionary St Columba is said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in 565AD. Later, in the 1930s, The Inverness Courier reported the first modern sighting of Nessie. The creature's appearance has been described as resembling a plesiosaur, a creature that died out with the dinosaurs. Nick Halfhide, of SNH, an organisation that promotes Scottish wildlife and natural habitats, said the 17-year-old code of practice remained relevant today. He said: ""There was a lot of activity on the loch at the time about Nessie. ""So, partly serious and partly for a bit of fun, we drew up a contingency plan about how we would help Nessie if and when she was found."" People continue to be fascinated with the mystery of the Loch Ness Monster Nicola Sturgeon was asked if she believed in Nessie in an interview last month The document sets out the need for the monster, and any other new species, to be protected from harm. Mr Halfhide said: ""Some of the lessons we learned then have been relevant when we have reintroduced species like sea eagles, and were used when, a couple of years ago, four new species were found in the sea off the west coast."" The SNH officer added that the plan would need to be updated if Nessie was to be discovered today, and that local communities and businesses along the shores of Loch Ness would need to be consulted . Last month, an international team of scientistsgathered environmental DNA from Loch Ness for analysis. The study expects to confirm what species live in the loch, but also potentially animals not previously recorded in its waters, and even a biological explanation for the monster myth. Nessie would be offered protection if found and not be ridden on as she was in BBC comedy The Goodies Also last month, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said, with a smile, that she believed in the Loch Ness Monsterduring an interview with ITV's Good Morning Britain. Over the years various efforts have tried and failed to find the beast. They have included 1987's Â£1m exploration of the loch called Operation Deepscan. The week-long project consisted of a flotilla of 24 boats, equipped with sonar, which trawled the almost 23-mile (37km) length of the loch, which is about 754ft (230m) at its deepest point. More than 400,000 people are estimated to visit Loch Ness every year Steve Feltham is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records for the longest continuous monster hunting vigil of Loch Ness. He moved from Dorset 27 years ago to look for Nessie. Mr Feltham said: ""This is a world-class mystery. ""If the story promotes tourism then great, and if it doesn't I don't mind either. I will still be here watching and waiting and trying to spot this animal."" Nick Halfhide said SNH's code of practice was drawn up to help protect any new species found in the loch Gary Campbell, keeper of a register of Nessie sightings, said there were, on average, 10 reports a year of something unexplained being spotted in the loch's waters. Given that more than 400,000 people visit Loch Ness every year, Mr Campbell said seeing something was ""pretty rare"". But he said eventually science would reveal a cause for the sightings. He added: ""People have been seeing things in the loch for fifteen hundred years.""

"The toad has been found only on one mountainside in Malaysia A toad named after the character Gollum in the fantasy novel Lord of the Rings has joined the latest list of animals deemed at risk of extinction. The amphibian lives not in the Misty Mountains, but on a Malaysian mountain. The toad got its name from Gollum, also known as SmÃ©agol, in Tolkien's trilogy because scientists saw similarities between the two. ""Smeagol from Lord of the Rings is a semi-aquatic creature,"" said Dr Chan Kin Onn of the University of Singapore. ""[It has] large eyes, occurs up in the mountains and has long thin limbs. And funnily enough his digits are also extended. These are all characters that this little stream-toad also has."" The toad, which goes by the scientific name,Ansonia smeagol, is classed as Vulnerable on the latestInternational Union for Conservation of Nature - IUCN,externalRed List. Wild banana on the brink of extinction 'Living fossil' heading for extinction Wild crops pushed to brink of extinction It lives only in upland streams on the top of a mountain in mainland Malaysia, where it is threatened by the expansion of tourist resorts. Unless something is done to protect its habitat and the water quality of the streams it relies on for survival, it might be lost forever. ""The fact they are so specialised and they have only been found so far on top of the one mountain makes them very unique and very special, but also very vulnerable to potential threats,"" said Chan Kin Onn, who carried out conservation assessments for theIUCN,external. The Carchi Andes toad has been rediscovered Despite the bleak picture for many of the world's amphibians, there is some good news. Four species thought to be extinct or on the brink of extinction have been spotted in Colombia and Ecuador. They include the Carchi Andes toad, which was last seen in Ecuador in September 1984, and feared lost forever. ""While these rediscoveries are encouraging news, the species are still negatively impacted by human-induced threats,"" said Jennifer Luedtke, of the Amphibian Red List at the IUCN. The threats include destruction of habitat, the disease chytridiomycosis, and the effects of a changing climate. Other animals on the latest IUCN RedList include the Mauritian flying fox, a large bat found only on the Indian Ocean islands of Mauritius and RÃ©union. The Mauritian flying fox (Pteropus niger) has been subject to culling The population has plummeted after a government-backed culling programme and threats from deforestation, cyclones, illegal hunting and collision with power lines. Another mammal, the Jamaican Hutia, has moved from Vulnerable to Endangered on The IUCN Red List. The secretive, nocturnal animal is rarely seen in the wild and very little is known about it. The Jamaican Hutia is found in rocky, forested areas of Jamaica Hunting pressure and habitat loss and degradation are thought to be behind its decline, as well as hunting by cats, dogs and mongoose, which have been introduced to the island. Queen Alexandra's Birdwing - the world's largest butterfly - remains endangered. Loss of habitat due to cocoa, rubber and oil palm plantations are now the main threats to the insect. Queen Alexandra's Birdwing (Ornithoptera alexandrae) is the world's largest butterfly In the plant world, demand for perfume is threatening a tree behind one of the world's most valuable woods. TheAquilaria malaccensistree is deemed Critically Endangered due to logging and the clearing of forests. These trees are sought-after because some produce a type of wood known as Agarwood when they are infected by a mould. This produces a fragrant, dark resin used in perfume and incense. Agarwood is a fragrant dark resinous wood used in incense, perfume, and small carvings However, it is difficult to tell which wild trees contain agarwood, meaning large numbers of trees can be destroyed. The yellow fatu (Abutilon pitcairnense) is assessed as Extinct in the Wild. The plant was first discovered on Pitcairn Island in the southern Pacific Ocean in 1898. Despite conservation efforts, the last wild surviving plant died in a landslide in 2005. The yellow fatu (Abutilon pitcairnense) is extinct in the wild However, cuttings of the plant had been taken and seeds stored in Kew's Millennium Seed Bank at Wakehurst. This should result in plants being grown on the island once again. ""There's no species left in the native habitat,"" said Sara Barrios of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. ""We will have to propagate this species and do habitat restoration work in order to be able to send this species back and re-plant in the wild."" Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"This video can not be played Children are baffled by Instagram and YouTube terms Children may be signing up to apps with terms and conditions that only university students can understand, BBC research reveals. The minimum age to use apps such as YouTube and Facebook is 13. As well as using complex language, the BBC found that reading the terms of 15 popular sites would take almost nine hours in total. Firms could be breaching European data rules, which require them to clearly spell out how they use personal data. In response to the findings, MP Damien Collins accused tech companies of using terms and conditions to ""exploit"" users' data. But several companies responded by saying they were working on improving the legibility of their legal documents by introducing easy-to-read summaries. Tech giants and your data: Nine things you didn't know Facebook tracks you even if you don't have an account LinkedIn scans your private messages Tinder shares your data with other dating sites When using websites or apps such as Facebook, YouTube and Instagram, users must sign up to the company's terms and conditions, which include agreeing to be bound by a privacy policy. According to Ofcom, more than eight in 10 children aged between five and 15 used YouTube last year. The BBC carried out a readability test to work out the education level required to understand these policies. All 15 sites had policies that were written at a university reading level, and were more complicated than Charles Dickens' A Tale of Two Cities. This is despite the fact that  YouTube, Twitter, Snapchat, Google, Instagram, Facebook, Reddit and Apple can all be used by children aged 13. Mr Collins, who chairs the House of Commons Culture Committee, criticised the use of complex and lengthy terms. ""It's not enough to print a load of gobbledegook, that you know no one will ever read, and say: 'Aha, we've got the right to do it because it says so in here',"" he said. ""You have got to make sure people are fully informed of what their rights are and why their data is being given away. ""We should make it a requirement of the tech companies to spell out in plain English what their users can do if they want to protect some of their data."" The findings come as the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), which regulates how companies deal with personal data, says it plans to develop an Age Appropriate Design Code. It says that this would mean those who design online services used by children, ""know what we expect from them"". However, there may also be further consequences for companies who do not clearly explain how they use users' data. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May, says that companies must be clear about how they use personal data. Article 12 says that communications to individuals about their data must be ""concise, transparent, intelligible and [in an] easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child"". Ailidh Callander, legal officer at Privacy International, a charity, says that companies have a legal responsibility to make policies concise and clear. ""The fact that privacy notices are still so hard to read raises concerns about whether these companies are complying with the law,"" she says. As well as being hard to understand, some of the terms and policies take almost an hour to read. Spotify had the longest combined policies at 13,000 words, just shy of Shakespeare's shortest play Comedy of Errors. Their terms would take an average person 53 minutes to read without breaks. Netflix had the shortest combined documents, while Google had the shortest privacy policy - yet even this would take the average reader eight minutes to read. To read all of the documents we looked at would take the average reader 533 minutes - or around nine hours, without breaks. Several of the companies that responded to the BBC emphasised that they were constantly working on improving the legibility of their legal documents. Google, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon and Wikipedia all pointed to their bespoke privacy centres or easy-to-read summaries, where users can find out more about how their data is used. Google, Twitter and Facebook said additional controls for limiting how user data is shared were easily accessible within their apps. However Google maintained that the use of certain terminology in its legal documents was unavoidable, and Netflix said it was ""legally bound to include certain wording and information"". Tech giants and your data: nine things you didn't know Our readability score takes an average of five different common readability measures. We analysed the policies as they stood on 15 June 2018.

"Shoko Asahara headed the Aum Shinrikyo cult Seven members of the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult which carried out a deadly chemical attack on the Tokyo underground in 1995 have been executed, including cult leader Shoko Asahara. The Sarin attack, Japan's worst terror incident, killed 13 people and injured thousands more. The executions took place at a Tokyo detention house on Friday morning. Japan does not give prior notice of executions, but they were later confirmed by the justice ministry. Shoko Asahara, 63, and his followers were also accused of several other murders and an earlier Sarin gas attack in 1994 which killed eight and left 600 injured. Choking, vomiting, blinded. Tokyo's Sarin attack in pictures Blood initiation and WW3 paranoia. The truth behind Japan's doomsday cult Their execution, by hanging, had been postponed until all those convicted had completed their final appeals. That happened in January. Another six members of the cult are still on death row. Injured victims and the families of those killed have welcomed the executions. ""I reacted calmly... But I did feel the world had become slightly brighter,"" said Atsushi Sakahara, a film director who was caught in the attack. ""It will be impossible to ever forget the incident, but the execution brings a kind of closure."" On 20 March 1995, cult members released the Sarin on the subway in the Japanese capital. They left punctured bags filled with liquid nerve agent on train lines going through Tokyo's political district. Witnesses described noticing the leaking packages and soon afterwards feeling stinging fumes hitting their eyes. The toxin struck victims down in a matter of seconds, leaving them choking and vomiting, some blinded and paralysed. Thirteen people died. Aum Shinrikyo, often shortened to Aum, believed that the end of the world was coming and that those outside the cult would go to hell - unless they were killed by cult members. Cult leader Asahara styled the attack as a ""holy attempt to elevate the doomed souls of this world to a higher spiritual stage"", the Japan Times reports. In the months after, members of the cult made several failed attempts to release hydrogen cyanide in various stations. This video can not be played Witness: Tokyo attack The attack shocked Japan, a country that prided itself on low crime rates and social cohesion. Scores of Aum members have faced trial over the incident and 13 were sentenced to death, including Asahara. Another six are serving life sentences. The cult, whose name means ""supreme truth"", began in the 1980s as a spiritual group mixing Hindu and Buddhist beliefs, later working in elements of apocalyptic Christian prophesies. Shoko Asahara, also known as Chizuo Matsumoto, declared himself to be both Christ and the first ""enlightened one"" since Buddha. Aum Shinrikyo is believed to still have thousands of followers Aum Shinrikyo gained official status as a religious organisation in Japan in 1989 and picked up a sizeable global following. At its peak, Asahara had tens of thousands of followers worldwide. The group gradually became a paranoid doomsday cult, convinced the world was about to end in a global war and that only they would survive. The cult went underground after the 1995 attack, but did not disappear, eventually renaming itself Aleph or Hikari no Wa. Aum Shinrikyo is designated a terrorist organisation in the US and many other countries, but Aleph and Hikari no Wa are both legal in Japan, although designated as ""dangerous religions"" subject to surveillance. It still has followers both in Japan and also worldwide, in particular in some countries of the former Soviet Union. In 2016,police in Russia conducted a number of raidson suspected cult members in Moscow and St Petersburg. Shizue Takahashi, the widow of a subway worker killed in the attack, said she felt Asahara's execution was fitting. ""He of course deserves death,"" she told reporters. ""The execution was processed as it should be... so no tears for me at all."" Japan has executed as many as eight people a year since an effective moratorium ended in 2010. The death penalty is only used for serious cases of murder. Officials do not give advance public notice of executions, and those condemned usually learn they are scheduled to die just a few hours beforehand. Who are Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo?

"This video can not be played Why the US-China trade war will hit most of our pockets US tariffs on $34bn (Â£25.7bn) of Chinese goods have come into effect, signalling the start of a trade war between the world's two largest economies. The 25% levy came into effect at midnight Washington time. China has retaliated by imposing a similar 25% tariff on 545 US products, also worth a total of $34bn. Beijing accused the US of starting the ""largest trade war in economic history"". ""After the US activated its tariff measures against China, China's measures against the US took effect immediately,"" said Lu Kang, a foreign ministry spokesman. Two companies in Shanghai told the BBC that customs authorities were delaying clearance processes for US imports on Friday. The American tariffs are the result of President Donald Trump's bid to protect US jobs and stop ""unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China"". The White House said it would consult on tariffs on another $16bn of products, which Mr Trump has suggested could come into effect later this month. This video can not be played The US soya farmers taking on Trump Live: Trade war begins Charting the US-China trade battle How a US-China trade war could hurt us all Trade row: What has happened so far? The imposition of the tariffs had little impact on Asian stock markets. The Shanghai Composite closed 0.5% higher, but ended the week 3.5% lower - its seventh consecutive week of losses. Tokyo closed 1.1% higher, but Hong Kong fell 0.5% in late trading. Hikaru Sato at Daiwa Securities said markets had already factored in the impact of the first round of tariffs. Mr Trump has already imposed tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels, and started charging levies on the imports of steel and aluminium from the European Union, Mexico and Canada. He has also threatened a 10% levy on an additional $200bn of Chinese goods if Beijng ""refuses to change its practices"". The president upped the stakes on Thursday, saying the amount of goods subject to tariffs could rise to more than $500bn. ""You have another 16 [billion dollars] in two weeks, and then, as you know, we have $200bn in abeyance and then after the $200bn, we have $300bn in abeyance. OK? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300,"" he said. The US tariffs imposed so far would affect the equivalent of 0.6% of global trade and account for 0.1% of global GDP, according to Morgan Stanley in a research note issued before Mr Trump's comments on Thursday. Analysts are also concerned about the impact on others in the supply chain and about an escalation of tensions between the US and China in general. Please upgrade your browser to view this content.

He explains why he believes the forward is the right man to help England beat Sweden in their quarter-final tomorrow. ""What makes him so good are the things he has always had, since I first saw him play as a young boy: game intelligence, speed of movement as well as speed of thought, the ability to play one or two-touch football and an eye for goal."" It's all here. Rio Ferdinand and Jesse Lingard in Manchester United training in 2013 Uruguay v France (15:00) The French dressing room is ready and they'll be in their away colours. The big question is in the other dressing room, will Edinson Cavani's shirt hang where the starting line-up sit or with the substitutes?

"The tapestry shows a soldier being killed by an arrow in his eye, which could be King Harold The Bayeux Tapestry is set to return to the UK in 2022, after nearly 1,000 years. The tapestry - said to have been created by nuns in England in the 11th Century - depicts the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. An Anglo-French agreement would see it displayed to the British public at locations yet to be announced. The two countries will also work together to produce a full English translation of the tapestry. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""The Bayeux Tapestry is a world treasure and a symbol of the deep ties between Britain and France. ""We are incredibly excited about the potential of the loan, to enhance further the bonds that tie us to our neighbours across the water."" Bayeux Tapestry gets new ending New theory for Bayeux Tapestry Alderney Tapestry heads to Battle The 70-metre long tapestry tells the story of the future William I's conquest of England, culminating in the Battle of Hastings and the defeat of Harold in 1066. It is on permanent display at the museum in Bayeux in Normandy but has previously been shown at other locations across France. The tapestry could come to the UK while the museum undergoes refurbishment. The Bayeux Tapestry is 70m (230ft) long It is first referenced in an inventory from Bayeux Cathedral in 1476. According to Reading Museum, which houses a replica of the tapestry,,externalit was ""probably commissioned"" in the 1070s by the half-brother of William the Conqueror - Bishop Odo of Bayeux. Some say it was created by teams of nuns across England - not France - possibly in Canterbury, Kent. In 2012,a PhD researcher at the University of Manchestersaid the artwork's needlework was ""consistent throughout"", suggesting one group of specialist embroiderers worked on it, in the same place at the same time. The tapestry opens with Harold, the Earl of Wessex, promising William of Normandy that he would support William's quest to inherit the throne of England, on the death of King Edward The story then moves on to Edward's funeral, and Harold breaking his promise by accepting the crown. On hearing the news, William decides to invade England and take the throne he believes to be his. His army lands in East Sussex, and the rivals meet at the Battle of Hastings which ends in Harold's death. It was a turning point in history as it ended the Anglo-Saxons's long reign of more than 600 years. Harold is crowned king after the death of Edward the Confessor Napoleon put the tapestry on display in Paris in 1804, while he was planning an invasion of England. It was then exhibited in Paris for the second time in 1944, during World War II, before it was returned to Bayeux. This agreement comes after previous attempts to bring the tapestry to Britain failed. One request is thought to have been made ahead of the Queen's Coronation in 1953, while another was made for the 900th anniversary of the Battle of Hastings, in 1966.

""It will be impossible to ever forget the incident, but the execution brings a kind of closure."" On 20 March 1995, cult members released the Sarin on the subway in the Japanese capital. They left punctured bags filled with liquid nerve agent on train lines going through Tokyo's political district. Witnesses described noticing the leaking packages and soon afterwards feeling stinging fumes hitting their eyes. The toxin struck victims down in a matter of seconds, leaving them choking and vomiting, some blinded and paralysed. Thirteen people died. Aum Shinrikyo, often shortened to Aum, believed that the end of the world was coming and that those outside the cult would go to hell - unless they were killed by cult members. Cult leader Asahara styled the attack as a ""holy attempt to elevate the doomed souls of this world to a higher spiritual stage"", the Japan Times reports. In the months after, members of the cult made several failed attempts to release hydrogen cyanide in various stations. This video can not be played Witness: Tokyo attack The attack shocked Japan, a country that prided itself on low crime rates and social cohesion. Scores of Aum members have faced trial over the incident and 13 were sentenced to death, including Asahara. Another six are serving life sentences. The cult, whose name means ""supreme truth"", began in the 1980s as a spiritual group mixing Hindu and Buddhist beliefs, later working in elements of apocalyptic Christian prophesies. Shoko Asahara, also known as Chizuo Matsumoto, declared himself to be both Christ and the first ""enlightened one"" since Buddha. Aum Shinrikyo is believed to still have thousands of followers Aum Shinrikyo gained official status as a religious organisation in Japan in 1989 and picked up a sizeable global following. At its peak, Asahara had tens of thousands of followers worldwide. The group gradually became a paranoid doomsday cult, convinced the world was about to end in a global war and that only they would survive. The cult went underground after the 1995 attack, but did not disappear, eventually renaming itself Aleph or Hikari no Wa. Aum Shinrikyo is designated a terrorist organisation in the US and many other countries, but Aleph and Hikari no Wa are both legal in Japan, although designated as ""dangerous religions"" subject to surveillance. It still has followers both in Japan and also worldwide, in particular in some countries of the former Soviet Union. In 2016,police in Russia conducted a number of raidson suspected cult members in Moscow and St Petersburg. Shizue Takahashi, the widow of a subway worker killed in the attack, said she felt Asahara's execution was fitting. ""He of course deserves death,"" she told reporters. ""The execution was processed as it should be... so no tears for me at all."" Japan has executed as many as eight people a year since an effective moratorium ended in 2010. The death penalty is only used for serious cases of murder. Officials do not give advance public notice of executions, and those condemned usually learn they are scheduled to die just a few hours beforehand. Who are Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo?

"This video can not be played Why the US-China trade war will hit most of our pockets US tariffs on $34bn (Â£25.7bn) of Chinese goods have come into effect, signalling the start of a trade war between the world's two largest economies. The 25% levy came into effect at midnight Washington time. China has retaliated by imposing a similar 25% tariff on 545 US products, also worth a total of $34bn. Beijing accused the US of starting the ""largest trade war in economic history"". ""After the US activated its tariff measures against China, China's measures against the US took effect immediately,"" said Lu Kang, a foreign ministry spokesman. Two companies in Shanghai told the BBC that customs authorities were delaying clearance processes for US imports on Friday. The American tariffs are the result of President Donald Trump's bid to protect US jobs and stop ""unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China"". The White House said it would consult on tariffs on another $16bn of products, which Mr Trump has suggested could come into effect later this month. This video can not be played The US soya farmers taking on Trump Live: Trade war begins Charting the US-China trade battle How a US-China trade war could hurt us all Trade row: What has happened so far? The imposition of the tariffs had little impact on Asian stock markets. The Shanghai Composite closed 0.5% higher, but ended the week 3.5% lower - its seventh consecutive week of losses. Tokyo closed 1.1% higher, but Hong Kong fell 0.5% in late trading. Hikaru Sato at Daiwa Securities said markets had already factored in the impact of the first round of tariffs. Mr Trump has already imposed tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels, and started charging levies on the imports of steel and aluminium from the European Union, Mexico and Canada. He has also threatened a 10% levy on an additional $200bn of Chinese goods if Beijng ""refuses to change its practices"". The president upped the stakes on Thursday, saying the amount of goods subject to tariffs could rise to more than $500bn. ""You have another 16 [billion dollars] in two weeks, and then, as you know, we have $200bn in abeyance and then after the $200bn, we have $300bn in abeyance. OK? So we have 50 plus 200 plus almost 300,"" he said. The US tariffs imposed so far would affect the equivalent of 0.6% of global trade and account for 0.1% of global GDP, according to Morgan Stanley in a research note issued before Mr Trump's comments on Thursday. Analysts are also concerned about the impact on others in the supply chain and about an escalation of tensions between the US and China in general. Please upgrade your browser to view this content.

"Tens of thousands of people were told to avoid London Victoria station on Thursday because of delays and cancellations Commuters travelling to London have faced train delays and cancellations for a second day. Tens of thousands of passengersfaced ""nightmare"" overcrowding and long delays on Thursdaydue to a signalling fault in Streatham, south London. Passengers were advised to travel as normal on Friday, but were warned services could be cancelled or delayed. Engineers are yet to work out why a panel providing power to signalling equipment ""burned out"" on Wednesday. Govia Thameslink Railway, (GTR), which operates rail firms Southern, Gatwick Express and Thameslink, said several Southern services into London Victoria were cancelled on Friday morning as a knock-on effect of Thursday's chaos. Some Southern trains also ran with fewer carriages than normal, while there were minor disruptions to Thameslink services, a spokesman said. He said Gatwick Express trains ran a good service. No trains at Oxford for fortnight as works start Govia Thameslink 'could lose franchise' over rail chaos Rail firm's 'sincere apology' paper ad On Thursday many passengers with tickets to or from London Victoria were advisednot to travel to the capital at all,external. Victoria is the second busiest station in Great Britain. About 210,000 passengers use the station each day, according to average figures collected for the Office of Rail and Road (ORR) in 2016-17. This video can not be played Commuters face massive disruption due to signal failure The signalling system, which went down when a power supply failed in the Streatham Common area on Wednesday night, was ""back in correct working order"", said National Rail. But it had warned there would be a knock-on effect on Friday morning. Train carriages were ""not in the correct places"", and matters had been ""complicated"" by the displacement of crew members. On Thursday, commuters complained of being ""sardined"" into overcrowded trains, while others missed flights from Gatwick. The airport told customers due to fly on Friday to leave extra time for their journey to the terminal. John Halsall, managing director of Network Rail's South East route, apologised for Thursday's chaos and said the company had failed in its job to provide ""a reliable railway for train operators and the travelling public"". On Friday, a Network Rail spokesman said the signalling equipment failed after a switching panel designed to provide back-up power was found burned out, and the room it was in was ""full of smoke"". He said: ""Our team worked through the night to bypass it, and had the signalling system working again by mid-morning. ""Unfortunately, that fix then failed before we could run trains and a new design had to be found. That is why it took so long."" Read the full statement here,external. Network Rail said it was now investigating to prevent similar faults happening again. Southern encouraged people whose trains are delayed by 15 minutes or moreto claim compensation,external.

"The couple, Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley, fell ill on Saturday The couple poisoned by Novichok were exposed to the substance after handling a contaminated item, police say. Charlie Rowley, 45, and Dawn Sturgess, 44, collapsed at a flat in Amesbury, Wiltshire, on Saturday and remain critically ill. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the nerve agent was the same as that used on ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in March. Russia said Theresa May's government was subjecting them ""to hell"". Mr Javid accused Russia of using Britain as a ""dumping ground for poison"" after the second incident involving the nerve agent. This video can not be played Footage shows Ms Sturgess in Salisbury days before her collapse But a Russian Embassy spokesman said all allegations of the country's involvement were ""merely speculative"". The Met said there were around 100 detectives from the Counter Terrorism Network working alongside Wiltshire Police on the ""major incident"". Salisbury District Hospital's chief executive Cara Charles-Barks said the couple are ""extremely unwell"" and remain in a critical condition. Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Salisbury reacts with shock and worry after Novichok case Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said that because the highest concentration of Novichok was found on the couple's hands, police believe the item they handled could be a container or receptacle that was used to carry the nerve agent. He said the most likely hypothesis was the Novichok was left over from an item discarded after the attack on the Skripals. Toxicologist Prof Alastair Hay said it would be possible for Novichok to still be dangerous four months after first use. Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said there was nothing in the couple's background to suggest the pair had been targeted. The BBC's home affairs correspondent June Kelly said it has been suggested the item ""could be a vial or syringe because of the couple's lifestyle"". Chemical weapons expert Richard Guthrie said it was possible that the couple came across the Novichok after it had been disposed of ""in a haphazard way"". Debbie Stark, south west deputy director from Public Health England said the risk to the public of further poisoning incidents ""remains low"". Police have set upa helpline,externalfor anyone who needs further advice: 0800 092 0410 or 0207 158 0124. This video can not be played Sajid Javid calls on Russia to explain ""exactly what has gone on"" following Amesbury incident In a statement to MPs, Mr Javid said: ""It is now time that the Russian state comes forward and explains exactly what has gone on."" He said the ""strong working assumption"" was that the couple came into contact with Novichok in a location which had not been cleaned up following the Skripal poisoning in nearby Salisbury. ""It is completely unacceptable for our people to be either deliberate or accidental targets, or for our streets, our parks, our towns, to be dumping grounds for poison,"" he added. He said he could not rule out the possibility that the Novichok found in Amesbury was from the same batch used in the Salisbury attack and that scientists would be ""looking into that"". Earlier, Mrs May said it was ""deeply disturbing"" to see two more people exposed to Novichok in the UK, and the police would leave ""no stone unturned in their investigation"". Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said British streets must not be allowed to become ""killing fields for state actors"". But the spokesman for the Russian Embassy said the government had yet to contact them about the incident He added: ""Instead of genuine co-operation, London is doing everything possible to muddy the waters, to confuse and frighten its own citizens. ""One can only guess what the reasons behind such a line of behaviour are."" This video can not be played Sam Hobson, friend of Charlie Rowley: ""His eyes were redâ¦ he was sweating and dribbling"" Ms Sturgess' father Stephen, 65, told The Times the family found out from TV news that she may have been poisoned by a nerve agent. ""We heard from the hospital on Sunday, and we gave them Dawn's GP details but we didn't hear anything from the police. ""We know as much as the next person in the street. We actually called the police station for information."" Charlie Rowley's older brother Matthew said security measures meant he couldn't get through to the hospital despite ringing several times. ""He's my younger brother, I love him to bits,"" he said. ""I don't want anything to happen to him, and yet it has. It's heartbreaking."" Natalie Smyth from Amesbury said: ""I'm furious that it took four days for them [the police] to even mention it could have been Novichok. ""Were they lying to us about it being drug related?"" Although the risk to the public remains low, Public Health England (PHE) have advised those who were in the areas from 22:00 BST on Friday and which are now cordoned off to wash their clothes and wipe down personal items. Clothing that cannot be washed should be double-bagged and owners should await ""further instructions"". Debbie Stark from PHE said areas of Salisbury that have already been cleaned as part of the Skripal incident - such as the Maltings shopping centre - are safe. Residents at John Baker House, the supported housing where Ms Sturgess is believed to have been staying, have been evacuated and told they will have to be rehoused. The police warned members of the public against picking up unfamiliar items. Sites in Amesbury and Salisbury believed to have been visited by the couple before they fell ill have been cordoned off as a precaution, including a church, park and chemist. The revelation that two more people have been exposed to the nerve agent Novichock has shocked people in Salisbury. Residents have experienced months of disruption and anxiety since the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March. Now many are wondering whether, despite a clean-up operation, their city is safe? Read more here There have been accusations from Russia that the UK is persecuting the country and failing to co-operate. The Skripal case is still shrouded in darkness, says Russia spokeswoman Maria Zakharova, as she called on Theresa May's government to stop the ""dirty"" games. She said Russia has sent ""dozens of offers of co-operation"" and she was confident London would have to apologise to her country. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Police search John Baker House where victim Dawn Sturgess lives Police in hazmat suits have been searching a Salisbury hostel as they try to find the item contaminated with a nerve agent that poisoned a couple. Investigators entered John Baker House, where one of the victims, Dawn Sturgess, 44, lives, on Friday afternoon. Police believe Charlie Rowley, 45, and Ms Sturgess were exposed toNovichokafter handling the unknown object. The pair remain in a critical condition in hospital. Police said the ""unique challenges"" surrounding the operation meant ""police activity is expected to take weeks and months to complete"". They added they are looking through more than 1,300 hours of CCTV footage to help them find the source of the contamination. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said no objects have been collected for testing yet. Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far Salisbury reacts to fresh case Conspiracy theories abound in Russia media What are Novichok nerve agents? A government scientist told BBC News that the contaminated item was unlikely to have been left in the open before the couple touched it. Novichok can be degraded by rainwater and sunlight over time - meaning it was probably discovered by the pair in a contained space, the government source added. But other experts have said the nerve agent was designed to be persistent and not break down. Speaking to BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, the government scientist also said the Novichok was so toxic it was able to pass through the skin and did not need to be ingested. The source added that Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess's symptoms were the same as those shown by Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia. They were both poisoned with Novichok in nearby Salisbury in March. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley fell ill on Saturday in Amesbury, Wiltshire The Amesbury investigation is entering a new phase. Scientists and chemical weapons experts atPorton Downin Wiltshire are bracing themselves for an influx of countless objects all needing forensic analysis. Investigators, led by the Met Police's counter-terrorism detectives, are working on the basis that the pair - now critically ill from Novichok poisoning - handled a contaminated item that caught their interest. They need to find it. The item - or possibly items - are thought to be something found and touched by the pair, possibly something as innocuous as a perfume bottle or other luxury toiletry. The search for this ""source item"" is likely to be extensive, painstaking and could last through the summer. This video can not be played Footage shows Ms Sturgess in Salisbury days before her collapse Ms Sturgess is understood to be a mother of three who lives at the Salisbury hostel, which offers supported accommodation. A close friend of Ms Sturgess's, who also lived at John Baker House, described her as a ""loving and caring person"". Mr Rowley's brother Matthew told the BBC: ""He's a lovely guy and would do anything for you. He's a sweetheart basically."" This video can not be played Charlie Rowley's brother Matthew describes how he found out what had happened On Saturday, paramedics were called twice to a flat in Muggleton Road in Amesbury - first at 11:00 BST after Ms Sturgess collapsed. Medics attended again several hours later, after Mr Rowley also fell ill. A friend of the couple, Sam Hobson, said after Ms Sturgess was taken to hospital, he and Mr Rowley went to a chemist in Amesbury to collect a prescription before going to an event at a nearby Baptist church. The two men returned to the flat and planned to visit the hospital but Mr Rowley ""started feeling really hot and sweaty"" and began ""acting all funny"", Mr Hobson, 29, said. ""He was rocking against the wall and his eyes were red, pinpricked, and he started sweating loads and dribbling, so I had to phone an ambulance for him,"" said Mr Hobson. This video can not be played Sam Hobson, a friend of one of the Amesbury poisoning victims, describes the symptoms he witnessed Based on information from a friend and items found at the flat, Wiltshire Police initially thought the pair had fallen ill after using a contaminated batch of heroin or crack cocaine. But after tests at the government's military research facility at Porton Down, a major incident was declared and it was confirmed they had been exposed to Novichok. Police do not believe Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess were victims of a targeted attack, but instead came into contact with the substance in Amesbury or Salisbury. On Friday night, police revealed more details around the victim's movements. They said the pair were both at John Baker House on Friday lunchtime, before visiting a number of shops in Salisbury and heading to Queen Elizabeth Gardens. They returned to the hostel at around 16:20 BST before heading to Amesbury by bus at around 22:30. At midday on Friday, there was an increased police presence in Muggleton Road - where the couple were found - with fire engines also attending Police believe they were there until emergency services were called on Saturday. Five areas have been cordoned off: Muggleton Road, Boots pharmacy and the Baptist church in Amesbury; John Baker House and Queen Elizabeth Gardens in Salisbury. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the ""strong working assumption"" was that the pair came into contact with Novichok in a location which had not been cleaned up following the Skripal poisoning. Assistant Commissioner of Specialist Operations Neil Basu said that ""around 100 detectives"" from the Counter Terrorism Policing Network were working on the investigation. Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said the latest incident was a result of a ""war crime"" by Russia - and that using a nerve agent in a civilian area was a ""vile act of terror"". Mr Javid called on Russia to explain ""exactly what has gone on"". The home secretary added he was ""comfortable"" the ""exact same nerve agent"" had been used in both the Salisbury and Amesbury poisonings - but added it was not yet known if they were from the same batch. But Russia - which denies involvement in either incident - said the UK was trying to ""muddy the waters"" and ""intimidate its own citizens"". Allow Twitter content?

"Thai divers carry supplies as officials prepare for a daring rescue In the bleak hours when there was no news of the missing boys, a new community emerged on the side of this mountain. Divers, cavers, and soldiers all trudged purposefully through the thick mud, focused on their own small role in what felt like a national effort. Now that the 12 boys and their football coach have been located, the mood in the camp has transformed. It is a place of hope, energy, and purpose. Yo Sato is 27. He grew up in east London but returned to Thailand to teach English. He drove for hours to get here to offer his service as a translator for the local police. Yo Sato is acting as a translator for the police ""I'm speechless, I've got goose-bumps right now,"" he says. ""Seeing those kids alive just changes people's mood. People are working so hard, it's so tiring. But now, they are all smiling. And seeing the British and the Thai working together, it's just the best thing ever."" Classmates of the young footballers come to the mouth of the cave to show their support. At the spot where their friends last glimpsed the outside world, they sing for them. ""Believe in God. Only belief can move a mountain,"" go the lyrics of the song they sing. Emergency teams are preparing to help bring the boys to safety Looking on, just a few metres away, are the rescue teams, planning how they can enter this particular mountain and bring the boys to safety. Everywhere you turn, small squadrons of men and women in matching colours huddle and nod in agreement. They are surrounded on every side by scores of international news teams who have filled this corner of a usually tranquil forest. The rescue effort is creating headlines round the world It is the Thai Navy Seals the journalists want to talk to the most. Videos of the boys posted to Facebook by the Seals have delighted and amazed people at the camp. There are other, regular soldiers too who don't get the same star treatment. But you feel their presence. Every now and then they emerge from their makeshift barracks and stand arm in arm, in a human chain. Their role is to block the media's path when heavy machinery is brought in, or when the medical teams are rehearsing for final stages of a rescue. They can be seen carrying empty stretchers out from the entrance to the cave and placed in ambulances which speed off into the distance. Thai soldiers are helping to maintain order outside the cave It is still not clear when the soldiers will be called upon for real. Until that time, an army of volunteers needs to be fed. Servers in yellow uniforms scoop steaming rice and fish curry on to plates for a never-ending queue of hungry workers. In fact, there is a wide choice and favourite dining spots are emerging. Workmen drenched in sweat and cave water lurk optimistically to see if the next fresh batch of chicken is ready. And the most popular woman in Thailand appears to be the one who loudly declares the ice-creams have arrived. Among the servers is Lakhana Didyasarin, the director of the American School of Bangkok. ""I have brownies, cookies and hotdogs,"" she says. Lakhana Didyasarin says she has faith that the boys will be brought out safely In fact, she brought 1,600 hotdogs, and they are all gone. It was her duty as a Thai to come and help, she says, and it was a ""dream came true"" when the boys were found. ""We have found them now,"" she says. ""The second stage will be much easier. We have doctors, nurses, experts - every person needed to help them out."" Volunteers prepare chicken rice for rescuers Like so many here, she says she is going nowhere. This unlikely army - professional and amateur - won't leave until the boys are safe.

"Alesha MacPhail was reported missing on Monday morning A 16-year-old boy has been charged in connection with the death of schoolgirl Alesha MacPhail. The six-year-old's body was found on the Isle of Bute on Monday, just hours after she was reported missing. The teenager, who was arrested on Wednesday, is expected to appear before Greenock Sheriff Court on Friday. Alesha, who was from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, had been staying at her grandmother's house when she was reported missing at 06:25 on Monday. She was a few days into a three-week summer break on the island in the Firth of Clyde, west of Glasgow. During a media briefing on Thursday afternoon, Det Supt Stuart Houston said: ""I'd like to take this opportunity to personally thank Alesha's  family who have shown incredible bravery through what has been an unimaginable ordeal during these past few days. ""I'd also like to thank local people for all their support and assistance during this major investigation on the island. The response to our appeals was significant both from those living here and the wider community of Scotland. Alesha MacPhail was reported missing on Monday morning ""The people of the Isle of Bute have rallied together since Alesha was first reported missing on Monday morning and I would stress that social media speculation relating to members of the community is both misleading and inaccurate."" He added: ""The family has also received considerable support from Alesha's home town of Airdrie which was reflected in the memorial service held at her school."" Det Supt Stuart Houston said the case had touched everyone who worked on it. He added: ""Officers and staff from across Police Scotland and the Scottish Police Authority have been involved in what has been a difficult and challenging investigation during which they have worked tirelessly to bring us to where we are today. ""As I have said previously, incidents such as this are extremely rare and while the police investigation will continue, I hope that today's announcement brings some reassurance to everyone in the local community. ""It is understandable that recent events will have shocked communities across Scotland, no more so than on Bute and in Airdrie. Argyll and Bute and North Lanarkshire councils have services available for those who may have been affected."" The senior detective said children, parents and carers who had concerns following the tragic events should contact ParentLine Scotland, which is run by Children 1st.
