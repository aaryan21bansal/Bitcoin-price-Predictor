"France will begin legal action against the UK in January over the issue of post-Brexit fishing licences, according to a French minister. Tensions have been growing between the UK and France, as both sides try to sort out the politically-charged matter of how to agree fishing rights after Brexit. Under a new post-Brexit trade deal (which came into force at the start of 2021), EU members states' boats need licences to fish in UK and Jersey waters and UK boats need them to fish in the waters of EU member states. Licences are granted to boats that can prove they have fished in a particular area between 1 February 2017 and 31 January 2020. Requiring proof in this way is normal practice in fisheries management and there are often disputes about the evidence. Big trawlers will routinely collect this sort of information using data from Automatic Identification Systems. Smaller vessels, which come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, find it more difficult to provide this kind of proof. The UK National Federation of Fisherman's Organisations (NFFO)says that,externalsorting legitimate boats that are struggling to find the necessary evidence from the opportunists trying to take advantage of the situation is a normal exercise ""best done through quiet dialogue and far from excitable politicians"". In October, the UK and Jersey denied licences to dozens of French boats. On 11 December,external, Jersey ministers gave permanent licences to another five French vessels, taking the total number to 130. That leaves 33 vessels which have temporary licences that are due to expire on 31 January 2022, and 54 applications which have been rejected. A British trawler wasseized by Francein October because it was not on an EU list of vessels that had been granted licences to fish in French waters. The UK government said the trawler had been granted a licence but it was unclear why it was not on the list. The vessel wassubsequently released. The dispute is also about licences for small boats to fish in territorial waters between six and 12 nautical miles from Britain. On 15 December,the UK government said,externalit had received 50 applications for French boats under 12 metres to fish in that zone and that it had issued 19 licences. On 1 December,Guernsey announced,externalthat it had issued licences to 40 boats, it had rejected 15 applications and that it would be issuing another three licences ""in due course"". France made various threats about what would happen if more licences were not issued. Subsequently there was what UK Environment Secretary George Eustice called a ""big de-escalation"" of the row with ""constructive talks"" with France. Then, on 19 November, French President Macron told reporters: ""We have not got what we wanted,"" and added: ""We will not yield."" On 26 November, French fishermen took their own action, including blocking access to French ports for British boats and blocking trucks at the Eurotunnel freight terminal. On 23 December, French Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France 2 television that, in early January, France would be taking its complaints to the special tribunal set up as part of the Brexit agreements. The post-Brexit trade deal,externaloutlines new rules on fishing: EU boats will continue to fish in UK waters for some years to come But UK fishing boats will get a greater share of the fish from UK waters That shift in the share will be phased in between 2021 and 2026, with most of the quota transferred in 2021 After that, there'll be annual negotiations to decide how the catch is shared out between the UK and EU The UK would have the right to completely exclude EU boats after 2026 But the EU could respond with taxes on exports of British fish to the EU or by denying UK boats access to EU waters Both sides agreed that 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in UK waters will be transferred to the UK fishing fleet over a period of five years. This is known as the ""adjustment period"", giving EU fleets time to get used to the new arrangements. The EU wanted it to be longer, the UK wanted it to be shorter - it looks like they've met somewhere in the middle, with an end date of 30 June 2026. The EU fishing quota, which is the amount of fish that EU boats are allowed to catch in UK waters, will be reduced by 15% in the first year and 2.5 percentage points each subsequent year. By 2026, it is estimated that UK boats will have access to an extra Â£145m of fishing quota every year. In 2019, British vessels caught 502,000 tonnes of fish, worth around Â£850m, inside UK waters. The document also sets out details of how each species of fish will be shared out between the UK and the EU during the transition. The UK fleet can expect increases in quota for 57 out of the 90 types of fish caught in UK waters every year. But quota shares for some species like Channel cod, of which EU boats (mainly from France) catch more than 90% each year, will remain unchanged. After the end of the adjustment period in June 2026, there will be annual talks to set the amount EU fishing boats can catch in UK waters (and vice versa) and theoretically the UK could decide to completely withdraw access to its waters for EU vessels, although the EU would be likely to restrict access to its markets and fish to UK fishermen. UK fishermen sell a large proportion of their catch to the EU so access to EU markets is important. In 2019, the UK fishing industry exported more than 333,000 tonnes of fish to the EU. That accounted for nearly half of the total catch of the UK fishing fleet and roughly three quarters of total fish exports from the UK. Some parts of the industry - such as shellfish - are totally dependent on such exports. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal?

"There is nothing surprising about the prime minister going to Brussels in the closing throes of a negotiation that's lasted many months. That's a standard piece of political choreography - essentially, the bosses get to sign it off, and get their ""grip and grin"" moment. The big headlines of drama, before the last-minute victory. It was only the personal chemistry/diplomatic charm/tough muscle-flexing of the politician at the top of the tree (delete as applicable) that got his almost impossible deal over the final line. The saga may well follow that well-worn script in the end. It is still possible that by the end of the week, Boris Johnson will head to Brussels and return the conquering hero to his supporters, proving the naysayers who told him a deal couldn't be done wrong, again. PM to meet EU chief in bid to save Brexit deal What happens if there's a no-deal Brexit? All you need to know about Brexit Making his many detractors gnash their teeth, he would prove the politician who seems to court disaster, but whose toast always lands butter side up in the end. But as I write tonight, it just doesn't feel that way. First off, Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have spent a significant amount of time talking in the last few days. Yes, it's been virtual. And yes, the chemistry in the room does matter, of course. But the two principals here have had two very lengthy private individual exchanges that don't seem to have resulted in any willingness on either side to compromise, or new instructions to their negotiators to budge. What is it that they will suddenly be able to realise or discover in the meeting - perhaps on Wednesday or Friday this week - that they haven't yet? Boris Johnson rang Ursula von der Leyen for the second time in a week on Monday. Next, as their official statement makes plain, their conversations have not been about a few pesky details that need to be ironed out. They have made plain that the official negotiations have basically been exhausted and there are still big gaps. True, there is only a tiny circle of people who know exactly what is going on. But the messages coming out from the centre are that much more than a nip and tuck is required to get this done. They haven't asked their negotiators to have another go. They've asked them to sit down and make a list of all the things that are wrong. In tone, it's very different to previous such moments, when the leaders were required to put the icing on a cake that was very nearly baked. And lastly, the expectations regarding an agreement have really shifted since this time last week. Even former strong Remainers now in the cabinet totally accept the notion of no agreement being reached. One of them told me: ""If it fails, it wouldn't be fair to point the finger at London as the villain of the piece. The uniform approach of the EU suddenly looks very ropey, and they have been left exposed."" Another said ""everyone is just so fed up"" of ""EU game playing"". Inside the government, it doesn't seem there would be an effort to stop the prime minister if he decides to walk away. On the EU side, hopes aren't high about what can be achieved by the two leaders when they meet. One source said: ""It feels like Saint Nick didn't bring you what you wanted, and we keep hoping every day he may after all."" Now, before you scream, the two sides both still want a deal of course. And it makes sense to the EU and the UK to find an agreement. Not to do so would affect the economy, security, Northern Ireland, and so much more. And for the vast majority of those involved, to fail in this endeavour would be a historic political accident. But sentiment is drifting away from a happy conclusion. It's not obvious that a face-to-face meeting between two very different politicians will turn that back.

"Glasgow is one of the areas which are subject to the highest level of restrictions The 11 Scottish council areas which are subject to the highest tier of Covid-19 restrictions will exit level four on Friday, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. The first minister said a decision on the levels that each region will be placed in will be taken on Tuesday. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman had said on Sunday that ""all options are on the table"" for the areas, beforerevising her comments later in the day. Ms Sturgeon confirmed the councils ""will all come out of level four"". She said it was likely that most of the areas would drop into level three, with the government taking a ""cautious"" approach to alert levels. When will I be vaccinated against Covid? What level is your council area in? What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? The 11 council areas in west and central Scotland', including Glasgow, were placed in the top tier of restrictions on 20 November in a ""short and sharp"" effort to contain the spread of the virus. This was described as a three-week measure which would come to an end on 11 December. However, some doubt appeared to be cast on this when the health minster was interviewed on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme. Asked whether some of the level four areas ""will remain so after the end of next week"", and whether they could still be in the top tier at Christmas, Ms Freeman replied that ""all options are on the table"". She later clarified that the 11 councils would come out of level four on Friday, and that her comments were intended to be about ""what level below four they'll go into"". Speaking at her daily coronavirus briefing on Monday, Ms Sturgeon reiterated: ""We've always said that those authorities would move out of that level on Friday and that remains the case."" The first minister said she would not pre-empt the review, as the levels for each council are due to be signed off by her cabinet on Tuesday morning. However, she said she would continue to take a ""cautious"" approach. She added: ""The one thing that we are being firm about is that the level four areas will all come out of level four. ""Whether they go to level three, which I think is probably likely, or whether any of them might go to a lower level, that's something we will look at over the course of the day."" The council areas currently subject to level four restrictions are: East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, Stirling, West Dunbartonshire and West Lothian. The rest of the country is in levels one to three of the five-tier system. Ms Sturgeon said the government would also be looking at whether any other areas should either move up or down a level. Meanwhile, the first Covid-19 vaccines are to be administered in Scotland on Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon said this was ""extremely positive news"" - but that it was ""important we not drop our guard."" She said: ""Now we can see the prospect of the return to a more normal way of life, that should give us all the more incentive to stay safe and keep each other safe."" The first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness -arrived in Scotland over the weekend, and have now been delivered to local health boards. Staff who will administer the vaccine will be the first to receive it, with the more elderly and vulnerable groups of the population next in line. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Vaccination is a major logistical exercise and it will take us time to work through the programme. The recent news doesn't remove the need for caution during this winter period.""

"Fauci: ""We've got to not walk away from the facts and the data"" Top US diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci has warned of another surge in Covid cases after Christmas - even with the rise following Thanksgiving still being tackled. He said the longer Christmas/New Year period may be even more of a challenge. The US is seeing peak infections of close to 200,000 a day on average with record numbers of people in hospital. California is under a strict new lockdown, with other states announcing record increases. A US city engulfed by Covid, but no lockdown Where has been hit hardest? US vaccine chief sees 'light at end of the tunnel' The US has recorded more than 14.7 million cases of infection in the pandemic so far and 282,500 deaths,according to Johns Hopkins University research,external, both global highs. President Donald Trump has been accused of playing down measures such as mask wearing but the US has also had to deal with different states taking different approaches to tackling the virus. Dr Fauci, who has been asked by President-elect Joe Biden to be his Covid chief medical adviser, told CNN his concerns for Christmas were the same as his concerns for  Thanksgiving, ""only this may be even more compounded because it's a longer holiday"". A pre-Christmas event in Los Angeles, California, now has strict lockdown measures He said nobody wanted to modify or shut down the holiday season, but ""we're at a very critical time... we've got to not walk away from the facts and the data. This is tough going for all of us"". Millions defied appeals from experts not to travel over the Thanksgiving period - the Sunday after the Thursday 26 November holiday saw the most air travellers since March and the Covid effects are still to be fully felt. Dr Fauci, who has been part of the Trump administration's response to Covid-19 but has also drawn criticism from the president for his views, said people tended to return to work the week following Thanksgiving but that this is often not the case with Christmas leading into New Year. On Sunday, former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner Scott Gottlieb said US deaths could be near 400,000 by the end of January, adding: ""As bad as things are right now, they're going to get a lot worse."" Also on Sunday, Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator, criticised the Trump administration for flouting guidelines and peddling ""myths"" about the pandemic. California has ordered much of the state to stay at home, after it set a daily record of 30,000 new cases on Sunday. In the south of the state, fewer than 15% of intensive care hospital beds are empty. This video can not be played ""I don't need your instruction"": Two US senators clash on wearing face masks in the chamber Dr Fauci told Californian officials they ""really don't have any choice"" in imposing some of the strictest measures in the US, including bans on restaurant dining and private gatherings. The lockdown, affecting around 85% of the state's 40 million people, will last for at least three weeks and until Intensive Care Unit (ICU) capacity goes above 15% again. New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo has called on retired doctors and nurses to return to work and said if the number of patients in hospital did not decrease in five days, indoor dining in New York City would stop. But New York did reopen some of its schools on Monday, allowing some in-person instruction at younger ages - a move guided by figures showing lower Covid positivity rates in schools. Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said the state had witnessed a post-Thanksgiving surge, saying infections ""took off like a rocket"". New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia have also announced record one-day rises in new cases. The FDA could authorise the Pfizer vaccine - approved in the UK - on Thursday, with vaccinations taking place just a few days later. They will be rationed and targeted but the Trump administration hopes to vaccinate as many as 24 million people by mid-January. This video can not be played Moncef Slaoui told CBS News that Americans could take comfort in vaccine news but still needed to follow Covid-19 guidance Health Secretary Alex Azar said the White House would host a vaccine distribution summit on Tuesday to align governors, retail pharmacy chains and shipping firms. The White House's vaccination campaign, called Operation Warp Speed, has said there could be a significant decrease in death rates among the elderly by the end of January. Some experts questioned both the number of vaccines projected to be administered by January and the effect on the death rate, given the latest surges. Meanwhile, Mr Biden on Monday announced his nominations for health secretary - California Attorney General Xavier Becerra - and head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Rochelle Walensky. Both were welcomed by Dr Fauci. Mr Biden, who will be sworn in on 20 January, vowed that his administration would be ""ready on day one to mobilise every resource of the federal government... and restore the belief that there is nothing beyond America's capacity"".

"MPs have voted to reinstate controversial sections of a new law to allow ministers to override sections of the UK's Brexit divorce deal. The House of Lords previously voted to take them out - but MPs backed government plans to put them back in during a vote on Monday. The EU has warned the issue could jeopardise the ongoing talks on a post-Brexit trade deal. But earlier, the UK signalled a possible compromise over the measures. Ministers said they would be prepared to remove clauses which, if they became law, would supplant agreements with the EU relating to goods moving between Britain and Northern Ireland and subsidies for Northern Irish firms. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the timing of the move, which came just before Boris Johnson spoke to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, seemed to be ""a rather public olive branch"". It has since been confirmed that the prime minister will travel to Brusselslater this week in a last-ditch effort to break the deadlock in talks over a trade deal. UK and EU negotiators are currently trying to reach an agreement before the UK stops following EU trading rules on 31 December. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months Talks are on again:The UK and the EU have until 31 December to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes What happens next with Brexit? Prior to the debate, the UK government said it would be willing to take the clauses out of the bill - or nullify their effect - if they could reach a solution with the EU in the coming days. In a statement, No 10 said it was committed to the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol in a ""pragmatic, proportionate way which recognises Northern Ireland's place in the UK's customs territory, and upholds the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions"". ""If the solutions being considered in those discussions are agreed, the UK government would be prepared to remove clause 44 of the UK Internal Market Bill, concerning export declarations,"" it added. ""The UK government would also be prepared to deactivate clauses 45 and 47, concerning state aid, such that they could be used only when consistent with the UK's rights and obligations under international law."" The bill would enable ministers to ignore certain requirements concerning Northern Ireland as set out in the Brexit deal (or withdrawal agreement)reached by leaders in 2019. For example, under the Brexit deal, companies moving goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain would have to fill out export declaration forms, but ministers would be able to overrule this. The bill also allows ministers to reinterpret rules on the financial support government gives to businesses in Northern Ireland. UK-EU talks resume in final push for trade deal Brexit: What is the Internal Market Bill? The week ahead in Parliament Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has acknowledged the bill breaks international law ""in a specific and limited way"". The EU has previously said the introduction of the bill had ""seriously damaged trust"" andbegan legal proceedings against the UK. However, Downing Street says the law provides a ""safety net"" in the event the two sides fail to reach a trade deal. The bill has to be approved by both houses in Parliament. Now that MPs have rejected the Lords' changes, the bill will return to the House of Lords on Wednesday. Peers will decide whether or not to reinsert their amendments, in a process known as ""ping pong"". Earlier, Business Minister Paul Scully said it was critical for the measures in question to be kept in the bill as a ""fall back option"" to protect the UK's territorial integrity. Belfast harbour in Northern Ireland For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said the legislation had been ""absolutely savaged"" in the Lords and it was no surprise the ""beginnings of the climbdown"" were now happening. ""Three months of posturing and undermining our reputation and three hours before the debate begins, we see the preparation being made for the brakes being applied before we go over the cliff,"" he said. ""I am not going to give the government any credit for it and I don't take their word for it either."" He also warned the bill would lead to a ""constitutional punch-up"" amid concerns of a power grab by Westminster from Scotland and Wales. The bill could also affect talks for a trade deal between the US and UK with US President-Elect Joe Biden appearing to express concern. On Wednesday, MPs will also get the chance to debate and vote on the Taxation Bill,which contains more powers for the UK to break legal requirementsin the withdrawal agreement around the customs border with the Irish Republic. No 10 said the contents of the bill, which unlike the Internal Market Bill will not need the consent of the House of Lords, would be ""kept under review"" in light of the discussions with the EU.

"Adrian Smith was shocked to find that a photo of him as an eight-year-old had become an internet meme. He stumbled upon the picture on Instagram, but it had come from a Tumblr blog in which his image was being used as the stepson of a fictional ""teenage stepdad"". He said he was amused by it, but admitted that as a child he would have found it ""confusing and sad"". Mr Smith's discovery has now gone more viral than the original meme. He has been in touch with its original creator, and said he was happy that the image has not been used in a ""mean spirit"". ""Teenage Stepdad"" offered to kill the character off, but Mr Smith is happy for him to carry on with it if he wishes, he said. The character which went with the photo was not a part of him, Mr Smith said. ""I had options - I could ignore it, I could get mad about it, or I could embrace it and make it part of my story now, and have it out there as an example of the chaotic randomness that happens with stuff on the internet that we put there,"" he said. Mr Smith, who lives in North Carolina, had contributed the photograph to a Tumblr blog in about 2007 where people were sharing school photos with laser backgrounds. It was taken in 1992. He said he remembered being very proud of the picture, having managed to find a top that matched the background, for which he had paid an additional $2. ""I'd like to say it's me pre-glasses, pre-braces, and 100% raw power as an eight-year-old,"" he said. ""My grin in the picture is one of smug satisfaction."" Mr Smith is himself a parent of two very young children - and said it would be a while before they understood what a meme was. But he did not wish to put them off sharing their lives online. ""The lesson is that what you put in the internet might last forever and have a life of its own, but also the internet doesn't define you, it doesn't have to be you,"" he said. ""Figure out who you are first, and if the stuff out there is part of how you want to define yourself then use it for that, if it's not, then don't."" His alter-ego has had a lively few years, sported some interesting hairstyles and made some questionable decisions, like the time he took up smoking. But Mr Smith thinks the fictional boy would also approve of his own career as an entomologist who ""puts videos about bugs on YouTube"". Viral dad on the trials of working from home.

"Singapore is a long way from the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss Alps The World Economic Forum, which usually hosts a glitzy annual meeting for political and business leaders in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, has moved next year's event to Singapore. The forum says it's making the change to safeguard health and safety. ""In light of the current situation with regards to Covid-19 cases, it was decided that Singapore was best placed to hold the meeting,"" it said. Singapore has largely been seen as managing the crisis successfully. Its health ministry says there are currently 28 people being treated in hospital for the coronavirus, but none are in intensive care, and there are no cases in the community. Singapore's death toll for Covid-19 stands at 29. But the country remains under ""phase two"" restrictions, which means gatherings are capped at five people and working from home is still the default for most companies. Singapore's Trade Minister Chan Chun Sing said the Forum's decision to hold the meeting in the country was ""an affirmation of Singapore's ability to provide a safe, neutral and conducive venue for global leaders to meet"". Safety measures could include tests on arrival and contact tracing of attendees, the government said. Breakfast panels are a staple of the Davos summit The in-person World Economic Forum annual meeting is planned to take place in Singapore from 13-16 May, before returning to Switzerland in 2022. It will be only the second time the event has been held outside Davos in its history. In 2002, the forum was organised in New York to show solidarity with the US after the 9/11 terror attacks. Free bobble hats and nine other facts about Davos Klaus Schwab, who founded the forum in the 1970s, said a global leadership summit would be crucial to address the global recovery from the pandemic.

"Ella Kissi-Debrah lived 25 metres from the South Circular Road in south-east London The mother of a nine-year-old girl who died following an asthma attack says she ""would have moved"" if she had known how dangerous local air pollution was. Ella Kissi-Debrah, who lived near the South Circular Road in Lewisham, south-east London, died in 2013. A 2018 report found unlawful levels of pollution likely contributed to a fatal asthma attack. At a new inquest into Ella's death Rosamund Adoo Kissi-Debrah said her daughter was ""the centre of our world"". Ms Kissi-Debrah said ""moving would have been the first thing"" the family would have done if they had known the risks air pollution posed to Ella. She told the inquest she knew about car fumes but had never heard of nitrogen oxides (NOx) - one of the most dangerous forms of air pollution.As they did not know of the risks posed by air pollution Ms Kissi-Debrah said she never spoke to doctors about moving. Ms Kissi-Debrah branded air pollution ""a public health emergency"", and called for more education about its dangers. Ella was classified as disabled due to her respiratory problems Ella was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit and subsequently admitted to hospital 27 times. Ms Kissi-Debrah said that by the summer of 2012, Ella was classified as disabled. She often had to carry Ella by piggyback to get her around. Ella was seen by consultants at six different hospitals in the years before her death. On the day before Ella died Ms Kissi-Debrah described her daughter ""screaming"" as she left her with paramedics. ""When I saw her in the ambulance I knew she was going to have a seizure, she was so bad,"" Ms Kissi-Debrah said. 'Did air pollution kill my daughter?' Tracking the toxic air that's killing millions Dad's mission to cut toxic air at school Describing the efforts of doctors to resuscitate Ella on the night of her death, she said: ""They tried and they tried and they tried."" Ella died at 03:27 on 15 February 2013. Rosamund Adoo Kissi-Debrah said she did not know how dangerous local levels of pollution were before her daughter's death An inquest in 2014, which focused on Ella's medical care, concluded her death was caused by acute respiratory failure and severe asthma.But a 2018 report said it was likely unlawful levels of pollution, which were detected at a monitoring station one mile from Ella's home, contributed to her fatal asthma attack. Ella may become the first person in the UK for whom air pollution is listed as the cause of death. The hearing continues.

"An Italian man stepped outside to cool off after quarrelling with his wife - and ended up walking 450km (280 miles). Italians have nicknamed him ""Forrest Gump"" on social media, after the slow-witted hero of a 1994 movie, played by Tom Hanks, who runs thousands of miles across the United States. Police stopped the Italian's epic walk at 2am in Fano on the Adriatic coast, a week after he left Como in the north. The man, 48, got a â¬400 (Â£362; $485) police fine for breaching the curfew. The story was first reported by the Bologna-based newspaper Il Resto del Carlino but quickly went viral in Italian media. Some comments on social media presented the man as heroic and criticised the fine. One said he should have been rewarded - not fined - and given a new pair of shoes. Another praised him for walking off to cool his anger, rather than resorting to violence. The man told police ""I came here on foot, I didn't use any transport"". He said ""along the way I met people who offered me food and drink"". ""I'm OK, just a bit tired,"" he said, having averaged 60km daily. Police found him wandering aimlessly and cold at night on a coastal highway. After checking his ID in their database they found that his wife had reported him missing, so they contacted her and she travelled to Fano to collect him. The Italian reports did not say how she reacted upon learning that he had picked up a â¬400 fine.

"The vaccine arrived at Wrexham Maelor Hospital in a brown carboard box on Monday afternoon The first batch of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has arrived in Wales ahead of Tuesday's much-anticipated rollout. The vaccine arrived at Wales' seven health boards in unassuming brown cardboard boxes on Monday afternoon. Front-line NHS staff and over-80s will be the first to get the jab. There will be nearly 40,000 doses of the vaccine available initially, enough to vaccinate nearly 20,000 people, the Welsh Government has said. Dr Matt Morgan, an intensive care consultant at University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, will be among the first to get the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. Vaccine rollout could be 'decisive turning point' First people to be vaccinated in Wales on Tuesday Q&A: How will the vaccine rollout work in Wales? He said the vaccinations had brought ""hope for the first time in a long time"". On Sunday, Health Minister Vaughan Gethingwarned it would take monthsbefore some people were able to receive the vaccine. Dr Matt Morgan will be among the first to receive the coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Dr Morgan said: ""I'm feeling kind of proud, in a way, that science and medicine and humanity has made this vaccine in less than a duration of a pregnancy. ""From when the first patient was admitted to intensive care in Cardiff with Covid, it will be 38 weeks to the day, and it is pretty remarkable that in that time, the vaccine is here. ""Because of that, I am feeling hopeful, for the first time in a long time. ""But also, I am realistic - this isn't going to make things better overnight and all of the other things that society and the public have been doing, sadly, remain more important than ever."" How do I know the Covid vaccine is safe? Wedding cancelled for Covid vaccination centre The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first to be approved for use by UK regulators last week, and requires two separate injections, a few weeks apart. Ahead of the vaccination programme beginning on Tuesday, a Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""It is expected nearly 1,000 doses will be administered in the first phase by each of the seven health boards in Wales by the end of the weekend. ""This will take place at one vaccination centre in each of the seven health boards, mostly in hospitals."" The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been trialled on more than 40,000 people, with only mild side-effects reported. Dr Morgan said the biggest risk in getting the vaccine was driving to the test centre to have it done, while the benefits of the injections were ""huge"". ""This vaccine has risks which are tiny. Absolutely tiny. It has been tested on 40,000 people. ""The benefits, to me, are not getting sick, hopefully my patients not getting sick, my colleagues not getting sick, my family not getting sick and all those other downstream benefits."" People will be given these cards once vaccinated in England Once vaccinated, people will be issued with a card with details of the vaccine name, date of vaccination and the batch numbers of each of the dose. It will also act as a reminder for a second appointment, as the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine requires two doses, but the cards will not hold any personal information. The Welsh Government said: ""We have no plans to produce vaccine passports or ID cards but everyone who receives a Covid-19 vaccination will be given an NHS Wales immunisation card with the vaccine name, date of vaccination and the batch numbers of each of the dose. ""This is designed to be a reminder about when the second dose is due and will help people report any side effects.""

"Shows affected included Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway ITV breached broadcasting rules with several of its viewer competitions, media watchdog Ofcom has ruled. Some viewers who participated in competitions using a postal entry had ""no chance of being selected to win"", Ofcom said. Competitions on shows like Good Morning Britain, Lorraine, This Morning, Loose Women and Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway were all involved. More than 41,000 entries between 2016 and 2019 were affected. Competitions on La Vuelta and X Factor: The Band were also found to be in breach of the broadcasting code. ITV said it has put in place plans to improve its postal entry procedures and it intended to donate a sum of money to charity as a ""mark of its sincere regret"". ITV investigated over competition entries An Ofcom spokeswoman said: ""Our investigation found that people who entered these competitions by post were excluded from the draw, with no chance of winning. ""ITV failed to follow proper procedures and this led to a clear breach of our rules, which require all broadcast competitions to be conducted fairly."" The broadcaster said the problem was a result of ""human error by ITV staff"" putting information on to a spreadsheet. Competitions on ITV usually invite viewers to enter by phone, text message, the channel's website or by post. Viewers are charged Â£2 to enter its competitions via text message, phone or online. Postal entries are usually free, although some require the purchase of a postage stamp. This Morning was one of the shows investigated ITV reviewed every broadcast competition it had conducted since 2014 after it discovered there had been an issue. This included competitions broadcast on sister networks like ITV2 and ITV4. The broadcaster then referred itself to Ofcom, prompting the regulator to investigate. ITV said it ""deeply regretted"" the errors and that the number of affected competitions represented fewer than 1% since 2014. Ofcom said it recognised ""the proactive way in which ITV dealt with the issue by notifying Ofcom and immediately setting about to determine the extent and cause of the problem"". But it said the broadcaster ""failed to take reasonable care through its processes to ensure the competitions were conducted in such ways as to provide fair and consistent treatment of all eligible entries"". It's not the first time the broadcaster has found itself in hot water over its competitions. ITV came in for criticism in 2007,externalafter it was revealed that premium rate competitions and phone votes on series such as Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway were rigged. Ofcom subsequently ordered ITV to pay Â£5.7m, a record sanction imposed on a broadcaster by the watchdog at the time. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

" How high might temperatures climb and how much rain might fall in your area and how? The BBC and the Met Office have looked at the UK's changing climate in detail to find out. Temperatures in the UK exceeded 40C for the first time on record earlier this summer, and extreme weather events are likely to become even more frequent. The Met Office climate projections cover different levels of global warming. When, or if, these levels are reached will depend on the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. The data is measured in 12km-square (7.5-mile-square) grids across the UK. The results for your postcode represent an average for the grids closest to you and the mid-point of a range of future possibilities, which come from the Met Office’s most recent major climate modelling data.

If global temperatures rise by 4C, it could be about {{beginHighlight}}{{high_hottest_day}}C{{endHighlight}}. The hottest day recorded in the UK came in July 2022, with40.3C measured in at Coningsby in Lincolnshire. Human activity has increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and caused rising temperatures worldwide since the growth of industrialisation in the 19th Century. If global average temperatures rise by 2C above pre-industrial levels, days at least as hot the 2019 record could be more frequent and widespread. And with a 4C rise, parts of the UK could see temperatures above 42C. Urgent cuts in emissions are needed to keep the rise in global average temperatures in check. The Glasgow Climate Pact,reached at the COP26 summit in 2021, agreed countries will meet this year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Use buttons to change season In the the 30 summers from 1991 to 2019, there were {{beginHighlight}} {{current_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}} above 25C per month on average. If global temperatures rise by 2C, there could be {{beginHighlight}}{{medium_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. With a 4C rise, there could be {{beginHighlight}}{{high_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines any day with a maximum temperature above 25C as a ""summer day"". In the 30 summers from 1991 to 2019, even the warmest places in the UK, located in the South, had no more than seven days a month above 25C on average. If global average temperatures rise by 2C, southern parts of the country could see more than 11 days per summer month go beyond 25C. If the rise is 4C, those places could have 20 or more summer days per month, and higher likelihood of hot spells triggering public-health warnings. The cooler, northern parts of the UK, which may not see many days above 25C even with a 4C rise, can nonetheless expect average daytime temperatures in summer to increase by at least 2.5C. The average daytime temperature in the UK in summercurrentlyranges from about 14C in northern Scotland to 22C in southern England.But summers have been getting warmer, with four of the 10 hottest summers up to 2019 recorded in the past two decades. Even if countries cut emissions and theworld warms by 2C, the whole UK could see higher summer temperatures.In some northern locations, the increase could be small. In southern areas, average summer temperatures could reach 24C. If emissions continue to increase and average global temperaturesrise by 4C, summers will be even hotter.Nearly a third of the UK could see average summer temperatures above 25C. The Met Office climate projections for the UK indicate significant temperature rises in the decades ahead for both winter and summer, with the greatest increases in the already warmer South. Extreme weather could become more frequent and intense. Not every summer will be hotter than the last – but temperature records are expected to be regularly broken, while heatwaves are likely to be longer and happen more often.

Winter rains could remain as likely as they are now. The number of days will vary from year-to-year, but rainy days in a warmer future could be wetter than today with total rainfall expected to rise. Use buttons to change season   In warmer winters the heaviest rains are likely to get more intense. If global average temperatures rise by 4C above pre-industrial levels, half the country could expect at least 20% more rainfall on the wettest winter days. Summer rains may also become heavier in many places, although total rainfall is expected to decline. Of course, not all of the heaviest rains will necessarily fall in these two seasons. The current wettest day on record was 3 October 2020, whenenough rain fell across all four nations to fill Loch Ness. Currently,the wettest areas of the UK dominate the west coast, with nearly all of Wales and western Scotland receiving most rain in winter months. So how much will change in future winters? With a2C rise, very little compared to what we've seen recently.But winters over the past 30 years have been rainier on average than previously, and the pattern of wetter winters could continue. The exact amount of change in rainfall at2C global warmingwill vary across the country. Most places could have slightly wetter winters than in the 20th Century. If global average temperatures were torise by 4C, more than half the country could see at least 10% more rain over the winter months. The UK climate projections suggest increases in winter rainfall in most parts of the country, as well as drier summers. Rainfall measurements fluctuate from year to year, making projections challenging. Not every winter will necessarily be rainier than the one before, and not every summer will be dry, but both trends could have big impacts. As the world warms, the UK is likely to have hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters, according to the Met Office. Extreme weather events such as heatwaves and heavy downpours could become more frequent and more intense. Many scientists are concerned. ""I think it’s really frightening,” says Dr Lizzie Kendon, a senior Met Office scientist. “It's just a wake-up call really as to what we’re talking about here.” We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, but the level of global warming we reach and by when will depend primarily on the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. To some, warming weather may not seem like such a big deal. But even the smallest incremental changes in climate can have far-reaching effects. Temperatures above 30C for two or more days can trigger a public-health warning. In the 1990s, this happened about once every four years for locations in the South. By the 2070s, projections suggest it could be as frequently as four times per year - 16 times more often, if we do not curb our emissions. The Met Office projects rainy winters, which keep the soil wet into spring, and dry summers of infrequent rainfall will become the norm. Summer rain is likely to become less frequent but could be heavier. Without regular rainfall, the ground has a harder time absorbing water when it finally does come, leading to a greater risk of flash flooding. Floods will likely become a staple of warming winters as well. Steady rain, which is currently a feature of winter months, will probably continue, and total rainfall is expected to increase. When the ground is already saturated, waterways tend to rise. Bridges and sewers designed for historical rainfall levels may come increasingly under pressure. Warming temperatures could also mean cold spells become less frequent. Andsnowy UK winters could become thing of the pastas climate change affects the UK, according to Met Office analysis shared with BBC Panorama. Temperatures below freezing during the day and areas with considerable amounts of snow on the ground may be limited to parts of Scotland by the end of the century if emissions continue to rise. The BBC has collaborated with scientists from the Met Office to analyse data from their extensive weather measurement records and their major climate modelling project, theUK Climate Projections (UKCP). The present-day data shows averages of observed measurements for 1991-2019. The future data shows projected temperature and rainfall measurements produced by climate models for two different levels of global warming: if global average temperatures rise 2C above records from the mid-19th Century, the start of major industrialisation, and if that rise is 4C. Twelve different versions of the Met Office's Hadley Centre climate model were used in calculating the UKCP Regional (12km) projections using a high emissions gas scenario (RCP8.5). Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. They help scientists come up with projections for what conditions on Earth we are likely to see as global warming continues. The level of global warming depends on a number of factors. The most important is the amount of emissions produced in the coming years. Emissions are greenhouse gases released into our atmosphere. The accumulation of these gases has a warming effect on the globe, which in turn leads to changes in climatic conditions. Governments around the world have pledged to reduce their emissions to limit the degree of warming. During the Glasgow COP26 summit in 2021, countries agreed to meet the following year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of keeping temperature rises within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effectssuch as millions more people being exposed to extreme heat. If no interventions are taken, global average temperatures could rise by up to 4C by 2100. This high-emissions future is highlighted in themost recent Evidence Report for the UK's Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA)as possible, if less likely. Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C, while at current rates of global emissions, the world is on a pathway somewhere between 2C and 4C. The modelled projections in this data do not represent a specific time period. Instead, they show what conditions could be like in these two different levels of global warming. Some other climate data may project specific points in time by which a certain level of global warming may be reached. However, this model allows for the possibility of actions that may reduce or increase emissions enough to change the timing before we would experience a 2C or 4C future. More information on the methods used to calculate the timing of different levels of global warming can be found inthis 2018 Met Office paper. This tool presents six different measurements among those scientists use to gain a picture of the environment under various conditions. Each represents a specific predefined climate metric. 1. Hottest day is the maximum temperature recorded or projected on a single day 2. Summer days, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), have a maximum temperature above 25C 3. Average daytime temperature is the average of daily maximum air temperatures over a season 4. Rainy days are when more than 1mm of rain is recorded. This excludes days that may have had very light rain or a heavy morning dew or mist 5. Wettest day is the maximum amount of recorded or projected rainfall on a single day 6. Total rainfall is the amount in millimetres measured across a season. We also calculated and display the change in rainfall for the future scenarios as a percentage change from the current period (1991-2019) Climate data is typically presented in gridded squares that make up a large surface area. The grids used in this model are 12km by 12km. This level of detail is able to capture many of the varied climate conditions across the UK's diverse geography far better than other, broader-scale models. Each UK postcode has been matched to its nearest 12km-square grid. The results displayed for your area represent an average (mean) for the grids closest to that location, as long as they are no further than 34km away. In most cases a grid has been averaged with its eight nearest grids, except along irregular coastlines and small islands. Averaging means that the figures displayed are never for a single grid alone. While natural variability between grid areas is normal, this process minimises dramatic differences that may be down to chance. Both current and future data are organised into the same 12km-square grids. However, unlike future modelled predictions, the present-day data comes from actual observed measurements. We have presented a single number that represents an average for each grid and season. This helps to reduce the influence of outliers in observed data. For instance, the current number of summer days represents the mean number of days recording maximum temperatures of at least 25C per month in June, July and August across every year from 1991 to 2019. Each number presented in the two future scenarios represents the median of 12 possible outcomes as projected by the 12 model simulations. All future projection data has been calibrated by Met Office scientists against the data in the present-day range, 1991-2019, so the model results can be compared directly with observations. More information on the calibration technique used can be foundin this 2017 paper. Because climate data is gridded, the data may represent a larger area than that covered by a single weather station. Measurements from multiple weather stations are averaged together to give a single datapoint for a grid. Take the hottest day, for instance. If the highest temperature recorded at Cambridge Royal Botanic Gardens was 38.7C, that number is combined with measurements from other stations across the region to produce an average for a 12km-square area that includes Cambridge. Other weather stations will have recorded slightly lower temperatures, so the average highest temperature in this area would be less than 38.7C.

"Millwall players were booed when they took a knee before Saturday's match against Derby Millwall players will not take a knee before Tuesday's Championship fixture against QPR but will stand arm-in-arm in a ""show of solidarity for football's fight against discrimination"". It comes after some Millwall fans booed the players taking a knee before Saturday's defeat by Derby at The Den. Players of both teams will collectively hold up an anti-racism banner. Millwall's regular shirt sponsor will be replaced with the logo of anti-discrimination body Kick It Out. In a statement, Millwall said: ""Millwall believe that this gesture, which the club hopes to repeat with other visiting teams in the coming weeks and months, will help to unify people throughout society in the battle to root out all forms of discrimination. ""Millwall have a zero-tolerance policy against racial and all other forms of discrimination and want to again make clear to anybody who holds such views that you are not welcome at this football club. Millwall's stance, as always, is that anybody found guilty of racial abuse is banned for life."" The decision came after a meeting on Monday between both clubs, Kick It Out, Show Racism The Red Card, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), the Football Association (FA) and the English Football League (EFL). In a statement, the EFL welcomed the decision of both clubs to ""continue to raise awareness of inequality and discrimination facing society"". ""Discrimination in any form is unacceptable and not welcome within our game or our communities - not today or any day,"" the statement said. ""Players often receive widespread criticism and negativity for merely doing their jobs but here they are leading the way, trying to effect positive change and they should be applauded for taking a stand, showing solidarity and setting an example for others to follow."" This video can not be played Taking the knee is showing solidarity, not a political statement - Southgate Some QPR players will take the kneebefore Tuesday's game at The Den, despite having stopped the gesture earlier this season after director of football Les Ferdinand said its impact had ""been diluted"". Players, officials and staff at Premier League and EFL games have been taking a knee pre-match since football restarted in June in order to show their support for the Black Lives Matter movement for racial equality. The Den was able to host 2,000 home fans for the first time this season after the second national lockdown was lifted but the return of spectators was overshadowed by the booing, with which Millwall said they were""dismayed and saddened"". The Millwall Supporters' Club said the booing was not motivated by racism, but instead in opposition to the political views held by the Black Lives Matter organisation. The FA has confirmed it is investigating the incident at Millwall, and a similar one atColchester United's League Two game against Grimsby Town. If it finds that the actions were discriminatory, the clubs could face fines. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club, former England defender Micah Richards said booing is ""not acceptable"". ""Millwall fans, from their point of view, this whole movement is becoming political. They're saying they don't think the players at their club should want to kneel because of what Black Lives Matter represents in their mind,"" he said. ""If they're booing that, it's not acceptable, but it's free speech and that is their opinion, but I think people are taking Black Lives Matter in a different context and changing the actual narrative of what it's all about. ""When the players are taking the knee they are not saying black lives matter and they are any better than white lives, they are trying to say it's a stand for equality and unity and that is why they are taking the knee."" BBC Sport football reporter Simon Stone Sources described this evening's meeting as ""difficult but productive"". It is understood the PFA was critical of the EFL's perceived lack of involvement, a feeling many at the club share, having told it beforehand of what they feared was likely to happen at The Den on Saturday. There are many unanswered questions for football and Millwall in particular and evidently solutions will not be easy. However, the sense of desperation hanging round the club on Monday has now been replaced by a mixture of trepidation and optimism. No-one at the club can be entirely sure of what will happen when the QPR players take a knee as planned before kick-off but the noises among fans on social media who backed the booing on Saturday is that these measures should be supported. Millwall can only hope this is what happens. Because if what happened on Saturday is repeated, even insiders know the damage to the club will be catastrophic.

"MPs have voted to reinstate controversial sections of a new law to allow ministers to override sections of the UK's Brexit divorce deal. The House of Lords previously voted to take them out - but MPs backed government plans to put them back in during a vote on Monday. The EU has warned the issue could jeopardise the ongoing talks on a post-Brexit trade deal. But earlier, the UK signalled a possible compromise over the measures. Ministers said they would be prepared to remove clauses which, if they became law, would supplant agreements with the EU relating to goods moving between Britain and Northern Ireland and subsidies for Northern Irish firms. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the timing of the move, which came just before Boris Johnson spoke to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, seemed to be ""a rather public olive branch"". It has since been confirmed that the prime minister will travel to Brusselslater this week in a last-ditch effort to break the deadlock in talks over a trade deal. UK and EU negotiators are currently trying to reach an agreement before the UK stops following EU trading rules on 31 December. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months Talks are on again:The UK and the EU have until 31 December to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes What happens next with Brexit? Prior to the debate, the UK government said it would be willing to take the clauses out of the bill - or nullify their effect - if they could reach a solution with the EU in the coming days. In a statement, No 10 said it was committed to the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol in a ""pragmatic, proportionate way which recognises Northern Ireland's place in the UK's customs territory, and upholds the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions"". ""If the solutions being considered in those discussions are agreed, the UK government would be prepared to remove clause 44 of the UK Internal Market Bill, concerning export declarations,"" it added. ""The UK government would also be prepared to deactivate clauses 45 and 47, concerning state aid, such that they could be used only when consistent with the UK's rights and obligations under international law."" The bill would enable ministers to ignore certain requirements concerning Northern Ireland as set out in the Brexit deal (or withdrawal agreement)reached by leaders in 2019. For example, under the Brexit deal, companies moving goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain would have to fill out export declaration forms, but ministers would be able to overrule this. The bill also allows ministers to reinterpret rules on the financial support government gives to businesses in Northern Ireland. UK-EU talks resume in final push for trade deal Brexit: What is the Internal Market Bill? The week ahead in Parliament Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has acknowledged the bill breaks international law ""in a specific and limited way"". The EU has previously said the introduction of the bill had ""seriously damaged trust"" andbegan legal proceedings against the UK. However, Downing Street says the law provides a ""safety net"" in the event the two sides fail to reach a trade deal. The bill has to be approved by both houses in Parliament. Now that MPs have rejected the Lords' changes, the bill will return to the House of Lords on Wednesday. Peers will decide whether or not to reinsert their amendments, in a process known as ""ping pong"". Earlier, Business Minister Paul Scully said it was critical for the measures in question to be kept in the bill as a ""fall back option"" to protect the UK's territorial integrity. Belfast harbour in Northern Ireland For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said the legislation had been ""absolutely savaged"" in the Lords and it was no surprise the ""beginnings of the climbdown"" were now happening. ""Three months of posturing and undermining our reputation and three hours before the debate begins, we see the preparation being made for the brakes being applied before we go over the cliff,"" he said. ""I am not going to give the government any credit for it and I don't take their word for it either."" He also warned the bill would lead to a ""constitutional punch-up"" amid concerns of a power grab by Westminster from Scotland and Wales. The bill could also affect talks for a trade deal between the US and UK with US President-Elect Joe Biden appearing to express concern. On Wednesday, MPs will also get the chance to debate and vote on the Taxation Bill,which contains more powers for the UK to break legal requirementsin the withdrawal agreement around the customs border with the Irish Republic. No 10 said the contents of the bill, which unlike the Internal Market Bill will not need the consent of the House of Lords, would be ""kept under review"" in light of the discussions with the EU.

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen say they want an ""overview of the remaining differences"" in EU-UK trade talks In a joint statement following a phone call on Monday, the two leaders said those differences will be ""discussed in person"" Boris Johnson says he will go to Brussels for a ""physical meeting"" in the coming days Three ""critical issues"" need to be resolved as talks continue in Brussels - fishing rights, government support for industry and how a deal is enforced The negotiating teams are trying to find an agreement on the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU The UK left the EU on 31 January, but remains under its trading rules until the end of the year If a deal is not agreed by then, tariffs - or taxes on goods - could come into force The boss of Toyota's European business has warned that a no-deal Brexit could make its UK plants uncompetitive Dr Johan van Zyl said such an outcome would create a ""very negative investment environment"" in the UK and be ""very, very negative"" for his business Thanks for following along with us today. The team at your service were Jennifer Scott, Lucy Webster, Paul Seddon, and Rob Corp, with Johanna Howitt in the editor's chair. We're going to pause our live coverage of today's Brexit developments. Before we leave you, here is a quick summary of the day's events:  Lord David Frost (left) and Michel Barnier (right) have led negotiating teams for the UK and EU We are now all waiting for the big meeting between Johnson and Von der Leyen, but it isn't all over for the negotiating teams yet. After almost 10 months of talks, the EU's Michel Barnier and the UK's Lord David Frost will meet again to prepare the overview of the difficulties that still remain between the two sides. We understand that meeting will take place tomorrow, before they hand it over to their political leaders. Reaching to theearlier joint statement,externalfrom Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, Labour has urged both sides to reach an agreement. Shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, said: âDay
after day we see this government failing to deliver their promises to the
British people and failing to get the deal they promised done. âSecuring
a deal is critical to the British national interest for jobs and security."" She called on the teams ""even
at this 11th hour... to get on with reaching an agreement"", adding: ""We
can then focus on the job at hand which is securing the economy and rebuilding
our country from the pandemic.â Katya AdlerEurope Editor We've had the same big three sticking points between the two sides for months now. Many trade negotiators were wondering what the point was of sending negotiators back into the room when they are so well rehearsed in each other's arguments. What is needed to break the deadlock right now is the political will from both sides - and that need to come from the bosses. It will be European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who will sit with Boris Johnson - because EU countries have tasked the Commission with negotiating on their behalf. But she does not have a free hand here - because the Commission is the conduit for the interests of the member states. When it's come to Brexit, they have kept a sense of unity you do not see normally. But now that we're getting to five to midnight, that unity is beginning to fray at the edges. A senior UK government source has said the trade talks are ""in the same position now as they were on Friday"". ""We have made no tangible progress. Itâs clear this must now continue politically. ""Whilst we do not consider this process to be closed, things are looking very tricky and thereâs every chance we are not going to get there.â UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pictured earlier during his phone call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The statement that dropped a few minute ago also left a few question marks, and while there is lots we cannot answer yet about the future of a trade deal, one thing has been cleared up. Von der Leyen's chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, has confirmed his boss and the prime minister will meet in person in Brussels - not their negotiating teams.

Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent It sounds like we are heading for a political showdown later this week. Boris Johnson will at some point be heading to Brussels for the real crunch moment - to discuss whether remaining issues can be overcome. Talks between the negotiating teams matter - but ultimately, whether to sign on the dotted line is a political decision. It is not completely clear when the final deadline is. But Thursday is a big day, because some on the European side are adamant they need something to discuss when EU leaders are due to meet at their summit on Thursday. So, Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, have repeated there are still ""significant difference on three critical issues"" in the Brexit trade talks. Here's a quick reminder of the three issues they seem to be stuck on:  A joint statement has just been released from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. It says: âAs agreed on Saturday, we took
stock today of the ongoing negotiations. We agreed that the conditions for
finalising an agreement are not there due to the remaining significant
differences on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and
fisheries. âWe asked our chief negotiators and
their teams to prepare an overview of the remaining differences to be discussed
in a physical meeting in Brussels in the coming days.â Boris Johnson and Urusual von der Leyen spoke earlier today Bad news from The City... The pound has fallen to its lowest level against the Euro in more than six weeks, as traders reacted to the growing prospect of a no-deal Brexit. In late afternoon trading in London, sterling was about 1% down against the single European currency at â¬1.098. And it also lost ground against the dollar, falling 0.83% to $1.3325. You can read more about the glum news here. Among the MPs speaking in the Commons over that controversial bill is Ed Miliband - remember him? The former Labour leader is now back on the front bench as the party's shadow business secretary. He begins by saying he feels like he is living in a ""parallel universe"" to the government, who continues to defend its position on the bill. He says it has been ""absolutely savaged"" by members from across Parliament, includingTory grandees. Miliband adds: ""There is one thing this whole sorry saga has shown the world beyond any doubt - that with this government their word is not their bond. ""They cannot be trusted because they are willing to rip up international agreements they made less than a year ago."" In the background of the post-Brexit trade talks, MPs are currently debating the government's Internal Market Bill, which caused controversy when it was first published. The bill was initially passed by MPs, but it faced a bumpier ride when it moved to the House of Lords. Sections in the bill which, if they became UK law, would break international law. Peers made a number of changes and removed sections which would have given the government powers to override parts of the Brexit ""divorce deal"" - otherwise known as the withdrawal agreement. Ministers now say they would be willing to remove controversial clauses from the bill, but only if a trade deal is agreed between the UK and the EU in the coming days. The bill has to be approved by both houses in Parliament, so if MPs rejected the peers' changes, it will return to the House of Lords, who will then decide whether or not to reinsert their amendments - a process called ""the ping pong stage"".

Post-Brexit trade is not on theprovisional agenda,externalfor the summit due to take place in Brussels - but it comes at a crucial time for the talks, meaning it will be hard to ignore.

Toyota has two plants in the UK, which employ about 3,000 people in total. But van Zyl said no decisions on the future of its UK plants - a car factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire and an engine facility at Deeside in North Wales - could be taken until the outcome of trade talks was known.

On Monday, the government announced a further 14,718 people had tested positive for the virus, while a further 189 people had died within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 61,434.

In England, 50 hospitals have been initially chosen to serve as hubs for administering it. Scotland,Wales, andNorthern Irelandwill also begin their vaccination programmes from hospitals on Tuesday. Speaking at the Royal Free Hospital in London ahead of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, Sir Simon said: ""Tomorrow is the beginning of the biggest vaccination campaign in our history, building on successes from previous campaigns against conditions [and] diseases like polio, meningitis, and tuberculosis. ""Hospitals, and then GPs and pharmacists, as more vaccine becomes available, are going to be vaccinating at least until next spring."" Refrigerated containers holding the vaccine doses, which need to be kept at -70C,have been arriving in the UK from Belgium, where it is made, and are being prepared to be moved from secure locations to the hospitals. The UK has ordered 40 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. It is enough to vaccinate 20 million people because two doses are needed. There are 800,000 doses in the first tranche, meaning 400,000 people will be vaccinated initially. Although care home residents were placed at the top of the priority list agreed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), they are not getting the very first vaccinations. The government has explained this is because the chosen hospital hubs already have the facilities to store the vaccine at the required temperature.

When asked about potential disruption to supply if there is a no-deal Brexit, Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said the vaccine was a ""top priority product"" and the government would considerusing the armed forces to ensure supply ""if we need to"". The Ministry of Defence said 60 military planners are working with the government's vaccine task force, with a further 56 personnel helping to construct vaccination centres.

Hashem Abedi, 23, was jailed for murdering the 22 people who were killed in the bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert in May 2017. During his trial, he denied helping his brother Salman, 22, plan the attack that also left hundreds more injured. But a public inquiry into the bombing heard Hashem Abedi had made the admission in prison in October. During an interview with inquiry lawyers, he admitted he had ""played a full part and a knowing part in the planning and preparation for the arena attack"", in which his brother also died, the inquiry heard. Figen Murray, whose son Martyn, 29, was killed in the bombing, said ""it would have been more bearable for all of us if he told the truth"" during the trial. ""We wanted to put that chapter behind us but focus our energies on the inquiry, which continues to be a gruelling and long process,"" she added. Abedi's admission was confirmed to the inquiry by Det Ch Supt Simon Barraclough, from Greater Manchester Police, who was the senior investigating officer on the case. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, said to him: ""You are aware, on 22 October this year, in prison serving his sentence, Hashem Abedi was interviewed by members of the inquiry legal team?"" Mr Barraclough told the inquiry he knew of the admission during the interview and agreed it was a ""fair summary"" to say 23-year-old Abedi admitted he had played ""a full part and a knowing part"". Hashem Abedi is serving a minimum prison term of 55 years The detective added that there was ""no doubt in my mind"" that the prosecution of Abedi was ""entirely well founded"". Mr Greaney said: ""So the point you are making is that it didn't need him to tell you that you had got it right?"" Mr Barraclough responded: ""I think we had got there with the trial."" No further details of the prison interview were provided. The court heard how the brothers spent months ordering, stockpiling and transporting the materials required for the attack. They joined their parents in Libya the month before the blast, but Salman Abedi returned to the UK on 18 May. He bought the final components needed for the bomb before carrying out the attack as fans left the arena on the evening of 22 May 2017. Salman Abedi in the foyer of the Manchester Arena, seconds before he blew himself up Abedi was arrested shortly afterwards and extradited to Britain. He did not give evidence during his trial, providing only a statement in which he denied 22 counts of murder, attempted murder and plotting to cause an explosion likely to endanger life. Abedi originally claimed he did not hold extremist views and had been ""shocked"" by what his brother had done. ""Had I any idea of it I would have reported it to my mother initially and then to other family members to prevent it from happening,"" he said in his statement. But Abedi, formerly of Fallowfield, Manchester, was convicted by a jury at the Old Bailey and jailed for life in Augustwith a minimum term of 55 years. Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured in the explosion A forensic link to Ismail Abedi, the elder brother of Salman and Hashem Abedi, was found in a car that was used to store explosives prior to the attack, the inquiry also heard. The Nissan Micra was bought by Salman and Hashem Abedi about 40 hours before they flew to Libya with their parents in April 2017. When Salman Abedi arrived back in the UK on 18 May 2017, he went straight to the car and returned the following morning to collect explosives from the vehicle, the inquiry heard. It was previously revealed that Ramadan Abedi, father of Salman and Hashem Abedi, iswanted for questioningafter his fingerprints were found inside the Micra. During evidence by Mr Barraclough, the link to Ismail Abedi emerged. Mr Barraclough agreed when questioned by Nicholas de la Poer QC, counsel to the inquiry, that ""the fingerprints and/or DNA of Ismail Abedi and Ramadan Abedi, brother and father respectively, [had been] discovered"". The BBC recentlysought to question Ismail Abediabout his refusal to assist the inquiry, which has heard he is citing a claimed privilege against self-incrimination. The Manchester Arena inquiry, which is being chaired by Sir John Saunders, started in September and is expected to last until the spring. It aims to explore the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the attack and whether it could have been prevented. The inquiry is being held at Manchester Magistrates' Court, less than a mile away from where the bombing happened.

"Shows affected included Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway ITV breached broadcasting rules with several of its viewer competitions, media watchdog Ofcom has ruled. Some viewers who participated in competitions using a postal entry had ""no chance of being selected to win"", Ofcom said. Competitions on shows like Good Morning Britain, Lorraine, This Morning, Loose Women and Ant and Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway were all involved. More than 41,000 entries between 2016 and 2019 were affected. Competitions on La Vuelta and X Factor: The Band were also found to be in breach of the broadcasting code. ITV said it has put in place plans to improve its postal entry procedures and it intended to donate a sum of money to charity as a ""mark of its sincere regret"". ITV investigated over competition entries An Ofcom spokeswoman said: ""Our investigation found that people who entered these competitions by post were excluded from the draw, with no chance of winning. ""ITV failed to follow proper procedures and this led to a clear breach of our rules, which require all broadcast competitions to be conducted fairly."" The broadcaster said the problem was a result of ""human error by ITV staff"" putting information on to a spreadsheet. Competitions on ITV usually invite viewers to enter by phone, text message, the channel's website or by post. Viewers are charged Â£2 to enter its competitions via text message, phone or online. Postal entries are usually free, although some require the purchase of a postage stamp. This Morning was one of the shows investigated ITV reviewed every broadcast competition it had conducted since 2014 after it discovered there had been an issue. This included competitions broadcast on sister networks like ITV2 and ITV4. The broadcaster then referred itself to Ofcom, prompting the regulator to investigate. ITV said it ""deeply regretted"" the errors and that the number of affected competitions represented fewer than 1% since 2014. Ofcom said it recognised ""the proactive way in which ITV dealt with the issue by notifying Ofcom and immediately setting about to determine the extent and cause of the problem"". But it said the broadcaster ""failed to take reasonable care through its processes to ensure the competitions were conducted in such ways as to provide fair and consistent treatment of all eligible entries"". It's not the first time the broadcaster has found itself in hot water over its competitions. ITV came in for criticism in 2007,externalafter it was revealed that premium rate competitions and phone votes on series such as Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway were rigged. Ofcom subsequently ordered ITV to pay Â£5.7m, a record sanction imposed on a broadcaster by the watchdog at the time. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Ella Kissi-Debrah lived 25 metres from the South Circular Road in south-east London The mother of a nine-year-old girl who died following an asthma attack says she ""would have moved"" if she had known how dangerous local air pollution was. Ella Kissi-Debrah, who lived near the South Circular Road in Lewisham, south-east London, died in 2013. A 2018 report found unlawful levels of pollution likely contributed to a fatal asthma attack. At a new inquest into Ella's death Rosamund Adoo Kissi-Debrah said her daughter was ""the centre of our world"". Ms Kissi-Debrah said ""moving would have been the first thing"" the family would have done if they had known the risks air pollution posed to Ella. She told the inquest she knew about car fumes but had never heard of nitrogen oxides (NOx) - one of the most dangerous forms of air pollution.As they did not know of the risks posed by air pollution Ms Kissi-Debrah said she never spoke to doctors about moving. Ms Kissi-Debrah branded air pollution ""a public health emergency"", and called for more education about its dangers. Ella was classified as disabled due to her respiratory problems Ella was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit and subsequently admitted to hospital 27 times. Ms Kissi-Debrah said that by the summer of 2012, Ella was classified as disabled. She often had to carry Ella by piggyback to get her around. Ella was seen by consultants at six different hospitals in the years before her death. On the day before Ella died Ms Kissi-Debrah described her daughter ""screaming"" as she left her with paramedics. ""When I saw her in the ambulance I knew she was going to have a seizure, she was so bad,"" Ms Kissi-Debrah said. 'Did air pollution kill my daughter?' Tracking the toxic air that's killing millions Dad's mission to cut toxic air at school Describing the efforts of doctors to resuscitate Ella on the night of her death, she said: ""They tried and they tried and they tried."" Ella died at 03:27 on 15 February 2013. Rosamund Adoo Kissi-Debrah said she did not know how dangerous local levels of pollution were before her daughter's death An inquest in 2014, which focused on Ella's medical care, concluded her death was caused by acute respiratory failure and severe asthma.But a 2018 report said it was likely unlawful levels of pollution, which were detected at a monitoring station one mile from Ella's home, contributed to her fatal asthma attack. Ella may become the first person in the UK for whom air pollution is listed as the cause of death. The hearing continues.

"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen when they met earlier this year It's not over, not yet. The two sides in this complicated and drawn out process have agreed that it is worth trying one last time to find a way through their profound differences. But the statements from the prime minister and the EU chief, Ursula von der Leyen, signal clearly that a trade deal is out of reach right now - spelling out that if no-one budges in the next few days, it's simply not going to happen. UK-EU trade talks to resume over 'critical issues' LIVE: Leaders agree to resume post-Brexit trade talks What's going on with Brexit? A feature of Brexit negotiations has often been the last minute stand off, the political emergency, before suddenly, lo and behold, a deal emerges from the wreckage. By Monday night, that tradition may have been proven again. Yet it seems there is a lot more to be done than ironing out a few last minute glitches. The UK believes that after months of talks, the EU - pushed by some member states - has hardened its stance on the same old stumbling blocks. And that's pushed a deal that was in reach just a few days ago, further away. For both sides, not reaching a deal would be a political failure. The prime minister has warned that it might not come to pass and has tried to assure the public about what would happen if it can't be done. But the UK and the EU have both said on repeated occasions that a deal is what they want - eager to avoid the disruption of leaving the transition period at the end of this year without arrangements in place. And their negotiating teams have worked for months on the mechanics of how the conundrums over our departure from the trading bloc could be resolved. But the two sides are still stuck over the fundamental, political question - who really calls the shots. It was Theresa May who coined the phrase, ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". In the next 48 hours, Boris Johnson and the European Union have to decide if they want to test if she was right.

"MPs have voted to reinstate controversial sections of a new law to allow ministers to override sections of the UK's Brexit divorce deal. The House of Lords previously voted to take them out - but MPs backed government plans to put them back in during a vote on Monday. The EU has warned the issue could jeopardise the ongoing talks on a post-Brexit trade deal. But earlier, the UK signalled a possible compromise over the measures. Ministers said they would be prepared to remove clauses which, if they became law, would supplant agreements with the EU relating to goods moving between Britain and Northern Ireland and subsidies for Northern Irish firms. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the timing of the move, which came just before Boris Johnson spoke to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, seemed to be ""a rather public olive branch"". It has since been confirmed that the prime minister will travel to Brusselslater this week in a last-ditch effort to break the deadlock in talks over a trade deal. UK and EU negotiators are currently trying to reach an agreement before the UK stops following EU trading rules on 31 December. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months Talks are on again:The UK and the EU have until 31 December to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes What happens next with Brexit? Prior to the debate, the UK government said it would be willing to take the clauses out of the bill - or nullify their effect - if they could reach a solution with the EU in the coming days. In a statement, No 10 said it was committed to the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol in a ""pragmatic, proportionate way which recognises Northern Ireland's place in the UK's customs territory, and upholds the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions"". ""If the solutions being considered in those discussions are agreed, the UK government would be prepared to remove clause 44 of the UK Internal Market Bill, concerning export declarations,"" it added. ""The UK government would also be prepared to deactivate clauses 45 and 47, concerning state aid, such that they could be used only when consistent with the UK's rights and obligations under international law."" The bill would enable ministers to ignore certain requirements concerning Northern Ireland as set out in the Brexit deal (or withdrawal agreement)reached by leaders in 2019. For example, under the Brexit deal, companies moving goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain would have to fill out export declaration forms, but ministers would be able to overrule this. The bill also allows ministers to reinterpret rules on the financial support government gives to businesses in Northern Ireland. UK-EU talks resume in final push for trade deal Brexit: What is the Internal Market Bill? The week ahead in Parliament Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has acknowledged the bill breaks international law ""in a specific and limited way"". The EU has previously said the introduction of the bill had ""seriously damaged trust"" andbegan legal proceedings against the UK. However, Downing Street says the law provides a ""safety net"" in the event the two sides fail to reach a trade deal. The bill has to be approved by both houses in Parliament. Now that MPs have rejected the Lords' changes, the bill will return to the House of Lords on Wednesday. Peers will decide whether or not to reinsert their amendments, in a process known as ""ping pong"". Earlier, Business Minister Paul Scully said it was critical for the measures in question to be kept in the bill as a ""fall back option"" to protect the UK's territorial integrity. Belfast harbour in Northern Ireland For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said the legislation had been ""absolutely savaged"" in the Lords and it was no surprise the ""beginnings of the climbdown"" were now happening. ""Three months of posturing and undermining our reputation and three hours before the debate begins, we see the preparation being made for the brakes being applied before we go over the cliff,"" he said. ""I am not going to give the government any credit for it and I don't take their word for it either."" He also warned the bill would lead to a ""constitutional punch-up"" amid concerns of a power grab by Westminster from Scotland and Wales. The bill could also affect talks for a trade deal between the US and UK with US President-Elect Joe Biden appearing to express concern. On Wednesday, MPs will also get the chance to debate and vote on the Taxation Bill,which contains more powers for the UK to break legal requirementsin the withdrawal agreement around the customs border with the Irish Republic. No 10 said the contents of the bill, which unlike the Internal Market Bill will not need the consent of the House of Lords, would be ""kept under review"" in light of the discussions with the EU.

" How high might temperatures climb and how much rain might fall in your area and how? The BBC and the Met Office have looked at the UK's changing climate in detail to find out. Temperatures in the UK exceeded 40C for the first time on record earlier this summer, and extreme weather events are likely to become even more frequent. The Met Office climate projections cover different levels of global warming. When, or if, these levels are reached will depend on the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. The data is measured in 12km-square (7.5-mile-square) grids across the UK. The results for your postcode represent an average for the grids closest to you and the mid-point of a range of future possibilities, which come from the Met Office’s most recent major climate modelling data.

If global temperatures rise by 4C, it could be about {{beginHighlight}}{{high_hottest_day}}C{{endHighlight}}. The hottest day recorded in the UK came in July 2022, with40.3C measured in at Coningsby in Lincolnshire. Human activity has increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and caused rising temperatures worldwide since the growth of industrialisation in the 19th Century. If global average temperatures rise by 2C above pre-industrial levels, days at least as hot the 2019 record could be more frequent and widespread. And with a 4C rise, parts of the UK could see temperatures above 42C. Urgent cuts in emissions are needed to keep the rise in global average temperatures in check. The Glasgow Climate Pact,reached at the COP26 summit in 2021, agreed countries will meet this year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Use buttons to change season In the the 30 summers from 1991 to 2019, there were {{beginHighlight}} {{current_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}} above 25C per month on average. If global temperatures rise by 2C, there could be {{beginHighlight}}{{medium_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. With a 4C rise, there could be {{beginHighlight}}{{high_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines any day with a maximum temperature above 25C as a ""summer day"". In the 30 summers from 1991 to 2019, even the warmest places in the UK, located in the South, had no more than seven days a month above 25C on average. If global average temperatures rise by 2C, southern parts of the country could see more than 11 days per summer month go beyond 25C. If the rise is 4C, those places could have 20 or more summer days per month, and higher likelihood of hot spells triggering public-health warnings. The cooler, northern parts of the UK, which may not see many days above 25C even with a 4C rise, can nonetheless expect average daytime temperatures in summer to increase by at least 2.5C. The average daytime temperature in the UK in summercurrentlyranges from about 14C in northern Scotland to 22C in southern England.But summers have been getting warmer, with four of the 10 hottest summers up to 2019 recorded in the past two decades. Even if countries cut emissions and theworld warms by 2C, the whole UK could see higher summer temperatures.In some northern locations, the increase could be small. In southern areas, average summer temperatures could reach 24C. If emissions continue to increase and average global temperaturesrise by 4C, summers will be even hotter.Nearly a third of the UK could see average summer temperatures above 25C. The Met Office climate projections for the UK indicate significant temperature rises in the decades ahead for both winter and summer, with the greatest increases in the already warmer South. Extreme weather could become more frequent and intense. Not every summer will be hotter than the last – but temperature records are expected to be regularly broken, while heatwaves are likely to be longer and happen more often. Use buttons to change season In the 30 years from 1991 to 2019, there were {{beginHighlight}} {{current_rainy_days}} rainy days{{endHighlight}} on average per month in summer. If global average temperatures rise by 2C, this could be {{beginHighlight}}{{medium_rainy_days}} days{{endHighlight}} per month. At a 4C rise it could be about {{beginHighlight}}{{high_rainy_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. In the 30 years from 1991 to 2019, there were {{beginHighlight}}{{current_rainy_days}} rainy days{{endHighlight}} on average per month in winter. At both 2C and 4C rises, the number of rainy days per month could be roughly the same. As the world warms, fewer rainy days in summer are expected. Currently, over a quarter of the UK has 20 or more days without rain each summer month. This could grow to more than half the country if we reach 4C global warming. Winter rains could remain as likely as they are now. The number of days will vary from year-to-year, but rainy days in a warmer future could be wetter than today with total rainfall expected to rise. Use buttons to change season   In warmer winters the heaviest rains are likely to get more intense. If global average temperatures rise by 4C above pre-industrial levels, half the country could expect at least 20% more rainfall on the wettest winter days. Summer rains may also become heavier in many places, although total rainfall is expected to decline. Of course, not all of the heaviest rains will necessarily fall in these two seasons. The current wettest day on record was 3 October 2020, whenenough rain fell across all four nations to fill Loch Ness. Currently,the wettest areas of the UK dominate the west coast, with nearly all of Wales and western Scotland receiving most rain in winter months. So how much will change in future winters? With a2C rise, very little compared to what we've seen recently.But winters over the past 30 years have been rainier on average than previously, and the pattern of wetter winters could continue. The exact amount of change in rainfall at2C global warmingwill vary across the country. Most places could have slightly wetter winters than in the 20th Century. If global average temperatures were torise by 4C, more than half the country could see at least 10% more rain over the winter months. The UK climate projections suggest increases in winter rainfall in most parts of the country, as well as drier summers. Rainfall measurements fluctuate from year to year, making projections challenging. Not every winter will necessarily be rainier than the one before, and not every summer will be dry, but both trends could have big impacts. As the world warms, the UK is likely to have hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters, according to the Met Office. Extreme weather events such as heatwaves and heavy downpours could become more frequent and more intense. Many scientists are concerned. ""I think it’s really frightening,” says Dr Lizzie Kendon, a senior Met Office scientist. “It's just a wake-up call really as to what we’re talking about here.” We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, but the level of global warming we reach and by when will depend primarily on the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. To some, warming weather may not seem like such a big deal. But even the smallest incremental changes in climate can have far-reaching effects. Temperatures above 30C for two or more days can trigger a public-health warning. In the 1990s, this happened about once every four years for locations in the South. By the 2070s, projections suggest it could be as frequently as four times per year - 16 times more often, if we do not curb our emissions. The Met Office projects rainy winters, which keep the soil wet into spring, and dry summers of infrequent rainfall will become the norm. Summer rain is likely to become less frequent but could be heavier. Without regular rainfall, the ground has a harder time absorbing water when it finally does come, leading to a greater risk of flash flooding. Floods will likely become a staple of warming winters as well. Steady rain, which is currently a feature of winter months, will probably continue, and total rainfall is expected to increase. When the ground is already saturated, waterways tend to rise. Bridges and sewers designed for historical rainfall levels may come increasingly under pressure. Warming temperatures could also mean cold spells become less frequent. Andsnowy UK winters could become thing of the pastas climate change affects the UK, according to Met Office analysis shared with BBC Panorama. Temperatures below freezing during the day and areas with considerable amounts of snow on the ground may be limited to parts of Scotland by the end of the century if emissions continue to rise. The BBC has collaborated with scientists from the Met Office to analyse data from their extensive weather measurement records and their major climate modelling project, theUK Climate Projections (UKCP). The present-day data shows averages of observed measurements for 1991-2019. The future data shows projected temperature and rainfall measurements produced by climate models for two different levels of global warming: if global average temperatures rise 2C above records from the mid-19th Century, the start of major industrialisation, and if that rise is 4C. Twelve different versions of the Met Office's Hadley Centre climate model were used in calculating the UKCP Regional (12km) projections using a high emissions gas scenario (RCP8.5). Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. They help scientists come up with projections for what conditions on Earth we are likely to see as global warming continues. The level of global warming depends on a number of factors. The most important is the amount of emissions produced in the coming years. Emissions are greenhouse gases released into our atmosphere. The accumulation of these gases has a warming effect on the globe, which in turn leads to changes in climatic conditions. Governments around the world have pledged to reduce their emissions to limit the degree of warming. During the Glasgow COP26 summit in 2021, countries agreed to meet the following year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of keeping temperature rises within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effectssuch as millions more people being exposed to extreme heat. If no interventions are taken, global average temperatures could rise by up to 4C by 2100. This high-emissions future is highlighted in themost recent Evidence Report for the UK's Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA)as possible, if less likely. Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C, while at current rates of global emissions, the world is on a pathway somewhere between 2C and 4C. The modelled projections in this data do not represent a specific time period. Instead, they show what conditions could be like in these two different levels of global warming. Some other climate data may project specific points in time by which a certain level of global warming may be reached. However, this model allows for the possibility of actions that may reduce or increase emissions enough to change the timing before we would experience a 2C or 4C future. More information on the methods used to calculate the timing of different levels of global warming can be found inthis 2018 Met Office paper. This tool presents six different measurements among those scientists use to gain a picture of the environment under various conditions. Each represents a specific predefined climate metric. 1. Hottest day is the maximum temperature recorded or projected on a single day 2. Summer days, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), have a maximum temperature above 25C 3. Average daytime temperature is the average of daily maximum air temperatures over a season 4. Rainy days are when more than 1mm of rain is recorded. This excludes days that may have had very light rain or a heavy morning dew or mist 5. Wettest day is the maximum amount of recorded or projected rainfall on a single day 6. Total rainfall is the amount in millimetres measured across a season. We also calculated and display the change in rainfall for the future scenarios as a percentage change from the current period (1991-2019) Climate data is typically presented in gridded squares that make up a large surface area. The grids used in this model are 12km by 12km. This level of detail is able to capture many of the varied climate conditions across the UK's diverse geography far better than other, broader-scale models. Each UK postcode has been matched to its nearest 12km-square grid. The results displayed for your area represent an average (mean) for the grids closest to that location, as long as they are no further than 34km away. In most cases a grid has been averaged with its eight nearest grids, except along irregular coastlines and small islands. Averaging means that the figures displayed are never for a single grid alone. While natural variability between grid areas is normal, this process minimises dramatic differences that may be down to chance. Both current and future data are organised into the same 12km-square grids. However, unlike future modelled predictions, the present-day data comes from actual observed measurements. We have presented a single number that represents an average for each grid and season. This helps to reduce the influence of outliers in observed data. For instance, the current number of summer days represents the mean number of days recording maximum temperatures of at least 25C per month in June, July and August across every year from 1991 to 2019. Each number presented in the two future scenarios represents the median of 12 possible outcomes as projected by the 12 model simulations. All future projection data has been calibrated by Met Office scientists against the data in the present-day range, 1991-2019, so the model results can be compared directly with observations. More information on the calibration technique used can be foundin this 2017 paper. Because climate data is gridded, the data may represent a larger area than that covered by a single weather station. Measurements from multiple weather stations are averaged together to give a single datapoint for a grid. Take the hottest day, for instance. If the highest temperature recorded at Cambridge Royal Botanic Gardens was 38.7C, that number is combined with measurements from other stations across the region to produce an average for a 12km-square area that includes Cambridge. Other weather stations will have recorded slightly lower temperatures, so the average highest temperature in this area would be less than 38.7C.

"Swansea Bay University Health Board said there were 800 new cases reported in the last two days in the region Coronavirus cases in the Swansea Bay area could soon reach ""catastrophic levels"" unless people follow social distancing rules, an expert has warned. Swansea Bay health board director Dr Keith Reid said the local health system will be ""overwhelmed"" if cases continue to rise at the current rate. The health board said 700 hospital staff were off sick while 800 new cases were reported in the last two days. Dr Reid said this ""perfect storm"" was being driven by people mixing. He also warned that care homes may be forced to close as they deal with a ""significant number of cases"". His warning follows new figures from Swansea Bay University Health Board (SWUHB) which show Neath Port Talbot has the highest weekly Covid-19 case rate in Wales at 621.7 per 100,000 population, and Swansea has 445.8 cases per week per 100,000. Wales 'only part of UK without falling Covid rates' Second phase of mass testing to tackle Covid hotspot Dr Reid said: ""Unless this community transmission drops significantly, we will be in a catastrophic situation by January because of big rises in cases of Covid and hospital admissions. ""We are at a critical stage. Infection rates are at record levels and we all need to play our part to bring this situation under control and quickly. ""If infections continue to rise at the current rate then without another lockdown before Christmas, the local system will be overwhelmed."" Allow Twitter content?

He has called on the public ""to think about what you need to do rather than what you want to do"" and ""to do the right thing for Christmas which is to follow the social distancing rules and stay safe"". ""The vaccine is coming but for most of us it's not here yet,"" he said. ""We have a chance to stave off a potential catastrophe."" The health board said there were 1,674 new cases of coronavirus recorded between 25 November and 1 December - with 711 in Neath Port Talbot and 960 in Swansea. David Howes, director of social services at Swansea council, said the rising infection levels within the community were ""extremely worrying"". He said their workforce was ""depleted, stretched and exhausted"" and the council is ""looking to reduced services in some areas, to make changes that no-one wants to make"". Dr Reid said a number of care homes in the area have been tackling a ""significant number of cases"" of coronavirus. ""If it gets worse in social care, we could see care homes having to close and the residents having to be displaced. It really is that bad."" He added that NHS staff were struggling to deal with increasing winter pressures, exacerbated by staff Covid-related sickness levels of nearly 700 in the Swansea Bay area. This is creating ""a perfect storm - with an increase in demand, increasing sickness in staff and running out of room to treat patients"", he said. Jamie Jenkins, former head of analysis at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), told BBC Radio Wales: ""Things are looking pretty bleak at the moment with the number of cases and it only seems to be going one way."" He said the number of tests being carried out in Wales has risen by 54% in three weeks - not including the mass-testing in Merthyr Tydfil and the lower Cynon Valley - which has resulted in an increase in confirmed cases. The number of Covid patients in hospital is similar to the numbers seen in mid-September, he added, which is placing increased demand on the health service. ""What's been driving the overall number of Covid patients in hospital has been those who've had the virus and overcome that and now they're in hospital recovering,"" he said. ""The longer you go into winter, if you have more and more patients going in, you're going to have more and more people recovering. ""That does put demand on the health service and affects other people who've got other illnesses."" The county has the highest case rate in Wales now - 621.7 cases per 100,000. That is 891 cases in the last seven days. Nine of its local areas are in the highest 20 places for localised case rates in Wales, with Aberdulais and Resolven the third highest in Wales on 1257.7 cases per 100,000 - 86 positive tests in the last week. Neath Port Talbot also has a positivity rate of more than 25% - the second highest in Wales. The leader of Neath Port Talbot council, councillor Rob Jones, said that ""the majority of people are being sensible and stick to the rules by maintaining social distance"" but he said ""it only takes a minority to ignore the guidelines and lead to a spread in coronavirus"". He added that the modelling shows there could be a ""big surge"" in cases in mid January. His neighbouring council leader at Swansea council, councillor Rob Stewart, has called on people to have ""a safe, socially-distanced festive season"".

"The vaccine arrived at Wrexham Maelor Hospital in a brown carboard box on Monday afternoon The first batch of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has arrived in Wales ahead of Tuesday's much-anticipated rollout. The vaccine arrived at Wales' seven health boards in unassuming brown cardboard boxes on Monday afternoon. Front-line NHS staff and over-80s will be the first to get the jab. There will be nearly 40,000 doses of the vaccine available initially, enough to vaccinate nearly 20,000 people, the Welsh Government has said. Dr Matt Morgan, an intensive care consultant at University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, will be among the first to get the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. Vaccine rollout could be 'decisive turning point' First people to be vaccinated in Wales on Tuesday Q&A: How will the vaccine rollout work in Wales? He said the vaccinations had brought ""hope for the first time in a long time"". On Sunday, Health Minister Vaughan Gethingwarned it would take monthsbefore some people were able to receive the vaccine. Dr Matt Morgan will be among the first to receive the coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Dr Morgan said: ""I'm feeling kind of proud, in a way, that science and medicine and humanity has made this vaccine in less than a duration of a pregnancy. ""From when the first patient was admitted to intensive care in Cardiff with Covid, it will be 38 weeks to the day, and it is pretty remarkable that in that time, the vaccine is here. ""Because of that, I am feeling hopeful, for the first time in a long time. ""But also, I am realistic - this isn't going to make things better overnight and all of the other things that society and the public have been doing, sadly, remain more important than ever."" How do I know the Covid vaccine is safe? Wedding cancelled for Covid vaccination centre The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first to be approved for use by UK regulators last week, and requires two separate injections, a few weeks apart. Ahead of the vaccination programme beginning on Tuesday, a Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""It is expected nearly 1,000 doses will be administered in the first phase by each of the seven health boards in Wales by the end of the weekend. ""This will take place at one vaccination centre in each of the seven health boards, mostly in hospitals."" The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been trialled on more than 40,000 people, with only mild side-effects reported. Dr Morgan said the biggest risk in getting the vaccine was driving to the test centre to have it done, while the benefits of the injections were ""huge"". ""This vaccine has risks which are tiny. Absolutely tiny. It has been tested on 40,000 people. ""The benefits, to me, are not getting sick, hopefully my patients not getting sick, my colleagues not getting sick, my family not getting sick and all those other downstream benefits."" People will be given these cards once vaccinated in England Once vaccinated, people will be issued with a card with details of the vaccine name, date of vaccination and the batch numbers of each of the dose. It will also act as a reminder for a second appointment, as the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine requires two doses, but the cards will not hold any personal information. The Welsh Government said: ""We have no plans to produce vaccine passports or ID cards but everyone who receives a Covid-19 vaccination will be given an NHS Wales immunisation card with the vaccine name, date of vaccination and the batch numbers of each of the dose. ""This is designed to be a reminder about when the second dose is due and will help people report any side effects.""

Hashem Abedi, 23, was jailed for murdering the 22 people who were killed in the bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert in May 2017. During his trial, he denied helping his brother Salman, 22, plan the attack that also left hundreds more injured. But a public inquiry into the bombing heard Hashem Abedi had made the admission in prison in October. During an interview with inquiry lawyers, he admitted he had ""played a full part and a knowing part in the planning and preparation for the arena attack"", in which his brother also died, the inquiry heard. Figen Murray, whose son Martyn, 29, was killed in the bombing, said ""it would have been more bearable for all of us if he told the truth"" during the trial. ""We wanted to put that chapter behind us but focus our energies on the inquiry, which continues to be a gruelling and long process,"" she added. Abedi's admission was confirmed to the inquiry by Det Ch Supt Simon Barraclough, from Greater Manchester Police, who was the senior investigating officer on the case. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, said to him: ""You are aware, on 22 October this year, in prison serving his sentence, Hashem Abedi was interviewed by members of the inquiry legal team?"" Mr Barraclough told the inquiry he knew of the admission during the interview and agreed it was a ""fair summary"" to say 23-year-old Abedi admitted he had played ""a full part and a knowing part"". Hashem Abedi is serving a minimum prison term of 55 years The detective added that there was ""no doubt in my mind"" that the prosecution of Abedi was ""entirely well founded"". Mr Greaney said: ""So the point you are making is that it didn't need him to tell you that you had got it right?"" Mr Barraclough responded: ""I think we had got there with the trial."" No further details of the prison interview were provided. The court heard how the brothers spent months ordering, stockpiling and transporting the materials required for the attack. They joined their parents in Libya the month before the blast, but Salman Abedi returned to the UK on 18 May. He bought the final components needed for the bomb before carrying out the attack as fans left the arena on the evening of 22 May 2017. Salman Abedi in the foyer of the Manchester Arena, seconds before he blew himself up Abedi was arrested shortly afterwards and extradited to Britain. He did not give evidence during his trial, providing only a statement in which he denied 22 counts of murder, attempted murder and plotting to cause an explosion likely to endanger life. Abedi originally claimed he did not hold extremist views and had been ""shocked"" by what his brother had done. ""Had I any idea of it I would have reported it to my mother initially and then to other family members to prevent it from happening,"" he said in his statement. But Abedi, formerly of Fallowfield, Manchester, was convicted by a jury at the Old Bailey and jailed for life in Augustwith a minimum term of 55 years. Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured in the explosion A forensic link to Ismail Abedi, the elder brother of Salman and Hashem Abedi, was found in a car that was used to store explosives prior to the attack, the inquiry also heard. The Nissan Micra was bought by Salman and Hashem Abedi about 40 hours before they flew to Libya with their parents in April 2017. When Salman Abedi arrived back in the UK on 18 May 2017, he went straight to the car and returned the following morning to collect explosives from the vehicle, the inquiry heard. It was previously revealed that Ramadan Abedi, father of Salman and Hashem Abedi, iswanted for questioningafter his fingerprints were found inside the Micra. During evidence by Mr Barraclough, the link to Ismail Abedi emerged. Mr Barraclough agreed when questioned by Nicholas de la Poer QC, counsel to the inquiry, that ""the fingerprints and/or DNA of Ismail Abedi and Ramadan Abedi, brother and father respectively, [had been] discovered"". The BBC recentlysought to question Ismail Abediabout his refusal to assist the inquiry, which has heard he is citing a claimed privilege against self-incrimination. The Manchester Arena inquiry, which is being chaired by Sir John Saunders, started in September and is expected to last until the spring. It aims to explore the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the attack and whether it could have been prevented. The inquiry is being held at Manchester Magistrates' Court, less than a mile away from where the bombing happened.

"The National Trust, which owns the beach, said it was investigating the shiny pillar A monolith has mysteriously appeared in Britain - just days after similar ones were spotted in the US and Romania. The unusual mirrored structure was discovered on the Isle of Wight, an island off the south coast of England. Resident Alexia Fishwick said she ""was dumbstruck"" when she came across it during a beach walk on Sunday and described it as ""really quite magical"". A monolith found in Utah last month created wild speculation on social media and apparent copycats. Many observers have presumed they were art installations left by sculptors. The metal edifice in Utah was found planted in the ground before it disappeared just days later. This video can not be played The unusual object in the desert in the US state of Utah was found by a helicopter crew while conducting a count of big horn sheep in the area Two other shining metal towers later appeared in Romania and southern California. Ms Fishwick said: ""I'd read about the one in Utah and then Romania, so I knew the significance. Many people took no notice of it."" She said people first thought she had photoshopped the images when she put them online. Lee Peckham, a lawyer living on the island, said: ""I saw it and wondered what it was and thought it a rather strange thing to see on the beach. I wondered who put it there and why."" DJ Rob da Bank, another island resident, was also among those who took a stroll to see the sight for themselves. He mused: ""I'm not sure if it's aliens, a Coldplay PR stunt or a local mirror dealer drumming up trade, but it got us all down the beach anyway."" The National Trust, which owns the site, said it had no immediate plans to remove the monolith, which it said was erected without permission. A spokesman said: ""We were unaware of the monolith's presence until this morning, but we've now visited Compton Beach and it seems secure on a wooden plinth and is made from mirrored sections of plastic or perspex material. ""We need to monitor over the next few days to ensure the beach remains safe and does not become overcrowded."" Alexia Fishwick described the monolith as ""incredibly graceful"" An anonymous collective called The Most Famous Artist has taken credit for the monoliths in Utah and California. It posted an image of the Utah monolith on Instagram, with a 45,000 US dollar (Â£34,000) price tag. However, when asked about the Isle of Wight structure, it said: ""The monolith is out of my control at this point. Godspeed to all the aliens working hard around the globe to propagate the myth."" People have tracked down the mystery Utah monolith Mysterious metal monolith found in Utah desert News of the monolith on the island has caused a stir on social media with some posting in jest - that the monolith - which already has its own Instagram page - could be a portal to another dimension. In 2001: A Space Odyssey - the 1968 film directed by Stanley Kubrick - imposing black monoliths created by an unseen alien species appear in the movie, based on the writings of novelist Arthur C Clarke. Most observers reflecting on their trip to the mysterious monolith suspected it was left by an artist rather than an alien species. Allow Twitter content?

"The 2021 edition will be the catalogue's final Furniture giant Ikea has announced it will stop printing its traditional catalogue, one of the world's biggest annual publications, after 70 years. The company said ""fewer people"" were reading the printed catalogue as customers moved to digital alternatives to shop and look for inspirations. The publication reached a peak in 2016 when around 200 million copies were distributed in more than 50 markets. The last edition to be printed is the 2021 version with 40 million copies. The catalogue's first edition was put together by Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad himself in 1951. It featured the MK wing chair, had 285,000 copies and was distributed in southern Sweden, where the company was created. Why we have a love-hate relationship with Ikea How Ikea's Billy bookcase took over the world In a statement,Ikea said the catalogue had become an ""iconic and beloved publication"",externaland an ""important success factor for Ikea to reach and inspire"" customers. ""Turning the page with our beloved catalogue is emotional but rational,"" said Konrad Gruss, managing director at Inter Ikea Systems, a division of brand owner Inter Ikea Group. ""For both customers and co-workers, the Ikea Catalogue is a publication that brings a lot of emotions, memories and joy. For 70 years it has been one of our most unique and iconic products."" The company has already increased digital investments, Mr Gruss said, as media consumption and customer behaviours change. Ikea said online sales had increased by 45% worldwide last year. However,the company - which has 445 stores - announced in October it planned to open dozens of new stores, including in the UK. The first catalogue was printed in 1951 In 2012, the catalogue sparked controversy whenimages of women were missing in a version distributed in Saudi Arabia.The company then attributed the gaffe to the fact its Saudi operation was run by a franchisee.

"Fauci: ""We've got to not walk away from the facts and the data"" Top US diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci has warned of another surge in Covid cases after Christmas - even with the rise following Thanksgiving still being tackled. He said the longer Christmas/New Year period may be even more of a challenge. The US is seeing peak infections of close to 200,000 a day on average with record numbers of people in hospital. California is under a strict new lockdown, with other states announcing record increases. A US city engulfed by Covid, but no lockdown Where has been hit hardest? US vaccine chief sees 'light at end of the tunnel' The US has recorded more than 14.7 million cases of infection in the pandemic so far and 282,500 deaths,according to Johns Hopkins University research,external, both global highs. President Donald Trump has been accused of playing down measures such as mask wearing but the US has also had to deal with different states taking different approaches to tackling the virus. Dr Fauci, who has been asked by President-elect Joe Biden to be his Covid chief medical adviser, told CNN his concerns for Christmas were the same as his concerns for  Thanksgiving, ""only this may be even more compounded because it's a longer holiday"". A pre-Christmas event in Los Angeles, California, now has strict lockdown measures He said nobody wanted to modify or shut down the holiday season, but ""we're at a very critical time... we've got to not walk away from the facts and the data. This is tough going for all of us"". Millions defied appeals from experts not to travel over the Thanksgiving period - the Sunday after the Thursday 26 November holiday saw the most air travellers since March and the Covid effects are still to be fully felt. Dr Fauci, who has been part of the Trump administration's response to Covid-19 but has also drawn criticism from the president for his views, said people tended to return to work the week following Thanksgiving but that this is often not the case with Christmas leading into New Year. On Sunday, former Food and Drug Administration (FDA) commissioner Scott Gottlieb said US deaths could be near 400,000 by the end of January, adding: ""As bad as things are right now, they're going to get a lot worse."" Also on Sunday, Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator, criticised the Trump administration for flouting guidelines and peddling ""myths"" about the pandemic. California has ordered much of the state to stay at home, after it set a daily record of 30,000 new cases on Sunday. In the south of the state, fewer than 15% of intensive care hospital beds are empty. This video can not be played ""I don't need your instruction"": Two US senators clash on wearing face masks in the chamber Dr Fauci told Californian officials they ""really don't have any choice"" in imposing some of the strictest measures in the US, including bans on restaurant dining and private gatherings. The lockdown, affecting around 85% of the state's 40 million people, will last for at least three weeks and until Intensive Care Unit (ICU) capacity goes above 15% again. New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo has called on retired doctors and nurses to return to work and said if the number of patients in hospital did not decrease in five days, indoor dining in New York City would stop. But New York did reopen some of its schools on Monday, allowing some in-person instruction at younger ages - a move guided by figures showing lower Covid positivity rates in schools. Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker said the state had witnessed a post-Thanksgiving surge, saying infections ""took off like a rocket"". New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia have also announced record one-day rises in new cases. The FDA could authorise the Pfizer vaccine - approved in the UK - on Thursday, with vaccinations taking place just a few days later. They will be rationed and targeted but the Trump administration hopes to vaccinate as many as 24 million people by mid-January. This video can not be played Moncef Slaoui told CBS News that Americans could take comfort in vaccine news but still needed to follow Covid-19 guidance Health Secretary Alex Azar said the White House would host a vaccine distribution summit on Tuesday to align governors, retail pharmacy chains and shipping firms. The White House's vaccination campaign, called Operation Warp Speed, has said there could be a significant decrease in death rates among the elderly by the end of January. Some experts questioned both the number of vaccines projected to be administered by January and the effect on the death rate, given the latest surges. Meanwhile, Mr Biden on Monday announced his nominations for health secretary - California Attorney General Xavier Becerra - and head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Rochelle Walensky. Both were welcomed by Dr Fauci. Mr Biden, who will be sworn in on 20 January, vowed that his administration would be ""ready on day one to mobilise every resource of the federal government... and restore the belief that there is nothing beyond America's capacity"".

"Visitors to 14 care homes will be offered faster Covid tests in a trial across five local authority areas. It will take place in homes in North Ayrshire, Fife, Argyll and Bute, Inverclyde and Aberdeenshire. Testing kits will then be sent out to all care homes in Scotland from 14 December. The lateral flow tests do not need to go to labs and can give results in under an hour. Visitors who test negative will still have to wear PPE. If there is a positive result the visitor will be advised to leave the home, self-isolate and book a PCR test at a coronavirus testing centre. A separate pilot in Liverpool showedthe rapid tests missed half of all cases, raising questions about whether they are worthwhile. First Covid-19 vaccine arrives in Scotland Rapid coronavirus test use defended When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Covid patients still being sent to care homes Health Minister Jeane Freeman has called the move a positive step for care homes, residents and their families and friends. She said: ""This will provide another important layer of protection against Covid, alongside the essential PPE and infection prevention and control measures already in place. ""I'm very pleased to say we will be able to significantly accelerate the delivery of testing kits to all care homes from 14 December, following the necessary trial phase to ensure we have the right guidance and training in place."" The vaccination programme will begin on Tuesday She added: ""This will require a significant amount of work from care homes, and we will continue to work closely with Health and Social Care Partnerships, Scottish Care, CCPS and Cosla as test kits are rolled out to ensure they have the support they need to deliver testing for designated visitors. ""However, it's important to remember that testing does not replace the other vital layers of protection we have against Covid, and all of these - reducing contacts, keeping our distance, wearing face coverings, and vaccines when they come - work most effectively to stop the virus when they are used together."" Not all care homes are expected to be able to offer the tests to visitors by Christmas, so the government has confirmed PCR tests will be available for visitors at coronavirus testing centres. Lateral flow tests are not as sensitive as traditional PCR testing but do not need to be analysed in a laboratory so they can produce same-day results. Designated visitors will be able to take the test to indicate whether they have the virus ahead of seeing friends, relatives and loved ones in care homes. On Saturday, Ms Freeman announced that the new Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had arrived in Scotland and that vaccinations would begin on Tuesday. The first groups to receive them will include the elderly, care home residents and staff, and frontline health and social care workers. The UK government has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, with two shots each. About 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be available in the UK next week, with about 65,500 being made available for Scotland. Half of the initial supplies of the vaccine that arrive in Scotland in December will be held back for the second dose. The Scottish government has bought 23 ultra-low temperature freezers to store the vaccine. They will be based at all major acute hospitals across the country and on Scotland's islands. There had been fears that homes would not be able to receive the first batch of doses due to logistical challenges caused by the vaccine having to be stored at -70C. But Ms Freeman said on Thursday that confirmation on how the vaccine could be transported and stored meant it would now be possible to deliver them to care homes.

"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will travel to Brussels later this week to meet European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a last-ditch bid to reach a post-Brexit trade deal. It comes after a 90-minute phone call between the two leaders on Monday failed to produce a breakthrough. In a joint statement, they said the conditions for a deal were ""not there"". ""Significant differences"" remained on fishing, business competition rules and governance of any deal, they added. ""We asked our chief negotiators and their teams to prepare an overview of the remaining differences to be discussed in a physical meeting in Brussels in the coming days,"" the leaders said. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Wednesday or Friday appeared the ""most likely"" dates. Labour welcomed the decision to keep talking, but shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the prime minister should have been ""more engaged in these negotiations months ago rather than leaving it to the 11th hour"". What happens if there's a no-deal Brexit? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: What is a level playing field? EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK counterpart Lord Frost have been locked in intensive talks for the past week. They will meet again on Tuesday to draw up a list of outstanding differences. And on Thursday, EU leaders will meet at a summit in Brussels. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months Talks are on again:The UK and the EU have until 31 December to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes What happens next with Brexit? A senior UK government source said: ""Talks are in the same position now as they were on Friday. We have made no tangible progress. It's clear this must now continue politically."" They added that the government did not ""consider this process to be closed"" but ""things are looking very tricky and there's every chance we are not going to get there"". The UK and EU have been trading for years without paying tariffs or doing customs or border checks. Rules have stayed the same despite the UK leaving the EU on 31 January, but that is all set to change at the start of next year. If an agreement is not reached and ratified by 31 December, the UK and EU could introduce import charges on each other's goods. The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility has said leaving the EU customs union and single market without a trade deal could lead to a 2% reduction in national income next year.

News of the upcoming meeting between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen came as a bit of a relief to those close to the EU negotiating team. There's been a sense of frustration building for months now at the circular nature of talks. EU and UK negotiators say they've gone over and over the three main sticking points: fish, competition regulations and how to police a deal, if one is ever reached. There's been mutual, mounting frustration at the perceived intransigence of the other side and a questioning of whether sitting down together one more time to repeat the same arguments - again - could ever be the solution. Political intervention at the highest level has long been needed, to give a nod and a wink to negotiators to agree the difficult compromises, or to get involved in person. Phone calls between the prime minister and the European Commission president (who represents all 27 EU countries in this case) have seemed inconclusive so far. Face-to-face, this could be different. The two leaders might finally find agreement, give the decisive push to get there, or maybe jointly admit that this deal can't be done now. The UK and EU are at loggerheads over the so-called""level playing field""- a set of shared rules and standards to ensure businesses in one country do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors in others.

And the two sides disagree on how any future trading disputes should be resolved.

"The National Trust, which owns the beach, said it was investigating the shiny pillar A monolith has mysteriously appeared in Britain - just days after similar ones were spotted in the US and Romania. The unusual mirrored structure was discovered on the Isle of Wight, an island off the south coast of England. Resident Alexia Fishwick said she ""was dumbstruck"" when she came across it during a beach walk on Sunday and described it as ""really quite magical"". A monolith found in Utah last month created wild speculation on social media and apparent copycats. Many observers have presumed they were art installations left by sculptors. The metal edifice in Utah was found planted in the ground before it disappeared just days later. This video can not be played The unusual object in the desert in the US state of Utah was found by a helicopter crew while conducting a count of big horn sheep in the area Two other shining metal towers later appeared in Romania and southern California. Ms Fishwick said: ""I'd read about the one in Utah and then Romania, so I knew the significance. Many people took no notice of it."" She said people first thought she had photoshopped the images when she put them online. Lee Peckham, a lawyer living on the island, said: ""I saw it and wondered what it was and thought it a rather strange thing to see on the beach. I wondered who put it there and why."" DJ Rob da Bank, another island resident, was also among those who took a stroll to see the sight for themselves. He mused: ""I'm not sure if it's aliens, a Coldplay PR stunt or a local mirror dealer drumming up trade, but it got us all down the beach anyway."" The National Trust, which owns the site, said it had no immediate plans to remove the monolith, which it said was erected without permission. A spokesman said: ""We were unaware of the monolith's presence until this morning, but we've now visited Compton Beach and it seems secure on a wooden plinth and is made from mirrored sections of plastic or perspex material. ""We need to monitor over the next few days to ensure the beach remains safe and does not become overcrowded."" Alexia Fishwick described the monolith as ""incredibly graceful"" An anonymous collective called The Most Famous Artist has taken credit for the monoliths in Utah and California. It posted an image of the Utah monolith on Instagram, with a 45,000 US dollar (Â£34,000) price tag. However, when asked about the Isle of Wight structure, it said: ""The monolith is out of my control at this point. Godspeed to all the aliens working hard around the globe to propagate the myth."" People have tracked down the mystery Utah monolith Mysterious metal monolith found in Utah desert News of the monolith on the island has caused a stir on social media with some posting in jest - that the monolith - which already has its own Instagram page - could be a portal to another dimension. In 2001: A Space Odyssey - the 1968 film directed by Stanley Kubrick - imposing black monoliths created by an unseen alien species appear in the movie, based on the writings of novelist Arthur C Clarke. Most observers reflecting on their trip to the mysterious monolith suspected it was left by an artist rather than an alien species. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Fifty hospitals in England have been chosen as hubs for administering the vaccine The armed forces could help transport further stocks of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from Belgium to the UK, with vaccinations due to begin on Tuesday. Asked if a no-deal Brexit could delay supplies, James Cleverly said it was a ""top priority"" and the government would look to ensure supplies were available ""in whatever circumstance"". Military personnel are already helping to construct vaccination centres. Health Secretary Matt Hancocktweeted,externalall parts of the UK had vaccine doses. Front-line health staff, those over 80, and care home workers will be first in line for the vaccine. In England, 50 hospitals have been initially chosen to serve as hubs for administering it. Scotland,Wales, andNorthern Irelandwill also begin their vaccination programmes from hospitals on Tuesday. On Monday, the government announced a further 14,718 people had tested positive for the virus, while a further 189 people had died within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 61,434. The Ministry of Defence said 60 military planners are working with the government's vaccine task force, with a further 56 personnel helping to construct vaccination centres. Armed Forces minister James Heappey said around 13,500 military personnel were on ""high readiness"" - with more than 2,000 deployed so far to help with testing and the government's Covid response. What are the safety checks for vaccines? Who will get the Covid vaccine first? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' Refrigerated containers holding the vaccine doses, which need to be kept at -70C,have been arriving in the UK from Belgium, where it is made, and are being prepared to be moved from secure locations to the hospitals. Asked whether the armed forces would be used to help transport the vaccine to the UK, Mr Cleverly told BBC Breakfast: ""Potentially - we are looking at non-commercial flight options."" In response to concerns a no-deal Brexit could cause delays in getting the vaccine into the UK, he said: ""This is such an important product, it's probably perhaps the most important product, so we will look to ensure that those supplies are available in the UK in whatever circumstance."" Asked to confirm if this meant the armed forces would be used if needed, he said: ""If we need to."" It comes as talks between the UK and the EU continuein a bid to reach a post-Brexit trade deal. Downing Street did not deny that RAF flights could be used to bring supplies of the vaccine over from other European countries if there were problems at ports caused by a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister's official spokesman would not comment on specific plans for ""security reasons"". But he said ""the military will have a role to play in what's been an enormous logistical challenge and I'm sure they will continue to do so as we move forward"". Vaccines were delivered to Croydon University Hospital on Sunday About 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be available in the UK from next week. So far the government has ordered a total of 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, with two shots each, 21 days apart. With limited quantities initially available, elderly people who are already attending hospital as an outpatient, as well as those who are being discharged after a hospital stay, will be among the first to receive the jab. Others over the age of 80 will be invited to attend the hospital to receive a jab, and care home providers will be able to book their staff into vaccination clinics. Any appointments not used for these groups will be used for healthcare workers who are at highest risk of serious illness from the virus. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - which represents hospitals and other NHS trusts in England - said people over 80 should not be concerned if they did not receive a letter calling them to be vaccinated this month, as the ""vast majority"" of people would have to wait until next year. The Mail on Sunday,externalreported that the Queen, who is 94, is expected to receive the vaccine ""within weeks"" - and then reveal she has had it to boost public take-up of the jab. The paper quoted senior sources who said the monarch and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, will not get ""preferential treatment"" but will wait their turn in the priorities list. Asked whether the Queen would receive the vaccination this week, the prime minister's official spokesman said it was a matter for Buckingham Palace. However, he added: ""It is obviously a statement of fact that the Queen and Prince Philip are over 80 and are in a priority group."" This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? Although care home residents and staff were placed at the top of the priority list agreed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), they are not getting the very first vaccinations. The government has explained this is because the chosen hospital hubs already have the facilities to store the vaccine at the required temperature of -70C. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government was doing everything it could to overcome ""significant challenges"" to ensure care home residents were vaccinated as soon as possible.

"Glasgow is one of the areas which are subject to the highest level of restrictions The 11 Scottish council areas which are subject to the highest tier of Covid-19 restrictions will exit level four on Friday, Nicola Sturgeon has confirmed. The first minister said a decision on the levels that each region will be placed in will be taken on Tuesday. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman had said on Sunday that ""all options are on the table"" for the areas, beforerevising her comments later in the day. Ms Sturgeon confirmed the councils ""will all come out of level four"". She said it was likely that most of the areas would drop into level three, with the government taking a ""cautious"" approach to alert levels. When will I be vaccinated against Covid? What level is your council area in? What are Scotland's level 4 restrictions? The 11 council areas in west and central Scotland', including Glasgow, were placed in the top tier of restrictions on 20 November in a ""short and sharp"" effort to contain the spread of the virus. This was described as a three-week measure which would come to an end on 11 December. However, some doubt appeared to be cast on this when the health minster was interviewed on the BBC's Sunday Politics programme. Asked whether some of the level four areas ""will remain so after the end of next week"", and whether they could still be in the top tier at Christmas, Ms Freeman replied that ""all options are on the table"". She later clarified that the 11 councils would come out of level four on Friday, and that her comments were intended to be about ""what level below four they'll go into"". Speaking at her daily coronavirus briefing on Monday, Ms Sturgeon reiterated: ""We've always said that those authorities would move out of that level on Friday and that remains the case."" The first minister said she would not pre-empt the review, as the levels for each council are due to be signed off by her cabinet on Tuesday morning. However, she said she would continue to take a ""cautious"" approach. She added: ""The one thing that we are being firm about is that the level four areas will all come out of level four. ""Whether they go to level three, which I think is probably likely, or whether any of them might go to a lower level, that's something we will look at over the course of the day."" The council areas currently subject to level four restrictions are: East Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, East Renfrewshire, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire, Stirling, West Dunbartonshire and West Lothian. The rest of the country is in levels one to three of the five-tier system. Ms Sturgeon said the government would also be looking at whether any other areas should either move up or down a level. Meanwhile, the first Covid-19 vaccines are to be administered in Scotland on Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon said this was ""extremely positive news"" - but that it was ""important we not drop our guard."" She said: ""Now we can see the prospect of the return to a more normal way of life, that should give us all the more incentive to stay safe and keep each other safe."" The first doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness -arrived in Scotland over the weekend, and have now been delivered to local health boards. Staff who will administer the vaccine will be the first to receive it, with the more elderly and vulnerable groups of the population next in line. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Vaccination is a major logistical exercise and it will take us time to work through the programme. The recent news doesn't remove the need for caution during this winter period.""

"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will travel to Brussels later this week to meet European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a last-ditch bid to reach a post-Brexit trade deal. It comes after a 90-minute phone call between the two leaders on Monday failed to produce a breakthrough. In a joint statement, they said the conditions for a deal were ""not there"". ""Significant differences"" remained on fishing, business competition rules and governance of any deal, they added. ""We asked our chief negotiators and their teams to prepare an overview of the remaining differences to be discussed in a physical meeting in Brussels in the coming days,"" the leaders said. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Wednesday or Friday appeared the ""most likely"" dates. Labour welcomed the decision to keep talking, but shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the prime minister should have been ""more engaged in these negotiations months ago rather than leaving it to the 11th hour"". What happens if there's a no-deal Brexit? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: What is a level playing field? EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK counterpart Lord Frost have been locked in intensive talks for the past week. They will meet again on Tuesday to draw up a list of outstanding differences. And on Thursday, EU leaders will meet at a summit in Brussels. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months Talks are on again:The UK and the EU have until 31 December to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes What happens next with Brexit? A senior UK government source said: ""Talks are in the same position now as they were on Friday. We have made no tangible progress. It's clear this must now continue politically."" They added that the government did not ""consider this process to be closed"" but ""things are looking very tricky and there's every chance we are not going to get there"". The UK and EU have been trading for years without paying tariffs or doing customs or border checks. Rules have stayed the same despite the UK leaving the EU on 31 January, but that is all set to change at the start of next year. If an agreement is not reached and ratified by 31 December, the UK and EU could introduce import charges on each other's goods. The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility has said leaving the EU customs union and single market without a trade deal could lead to a 2% reduction in national income next year.

"From 1 January, the free movement of people and goods and services between the UK and the EU will end. This means significant differences to how people live, work and travel. Here are some of the most important things that are changing. From January, UK nationals will only be able to travel without a visa toSchengen area countries,externalfor up to 90 days in any 180-day period (this includes most EU nations and Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein). In addition, you will need to: Have at least six months left on your passport, except for trips to Ireland. Have travel insurance with health cover. Your current EHIC cardwill be valid until its expiry dateand will be replaced by a new scheme in the future, but the government still advises you to get travel insurance with health cover. Make sure you've checked roaming charges with your mobile provider, as theguarantee of free roaming will end. Have obtained an animal health certificate from your vet at least 10 days before you travel -if you are travelling with your pet- including from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The current EU pet passport scheme will no longer apply. Use separate lanes from EU, EEA and Swiss citizens at border control. Significantly, because of the Covid pandemic, travellers from non-EU countries - including the UK - will not be able to visit the EU at the moment, except for a certain number of essential reasons. When the UK was an EU member, you were allowed to bring unlimited amounts of alcohol and tobacco back from an EU country without paying any duty at the border, as long as duty had been paid in the country where you bought it and you could prove it was for your own use. From 2021, duty-free shopping will be available if you travel to the EU, although there will now be limits to the amount you can bring in duty-free from the EU, as there are for arrivals from non-EU countries. The permitted amount of duty-free tobacco and alcoholwill increase,externalhowever. So you will be able, for example, to bring 18 litres of still wine and 42 litres of beer. If you're already living in an EU country, you will have certain protections under thewithdrawal agreement.,external But even then, you shouldcheck that country's specific rules.,externalYou may need to register or apply for residency, get new documents, or meet specific requirements - like having a job. For example, UK nationalsliving in France,externalwill need to obtain new residents' permits. If you plan to move to the EU in 2021, you willno longer have an automatic rightto live, work, study or retire there. You will need a visa if you are going there for any reason other than tourism. The rules will depend on the country you want to move to, and the reason for your move. You shouldcheck the rules,externalfor the country that you are intending to move to. People planning tomove to Ireland,externalwill be largely unaffected. If you're an EU citizen living in the UK by 31 December 2020 - or from Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway or Switzerland - your rights remain the same until 30 June 2021. But you shouldcheck if you can stay,externalafter that. If you have ""indefinite leave to remain"" or ""indefinite leave to enter"" the UK there's no need for you to do anything. If you don't, you'll need to apply for theEU Settlement Scheme,externalor become aUK citizen,externalif you qualify. Again, because of theCommon Travel Area,,externalrights of Irish citizens will not change. From January, there'll be a newpoints-based system,externalfor foreign citizens (except Irish nationals) wanting to move to the UK. The government says it'll treat EU and non-EU citizens equally and will aim to attract people who can contribute to the UK economy. People wanting to move to the UK to work, live or study will have to apply and pay for a visa. It will costÂ£348 to apply for a student visa from outside the UK,external, or Â£475 to extend or switch one from inside the UK. Applying for a visa as a skilled workerwill cost between Â£610 and Â£1,408 per person,external- unless an individual has skills the country is short of. People applying for visas will also have to pay a health surcharge of Â£624 per person per year, unless they are healthcare workers. How will the UK points-based immigration system work? The UK and the EU have agreed there'll be no taxes on each other's goods when they cross borders and no limits on the amount of things that can be traded. However, traders in England, Wales and Scotland (for the case of Northern Ireland, see below) will need to make customs declarations as if they were dealing with countries elsewhere in the world - this means a lot of paperwork. Some products, including plants, live animals and some foods, will also needspecial licences and certificates,external. Others will have to be labelled in specific ways. There will no longer be automatic recognition of professional qualifications - people will need to check each country's rules to make sure their qualifications are still recognised. And while the UK government has chosen to delay - by six months - the imposition of full controls, the EU will be carrying out checks from 1 January. Even though trade with the EU will become trickier,the UK is free to negotiate its own trade deals with other countries, like the US. Brexit supporters say this will benefit the economy in the long run, although critics say it's more important to remain close to the EU. A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal The UK and EU have agreed to keep an all-but-invisible border, without checkpoints, between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland (which remains in the EU). Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules, meaning that lorries can continue to drive across the border without having to be inspected. However, some new checks will be needed on certain goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales) instead. Food products - such as meat, fish and eggs - will need to be checked to ensure they comply with EU standards. However, in order to reduce any potential disruption,supermarkets will be given an initial three-month ""grace period""where the rules will not be enforced on the food they bring into Northern Ireland. Certain meat products will have a longer, six-month grace period. What happens after this period is unclear and will be the subject of future negotiations. An agreement has also been reached to eliminate tariffs - extra charges on goods - for most trade between Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) and Northern Ireland. Some new paperwork will nevertheless be required from 1 January and businesses will need be ready for the changes. What will happen in Northern Ireland after Brexit?

"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen when they met earlier this year It's not over, not yet. The two sides in this complicated and drawn out process have agreed that it is worth trying one last time to find a way through their profound differences. But the statements from the prime minister and the EU chief, Ursula von der Leyen, signal clearly that a trade deal is out of reach right now - spelling out that if no-one budges in the next few days, it's simply not going to happen. UK-EU trade talks to resume over 'critical issues' LIVE: Leaders agree to resume post-Brexit trade talks What's going on with Brexit? A feature of Brexit negotiations has often been the last minute stand off, the political emergency, before suddenly, lo and behold, a deal emerges from the wreckage. By Monday night, that tradition may have been proven again. Yet it seems there is a lot more to be done than ironing out a few last minute glitches. The UK believes that after months of talks, the EU - pushed by some member states - has hardened its stance on the same old stumbling blocks. And that's pushed a deal that was in reach just a few days ago, further away. For both sides, not reaching a deal would be a political failure. The prime minister has warned that it might not come to pass and has tried to assure the public about what would happen if it can't be done. But the UK and the EU have both said on repeated occasions that a deal is what they want - eager to avoid the disruption of leaving the transition period at the end of this year without arrangements in place. And their negotiating teams have worked for months on the mechanics of how the conundrums over our departure from the trading bloc could be resolved. But the two sides are still stuck over the fundamental, political question - who really calls the shots. It was Theresa May who coined the phrase, ""no deal is better than a bad deal"". In the next 48 hours, Boris Johnson and the European Union have to decide if they want to test if she was right.

"Johan van Zyl said Brexit and Covid were a ""double whammy"" for Toyota The boss of Toyota's European business has warned that a no-deal Brexit could make its UK plants uncompetitive. Dr Johan van Zyl said such an outcome would create a ""very negative investment environment"" in Britain and be ""very, very negative"" for his business. He told the BBC the combination of Brexit and the Covid crisis was a ""double whammy"" for the carmaker. Toyota has two plants in the UK, which employ about 3,000 people in total. But Mr van Zyl said no decisions on the future of its UK plants - a car factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire and an engine facility at Deeside in North Wales - could be taken until the outcome of trade talks was known. Like other manufacturers, Toyota has been badly affected by the Covid outbreak. Both its UK plants were forced to suspend production during the spring lockdown, while showrooms were also forced to close. Now the company is forecasting a strong recovery for its European business. But according to Dr van Zyl, its UK recovery could be made more difficult by Brexit. ""We have Brexit, and we have Covid, and this is a double whammy which is happening to us"", he said during an online media event. ""When it comes to the recoveryâ¦ it's going to be more difficult if Brexit of course is negative, or a hard Brexit"". UK car industry warns of Â£55bn no-deal Brexit hit Nissan warns on its UK future without a Brexit deal The company has, he said, already taken steps to mitigate the impact of a no-deal scenario - but there is a limit to what it can do. ""What we could put in place, we have done - in terms of adjusting our systems, looking at customs procedures which will be required, looking at increasing stock levels. ""Up to a point we can do it. But you can't do a huge amount of that - it's only a limited few days. ""So it can be very, very negative for our business if we have a no-deal scenario. Very negative. And even if there is a deal, we need to know the content of the deal. We need to get those details to really be able to establish what is the real impact. We haven't seen those yet"". It is not yet clear what the future holds for Toyota's UK plants. The company recently invested Â£240m in equipping the Burnaston factory to build its latest vehicle platforms. Dr van Zyl insists that: ""We have confidence in our colleagues in the UK. They're doing an excellent job so far"". But the longer-term outlook may be bleaker, in an industry where product cycles tend to last around seven years. ""We have always said that if, for instance Brexit, is very negative, it will be a very negative investment environment, so we need first to see the outcome before we can judge what we are really going to do"", he says. Tariffs on cross channel trade, he explains, could make a big difference. ""If 90% of what you produce in the UK is exported to the EU, and you've got to do it at a duty, then you're not competitive. You will not be able to compete with plants in Europe. So it is a very difficult situation ""But let's see what the outcome of the negotiations is, then we can really decide what we're going to do.""

"Police said they found between 100 and 150 people inside the property in Lace Street A house party with up to 150 guests has been broken up by police in Nottingham. The 20-year-old organiser of the illegal gathering, in Lace Street, is facing a fine of up to Â£10,000 after officers arrived at about 00:30 GMT. Several guests were given Â£200 penalties for breaking Covid-19 rules and a 19-year-old man was charged with obstructing a police officer. Nottingham is currently subject to tier three restrictions, which bans different households mixing indoors. The 19-year-old was also fined Â£200 and bailed to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on 26 January. Meanwhile, the party host has been reported for summons and could be given the maximum fine under Covid-19 regulations.

Today's live page was written by Hazel Shearing, Francesca Gillett and Victoria Bisset. It was edited by Owen Amos and Mal Siret. We're about to wrap up for the day. Before we do, here's the latest virus news from the UK: Here's a reminder of the day's top global stories: Tomorrow could mark ""a decisive turning point in the battle against coronavirus,"" NHS England's chief executive has said. ""Tomorrow is the beginning of the biggest vaccination campaign in our history, building on successes from previous campaigns against conditions (and) diseases like polio, meningitis, and tuberculosis,"" Sir Simon Stevens said on the eve of the vaccine roll-out. He said that hospitals, then GPs and pharmacists, ""are going to be vaccinating at least until next spring"" and urged people to ""continue to be very careful"". ""If we do that I think there's every chance that we will look back on tomorrow as marking a decisive turning point in the battle against coronavirus,"" he said. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says about 250,000 doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine will be available by the end of the year. These early doses will be prioritised for long-term care workers and people in care homes. The vaccine will be distributed across the country on a per-capita basis, he said, which means that provinces with higher populations will get more doses. The government could approve the vaccine as early as this week, and doses could be ready for distribution next week, Mr Trudeau added. The Mona Lisa hangs on the wall of the empty Louvre If you've ever wished you could see priceless pieces of art without the crowds, now's your chance. After being closed for more than five months this year due to the pandemic, the Louvre in Paris is offering unique experiences to help make up some of its financial losses. With many of the bids starting around â¬10,000 (Â£9,000), you could explore the museum by torchlight, attend a private concert held in your honour, or become one of the few people in the world to see Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa taken down for its annual examination. The most expensive item so far is an oil painting by Pierre Soulages, which has received a bid of â¬800,000. Yann Le Touher, who handles relations with the Louvre's patrons, told Reuters news agency that the museum expected to lose up to â¬90m this year, and that money provided by the French state would only cover around half of the shortfall. The online auction is being held byChristies,externaland will end on 15 December. The competition may have moved online, but that did not discourage the bakers taking part in Sweden's annual gingerbread contest. From Zoom drinks to people sitting on a park bench (while maintaining social distancing rules, of course), this year's bakers showed how the pandemic had changed many aspects of daily life, even in a country that has shown a much less strict approach to dealing with coronavirus than the rest of Europe. Even Sweden's top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, turned up in gingerbread form at the Arkdes Museum of Architecture and Design in Stockholm - with the creator telling Reuters news agency that he wanted to get across the message of social distancing. In England, some fans are allowed to return to stadiums such as Liverpool on Sunday - but in Wales they are still banned Elite-level sports clubs in Wales have warned they could face bankruptcy if a way isnât found to allow the return of spectators to Welsh stadiums. In England, up to 2,000 spectators are allowed in stadiums for matches in tier two, with 4,000 permitted in tier one areas. But the same has not been allowed in Wales, with no fans allowed back. In Scotland,the number of fans stands at 300,while some fans were allowed back in Northern Ireland beforeextra restrictions were brought in last month. Representatives of Welsh sport including the Welsh Rugby Union, the Football Association of Wales, Cardiff City FC and Swansea City FC have written an open letter to First Minister Mark Drakeford. They said âthe lack of a clear road map for the return of spectators in Wales poses the real risk of bankruptcy for our sportsâ. ""Sport is a fundamental part of life in Wales,"" the letter read. ""We form part of an an industry that employs thousands of people across the country, our contribution to the Welsh economy, employment and well-being is significant, but this is now at risk.""

As we reported earlier, William and Kate - who are also known as the Earl and Countess of Strathearn when in Scotland - visited Edinburgh as part of a three-day tour of the UK to meet key workers. The timing of the visit was particularly poignant for the Scottish Ambulance Service workers as they remembered a colleague who died with coronavirus. The 1,250 mile tour on board the royal train includes stops in England and Wales. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Throughout the pandemic we'vebeen answering your questions.The latest comes from Phil Hemingway, who asks: My 95-year-old mother has a pacemaker. Can she cope with a full-strength dose or should she wait for the half-strength first dose Oxford vaccine (subject to approval)? During the Pfizer vaccine trials, people of all ages were vaccinated to make sure it was safe and effective in older age groups who are most at risk of serious illness and death from Covid-19. In fact, the vaccine was found to be 94% effective in the over-65s. There is no evidence that the over-90s are not able to cope with two full-strength doses. The first primes the bodyâs defences against the virus, while the second dose is a booster which offers full protection after a week. Prof Van-Tam said he is""hopeful"" the Oxford vaccine will be approved by Christmas,but said: ""That's entirely out of my hands. It's down to the MHRA, the UK regulatory body. If it takes them a few weeks, or a few months, that's fine, they have to get it right."" Read more questions and answers here. We've got a little more on the UK's daily coronavirus figures, which the government published earlier. It showed a further 14,718 people had tested positive for coronavirus, and another 189 people had died.

The annual World Economic Forum traditionally takes place in Davos, Switzerland The World Economic Forum (WEF) - the annual gathering of the world's political, economic and business elite - has been forced to move next year's summit from Switzerland to Singapore because of the pandemic, organisers say. The event, which traditionally takes place in the Alpine village of Davos in January, will instead be held from 13 to 16 May. ""The change in location reflects the Forum's priority of safeguarding the health and safety of participants and the host community,"" the WEF said in a statement. It added that ""in light of the current situation with regards to Covid-19 cases"" and after ""careful consideration"", Singapore was best placed to hold the ""in-person"" meeting next year. The WEF said it planned to return to Davos in 2022. The UK governmenthas just updated its daily coronavirus figures,,externaland has announced 14,718 new confirmed cases. A further 189 people have died with coronavirus, the government added. That measure refers to people who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. It takes the total number of deaths, as recorded by the government by that measure, to 61,434. For more information on the stats and to check how many coronavirus cases are in your area,head here. Life in China is almost back to normal - despite the fact it's where the first case of coronavirus emerged. Since then, there have been lots of racist incidents towards Chinese people - online and in real life - and US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called the disease the ""China-virus"". So what's life like now for people in China, and how do they feel about the way the world views their country after the 2020 pandemic? This video can not be played The UK's Ministry of Defence has provided details on the role the armed forces are playing in the country's vaccine rollout. It said 60 military planners are  working with the government's vaccine task force - with a further 56 Armed Forces personnel now helping to construct vaccination centres. The minister for the armed forces, James Heappey, said around 13,500 military personnel were on high readiness - with just over 2,000 deployed so far to help with testing and the government's Covid response. This is the first and most important question scientists ask when they start designing and testing a new vaccine or treatment. Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. The principle is to start small and only ever move on to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns. As long as the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check that the vaccine or treatment is effective, too. That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - around 40,000 individuals in the case of Pfizer/BioNTech. All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. The Covid vaccine trials have happened at breakneck speed, but they haven't skipped any of these steps. There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against serious infections. Covid vaccines appear to stop people getting very sick and could save lives. Read more here.

Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Restaurants and most shops in Portugal were ordered to close early today on what is the eve of a national holiday as the government attempts to curb the spread of the virus over the second long weekend in two weeks. Traders were obliged to close by 15:00 and the government gave employees the day off in addition to tomorrow's holiday - as it did a week
ago, on the eve of the 1 December national holiday. A domestic travel ban has been in place since 23:00 Friday, and runs to 05:00 Wednesday, with people barred from
leaving their municipality of residence except for work or emergencies. Remote working is mandatory - where feasible - in areas deemed to
be at high, very high, or extremely high risk of transmission of the virus - affecting the vast majority of Portugal's population. In most of these areas - those deemed at very high or extremely high risk,
which include Lisbon and Porto - there is also a 13:00 curfew tomorrow.
The restrictions are in place under the state of emergency that parliament
on Friday voted to renew until 23 December. Portugal yesterday reported 3,834 new
confirmed coronavirus cases - well down from the 19 November peak of 6,994
- and 87 deaths associated with Covid. Since the start of the epidemic, the country has reported 322,474 confirmed cases and 4,963 Covid-19 deaths. Tina and Victor have been together for seven
years and usually meet up every three months in their homes in the US or

"Adrian Smith was shocked to find that a photo of him as an eight-year-old had become an internet meme. He stumbled upon the picture on Instagram, but it had come from a Tumblr blog in which his image was being used as the stepson of a fictional ""teenage stepdad"". He said he was amused by it, but admitted that as a child he would have found it ""confusing and sad"". Mr Smith's discovery has now gone more viral than the original meme. He has been in touch with its original creator, and said he was happy that the image has not been used in a ""mean spirit"". ""Teenage Stepdad"" offered to kill the character off, but Mr Smith is happy for him to carry on with it if he wishes, he said. The character which went with the photo was not a part of him, Mr Smith said. ""I had options - I could ignore it, I could get mad about it, or I could embrace it and make it part of my story now, and have it out there as an example of the chaotic randomness that happens with stuff on the internet that we put there,"" he said. Mr Smith, who lives in North Carolina, had contributed the photograph to a Tumblr blog in about 2007 where people were sharing school photos with laser backgrounds. It was taken in 1992. He said he remembered being very proud of the picture, having managed to find a top that matched the background, for which he had paid an additional $2. ""I'd like to say it's me pre-glasses, pre-braces, and 100% raw power as an eight-year-old,"" he said. ""My grin in the picture is one of smug satisfaction."" Mr Smith is himself a parent of two very young children - and said it would be a while before they understood what a meme was. But he did not wish to put them off sharing their lives online. ""The lesson is that what you put in the internet might last forever and have a life of its own, but also the internet doesn't define you, it doesn't have to be you,"" he said. ""Figure out who you are first, and if the stuff out there is part of how you want to define yourself then use it for that, if it's not, then don't."" His alter-ego has had a lively few years, sported some interesting hairstyles and made some questionable decisions, like the time he took up smoking. But Mr Smith thinks the fictional boy would also approve of his own career as an entomologist who ""puts videos about bugs on YouTube"". Viral dad on the trials of working from home.

"Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane are one of 1,300 same-sex couples in Northern Ireland who can now convert their civil partnerships into marriages Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane were the first gay men in the UK to get a civil partnership back in 2005. But they were left in a legal limbo when the laws were changed to allow same-sex couples to get married in NI. Those already in civil partnerships were denied the retrospective right to marriage, sparking a long legal battle. As of Monday, more than 1,300 same-sex couples in Northern Ireland can convert their civil partnerships into marriages. The Flanagan-Kanes were among the first going through the process. Finance Minister Conor Murphy said 17 couples were expected to convert their civil partnerships to marriages on Monday, with a total of 32 planned for this week. Mr Murphy said that as ""a gesture of support"", he had waived the conversion fee for those couples and for all couples who wish to convert their civil partnership to a marriage for a year. Looking forward to their ceremony, Chris said it was worth the court case to finally have their love recognised as equal. ""Love is love,"" he said. ""If you fall in love, you want to get married and want the same rights as our heterosexual brothers and sisters. ""But in Northern Ireland we were denied the right to have equal marriage."" Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane with their son Aodhan In 2005, they initially thought they would only be able to get a blessing as a recognition they were a couple. But a chance phone call revealed they could actually be the first to use the new rights to a same-sex civil partnership. ""We come from a strong family unit and we always grew up believing that when you met somebody and you fall in love you go and get married,"" said Chris. ""Unfortunately we couldn't, but the next best thing then was to get a civil partnership so we waited for that."" This video can not be played 'This is just a day of equality' - civil partnerships can now be converted to marriages in NI Another important thing for the Flanagan-Kanes was to become parents together - but adoption for same-sex couples in Northern Ireland was banned until 2013. When the ban was lifted and they successfully adopted their two children - Aodhan, eight, and Evelyn, two - Chris said they found there was still ""discrimination"" around civil partnerships. He said: ""When we were filling in primary school forms and ticking a civil partnership box, you were kind of setting yourself up for discrimination before anyone had even met you. ""We were going in somewhere with a big flashing sign saying 'I'm gay' - so other people with opinions on that or who were prejudiced against that, they were forming them already before they had even met you. ""So that was a big thing for us as well, about getting full, equal marriage rights."" That experience meant the new parents increasingly felt they needed to be married as opposed to being in a civil partnership. Chris said they did not want their children to grow up feeling their family was not worth as much as other families. ""It was for the kids and for the future,"" he said. Judge dismisses same sex marriage case ""Gay weddings"" first for Belfast,external ""We don't want our kids growing up thinking we're not equal to everyone else in the world, that we're lesser people or we're doing something wrong. ""We'll have been in a civil partnership 15 years next month, we've got two kids - you know what, we're doing better than some heterosexual couples and we've lasted a lot longer too."" They teamed up with a lesbian couple in the same predicament, crowdfunded legal fees and took the NI Office to court over the decision not to allow conversions. Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane at their civil partnership ceremony in 2005 New regulations to allow conversions from 7 December were introduced to Parliament in October by Northern Ireland minister Robin Walker. So on Monday, the Flanagan-Kanes will be able to hold their marriage ceremony at Belfast City Hall, which will be retrospectively applied back to 2005. That means they can celebrate their 15th anniversary on 19 December as an officially married couple. ""It's been a long, long slog,"" he said. ""It's been through a lot of people fighting behind the scenes to try and get these rights. ""We're not asking for anything special - we're just looking for the same human rights as everyone else.""

Today's live page was written by Hazel Shearing, Francesca Gillett and Victoria Bisset. It was edited by Owen Amos and Mal Siret. We're about to wrap up for the day. Before we do, here's the latest virus news from the UK: Here's a reminder of the day's top global stories: Tomorrow could mark ""a decisive turning point in the battle against coronavirus,"" NHS England's chief executive has said. ""Tomorrow is the beginning of the biggest vaccination campaign in our history, building on successes from previous campaigns against conditions (and) diseases like polio, meningitis, and tuberculosis,"" Sir Simon Stevens said on the eve of the vaccine roll-out. He said that hospitals, then GPs and pharmacists, ""are going to be vaccinating at least until next spring"" and urged people to ""continue to be very careful"". ""If we do that I think there's every chance that we will look back on tomorrow as marking a decisive turning point in the battle against coronavirus,"" he said. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says about 250,000 doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine will be available by the end of the year. These early doses will be prioritised for long-term care workers and people in care homes. The vaccine will be distributed across the country on a per-capita basis, he said, which means that provinces with higher populations will get more doses. The government could approve the vaccine as early as this week, and doses could be ready for distribution next week, Mr Trudeau added. The Mona Lisa hangs on the wall of the empty Louvre If you've ever wished you could see priceless pieces of art without the crowds, now's your chance. After being closed for more than five months this year due to the pandemic, the Louvre in Paris is offering unique experiences to help make up some of its financial losses. With many of the bids starting around â¬10,000 (Â£9,000), you could explore the museum by torchlight, attend a private concert held in your honour, or become one of the few people in the world to see Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa taken down for its annual examination. The most expensive item so far is an oil painting by Pierre Soulages, which has received a bid of â¬800,000. Yann Le Touher, who handles relations with the Louvre's patrons, told Reuters news agency that the museum expected to lose up to â¬90m this year, and that money provided by the French state would only cover around half of the shortfall. The online auction is being held byChristies,externaland will end on 15 December. The competition may have moved online, but that did not discourage the bakers taking part in Sweden's annual gingerbread contest. From Zoom drinks to people sitting on a park bench (while maintaining social distancing rules, of course), this year's bakers showed how the pandemic had changed many aspects of daily life, even in a country that has shown a much less strict approach to dealing with coronavirus than the rest of Europe. Even Sweden's top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, turned up in gingerbread form at the Arkdes Museum of Architecture and Design in Stockholm - with the creator telling Reuters news agency that he wanted to get across the message of social distancing. In England, some fans are allowed to return to stadiums such as Liverpool on Sunday - but in Wales they are still banned Elite-level sports clubs in Wales have warned they could face bankruptcy if a way isnât found to allow the return of spectators to Welsh stadiums. In England, up to 2,000 spectators are allowed in stadiums for matches in tier two, with 4,000 permitted in tier one areas. But the same has not been allowed in Wales, with no fans allowed back. In Scotland,the number of fans stands at 300,while some fans were allowed back in Northern Ireland beforeextra restrictions were brought in last month. Representatives of Welsh sport including the Welsh Rugby Union, the Football Association of Wales, Cardiff City FC and Swansea City FC have written an open letter to First Minister Mark Drakeford. They said âthe lack of a clear road map for the return of spectators in Wales poses the real risk of bankruptcy for our sportsâ. ""Sport is a fundamental part of life in Wales,"" the letter read. ""We form part of an an industry that employs thousands of people across the country, our contribution to the Welsh economy, employment and well-being is significant, but this is now at risk.""

As we reported earlier, William and Kate - who are also known as the Earl and Countess of Strathearn when in Scotland - visited Edinburgh as part of a three-day tour of the UK to meet key workers. The timing of the visit was particularly poignant for the Scottish Ambulance Service workers as they remembered a colleague who died with coronavirus. The 1,250 mile tour on board the royal train includes stops in England and Wales. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Throughout the pandemic we'vebeen answering your questions.The latest comes from Phil Hemingway, who asks: My 95-year-old mother has a pacemaker. Can she cope with a full-strength dose or should she wait for the half-strength first dose Oxford vaccine (subject to approval)? During the Pfizer vaccine trials, people of all ages were vaccinated to make sure it was safe and effective in older age groups who are most at risk of serious illness and death from Covid-19. In fact, the vaccine was found to be 94% effective in the over-65s. There is no evidence that the over-90s are not able to cope with two full-strength doses. The first primes the bodyâs defences against the virus, while the second dose is a booster which offers full protection after a week. Prof Van-Tam said he is""hopeful"" the Oxford vaccine will be approved by Christmas,but said: ""That's entirely out of my hands. It's down to the MHRA, the UK regulatory body. If it takes them a few weeks, or a few months, that's fine, they have to get it right."" Read more questions and answers here. We've got a little more on the UK's daily coronavirus figures, which the government published earlier. It showed a further 14,718 people had tested positive for coronavirus, and another 189 people had died. Our data team has updated the graphs which show us how the number of deaths and cases (calculated as a seven day average) is changing. Police said they found between 100 and 150 people inside the property in Lace Street A house party with up to 150 guests has been broken up by police in the English city of Nottingham. The 20-year-old organiser of the illegal gathering, in Lace Street, is facing a fine of up to Â£10,000 after officers arrived at about 00:30 GMT. Several guests were given Â£200 penalties for breaking Covid-19 rules and a 19-year-old man was charged with obstructing a police officer. The charged 19-year-old was also fined Â£200 and bailed to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on 26 January. The party host has been reported for summons and could be given the maximum fine under Covid-19 regulations. Nottingham is subject to tier three restrictions, which bans different households mixing indoors. Insp Amy English, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: ""The very last thing we want to be doing as police officers is to be punishing people for gathering together and having fun but there really are no excuses for this kind of behaviour where people are blatantly ignoring rules in such large numbers.""

The annual World Economic Forum traditionally takes place in Davos, Switzerland The World Economic Forum (WEF) - the annual gathering of the world's political, economic and business elite - has been forced to move next year's summit from Switzerland to Singapore because of the pandemic, organisers say. The event, which traditionally takes place in the Alpine village of Davos in January, will instead be held from 13 to 16 May. ""The change in location reflects the Forum's priority of safeguarding the health and safety of participants and the host community,"" the WEF said in a statement. It added that ""in light of the current situation with regards to Covid-19 cases"" and after ""careful consideration"", Singapore was best placed to hold the ""in-person"" meeting next year. The WEF said it planned to return to Davos in 2022. The UK governmenthas just updated its daily coronavirus figures,,externaland has announced 14,718 new confirmed cases. A further 189 people have died with coronavirus, the government added. That measure refers to people who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. It takes the total number of deaths, as recorded by the government by that measure, to 61,434. For more information on the stats and to check how many coronavirus cases are in your area,head here. Life in China is almost back to normal - despite the fact it's where the first case of coronavirus emerged. Since then, there have been lots of racist incidents towards Chinese people - online and in real life - and US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called the disease the ""China-virus"". So what's life like now for people in China, and how do they feel about the way the world views their country after the 2020 pandemic? This video can not be played The UK's Ministry of Defence has provided details on the role the armed forces are playing in the country's vaccine rollout. It said 60 military planners are  working with the government's vaccine task force - with a further 56 Armed Forces personnel now helping to construct vaccination centres. The minister for the armed forces, James Heappey, said around 13,500 military personnel were on high readiness - with just over 2,000 deployed so far to help with testing and the government's Covid response. This is the first and most important question scientists ask when they start designing and testing a new vaccine or treatment. Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. The principle is to start small and only ever move on to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns. As long as the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check that the vaccine or treatment is effective, too. That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - around 40,000 individuals in the case of Pfizer/BioNTech. All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. The Covid vaccine trials have happened at breakneck speed, but they haven't skipped any of these steps. There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against serious infections. Covid vaccines appear to stop people getting very sick and could save lives. Read more here.

Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Restaurants and most shops in Portugal were ordered to close early today on what is the eve of a national holiday as the government attempts to curb the spread of the virus over the second long weekend in two weeks. Traders were obliged to close by 15:00 and the government gave employees the day off in addition to tomorrow's holiday - as it did a week
ago, on the eve of the 1 December national holiday. A domestic travel ban has been in place since 23:00 Friday, and runs to 05:00 Wednesday, with people barred from
leaving their municipality of residence except for work or emergencies. Remote working is mandatory - where feasible - in areas deemed to
be at high, very high, or extremely high risk of transmission of the virus - affecting the vast majority of Portugal's population. In most of these areas - those deemed at very high or extremely high risk,
which include Lisbon and Porto - there is also a 13:00 curfew tomorrow.
The restrictions are in place under the state of emergency that parliament
on Friday voted to renew until 23 December. Portugal yesterday reported 3,834 new
confirmed coronavirus cases - well down from the 19 November peak of 6,994
- and 87 deaths associated with Covid. Since the start of the epidemic, the country has reported 322,474 confirmed cases and 4,963 Covid-19 deaths. Tina and Victor have been together for seven
years and usually meet up every three months in their homes in the US or

Hashem Abedi, 23, was jailed for murdering the 22 people who were killed in the bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert in May 2017. During his trial, he denied helping his brother Salman, 22, plan the attack that also left hundreds more injured. But a public inquiry into the bombing heard Hashem Abedi had made the admission in prison in October. During an interview with inquiry lawyers, he admitted he had ""played a full part and a knowing part in the planning and preparation for the arena attack"", in which his brother also died, the inquiry heard. Figen Murray, whose son Martyn, 29, was killed in the bombing, said ""it would have been more bearable for all of us if he told the truth"" during the trial. ""We wanted to put that chapter behind us but focus our energies on the inquiry, which continues to be a gruelling and long process,"" she added. Abedi's admission was confirmed to the inquiry by Det Ch Supt Simon Barraclough, from Greater Manchester Police, who was the senior investigating officer on the case. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, said to him: ""You are aware, on 22 October this year, in prison serving his sentence, Hashem Abedi was interviewed by members of the inquiry legal team?"" Mr Barraclough told the inquiry he knew of the admission during the interview and agreed it was a ""fair summary"" to say 23-year-old Abedi admitted he had played ""a full part and a knowing part"". Hashem Abedi is serving a minimum prison term of 55 years The detective added that there was ""no doubt in my mind"" that the prosecution of Abedi was ""entirely well founded"". Mr Greaney said: ""So the point you are making is that it didn't need him to tell you that you had got it right?"" Mr Barraclough responded: ""I think we had got there with the trial."" No further details of the prison interview were provided. The court heard how the brothers spent months ordering, stockpiling and transporting the materials required for the attack. They joined their parents in Libya the month before the blast, but Salman Abedi returned to the UK on 18 May. He bought the final components needed for the bomb before carrying out the attack as fans left the arena on the evening of 22 May 2017. Salman Abedi in the foyer of the Manchester Arena, seconds before he blew himself up Abedi was arrested shortly afterwards and extradited to Britain. He did not give evidence during his trial, providing only a statement in which he denied 22 counts of murder, attempted murder and plotting to cause an explosion likely to endanger life. Abedi originally claimed he did not hold extremist views and had been ""shocked"" by what his brother had done. ""Had I any idea of it I would have reported it to my mother initially and then to other family members to prevent it from happening,"" he said in his statement. But Abedi, formerly of Fallowfield, Manchester, was convicted by a jury at the Old Bailey and jailed for life in Augustwith a minimum term of 55 years. Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured in the explosion A forensic link to Ismail Abedi, the elder brother of Salman and Hashem Abedi, was found in a car that was used to store explosives prior to the attack, the inquiry also heard. The Nissan Micra was bought by Salman and Hashem Abedi about 40 hours before they flew to Libya with their parents in April 2017. When Salman Abedi arrived back in the UK on 18 May 2017, he went straight to the car and returned the following morning to collect explosives from the vehicle, the inquiry heard. It was previously revealed that Ramadan Abedi, father of Salman and Hashem Abedi, iswanted for questioningafter his fingerprints were found inside the Micra. During evidence by Mr Barraclough, the link to Ismail Abedi emerged. Mr Barraclough agreed when questioned by Nicholas de la Poer QC, counsel to the inquiry, that ""the fingerprints and/or DNA of Ismail Abedi and Ramadan Abedi, brother and father respectively, [had been] discovered"". The BBC recentlysought to question Ismail Abediabout his refusal to assist the inquiry, which has heard he is citing a claimed privilege against self-incrimination. The Manchester Arena inquiry, which is being chaired by Sir John Saunders, started in September and is expected to last until the spring. It aims to explore the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the attack and whether it could have been prevented. The inquiry is being held at Manchester Magistrates' Court, less than a mile away from where the bombing happened.

"Adrian Smith was shocked to find that a photo of him as an eight-year-old had become an internet meme. He stumbled upon the picture on Instagram, but it had come from a Tumblr blog in which his image was being used as the stepson of a fictional ""teenage stepdad"". He said he was amused by it, but admitted that as a child he would have found it ""confusing and sad"". Mr Smith's discovery has now gone more viral than the original meme. He has been in touch with its original creator, and said he was happy that the image has not been used in a ""mean spirit"". ""Teenage Stepdad"" offered to kill the character off, but Mr Smith is happy for him to carry on with it if he wishes, he said. The character which went with the photo was not a part of him, Mr Smith said. ""I had options - I could ignore it, I could get mad about it, or I could embrace it and make it part of my story now, and have it out there as an example of the chaotic randomness that happens with stuff on the internet that we put there,"" he said. Mr Smith, who lives in North Carolina, had contributed the photograph to a Tumblr blog in about 2007 where people were sharing school photos with laser backgrounds. It was taken in 1992. He said he remembered being very proud of the picture, having managed to find a top that matched the background, for which he had paid an additional $2. ""I'd like to say it's me pre-glasses, pre-braces, and 100% raw power as an eight-year-old,"" he said. ""My grin in the picture is one of smug satisfaction."" Mr Smith is himself a parent of two very young children - and said it would be a while before they understood what a meme was. But he did not wish to put them off sharing their lives online. ""The lesson is that what you put in the internet might last forever and have a life of its own, but also the internet doesn't define you, it doesn't have to be you,"" he said. ""Figure out who you are first, and if the stuff out there is part of how you want to define yourself then use it for that, if it's not, then don't."" His alter-ego has had a lively few years, sported some interesting hairstyles and made some questionable decisions, like the time he took up smoking. But Mr Smith thinks the fictional boy would also approve of his own career as an entomologist who ""puts videos about bugs on YouTube"". Viral dad on the trials of working from home.

"""If we were having a conversation that we didn't want on air, we'd get someone in the background to sing I Want To Break Free or Hey Jude"". That's whatI'm a Celeb runner upand Burnley legend Jordan North told Greg James on the Radio 1 Breakfast Show after leaving the Welsh castle. But how does singing affect what goes on TV? ""Before we went in, we were told not to sing any songs by Queen, The Beatles or Disney,"" Jordan told Greg. That's because ITV didn't have the rights to use that music. So if Vernon and Jordan wanted to have a gossip - as long as they get Shane Richie to belt out Disney's Frozen in the background they could keep it private. I'm a Celeb: Jordan North's five greatest moments During the show, Jordan repeated an iconic mantra: 'Happy place, happy place, Turf Moor', during his toughest moments. That's the home ground of Burnley FC - Jordan's home team. 14.3 million viewers tuned in to the first episode of this years I'm A Celeb,external- meaning 14.3 million people saw Jordan throw up on his first challenge. He told Greg his fear of heights kicked in and made his head go all dizzy. Now he's revealed it was his paratrooper brother who actually inspired the quote. ""He says that in the army - when you're cold, scared or wet, they tell people to go to their happy place. ""So I'm in this coffin full of snakes screaming that, and people didn't know but it actually took me an hour to get into that coffin."" Before going into the castle, Jordan was pretty well known as a Radio 1 presenter. But after his time on I'm A Celeb, he's now experiencing what life is like for a fully famous person. ""On the way back to London, we stopped at a service station for a wee,"" he said. ""When I left the toilet, there was a queue and a crowd so I joined the queue thinking it was to get out - then a girl told me they were queuing for a picture with me - I was in my own queue!"" He says when he went out to buy a sandwich, a few people shouted 'happy place, happy place' at him. That's how Jordan describes his time in the castle. ""We were freezing and we were starving, I thought we'd get used to the hunger but it gets worse, we had no energy.

"This video can not be played Fifty hospitals in England have been chosen as hubs for administering the vaccine The armed forces could help transport further stocks of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from Belgium to the UK, with vaccinations due to begin on Tuesday. Asked if a no-deal Brexit could delay supplies, James Cleverly said it was a ""top priority"" and the government would look to ensure supplies were available ""in whatever circumstance"". Military personnel are already helping to construct vaccination centres. Health Secretary Matt Hancocktweeted,externalall parts of the UK had vaccine doses. Front-line health staff, those over 80, and care home workers will be first in line for the vaccine. In England, 50 hospitals have been initially chosen to serve as hubs for administering it. Scotland,Wales, andNorthern Irelandwill also begin their vaccination programmes from hospitals on Tuesday. On Monday, the government announced a further 14,718 people had tested positive for the virus, while a further 189 people had died within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 61,434. The Ministry of Defence said 60 military planners are working with the government's vaccine task force, with a further 56 personnel helping to construct vaccination centres. Armed Forces minister James Heappey said around 13,500 military personnel were on ""high readiness"" - with more than 2,000 deployed so far to help with testing and the government's Covid response. What are the safety checks for vaccines? Who will get the Covid vaccine first? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' Refrigerated containers holding the vaccine doses, which need to be kept at -70C,have been arriving in the UK from Belgium, where it is made, and are being prepared to be moved from secure locations to the hospitals. Asked whether the armed forces would be used to help transport the vaccine to the UK, Mr Cleverly told BBC Breakfast: ""Potentially - we are looking at non-commercial flight options."" In response to concerns a no-deal Brexit could cause delays in getting the vaccine into the UK, he said: ""This is such an important product, it's probably perhaps the most important product, so we will look to ensure that those supplies are available in the UK in whatever circumstance."" Asked to confirm if this meant the armed forces would be used if needed, he said: ""If we need to."" It comes as talks between the UK and the EU continuein a bid to reach a post-Brexit trade deal. Downing Street did not deny that RAF flights could be used to bring supplies of the vaccine over from other European countries if there were problems at ports caused by a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister's official spokesman would not comment on specific plans for ""security reasons"". But he said ""the military will have a role to play in what's been an enormous logistical challenge and I'm sure they will continue to do so as we move forward"". Vaccines were delivered to Croydon University Hospital on Sunday About 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be available in the UK from next week. So far the government has ordered a total of 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, with two shots each, 21 days apart. With limited quantities initially available, elderly people who are already attending hospital as an outpatient, as well as those who are being discharged after a hospital stay, will be among the first to receive the jab. Others over the age of 80 will be invited to attend the hospital to receive a jab, and care home providers will be able to book their staff into vaccination clinics. Any appointments not used for these groups will be used for healthcare workers who are at highest risk of serious illness from the virus. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - which represents hospitals and other NHS trusts in England - said people over 80 should not be concerned if they did not receive a letter calling them to be vaccinated this month, as the ""vast majority"" of people would have to wait until next year. The Mail on Sunday,externalreported that the Queen, who is 94, is expected to receive the vaccine ""within weeks"" - and then reveal she has had it to boost public take-up of the jab. The paper quoted senior sources who said the monarch and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, will not get ""preferential treatment"" but will wait their turn in the priorities list. Asked whether the Queen would receive the vaccination this week, the prime minister's official spokesman said it was a matter for Buckingham Palace. However, he added: ""It is obviously a statement of fact that the Queen and Prince Philip are over 80 and are in a priority group."" This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? Although care home residents and staff were placed at the top of the priority list agreed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), they are not getting the very first vaccinations. The government has explained this is because the chosen hospital hubs already have the facilities to store the vaccine at the required temperature of -70C. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government was doing everything it could to overcome ""significant challenges"" to ensure care home residents were vaccinated as soon as possible.

"The National Trust, which owns the beach, said it was investigating the shiny pillar A monolith has mysteriously appeared in Britain - just days after similar ones were spotted in the US and Romania. The unusual mirrored structure was discovered on the Isle of Wight, an island off the south coast of England. Resident Alexia Fishwick said she ""was dumbstruck"" when she came across it during a beach walk on Sunday and described it as ""really quite magical"". A monolith found in Utah last month created wild speculation on social media and apparent copycats. Many observers have presumed they were art installations left by sculptors. The metal edifice in Utah was found planted in the ground before it disappeared just days later. This video can not be played The unusual object in the desert in the US state of Utah was found by a helicopter crew while conducting a count of big horn sheep in the area Two other shining metal towers later appeared in Romania and southern California. Ms Fishwick said: ""I'd read about the one in Utah and then Romania, so I knew the significance. Many people took no notice of it."" She said people first thought she had photoshopped the images when she put them online. Lee Peckham, a lawyer living on the island, said: ""I saw it and wondered what it was and thought it a rather strange thing to see on the beach. I wondered who put it there and why."" DJ Rob da Bank, another island resident, was also among those who took a stroll to see the sight for themselves. He mused: ""I'm not sure if it's aliens, a Coldplay PR stunt or a local mirror dealer drumming up trade, but it got us all down the beach anyway."" The National Trust, which owns the site, said it had no immediate plans to remove the monolith, which it said was erected without permission. A spokesman said: ""We were unaware of the monolith's presence until this morning, but we've now visited Compton Beach and it seems secure on a wooden plinth and is made from mirrored sections of plastic or perspex material. ""We need to monitor over the next few days to ensure the beach remains safe and does not become overcrowded."" Alexia Fishwick described the monolith as ""incredibly graceful"" An anonymous collective called The Most Famous Artist has taken credit for the monoliths in Utah and California. It posted an image of the Utah monolith on Instagram, with a 45,000 US dollar (Â£34,000) price tag. However, when asked about the Isle of Wight structure, it said: ""The monolith is out of my control at this point. Godspeed to all the aliens working hard around the globe to propagate the myth."" People have tracked down the mystery Utah monolith Mysterious metal monolith found in Utah desert News of the monolith on the island has caused a stir on social media with some posting in jest - that the monolith - which already has its own Instagram page - could be a portal to another dimension. In 2001: A Space Odyssey - the 1968 film directed by Stanley Kubrick - imposing black monoliths created by an unseen alien species appear in the movie, based on the writings of novelist Arthur C Clarke. Most observers reflecting on their trip to the mysterious monolith suspected it was left by an artist rather than an alien species. Allow Twitter content?

"Kensington Palace arranged for three reindeer to visit a school in Berwick as a treat for the pupils The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have surprised schoolchildren with a visit from reindeer during a three-day train tour of Great Britain. Kensington Palace arranged for Chaz, Crackers and her calf, Echols, to join the couple at a school in Berwick. Prince William and Catherine are travelling around Great Britain to thank key workers for their efforts during the pandemic. Their first stop was Edinburgh, where they met frontline ambulance workers. The duke and duchess had travelled to Scotland overnight from London's Euston station. The 1,250 mile tour on board the royal train will include stops in England, Scotland and Wales. The couple, known as the Earl and Countess of Strathearn in Scotland, arrived at Edinburgh Waverley station on Monday morning to the sounds of a piper playing Christmas songs including Jingle Bells and Santa Claus is Coming to Town. Their first official engagement saw them visit the Scottish Ambulance Service in Newbridge, near Edinburgh, where they met front-line staff. Piper Louise Marshall and deputy Lord Lieutenant Sandra Cumming greet the royal couple in Edinburgh This video can not be played Prince William and Catherine thanked Scottish ambulance staff for their work during the pandemic They heard moving accounts from ambulance workers about how they have been personally affected by the crisis. Paramedic Alistair Matson told them about how he had to cope with his father falling ill and later dying in hospital during the pandemic. Mr Matson, 54, said: ""It was very emotional talking to the prince about losing my father. He was very anxious to hear how we managed to cope with the mental strains of our job."" The visit coincided with the announcement that the couple have become joint patrons of NHS Charities Together. Ian Lush, chairman of NHS Charities Together, said it was ""such an honour for our organisation"", adding that their involvement will inspire the public ""to do even more to support the amazing NHS staff and volunteers"". Earlier this year,Captain Sir Tom Moore raised more than Â£33m for NHS Charities Togetherby walking 100 laps of his Bedfordshire garden before his 100th birthday. Later asked whether the visit to Scotland broke coronavirus rules banning cross-border travel, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the royal household was made aware of the restrictions ahead of time. Royal sources said the Cambridges' trip was planned in conjunction with the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments and that travelling across the border is permitted for work purposes. The royal couple then crossed the border to visit Holy Trinity First School in England's most northern town, Berwick-upon-Tweed. The school's 175 pupils waved and sang as the duke and duchess arrived, while local saxophone group The Earl Grey Saxes played Christmas tunes, including Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. Kate and William were greeted by children wearing antlers at a school visit in Berwick-upon-Tweed As a surprise for the children, Kensington Palace had organised for Rent a Reindeer to bring three animals to the school. Rent a Reindeer owner George Richardson said the booking by the palace had been ""top secret"". He said: ""We got a phone call out of the blue two weeks ago, they asked us to bring a reindeer for the royal visit and we were happy to oblige. ""This was baby's first outing and she took it in her stride,"" he added, talking about the calf. Headteacher Nicholas Shaw said the school felt ""honoured"" to have been chosen for the royal visit, adding: ""We appreciate they are taking the time to think about teachers and the work that has been going on in schools.""

The royals went on to Batley Community Centre in West Yorkshire and met volunteers from the centre who have supported elderly members of the community throughout the pandemic. They also met Len Gardner, a local resident with whom the duchess has been chatting on the phone after she secretly volunteered through the NHS Volunteer Responder Check In And Chat scheme. The royals met volunteers in West Yorkshire who had helped older people during the pandemic Kate and William leave a message to transport workers before boarding their train Shakin' Stevens performs for the royal couple and transport workers at London's Euston station on Sunday night Their final stop on Monday was in Greater Manchester, where they visited the FareShare charity, which redistributes surplus food from businesses to 11,000 charities and community groups across the UK. Before leaving London on Sunday night, the duke and duchess left a personal message of thanks for transport workers on a London Underground service information board. Kensington Palace shared images of Catherine writing the notice,,externalwhich read: ""Thank you to all transport workers everywhere for keeping the country moving throughout this difficult year. ""Wishing you all a very Merry Christmas!"" They were also serenaded by singer Shakin' Stevens, who performed his hit festive song, Merry Christmas Everyone, at the station. The royal tour, which ends on Tuesday, will see the couple meet care home staff, teachers, pupils and volunteers to learn about the challenges they have faced during the coronavirus pandemic. Prince Charles's study on the royal train, as pictured in 2010 Queen Victoria was the first monarch to use the royal train, travelling from Slough to Paddington station on 13 June 1842, with Isambard Kingdom Brunel riding on the footplate. In her diary, the 23-year-old queen described the 25-minute journey as ""delightful and so quick"" The present train has nine carriages and came into service for the Queen's Silver Jubilee, in 1977. It includes private carriages for the Queen and the Prince of Wales The train is described as more functional than palatial, with one royal aide suggesting it has bathroom fixtures ""you could find in Homebase or B&Q"" Only three trips - two by the Prince of Wales and one by the Queen - were taken on the royal train in the 2019/2020 financial year, but the total cost was more than Â£63,000. When the Queen toured the UK on the train for her Golden Jubilee in 2002, it cost Â£872,000 In 2000, a royal bodyguard discharged his gun on the train while the Queen was sleeping.

"Mike Ashley has bought other struggling businesses including House of Fraser and Evans Cycles Mike Ashley's Frasers Group has confirmed it is working on a possible last minute rescue of Debenhams. The department store chain is currently set to shut all its stores by the end of next March, putting 12,000 jobs at risk, after administrators failed to find a buyer for the business. Mr Ashley has bought other struggling High Street businesses and used to be a major shareholder in Debenhams. But Frasers said there was ""no certainty"" it could save the chain. One of the biggest issues, it said, was the collapse into administration last week of another High Street giant, Arcadia, which is the biggest concession holder in Debenhams department stores. Liquidators moved in to Debenhams' stores on Wednesday to start clearing stock after a potential rescue deal with JD Sports fell through. Debenhams set to close putting 12,000 jobs at risk What went wrong at Debenhams? Mike Ashley, who founded Sports Direct and also owns House of Fraser, had already made an offer for Debenhams after it was initially put up for sale in April. But this approach, thought to be in the region of Â£125m, was rejected as too low, leaving JD Sports as the last remaining bidder. It is understood Mr Ashley was only interested in taking on about 30 stores out of 124. In a statement issued on Monday, Frasers Group said,externalthat while it ""hopes that a rescue package can be put in place and jobs saved, time is short and the position is further complicated by the recent administration of the Arcadia Group"". ""There is no certainty that any transaction will take place, particularly if discussions cannot be concluded swiftly."" Mr Ashley has made no secret of his desire to acquire Debenhams in the past. He built up a 29% stake in the chain, but saw his Â£150m holding wiped out last year when the company fell into administration and then ended up in the hands of its lenders, a consortium led by hedge fund Silverpoint. For Mike Ashley this is the final throw of the dice in his efforts to own Debenhams. The big question now is how much will he up his offer and will it be credible enough for the administrators and ultimately Debenhams' lenders? He's up against what sum the administrators think they can recover from liquidating the chain. Harsh as it may sound, in these situations, the priority is to secure as much value for creditors as possible as opposed to saving jobs and stores. Mike Ashley should never be underestimated, but his is by no means a done deal. If he can clinch an 11th-hour agreement then Debenhams lives on, but ultimately the chain is likely to have far fewer stores. Stockbroker Shore Capital said the latest bid could be Mike Ashley's ""last play"" on the retailer. In a note, it said any potential rescue deal would centre on the chain's ""current and future stock position"" and that it was unclear how many Debenhams stores would survive given many were located near to House of Fraser shops. ""Frasers is known to be a hard negotiator and will probably walk away rather than over pay,"" it added. Before Debenhams went into liquidation, the business had called in administrators twice in two years, most recently in April. The 242-year-old retailer has struggled for years with falling profits and rising debts as more shopping moved online. But its position became untenable in the pandemic as non-essential retailers were forced to close for prolonged periods. The firm had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May as it struggled to stay afloat. Debenhams set to close putting 12,000 jobs at risk What went wrong at Debenhams?

The coins range in price from Â£13 to Â£72,195 The Mint said the design had been inspired by an image of Bowie from his time spent living and recording in Berlin. It features the iconic lightning bolt motif from Aladdin Sane, and captures Bowie's career journey.

"The NHS is preparing for Brexit at the same time as managing Covid-19 and the winter pressures of flu and bad weather A no-deal Brexit could threaten safe and effective patient care, a major Scottish health board has warned. NHS Tayside is preparing for possible service disruption when the transition period ends on 31 December. The UK and the EU are struggling to strike a post-membership trade deal with the two sides acknowledging ""significant differences remain"". Both the UK and Scottish governments have prepared contingency plans in case no agreement is reached. Whateverthe outcome of continuing Brussels talks, continuity of healthcare is a key concern and the NHS across Scotland has reactivated plans drawn up when a Brexit crisis loomed last year. NHS Tayside is preparing for possible shortages of medicine, equipment and staff - warning that a no deal departure could ""lead to an inability to deliver safe and effective care"". The health board serves more than 400,000 patients across Dundee, Angus and Perth and Kinross. The UK government's department of health and social care said it was working to ""help ensure continued supply of medicines and medical products to the whole of the UK at the end of the transition period"". It has asked medicine suppliers to hold extra stock in the UK and has plans to re-route deliveries to the UK if necessary. Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman also highlighted the need to prepare. She said: ""We are working with the UK government and other devolved administrations to ensure we have a stockpile of essential medicines, including Covid-19 and end of life medicines."" Ms Freeman added that the country benefited ""enormously"" from EU citizens who worked in the health and social care sectors. She said: ""We encourage all EU citizens, including those working in the health and social care sectors, to apply to the Home Office's Settled Status Scheme to exercise this right."" Brexit: What is a level playing field? What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? In a 34-page Brexit readiness plan released to BBC Scotland in response to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, NHS Tayside set out potential problems and measures to offset them. Its concerns are shared by other health boards that have responded to the BBC's FOI. NHS Lanarkshire considers Brexit a ""very high"" risk with the ""potential to adversely disrupt continuity of delivery of healthcare services"". The board's concerns include possible ""interruption to availability of medicines, vaccines, personal protective equipment and essential consumable items"". The NHS is preparing for Brexit at the same time as managing Covid-19 and the winter pressures of flu and bad weather. Even before the pandemic, NHS Dumfries and Galloway flagged ""an unprecedented degree of risk for smooth provision of services"" in the event of a disorderly exit from the EU during winter. Its chief executive, Jeff Ace, has since been appointed to play a leading role in co-ordinating NHS Brexit preparations across Scotland. The UK formally left the EU in January but is able to keep trading in the European single market and customs union until the end of this month. A trade deal is needed by then to prevent the introduction of tariffs (or taxes) on imports and exports. Even with a deal, new border controls will take effect from 1 January when the free movement of goods and people comes to an end. Extra paperwork and checks are expected to cause delays at key border crossings such as Calais-Dover. All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Procuring equipment for the health service, such as monitors and PPE, could be a concern in the event of a no-deal Across the health service, some of the key concerns included disruption to supplies and increased costs of medicine; the recruitment and retention of EU nationals in the NHS and procurement process such as the maintaining flow of orders for essential items such as PPE. NHS Grampiannoted that about 85% of prescription-only medicines are imported to the UK from, or through,  the EU single market. It said medicine shortages, unrelated to Brexit, were increasingly common especially with the strains that Covid-19 has placed on the global supply chain. The board is concerned that ""any customs delays could create disruption at ports and reduce the supply of medicines into the UK from Europe"". To ease any pressure, the UK government has asked pharmaceutical firms to keep six weeks of supplies in the UK and has secured its own cross-channel freight capacity. NHS Tayside'splanning assumptions include ""shortages of some medicines, particularly after the first six weeks as stocks reduce"". NHS Ayrshire and Arranhas also raised concerns that it may have to plug gaps in supply with more expensive alternatives and that European manufacturers may raise their prices after Brexit. NHS National Services Scotland, which bulk buys medical, surgical and cleaning supplies for all health boards, has been building up a Brexit stockpile since September. Before the end of that month, it had amassed a six-week supply of 80% of the items thought to be vulnerable to any trade disruption. While the UK is phasing in its new border arrangements over the first six months of 2021, EU member states will be entitled to apply controls from 1 January. NHS National Servicesanticipates ""disruption if significant volumes of freight arrive at the border without completing the correct formalities"". In a report dated 13 October, it expected to be ""able to manage supply chain risks effectively"". NHS Taysideis assured it will have access to sufficient supplies for the first six weeks of 2021 but considers ""there may be delays"" after that. Many health authorities are worried Brexit will reduce the number of EU nationals available to work as doctors, dentists, nurses and in social care. While those already living and working here can apply for settled status until next summer,NHS Taysidebelieves ""there remains a risk that EU staff will leave the UK"". It expects the UK's new immigration rules to make staff shortages worse and is concerned a post-Brexit drop in the value of the pound would encourage EU workers to return home. NHS Grampianhas raised a particular concern about the impact any loss of EU workers would have on social care provision in the north east. NHS Borderssaid that while it was ""not overly reliant"" on EU nationals ""uncertainty remains"" about access to European labour after Brexit. NHS Taysideexpects existing reciprocal healthcare arrangements with EU countries to break down if there is no deal. That could lead to many UK nationals coming home for treatment, especially more vulnerable patients such as those who are elderly, disabled or pregnant. NHS Grampianestimates that as many as 300 UK citizens may relocate to north east Scotland and seek access to healthcare within a 6-12 week period. There is a general concern that the pound could further reduce in value after Brexit, increasing healthcare costs and adding to budget pressures. WhileNHS Borderssaid it had not yet experienced cost increases as a result of Brexit,NHS Ayrshire and Arranreported a 30% rise in some of its IT costs since the EU referendum in 2016. TheAyrshire and Arranboard said there was a ""high likelihood"" that food supplies would be impacted by Brexit. WhileNHS Grampianexpects this could affect choice and price, it is confident local supplies will be sufficient to cover any shortages. NHS Bordershas a particular concern about possible restrictions in supply of fresh produce such as fruit and vegetables. NHS Lanarkshirehas registered an unusual risk factor - possible disruption to the normal supply of illegal drugs leading to alternative substances ""contaminated with anthrax"" reappearing on the market. TheScottish National Blood Transfusion Servicesaid it was concerned about ""disruption to service delivery"" if Brexit planning proved to be ""insufficient"". It has used ""advanced purchasing and extended stock holding"" of some key consumable items to guard against possible shortages. NHS Highlandexpressed concern that a no-deal Brexit could compound the challenges of winter and ""managing the backlog from the Covid-19 pandemic"". NHS Taysidesaid it was planning a table-top exercise to test the robustness of its Brexit planning. As well as working on local preparations,NHS Orkneysaid its staff would be attending a national EU exit planning event on 10 December. NHS Shetland, in a response dated 11 November, said the Brexit plans it had in place prior to the pandemic were ""only now being revisited"". NHS Western Islessaid it had made ""no updated assessment"" of the likely impact of Brexit this year. All three island boards work together withNHS Highlandand local authorities on resilience planning across the Highlands and islands. NHS Forth Valleysaid it had ""identified risks"" associated with Brexit and was monitoring and reporting on them as part of the national response. Scotland's two largest health boards,NHS Greater Glasgow and ClydeandNHS Lothianhave yet to respond to the BBC's request for information. What is a level playing field?

""Tomorrow is the beginning of the biggest vaccination campaign in our history, building on successes from previous campaigns against conditions (and) diseases like polio, meningitis, and tuberculosis,"" Sir Simon Stevens said on the eve of the vaccine roll-out.

""If we do that I think there's every chance that we will look back on tomorrow as marking a decisive turning point in the battle against coronavirus,"" he said. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says about 250,000 doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine will be available by the end of the year. These early doses will be prioritised for long-term care workers and people in care homes. The vaccine will be distributed across the country on a per-capita basis, he said, which means that provinces with higher populations will get more doses. The government could approve the vaccine as early as this week, and doses could be ready for distribution next week, Mr Trudeau added. The Mona Lisa hangs on the wall of the empty Louvre If you've ever wished you could see priceless pieces of art without the crowds, now's your chance. After being closed for more than five months this year due to the pandemic, the Louvre in Paris is offering unique experiences to help make up some of its financial losses. With many of the bids starting around â¬10,000 (Â£9,000), you could explore the museum by torchlight, attend a private concert held in your honour, or become one of the few people in the world to see Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa taken down for its annual examination. The most expensive item so far is an oil painting by Pierre Soulages, which has received a bid of â¬800,000. Yann Le Touher, who handles relations with the Louvre's patrons, told Reuters news agency that the museum expected to lose up to â¬90m this year, and that money provided by the French state would only cover around half of the shortfall. The online auction is being held byChristies,externaland will end on 15 December. The competition may have moved online, but that did not discourage the bakers taking part in Sweden's annual gingerbread contest. From Zoom drinks to people sitting on a park bench (while maintaining social distancing rules, of course), this year's bakers showed how the pandemic had changed many aspects of daily life, even in a country that has shown a much less strict approach to dealing with coronavirus than the rest of Europe. Even Sweden's top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, turned up in gingerbread form at the Arkdes Museum of Architecture and Design in Stockholm - with the creator telling Reuters news agency that he wanted to get across the message of social distancing. In England, some fans are allowed to return to stadiums such as Liverpool on Sunday - but in Wales they are still banned Elite-level sports clubs in Wales have warned they could face bankruptcy if a way isnât found to allow the return of spectators to Welsh stadiums. In England, up to 2,000 spectators are allowed in stadiums for matches in tier two, with 4,000 permitted in tier one areas. But the same has not been allowed in Wales, with no fans allowed back. In Scotland,the number of fans stands at 300,while some fans were allowed back in Northern Ireland beforeextra restrictions were brought in last month. Representatives of Welsh sport including the Welsh Rugby Union, the Football Association of Wales, Cardiff City FC and Swansea City FC have written an open letter to First Minister Mark Drakeford. They said âthe lack of a clear road map for the return of spectators in Wales poses the real risk of bankruptcy for our sportsâ. ""Sport is a fundamental part of life in Wales,"" the letter read. ""We form part of an an industry that employs thousands of people across the country, our contribution to the Welsh economy, employment and well-being is significant, but this is now at risk.""

As we reported earlier, William and Kate - who are also known as the Earl and Countess of Strathearn when in Scotland - visited Edinburgh as part of a three-day tour of the UK to meet key workers. The timing of the visit was particularly poignant for the Scottish Ambulance Service workers as they remembered a colleague who died with coronavirus. The 1,250 mile tour on board the royal train includes stops in England and Wales. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Throughout the pandemic we'vebeen answering your questions.The latest comes from Phil Hemingway, who asks: My 95-year-old mother has a pacemaker. Can she cope with a full-strength dose or should she wait for the half-strength first dose Oxford vaccine (subject to approval)? During the Pfizer vaccine trials, people of all ages were vaccinated to make sure it was safe and effective in older age groups who are most at risk of serious illness and death from Covid-19. In fact, the vaccine was found to be 94% effective in the over-65s. There is no evidence that the over-90s are not able to cope with two full-strength doses. The first primes the bodyâs defences against the virus, while the second dose is a booster which offers full protection after a week. Prof Van-Tam said he is""hopeful"" the Oxford vaccine will be approved by Christmas,but said: ""That's entirely out of my hands. It's down to the MHRA, the UK regulatory body. If it takes them a few weeks, or a few months, that's fine, they have to get it right."" Read more questions and answers here. We've got a little more on the UK's daily coronavirus figures, which the government published earlier. It showed a further 14,718 people had tested positive for coronavirus, and another 189 people had died. Our data team has updated the graphs which show us how the number of deaths and cases (calculated as a seven day average) is changing. Police said they found between 100 and 150 people inside the property in Lace Street A house party with up to 150 guests has been broken up by police in the English city of Nottingham. The 20-year-old organiser of the illegal gathering, in Lace Street, is facing a fine of up to Â£10,000 after officers arrived at about 00:30 GMT. Several guests were given Â£200 penalties for breaking Covid-19 rules and a 19-year-old man was charged with obstructing a police officer. The charged 19-year-old was also fined Â£200 and bailed to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on 26 January. The party host has been reported for summons and could be given the maximum fine under Covid-19 regulations. Nottingham is subject to tier three restrictions, which bans different households mixing indoors. Insp Amy English, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: ""The very last thing we want to be doing as police officers is to be punishing people for gathering together and having fun but there really are no excuses for this kind of behaviour where people are blatantly ignoring rules in such large numbers.""

The annual World Economic Forum traditionally takes place in Davos, Switzerland The World Economic Forum (WEF) - the annual gathering of the world's political, economic and business elite - has been forced to move next year's summit from Switzerland to Singapore because of the pandemic, organisers say. The event, which traditionally takes place in the Alpine village of Davos in January, will instead be held from 13 to 16 May. ""The change in location reflects the Forum's priority of safeguarding the health and safety of participants and the host community,"" the WEF said in a statement. It added that ""in light of the current situation with regards to Covid-19 cases"" and after ""careful consideration"", Singapore was best placed to hold the ""in-person"" meeting next year. The WEF said it planned to return to Davos in 2022. The UK governmenthas just updated its daily coronavirus figures,,externaland has announced 14,718 new confirmed cases. A further 189 people have died with coronavirus, the government added. That measure refers to people who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. It takes the total number of deaths, as recorded by the government by that measure, to 61,434. For more information on the stats and to check how many coronavirus cases are in your area,head here. Life in China is almost back to normal - despite the fact it's where the first case of coronavirus emerged. Since then, there have been lots of racist incidents towards Chinese people - online and in real life - and US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called the disease the ""China-virus"". So what's life like now for people in China, and how do they feel about the way the world views their country after the 2020 pandemic? This video can not be played The UK's Ministry of Defence has provided details on the role the armed forces are playing in the country's vaccine rollout. It said 60 military planners are  working with the government's vaccine task force - with a further 56 Armed Forces personnel now helping to construct vaccination centres. The minister for the armed forces, James Heappey, said around 13,500 military personnel were on high readiness - with just over 2,000 deployed so far to help with testing and the government's Covid response. This is the first and most important question scientists ask when they start designing and testing a new vaccine or treatment. Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. The principle is to start small and only ever move on to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns. As long as the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check that the vaccine or treatment is effective, too. That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - around 40,000 individuals in the case of Pfizer/BioNTech. All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. The Covid vaccine trials have happened at breakneck speed, but they haven't skipped any of these steps. There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against serious infections. Covid vaccines appear to stop people getting very sick and could save lives. Read more here.

Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Restaurants and most shops in Portugal were ordered to close early today on what is the eve of a national holiday as the government attempts to curb the spread of the virus over the second long weekend in two weeks. Traders were obliged to close by 15:00 and the government gave employees the day off in addition to tomorrow's holiday - as it did a week
ago, on the eve of the 1 December national holiday. A domestic travel ban has been in place since 23:00 Friday, and runs to 05:00 Wednesday, with people barred from
leaving their municipality of residence except for work or emergencies. Remote working is mandatory - where feasible - in areas deemed to
be at high, very high, or extremely high risk of transmission of the virus - affecting the vast majority of Portugal's population. In most of these areas - those deemed at very high or extremely high risk,
which include Lisbon and Porto - there is also a 13:00 curfew tomorrow.
The restrictions are in place under the state of emergency that parliament
on Friday voted to renew until 23 December. Portugal yesterday reported 3,834 new
confirmed coronavirus cases - well down from the 19 November peak of 6,994
- and 87 deaths associated with Covid. Since the start of the epidemic, the country has reported 322,474 confirmed cases and 4,963 Covid-19 deaths. Tina and Victor have been together for seven

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen say they want an ""overview of the remaining differences"" in EU-UK trade talks In a joint statement following a phone call on Monday, the two leaders said those differences will be ""discussed in person"" Boris Johnson says he will go to Brussels for a ""physical meeting"" in the coming days Three ""critical issues"" need to be resolved as talks continue in Brussels - fishing rights, government support for industry and how a deal is enforced The negotiating teams are trying to find an agreement on the future trading relationship between the UK and the EU The UK left the EU on 31 January, but remains under its trading rules until the end of the year If a deal is not agreed by then, tariffs - or taxes on goods - could come into force The boss of Toyota's European business has warned that a no-deal Brexit could make its UK plants uncompetitive Dr Johan van Zyl said such an outcome would create a ""very negative investment environment"" in the UK and be ""very, very negative"" for his business Thanks for following along with us today. The team at your service were Jennifer Scott, Lucy Webster, Paul Seddon, and Rob Corp, with Johanna Howitt in the editor's chair. We're going to pause our live coverage of today's Brexit developments. Before we leave you, here is a quick summary of the day's events:  Lord David Frost (left) and Michel Barnier (right) have led negotiating teams for the UK and EU We are now all waiting for the big meeting between Johnson and Von der Leyen, but it isn't all over for the negotiating teams yet. After almost 10 months of talks, the EU's Michel Barnier and the UK's Lord David Frost will meet again to prepare the overview of the difficulties that still remain between the two sides. We understand that meeting will take place tomorrow, before they hand it over to their political leaders. Reaching to theearlier joint statement,externalfrom Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, Labour has urged both sides to reach an agreement. Shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, said: âDay
after day we see this government failing to deliver their promises to the
British people and failing to get the deal they promised done. âSecuring
a deal is critical to the British national interest for jobs and security."" She called on the teams ""even
at this 11th hour... to get on with reaching an agreement"", adding: ""We
can then focus on the job at hand which is securing the economy and rebuilding
our country from the pandemic.â Katya AdlerEurope Editor We've had the same big three sticking points between the two sides for months now. Many trade negotiators were wondering what the point was of sending negotiators back into the room when they are so well rehearsed in each other's arguments. What is needed to break the deadlock right now is the political will from both sides - and that need to come from the bosses. It will be European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who will sit with Boris Johnson - because EU countries have tasked the Commission with negotiating on their behalf. But she does not have a free hand here - because the Commission is the conduit for the interests of the member states. When it's come to Brexit, they have kept a sense of unity you do not see normally. But now that we're getting to five to midnight, that unity is beginning to fray at the edges. A senior UK government source has said the trade talks are ""in the same position now as they were on Friday"". ""We have made no tangible progress. Itâs clear this must now continue politically. ""Whilst we do not consider this process to be closed, things are looking very tricky and thereâs every chance we are not going to get there.â UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson pictured earlier during his phone call with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The statement that dropped a few minute ago also left a few question marks, and while there is lots we cannot answer yet about the future of a trade deal, one thing has been cleared up. Von der Leyen's chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, has confirmed his boss and the prime minister will meet in person in Brussels - not their negotiating teams.

Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent It sounds like we are heading for a political showdown later this week. Boris Johnson will at some point be heading to Brussels for the real crunch moment - to discuss whether remaining issues can be overcome. Talks between the negotiating teams matter - but ultimately, whether to sign on the dotted line is a political decision. It is not completely clear when the final deadline is. But Thursday is a big day, because some on the European side are adamant they need something to discuss when EU leaders are due to meet at their summit on Thursday. So, Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen, have repeated there are still ""significant difference on three critical issues"" in the Brexit trade talks. Here's a quick reminder of the three issues they seem to be stuck on:  A joint statement has just been released from UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. It says: âAs agreed on Saturday, we took
stock today of the ongoing negotiations. We agreed that the conditions for
finalising an agreement are not there due to the remaining significant
differences on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and
fisheries. âWe asked our chief negotiators and
their teams to prepare an overview of the remaining differences to be discussed
in a physical meeting in Brussels in the coming days.â Boris Johnson and Urusual von der Leyen spoke earlier today Bad news from The City... The pound has fallen to its lowest level against the Euro in more than six weeks, as traders reacted to the growing prospect of a no-deal Brexit. In late afternoon trading in London, sterling was about 1% down against the single European currency at â¬1.098. And it also lost ground against the dollar, falling 0.83% to $1.3325. You can read more about the glum news here. Among the MPs speaking in the Commons over that controversial bill is Ed Miliband - remember him? The former Labour leader is now back on the front bench as the party's shadow business secretary. He begins by saying he feels like he is living in a ""parallel universe"" to the government, who continues to defend its position on the bill. He says it has been ""absolutely savaged"" by members from across Parliament, includingTory grandees. Miliband adds: ""There is one thing this whole sorry saga has shown the world beyond any doubt - that with this government their word is not their bond. ""They cannot be trusted because they are willing to rip up international agreements they made less than a year ago."" In the background of the post-Brexit trade talks, MPs are currently debating the government's Internal Market Bill, which caused controversy when it was first published. The bill was initially passed by MPs, but it faced a bumpier ride when it moved to the House of Lords. Sections in the bill which, if they became UK law, would break international law. Peers made a number of changes and removed sections which would have given the government powers to override parts of the Brexit ""divorce deal"" - otherwise known as the withdrawal agreement. Ministers now say they would be willing to remove controversial clauses from the bill, but only if a trade deal is agreed between the UK and the EU in the coming days. The bill has to be approved by both houses in Parliament, so if MPs rejected the peers' changes, it will return to the House of Lords, who will then decide whether or not to reinsert their amendments - a process called ""the ping pong stage"". Read more about the row here Charles Michel hosted the teleconference earlier. Meanwhile, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron have discussed Brexit during a scheduled teleconference ahead of Thursday's two-day EU summit . It is understood the leaders discussed the latest state of talks with European Council President Charles Michel and EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Post-Brexit trade is not on theprovisional agenda,externalfor the summit due to take place in Brussels - but it comes at a crucial time for the talks, meaning it will be hard to ignore. There are conflicting reports across social media about the status of the call between Johnson and Von der Leyen. But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says it has come to an end...

Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Another lengthy phone call appears to be over. It isnât
clear if Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen will dial each other again
later. So the wait, and uncertainty, goes on. These discussions amount to a top
level stock takes at a crucial moment. After months and months of talks and all
the to and fro of the last two days, these leaders must, again, assess whether
the negotiations are still worth pursuing. We already know some things that will change from 1 January 2021. From trips to Europe and queues at the border, to duty-free shopping and lots of new rules - here are some of the most important things you might want to think about (and a couple of others which are still unresolved). Seven things that will change in January and others that remain unresolved Rumours are abound that Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen are ""on a break"" - not like that, it has just been a long phone call. We have had a picture from the European Commission of their president talking to the prime minister. But we are still waiting for more detail of their discussion... We'll bring you any updates as soon as we get them. Some businesses have expressed their fears about a no-deal outcome between the UK and the EU. The boss of Toyota's European business, Johan van Zyl, said it would make the firm's UK plants uncompetitive, telling the BBC it would create a ""very negative investment environment"" in Britain and be ""very, very negative"" for his business. Toyota has two plants in the UK, which employ about 3,000 people in total. But van Zyl said no decisions on the future of its UK plants - a car factory at Burnaston in Derbyshire and an engine facility at Deeside in North Wales - could be taken until the outcome of trade talks was known.

""If we do that I think there's every chance that we will look back on tomorrow as marking a decisive turning point in the battle against coronavirus,"" he said. Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says about 250,000 doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine will be available by the end of the year. These early doses will be prioritised for long-term care workers and people in care homes. The vaccine will be distributed across the country on a per-capita basis, he said, which means that provinces with higher populations will get more doses. The government could approve the vaccine as early as this week, and doses could be ready for distribution next week, Mr Trudeau added. The Mona Lisa hangs on the wall of the empty Louvre If you've ever wished you could see priceless pieces of art without the crowds, now's your chance. After being closed for more than five months this year due to the pandemic, the Louvre in Paris is offering unique experiences to help make up some of its financial losses. With many of the bids starting around â¬10,000 (Â£9,000), you could explore the museum by torchlight, attend a private concert held in your honour, or become one of the few people in the world to see Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa taken down for its annual examination. The most expensive item so far is an oil painting by Pierre Soulages, which has received a bid of â¬800,000. Yann Le Touher, who handles relations with the Louvre's patrons, told Reuters news agency that the museum expected to lose up to â¬90m this year, and that money provided by the French state would only cover around half of the shortfall. The online auction is being held byChristies,externaland will end on 15 December. The competition may have moved online, but that did not discourage the bakers taking part in Sweden's annual gingerbread contest. From Zoom drinks to people sitting on a park bench (while maintaining social distancing rules, of course), this year's bakers showed how the pandemic had changed many aspects of daily life, even in a country that has shown a much less strict approach to dealing with coronavirus than the rest of Europe. Even Sweden's top epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, turned up in gingerbread form at the Arkdes Museum of Architecture and Design in Stockholm - with the creator telling Reuters news agency that he wanted to get across the message of social distancing. In England, some fans are allowed to return to stadiums such as Liverpool on Sunday - but in Wales they are still banned Elite-level sports clubs in Wales have warned they could face bankruptcy if a way isnât found to allow the return of spectators to Welsh stadiums. In England, up to 2,000 spectators are allowed in stadiums for matches in tier two, with 4,000 permitted in tier one areas. But the same has not been allowed in Wales, with no fans allowed back. In Scotland,the number of fans stands at 300,while some fans were allowed back in Northern Ireland beforeextra restrictions were brought in last month. Representatives of Welsh sport including the Welsh Rugby Union, the Football Association of Wales, Cardiff City FC and Swansea City FC have written an open letter to First Minister Mark Drakeford. They said âthe lack of a clear road map for the return of spectators in Wales poses the real risk of bankruptcy for our sportsâ. ""Sport is a fundamental part of life in Wales,"" the letter read. ""We form part of an an industry that employs thousands of people across the country, our contribution to the Welsh economy, employment and well-being is significant, but this is now at risk.""

As we reported earlier, William and Kate - who are also known as the Earl and Countess of Strathearn when in Scotland - visited Edinburgh as part of a three-day tour of the UK to meet key workers. The timing of the visit was particularly poignant for the Scottish Ambulance Service workers as they remembered a colleague who died with coronavirus. The 1,250 mile tour on board the royal train includes stops in England and Wales. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Throughout the pandemic we'vebeen answering your questions.The latest comes from Phil Hemingway, who asks: My 95-year-old mother has a pacemaker. Can she cope with a full-strength dose or should she wait for the half-strength first dose Oxford vaccine (subject to approval)? During the Pfizer vaccine trials, people of all ages were vaccinated to make sure it was safe and effective in older age groups who are most at risk of serious illness and death from Covid-19. In fact, the vaccine was found to be 94% effective in the over-65s. There is no evidence that the over-90s are not able to cope with two full-strength doses. The first primes the bodyâs defences against the virus, while the second dose is a booster which offers full protection after a week. Prof Van-Tam said he is""hopeful"" the Oxford vaccine will be approved by Christmas,but said: ""That's entirely out of my hands. It's down to the MHRA, the UK regulatory body. If it takes them a few weeks, or a few months, that's fine, they have to get it right."" Read more questions and answers here. We've got a little more on the UK's daily coronavirus figures, which the government published earlier. It showed a further 14,718 people had tested positive for coronavirus, and another 189 people had died. Our data team has updated the graphs which show us how the number of deaths and cases (calculated as a seven day average) is changing. Police said they found between 100 and 150 people inside the property in Lace Street A house party with up to 150 guests has been broken up by police in the English city of Nottingham. The 20-year-old organiser of the illegal gathering, in Lace Street, is facing a fine of up to Â£10,000 after officers arrived at about 00:30 GMT. Several guests were given Â£200 penalties for breaking Covid-19 rules and a 19-year-old man was charged with obstructing a police officer. The charged 19-year-old was also fined Â£200 and bailed to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on 26 January. The party host has been reported for summons and could be given the maximum fine under Covid-19 regulations. Nottingham is subject to tier three restrictions, which bans different households mixing indoors. Insp Amy English, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: ""The very last thing we want to be doing as police officers is to be punishing people for gathering together and having fun but there really are no excuses for this kind of behaviour where people are blatantly ignoring rules in such large numbers.""

The annual World Economic Forum traditionally takes place in Davos, Switzerland The World Economic Forum (WEF) - the annual gathering of the world's political, economic and business elite - has been forced to move next year's summit from Switzerland to Singapore because of the pandemic, organisers say. The event, which traditionally takes place in the Alpine village of Davos in January, will instead be held from 13 to 16 May. ""The change in location reflects the Forum's priority of safeguarding the health and safety of participants and the host community,"" the WEF said in a statement. It added that ""in light of the current situation with regards to Covid-19 cases"" and after ""careful consideration"", Singapore was best placed to hold the ""in-person"" meeting next year. The WEF said it planned to return to Davos in 2022. The UK governmenthas just updated its daily coronavirus figures,,externaland has announced 14,718 new confirmed cases. A further 189 people have died with coronavirus, the government added. That measure refers to people who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. It takes the total number of deaths, as recorded by the government by that measure, to 61,434. For more information on the stats and to check how many coronavirus cases are in your area,head here. Life in China is almost back to normal - despite the fact it's where the first case of coronavirus emerged. Since then, there have been lots of racist incidents towards Chinese people - online and in real life - and US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called the disease the ""China-virus"". So what's life like now for people in China, and how do they feel about the way the world views their country after the 2020 pandemic? This video can not be played The UK's Ministry of Defence has provided details on the role the armed forces are playing in the country's vaccine rollout. It said 60 military planners are  working with the government's vaccine task force - with a further 56 Armed Forces personnel now helping to construct vaccination centres. The minister for the armed forces, James Heappey, said around 13,500 military personnel were on high readiness - with just over 2,000 deployed so far to help with testing and the government's Covid response. This is the first and most important question scientists ask when they start designing and testing a new vaccine or treatment. Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. The principle is to start small and only ever move on to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns. As long as the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check that the vaccine or treatment is effective, too. That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - around 40,000 individuals in the case of Pfizer/BioNTech. All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. The Covid vaccine trials have happened at breakneck speed, but they haven't skipped any of these steps. There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against serious infections. Covid vaccines appear to stop people getting very sick and could save lives. Read more here.

Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Restaurants and most shops in Portugal were ordered to close early today on what is the eve of a national holiday as the government attempts to curb the spread of the virus over the second long weekend in two weeks. Traders were obliged to close by 15:00 and the government gave employees the day off in addition to tomorrow's holiday - as it did a week
ago, on the eve of the 1 December national holiday. A domestic travel ban has been in place since 23:00 Friday, and runs to 05:00 Wednesday, with people barred from
leaving their municipality of residence except for work or emergencies. Remote working is mandatory - where feasible - in areas deemed to
be at high, very high, or extremely high risk of transmission of the virus - affecting the vast majority of Portugal's population. In most of these areas - those deemed at very high or extremely high risk,
which include Lisbon and Porto - there is also a 13:00 curfew tomorrow.
The restrictions are in place under the state of emergency that parliament
on Friday voted to renew until 23 December. Portugal yesterday reported 3,834 new
confirmed coronavirus cases - well down from the 19 November peak of 6,994
- and 87 deaths associated with Covid. Since the start of the epidemic, the country has reported 322,474 confirmed cases and 4,963 Covid-19 deaths. Tina and Victor have been together for seven
years and usually meet up every three months in their homes in the US or

"This video can not be played NHS in Wales is under ""considerable and sustained pressure"", says health minister Wales' health minister has warned there could be further restrictions after Christmas as Covid cases continue to rise. Vaughan Gething said Wales was the only part of the UK where figures were not falling at the end of November. Mr Gething confirmed ministers were looking at whether further measures would be needed. At a press conference he said choices made by the public would determine how many die from the virus. It comes as officials in Swansea Bay warned case levels could soon reach""catastrophic levels""unless people follow social distancing rules. Meanwhile the Welsh Conservatives called for ""detailed plans"" for how the Welsh Government would deal with the rising cases. Plaid Cymru's Adam Price said the Welsh Government was struggling to communicate to the public. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Q&A: Can people from Wales go to England to drink? According to UK government statistics, Wales' coronavirus case rate overtook England's on 23 November,two weeks after the firebreak endedand while England was locked down, and on 1 December had a seven-day case rate of 267.8 per 100,000 people. That compared to 149.5 in England, 143.6 in Northern Ireland, and 100.3 in Scotland. The number of deaths per 100,000 people in the seven days to 1 December was 5.07, compared to 4.3 in England, 3.5 in Scotland and 3.3 in Northern Ireland. New measuresstopping the sale of alcohol in pubs, and closing them - along with cafes, bars and restaurants - at 18:00 GMT, came into force last Friday. But Mr Gething said it would ""take a couple of weeks"" for them to have any impact on the rate of confirmed cases. The health minister said the Covid situation is Wales was ""very serious"" with the NHS under ""considerable and sustained pressure"". ""We're actively considering each day whether the measures we have are the right ones in place or not. ""We're committed to review the regulations in the next week and a half or so and we will then have to consider what we doâ¦ we're actively considering what we are going to need to do, what we may need to do after the Christmas period."" Restrictionsare set to be relaxed at Christmas, so three households can form a bubble. The latest data showed the all-Wales case rate was almost 70 points higher than it was on Friday, he told journalists. There were eight local authorities with rates higher than 400 cases per 100,000 people - four times as many areas as on Friday. Mr Gething said choices made by the public would influence how many people died of Covid over the Christmas period. He decisions about social contact made by each individual would ""determine how many of us are here in the New Year and beyond"". At Monday's press briefing, Mr Gething cited the most recentinfection surveyfrom the ONS which said one in 170 people in Wales were likely to have the virus at the end of November. That compared to one in 190 in Northern Ireland, one in 130 in Scotland and one in 105 in England. But he said it showed Wales, with an estimated 18,100 people with Covid-19, ""was the only part of the UK where infection rates did not appear to be falling in the last week of November"". However he said that reflected ""tighter measures elsewhere"". Mr Gething said there were now more than 1,800 coronavirus-related patients in hospitals in Wales - ""the highest number ever recorded"". ""If we do not see a reduction in coronavirus admissions, we will need to consider what action we can take and may need to take to support the NHS as we move into the New Year,"" he said. The figures, from last Thursday, include more than 550 patients still recovering from the effects of the virus, although they have not shown symptoms for more than two weeks. Patients in the Aneurin Bevan and Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board areas count for more than half of those being treated for Covid-19 in hospital. Covid-19 patients make up around 23% of all patients in hospital, compared to about 18% at the end of May. The press conference followed last week's controversyover the alcohol ban in pubs. What is the evidence for new hospitality rules? Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government has struggled to communicate with the public. ""I'm not sure that they're taking the public with them, and there's no clear roadmap, if you like, which takes us from now to where we're going to be in the spring"". He said there should have been ""a compromise"" with less strict hospitality rules. Meanwhile Mr Gething confirmed that the first Covid vaccine will not be delivered to care homes when the rollout begins on Tuesday. Last week the Welsh Government wasunable to saywhen the vaccine roll out would start with care homes, because of difficulties with how it is stored. Mr Gething said conversations had taken place with Pfizer and the regulator ""to understand how we can safely and lawfully deliver this vaccine to care homes"". But he stressed ""that won't be tomorrow"". The Welsh Conservatives said the news was a ""bitter blow"" and the decision needed a ""fuller explanation"". Welsh Conservative Andrew RT Davies, health spokesman, added: ""We've seen that the figures outlined today suggest higher cases of Covid in Wales. ""We, not just Welsh Conservatives but I'm sure all people in Wales, want to see detailed plans of how the administration here will address this. ""However, we have been calling for the publication of a detailed Winter plan for how the virus will be managed for months, and we're still waiting."" Record numbers of Covid-related inpatients in Welsh hospitals inevitably pose questions about recent policy decisions by ministers. Was the firebreak lockdown too short? Was the regime that succeeded it too liberal? On Friday, new (and highly controversial) restrictions on hospitality were imposed. It will be a few weeks before we see any data on their effect. What's interesting is that those measures still allow the most generous household mixing in hospitality venues than any equivalent measures elsewhere in Britain. With the Christmas relaxation looming, it's hard to escape the feeling that stricter restrictions are just around the corner. Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?

Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says about 250,000 doses of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine will be available by the end of the year. These early doses will be prioritised for long-term care workers and people in care homes. The vaccine will be distributed across the country on a per-capita basis, he said, which means that provinces with higher populations will get more doses. The government could approve the vaccine as early as this week, and doses could be ready for distribution next week, Mr Trudeau added. The Mona Lisa hangs on the wall of the empty Louvre If you've ever wished you could see priceless pieces of art without the crowds, now's your chance. After being closed for more than five months this year due to the pandemic, the Louvre in Paris is offering unique experiences to help make up some of its financial losses. With many of the bids starting around â¬10,000 (Â£9,000), you could explore the museum by torchlight, attend a private concert held in your honour, or become one of the few people in the world to see Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa taken down for its annual examination. The most expensive item so far is an oil painting by Pierre Soulages, which has received a bid of â¬800,000. Yann Le Touher, who handles relations with the Louvre's patrons, told Reuters news agency that the museum expected to lose up to â¬90m this year, and that money provided by the French state would only cover around half of the shortfall.

Can she cope with a full-strength dose or should she wait for the half-strength first dose Oxford vaccine (subject to approval)? During the Pfizer vaccine trials, people of all ages were vaccinated to make sure it was safe and effective in older age groups who are most at risk of serious illness and death from Covid-19. In fact, the vaccine was found to be 94% effective in the over-65s. There is no evidence that the over-90s are not able to cope with two full-strength doses. The first primes the bodyâs defences against the virus, while the second dose is a booster which offers full protection after a week. Prof Van-Tam said he is""hopeful"" the Oxford vaccine will be approved by Christmas,but said: ""That's entirely out of my hands. It's down to the MHRA, the UK regulatory body. If it takes them a few weeks, or a few months, that's fine, they have to get it right."" Read more questions and answers here. We've got a little more on the UK's daily coronavirus figures, which the government published earlier. It showed a further 14,718 people had tested positive for coronavirus, and another 189 people had died. Our data team has updated the graphs which show us how the number of deaths and cases (calculated as a seven day average) is changing. Police said they found between 100 and 150 people inside the property in Lace Street A house party with up to 150 guests has been broken up by police in the English city of Nottingham. The 20-year-old organiser of the illegal gathering, in Lace Street, is facing a fine of up to Â£10,000 after officers arrived at about 00:30 GMT. Several guests were given Â£200 penalties for breaking Covid-19 rules and a 19-year-old man was charged with obstructing a police officer. The charged 19-year-old was also fined Â£200 and bailed to appear at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on 26 January. The party host has been reported for summons and could be given the maximum fine under Covid-19 regulations. Nottingham is subject to tier three restrictions, which bans different households mixing indoors. Insp Amy English, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: ""The very last thing we want to be doing as police officers is to be punishing people for gathering together and having fun but there really are no excuses for this kind of behaviour where people are blatantly ignoring rules in such large numbers.""

The annual World Economic Forum traditionally takes place in Davos, Switzerland The World Economic Forum (WEF) - the annual gathering of the world's political, economic and business elite - has been forced to move next year's summit from Switzerland to Singapore because of the pandemic, organisers say. The event, which traditionally takes place in the Alpine village of Davos in January, will instead be held from 13 to 16 May. ""The change in location reflects the Forum's priority of safeguarding the health and safety of participants and the host community,"" the WEF said in a statement. It added that ""in light of the current situation with regards to Covid-19 cases"" and after ""careful consideration"", Singapore was best placed to hold the ""in-person"" meeting next year. The WEF said it planned to return to Davos in 2022. The UK governmenthas just updated its daily coronavirus figures,,externaland has announced 14,718 new confirmed cases. A further 189 people have died with coronavirus, the government added. That measure refers to people who have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. It takes the total number of deaths, as recorded by the government by that measure, to 61,434. For more information on the stats and to check how many coronavirus cases are in your area,head here. Life in China is almost back to normal - despite the fact it's where the first case of coronavirus emerged. Since then, there have been lots of racist incidents towards Chinese people - online and in real life - and US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called the disease the ""China-virus"". So what's life like now for people in China, and how do they feel about the way the world views their country after the 2020 pandemic? This video can not be played The UK's Ministry of Defence has provided details on the role the armed forces are playing in the country's vaccine rollout. It said 60 military planners are  working with the government's vaccine task force - with a further 56 Armed Forces personnel now helping to construct vaccination centres. The minister for the armed forces, James Heappey, said around 13,500 military personnel were on high readiness - with just over 2,000 deployed so far to help with testing and the government's Covid response. This is the first and most important question scientists ask when they start designing and testing a new vaccine or treatment. Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. The principle is to start small and only ever move on to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns. As long as the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check that the vaccine or treatment is effective, too. That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - around 40,000 individuals in the case of Pfizer/BioNTech. All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. The Covid vaccine trials have happened at breakneck speed, but they haven't skipped any of these steps. There is overwhelming scientific evidence that vaccination is the best defence against serious infections. Covid vaccines appear to stop people getting very sick and could save lives. Read more here.

Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon Restaurants and most shops in Portugal were ordered to close early today on what is the eve of a national holiday as the government attempts to curb the spread of the virus over the second long weekend in two weeks. Traders were obliged to close by 15:00 and the government gave employees the day off in addition to tomorrow's holiday - as it did a week
ago, on the eve of the 1 December national holiday. A domestic travel ban has been in place since 23:00 Friday, and runs to 05:00 Wednesday, with people barred from
leaving their municipality of residence except for work or emergencies. Remote working is mandatory - where feasible - in areas deemed to
be at high, very high, or extremely high risk of transmission of the virus - affecting the vast majority of Portugal's population. In most of these areas - those deemed at very high or extremely high risk,
which include Lisbon and Porto - there is also a 13:00 curfew tomorrow.
The restrictions are in place under the state of emergency that parliament
on Friday voted to renew until 23 December. Portugal yesterday reported 3,834 new
confirmed coronavirus cases - well down from the 19 November peak of 6,994
- and 87 deaths associated with Covid. Since the start of the epidemic, the country has reported 322,474 confirmed cases and 4,963 Covid-19 deaths. Tina and Victor have been together for seven

" How high might temperatures climb and how much rain might fall in your area and how? The BBC and the Met Office have looked at the UK's changing climate in detail to find out. Temperatures in the UK exceeded 40C for the first time on record earlier this summer, and extreme weather events are likely to become even more frequent. The Met Office climate projections cover different levels of global warming. When, or if, these levels are reached will depend on the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. The data is measured in 12km-square (7.5-mile-square) grids across the UK. The results for your postcode represent an average for the grids closest to you and the mid-point of a range of future possibilities, which come from the Met Office’s most recent major climate modelling data.

If global temperatures rise by 4C, it could be about {{beginHighlight}}{{high_hottest_day}}C{{endHighlight}}. The hottest day recorded in the UK came in July 2022, with40.3C measured in at Coningsby in Lincolnshire. Human activity has increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and caused rising temperatures worldwide since the growth of industrialisation in the 19th Century. If global average temperatures rise by 2C above pre-industrial levels, days at least as hot the 2019 record could be more frequent and widespread. And with a 4C rise, parts of the UK could see temperatures above 42C. Urgent cuts in emissions are needed to keep the rise in global average temperatures in check. The Glasgow Climate Pact,reached at the COP26 summit in 2021, agreed countries will meet this year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Use buttons to change season In the the 30 summers from 1991 to 2019, there were {{beginHighlight}} {{current_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}} above 25C per month on average. If global temperatures rise by 2C, there could be {{beginHighlight}}{{medium_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. With a 4C rise, there could be {{beginHighlight}}{{high_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines any day with a maximum temperature above 25C as a ""summer day"". In the 30 summers from 1991 to 2019, even the warmest places in the UK, located in the South, had no more than seven days a month above 25C on average. If global average temperatures rise by 2C, southern parts of the country could see more than 11 days per summer month go beyond 25C. If the rise is 4C, those places could have 20 or more summer days per month, and higher likelihood of hot spells triggering public-health warnings. The cooler, northern parts of the UK, which may not see many days above 25C even with a 4C rise, can nonetheless expect average daytime temperatures in summer to increase by at least 2.5C. The average daytime temperature in the UK in summercurrentlyranges from about 14C in northern Scotland to 22C in southern England.But summers have been getting warmer, with four of the 10 hottest summers up to 2019 recorded in the past two decades. Even if countries cut emissions and theworld warms by 2C, the whole UK could see higher summer temperatures.In some northern locations, the increase could be small. In southern areas, average summer temperatures could reach 24C. If emissions continue to increase and average global temperaturesrise by 4C, summers will be even hotter.Nearly a third of the UK could see average summer temperatures above 25C. The Met Office climate projections for the UK indicate significant temperature rises in the decades ahead for both winter and summer, with the greatest increases in the already warmer South. Extreme weather could become more frequent and intense. Not every summer will be hotter than the last – but temperature records are expected to be regularly broken, while heatwaves are likely to be longer and happen more often. Use buttons to change season In the 30 years from 1991 to 2019, there were {{beginHighlight}} {{current_rainy_days}} rainy days{{endHighlight}} on average per month in summer. If global average temperatures rise by 2C, this could be {{beginHighlight}}{{medium_rainy_days}} days{{endHighlight}} per month. At a 4C rise it could be about {{beginHighlight}}{{high_rainy_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. In the 30 years from 1991 to 2019, there were {{beginHighlight}}{{current_rainy_days}} rainy days{{endHighlight}} on average per month in winter. At both 2C and 4C rises, the number of rainy days per month could be roughly the same. As the world warms, fewer rainy days in summer are expected. Currently, over a quarter of the UK has 20 or more days without rain each summer month. This could grow to more than half the country if we reach 4C global warming. Winter rains could remain as likely as they are now. The number of days will vary from year-to-year, but rainy days in a warmer future could be wetter than today with total rainfall expected to rise. Use buttons to change season   In warmer winters the heaviest rains are likely to get more intense. If global average temperatures rise by 4C above pre-industrial levels, half the country could expect at least 20% more rainfall on the wettest winter days. Summer rains may also become heavier in many places, although total rainfall is expected to decline. Of course, not all of the heaviest rains will necessarily fall in these two seasons. The current wettest day on record was 3 October 2020, whenenough rain fell across all four nations to fill Loch Ness. Currently,the wettest areas of the UK dominate the west coast, with nearly all of Wales and western Scotland receiving most rain in winter months. So how much will change in future winters? With a2C rise, very little compared to what we've seen recently.But winters over the past 30 years have been rainier on average than previously, and the pattern of wetter winters could continue. The exact amount of change in rainfall at2C global warmingwill vary across the country. Most places could have slightly wetter winters than in the 20th Century. If global average temperatures were torise by 4C, more than half the country could see at least 10% more rain over the winter months. The UK climate projections suggest increases in winter rainfall in most parts of the country, as well as drier summers. Rainfall measurements fluctuate from year to year, making projections challenging. Not every winter will necessarily be rainier than the one before, and not every summer will be dry, but both trends could have big impacts. As the world warms, the UK is likely to have hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters, according to the Met Office. Extreme weather events such as heatwaves and heavy downpours could become more frequent and more intense. Many scientists are concerned. ""I think it’s really frightening,” says Dr Lizzie Kendon, a senior Met Office scientist. “It's just a wake-up call really as to what we’re talking about here.” We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, but the level of global warming we reach and by when will depend primarily on the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. To some, warming weather may not seem like such a big deal. But even the smallest incremental changes in climate can have far-reaching effects. Temperatures above 30C for two or more days can trigger a public-health warning. In the 1990s, this happened about once every four years for locations in the South. By the 2070s, projections suggest it could be as frequently as four times per year - 16 times more often, if we do not curb our emissions. The Met Office projects rainy winters, which keep the soil wet into spring, and dry summers of infrequent rainfall will become the norm. Summer rain is likely to become less frequent but could be heavier. Without regular rainfall, the ground has a harder time absorbing water when it finally does come, leading to a greater risk of flash flooding. Floods will likely become a staple of warming winters as well. Steady rain, which is currently a feature of winter months, will probably continue, and total rainfall is expected to increase. When the ground is already saturated, waterways tend to rise. Bridges and sewers designed for historical rainfall levels may come increasingly under pressure. Warming temperatures could also mean cold spells become less frequent. Andsnowy UK winters could become thing of the pastas climate change affects the UK, according to Met Office analysis shared with BBC Panorama. Temperatures below freezing during the day and areas with considerable amounts of snow on the ground may be limited to parts of Scotland by the end of the century if emissions continue to rise. The BBC has collaborated with scientists from the Met Office to analyse data from their extensive weather measurement records and their major climate modelling project, theUK Climate Projections (UKCP). The present-day data shows averages of observed measurements for 1991-2019. The future data shows projected temperature and rainfall measurements produced by climate models for two different levels of global warming: if global average temperatures rise 2C above records from the mid-19th Century, the start of major industrialisation, and if that rise is 4C. Twelve different versions of the Met Office's Hadley Centre climate model were used in calculating the UKCP Regional (12km) projections using a high emissions gas scenario (RCP8.5). Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. They help scientists come up with projections for what conditions on Earth we are likely to see as global warming continues. The level of global warming depends on a number of factors. The most important is the amount of emissions produced in the coming years. Emissions are greenhouse gases released into our atmosphere. The accumulation of these gases has a warming effect on the globe, which in turn leads to changes in climatic conditions. Governments around the world have pledged to reduce their emissions to limit the degree of warming. During the Glasgow COP26 summit in 2021, countries agreed to meet the following year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of keeping temperature rises within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effectssuch as millions more people being exposed to extreme heat. If no interventions are taken, global average temperatures could rise by up to 4C by 2100. This high-emissions future is highlighted in themost recent Evidence Report for the UK's Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA)as possible, if less likely. Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C, while at current rates of global emissions, the world is on a pathway somewhere between 2C and 4C. The modelled projections in this data do not represent a specific time period. Instead, they show what conditions could be like in these two different levels of global warming. Some other climate data may project specific points in time by which a certain level of global warming may be reached. However, this model allows for the possibility of actions that may reduce or increase emissions enough to change the timing before we would experience a 2C or 4C future. More information on the methods used to calculate the timing of different levels of global warming can be found inthis 2018 Met Office paper. This tool presents six different measurements among those scientists use to gain a picture of the environment under various conditions. Each represents a specific predefined climate metric. 1. Hottest day is the maximum temperature recorded or projected on a single day 2. Summer days, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), have a maximum temperature above 25C 3. Average daytime temperature is the average of daily maximum air temperatures over a season 4. Rainy days are when more than 1mm of rain is recorded. This excludes days that may have had very light rain or a heavy morning dew or mist 5. Wettest day is the maximum amount of recorded or projected rainfall on a single day 6. Total rainfall is the amount in millimetres measured across a season. We also calculated and display the change in rainfall for the future scenarios as a percentage change from the current period (1991-2019) Climate data is typically presented in gridded squares that make up a large surface area. The grids used in this model are 12km by 12km. This level of detail is able to capture many of the varied climate conditions across the UK's diverse geography far better than other, broader-scale models. Each UK postcode has been matched to its nearest 12km-square grid. The results displayed for your area represent an average (mean) for the grids closest to that location, as long as they are no further than 34km away. In most cases a grid has been averaged with its eight nearest grids, except along irregular coastlines and small islands. Averaging means that the figures displayed are never for a single grid alone. While natural variability between grid areas is normal, this process minimises dramatic differences that may be down to chance. Both current and future data are organised into the same 12km-square grids. However, unlike future modelled predictions, the present-day data comes from actual observed measurements. We have presented a single number that represents an average for each grid and season. This helps to reduce the influence of outliers in observed data. For instance, the current number of summer days represents the mean number of days recording maximum temperatures of at least 25C per month in June, July and August across every year from 1991 to 2019. Each number presented in the two future scenarios represents the median of 12 possible outcomes as projected by the 12 model simulations. All future projection data has been calibrated by Met Office scientists against the data in the present-day range, 1991-2019, so the model results can be compared directly with observations. More information on the calibration technique used can be foundin this 2017 paper. Because climate data is gridded, the data may represent a larger area than that covered by a single weather station. Measurements from multiple weather stations are averaged together to give a single datapoint for a grid. Take the hottest day, for instance. If the highest temperature recorded at Cambridge Royal Botanic Gardens was 38.7C, that number is combined with measurements from other stations across the region to produce an average for a 12km-square area that includes Cambridge. Other weather stations will have recorded slightly lower temperatures, so the average highest temperature in this area would be less than 38.7C.

"Pop star Rita Ora has apologised for a second breach of the UK's Covid-19 restrictions, after failing to self-isolate following a trip to Egypt. The 30-year-old flew to Egypt for a private performance on 21 November. On her return the following day, she should have isolated for two weeks. Instead, she threw a birthday party in London, which was itself in violation of lockdown rules. The starapologised for the party last week, and offered to pay a fine. Details of her trip to Egypt subsequently emerged in theMail On Sunday,external. The newspaper said the singer, whose hits include I Will Never Let You Down, Your Song and Let You Love Me, had played an exclusive set at Cairo's W Hotel for a six-figure sum. An unverified source also told the Mail that Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi was among those in attendance, although the claim has been disputed. In response, Ora said she ""deserved criticism"" for her actions, and would donate her fee from the concert to charity. This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? In a statement, she said: ""I recently flew to Egypt to perform at a corporate event for a private company, where my travel party followed protocol and presented negative Covid tests upon entry, as required by Egyptian authorities. ""Upon my return to Britain, I should have followed government advice and isolated myself for the required period. As you know, I didn't follow government advice and for that I apologised earlier this week. I apologise again, unreservedly."" After reassuring fans she had tested negative for Covid-19, she continued: ""While I realise the apologetic words of a pop star might not carry much weight, especially one who has broken the rules like I have, I do realise that some might seek to follow my example. My message to them is simple: Please don't. ""The guilt and shame I've carried this week for my mistake aren't worth it. Instead, continue to listen to the government advice and the voices of the heroes of the NHS and take the required precautions. I will take the criticisms coming my way because I deserve them."" She added that she hoped ""to one day make it up to the public who have given me so much support over the years and, in particular, make it up to the heroes of the NHS"". Rita Ora pictured at the MTV Europe Music Awards earlier this year Meanwhile, Kensington and Chelsea Council has denied that Ora paid a Â£10,000 fine over the party she held in Notting Hill's Casa Cruz restaurant, according tothe Local Democracy Reporting Service. Up to 30 people were at the event, according to reports, although the pop star herself described it as a ""small gathering"". Some press outlets claimed she had handed over a five-figure sum, but on Friday 4 December, a council spokesperson said no such fine had been paid. They added that the council was investigating the premises for a potential breach of licensing and Covid regulations, and that it was not in their power to investigate an individual.

"The surfer said he had been enjoying a ""normal day's surfing"" when he was attacked by a great white shark A surfer in Australia who was attacked by a great white shark has described the experience as like being ""hit by a truck"". The 29-year-old was surfing in waters around Kangaroo Island off the Adelaide coast, when he was attacked on Sunday. He suffered serious injuries and was said to be lucky to be alive. After the attack at remote D'Estrees Bay, he managed to swim back to shore, before walking another 300 metres (328 yards) to get help. First fatal attack on Gold Coast beaches in 60 years How do you stop sharks attacking? Describing his ordeal in a handwritten letter, he said he believed he would make a full recovery.

Any disruption caused by Brexit could affect supplies of the coronavirus vaccine, according to Wales' health minister. Vaughan Gething said work had been done to make ""alternative arrangements"" but that any disruption was an ""unwelcome distraction"". ""There is no getting away from the fact that disrupting our ports could disrupt supplies,"" he said. Mr Gething said pharmaceutical companies had taken matters ""into their own hands"", and have planned to use different ports of entry. He said disruption ""may not happen on day one"" of Brexit but ""there's a challenge about longer term arrangements"". The UK left the EU in January but entered a transition
period until the end of 2020 in which the trading rules remained broadly the
same. If a deal is not reached, from 1 January border checks
and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. Students will be invited to return to university campuses in Wales over a four-week period, starting from 11 January, with a phased return to in-person teaching. Priority will be given students in healthcare professions, on placements, or who need access to campus facilities. Lateral-flow testing pilots, for students showing now students, will continue. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: âI know students will be eager to return to their university campus after the Christmas break, but will want to do that in a safe way. âStudents will also want to return to learning in person, where itâs safe to do so. ""Weâre putting these measures in place to ensure confidence in a return to learning in-person and minimise the risk of large numbers of students needing to self-isolate during the term."" Testing of students for Covid will continue in the new year Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online UK hospitals are getting ready to start giving the first doses of a coronavirus vaccine now that regulators have approved the Pfizer/BioNTech jab for widespread use. But while many people want an injection as soon as possible, others are worried about putting something unknown into their bodies. So, how do we know a vaccine is safe? Local Democracy Reporting Service Schools in Caerphilly county borough will move to online learning from Thursday, 17 December for the final two days of the school term. Chief education officer Keri Cole has written to parents and carers saying the council recognises the rise of cases in the county borough and the disruption children and young people have experienced to their education. But she added that some schools may take the decision to close earlier than that, for example by rescheduling inset days. âThe local authority and school communities are absolutely committed to offering the best provision under increasingly difficult circumstances and we recognise how worrying this situation must be for you,"" Ms Cole wrote. âI sincerely hope that you will enjoy a safe, family Christmas and that we will all look forward together to a new year.â Neighbouring Blaenau Gwent council, serving an area with one of the highest Covid infection rates in Wales, has already decided toclose schools after lessons on Wednesday, more than a week early. The Welsh Government and council leaders across Wales have agreed a joint pledge to keep schools open until term ends on 18 December, only moving to remote learning ""where it is proportionate to the prevalence and impact of the virus within the locality"". Here's a chart showing why Covid-19 cases are causing concern for health bosses inSwansea and Neath Port Talbot. Swansea Bay health board director Dr Keith Reid said the local health system will be ""overwhelmed"" if cases continue to rise at the current rate. There have been 800 new cases reported in the last two days in the region, he said. Beer was poured away prior to new rules being adopted on Friday evening Paul Davies, the Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd, said the hospitality sector needed help sooner rather than later to protect businesses and jobs over Christmas. Pubs in Wales have been banned from serving alcohol and ordered to close at 18:00 GMT, other than for takeaways. Barrels of beer were poured down drainson Friday as the hospitality industry prepared for the alcohol ban to come into force. First Minister Mark Drakeford has previously said firms hit by the restrictions would be offeredÂ£340m in supportwhich he claimed was ""the most generous package of financial assistance anywhere in the UK"".

Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has said the Welsh Government has struggled to communicate with the public over the actions taken to tackle coronavirus. âIâm not sure that they're taking the public with them, and there's no clear road map, if you like, which takes us from now to where we're going to be in the spring,"" he said. Mr Price said there should have been âa compromiseâ with less strict hospitality rules which has seen pubsbanned from serving alcoholand ordered to close at 18:00 GMT, other than for takeaway service.. âIt's absolutely essential you take the public with you, step by step, and also give them a sense that you know the way forward over the next three to four months, and that's what's lacking, I think, at the moment,"" he said. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has confirmed ministers were considering whether any new restrictions would be needed after relaxation for a five-day window allowing family get-togethers over the holidays. Adam Price: ""It's absolutely essential you take the public with you, step by step"" Schools in Wales should remain open as planned up to the Christmas holiday, said Health Minister Vaughan Gething. He said there was no current Covid evidence to show that there was âsignificant harmâ in keeping schools open. Mr Gething said school was a âsafe placeâ for vulnerable children and a shut-down would disproportionately affect the least well-off. Blaenau Gwent council, serving an area with one of the highest Covid infection rates in Wales, has decided toclose schools after lessons on Wednesday, more than a week early. The decision comes despite a pledge from the Welsh Government and council leaders across Wales to keep schools open until term ends on 18 December. Vaccines will not be delivered to care homes in Wales onTuesday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has confirmed. There had been concerns surrounding the transporting of the vaccines to care homes due to the very low temperatures needed to store the vials. Mr Gething said conversations had taken place with manufacturer Pfizer and the regulator ""to understand how we can safely and lawfully deliver this vaccine to care homes"" but he stressed: ""That won't be tomorrow."" Whilst other parts of the UK have said they hope to deliver the vaccine to care homes before Christmas, Mr Gething said he wanted to give ""a rather more definitive date than that"". ""At present those conversations with the regulator are not complete,"" he said. ""So I'll follow thepriority list given by the JCVI(Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) with that important caveat that, at this point, and certainly tomorrow, we won't be able to deliver the vaccine to care homes. ""But we will vaccinate in accordance with those priorities, not in the first batch but, of course, the subsequent batches we expect to get through the month of December."" Choices made by the public will influence how many people
die of Covid over the Christmas period, according to Health Minister Vaughan
Gething. He confirmed ministers were considering whether any new
restrictions would be needed after relaxation for a five-day window allowing family get-togethers over the holidays. âWeâre in very odd position of a much more contested
environment, and rising harm being seen,â said Mr Gething, referring to new Covid infections. âWe know that this is much more about the choices weâre
making about who we see, how long we see them for. âWeâre actively considering each day whether the measures
we have are the right ones in place or not. ""Weâre committed to review the regulations in the
next week and a half or so and we will then have to consider what we do... weâre
actively considering what we are going to need to do, what we may need to do
after the Christmas period. âSo, if weâre going to be able to get through not just to
the end of the year but into the next year with the minimum amount of harm,
itâs not just the choices we make in government, itâs the choices each of us
make about how weâre living our lives that will determine how many of us are
here in the New Year and beyond.â Self-isolation paymentsin Wales are to be extended to include some parents and carers on low incomes of children who have to self-isolate. The Â£500 payment has been available to help people on low
incomes and as a statutory sick pay top-up to social care workers who have to
self-isolate. Health Minister Vaughan Gething told a Welsh Government
briefing it will be extended from next Monday to include parents and
carers on low incomes of children who have to self-isolate because of an
outbreak of coronavirus at their school or childcare setting. ""This will provide parents and carers on low incomes
with the financial support they need while they look after their children,""
he said. These children in Gwynedd had to self-isolate because of positive Covid tests at their school Having a vaccination against coronavirus will not be mandatory, according to Public Health Wales. It says people will be able to choose whether they take it or not, but it warns""it will be offered to those who are most at risk first"",external.

There are now more than 1,800 coronavirus-related patients in hospitals around Wales, the highest number since the pandemic began, according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said Wales was the only part of the UK where infection rates did not appear to be falling in the last week of November, according to an ONS infection survey. He said it reflected the tighter measures elsewhere in the UK at the time. Mr Gething said the government strengthenedcoronavirus restrictionsin response to this âvery serious situationâ on Friday in a bid to slow the spread of the virus and to protect peopleâs health. âBut, just like the firebreak period, we will not see the impact immediately â it will take a couple of weeksâ, he added. Wales was the only part of the UK whereCovid infection rates were not fallingat the end of November, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said it reflected tighter UK restrictions elsewhere. But he said if there is not a reduction in NHS Covid admissions ""we will need to consider what action we can take"". The coronavirus case rate overtook England's on 23 November - and Wales had a higher death rate in the week to 1 December. Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the situation with Covid in Wales remains âvery seriousâ, with cases rising in 19 of the 22 local authority areas. He told the Welsh Governmentâs coronavirus briefing: 
âOur health service is under considerable and sustained pressure because of the number of people who need to be admitted to hospital for treatment for coronavirus."" Mr Gething said the latest data shows that the all-Wales case rate is almost 70 points higher than it was on Friday. âThis shows you how just fast coronavirus is spreading,"" he said. Mr Gething said there were eight local authorities with rates higher than 400 cases per 100,000 people â four times as many areas as on Friday. âSadly, we are seeing a return to the very high rates of more than 500 in Blaenau Gwent and 600 in Neath Port Talbot,"" he added Dr Keith Reid: ""We have a chance to stave off a potential catastrophe"" Local health and social care services could be ""overwhelmed"" byan increase in coronavirus cases in Swansea and Neath Port Talbot, according to
the director of public health for Swansea Bay University Health Board. Dr Keith Reid said Neath
Port Talbot hit ""record"" levels of Covid-19 infection rates with 622
cases per 100,000 population in the past week, with 446 cases per 100,000
population in Swansea. There were 800 new
cases reported in the last two days alone in the Swansea Bay region, he said. 'We have a chance to stave off a potential catastrophe but we all have a role to play,"" he said, in astatement,externalpublished by the health board. âIf infections
continue to rise at the current rate then, without another lockdown before
Christmas, the local system will be overwhelmed.â Public Health Wales is due to publish the latest overall figures for coronavirus cases in Wales later on Monday. Allow Twitter content?

"Kensington Palace arranged for three reindeer to visit a school in Berwick as a treat for the pupils The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have surprised schoolchildren with a visit from reindeer during a three-day train tour of Great Britain. Kensington Palace arranged for Chaz, Crackers and her calf, Echols, to join the couple at a school in Berwick. Prince William and Catherine are travelling around Great Britain to thank key workers for their efforts during the pandemic. Their first stop was Edinburgh, where they met frontline ambulance workers. The duke and duchess had travelled to Scotland overnight from London's Euston station. The 1,250 mile tour on board the royal train will include stops in England, Scotland and Wales. The couple, known as the Earl and Countess of Strathearn in Scotland, arrived at Edinburgh Waverley station on Monday morning to the sounds of a piper playing Christmas songs including Jingle Bells and Santa Claus is Coming to Town. Their first official engagement saw them visit the Scottish Ambulance Service in Newbridge, near Edinburgh, where they met front-line staff. Piper Louise Marshall and deputy Lord Lieutenant Sandra Cumming greet the royal couple in Edinburgh This video can not be played Prince William and Catherine thanked Scottish ambulance staff for their work during the pandemic They heard moving accounts from ambulance workers about how they have been personally affected by the crisis. Paramedic Alistair Matson told them about how he had to cope with his father falling ill and later dying in hospital during the pandemic. Mr Matson, 54, said: ""It was very emotional talking to the prince about losing my father. He was very anxious to hear how we managed to cope with the mental strains of our job."" The visit coincided with the announcement that the couple have become joint patrons of NHS Charities Together. Ian Lush, chairman of NHS Charities Together, said it was ""such an honour for our organisation"", adding that their involvement will inspire the public ""to do even more to support the amazing NHS staff and volunteers"". Earlier this year,Captain Sir Tom Moore raised more than Â£33m for NHS Charities Togetherby walking 100 laps of his Bedfordshire garden before his 100th birthday. Later asked whether the visit to Scotland broke coronavirus rules banning cross-border travel, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the royal household was made aware of the restrictions ahead of time. Royal sources said the Cambridges' trip was planned in conjunction with the UK, Scottish and Welsh governments and that travelling across the border is permitted for work purposes. The royal couple then crossed the border to visit Holy Trinity First School in England's most northern town, Berwick-upon-Tweed. The school's 175 pupils waved and sang as the duke and duchess arrived, while local saxophone group The Earl Grey Saxes played Christmas tunes, including Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. Kate and William were greeted by children wearing antlers at a school visit in Berwick-upon-Tweed As a surprise for the children, Kensington Palace had organised for Rent a Reindeer to bring three animals to the school. Rent a Reindeer owner George Richardson said the booking by the palace had been ""top secret"". He said: ""We got a phone call out of the blue two weeks ago, they asked us to bring a reindeer for the royal visit and we were happy to oblige. ""This was baby's first outing and she took it in her stride,"" he added, talking about the calf. Headteacher Nicholas Shaw said the school felt ""honoured"" to have been chosen for the royal visit, adding: ""We appreciate they are taking the time to think about teachers and the work that has been going on in schools.""

Before leaving London on Sunday night, the duke and duchess left a personal message of thanks for transport workers on a London Underground service information board. Kensington Palace shared images of Catherine writing the notice,,externalwhich read: ""Thank you to all transport workers everywhere for keeping the country moving throughout this difficult year. ""Wishing you all a very Merry Christmas!"" They were also serenaded by singer Shakin' Stevens, who performed his hit festive song, Merry Christmas Everyone, at the station.

Prince Charles's study on the royal train, as pictured in 2010 Queen Victoria was the first monarch to use the royal train, travelling from Slough to Paddington station on 13 June 1842, with Isambard Kingdom Brunel riding on the footplate. In her diary, the 23-year-old queen described the 25-minute journey as ""delightful and so quick"" The present train has nine carriages and came into service for the Queen's Silver Jubilee, in 1977. It includes private carriages for the Queen and the Prince of Wales The train is described as more functional than palatial, with one royal aide suggesting it has bathroom fixtures ""you could find in Homebase or B&Q"" Only three trips - two by the Prince of Wales and one by the Queen - were taken on the royal train in the 2019/2020 financial year, but the total cost was more than Â£63,000. When the Queen toured the UK on the train for her Golden Jubilee in 2002, it cost Â£872,000 In 2000, a royal bodyguard discharged his gun on the train while the Queen was sleeping.

"Kevin Crossland pictured with his grandmother in 1961, the year he was born David Crossland's whole family died beside him on a holiday flight to Yugoslavia in September 1966. His wife Daphne, and their young children Kevin and Lynne were killed when their plane crashed in woods as it was approaching the airport in Ljubljana. David, who was sitting across the aisle from his wife and children, crawled to safety from the burning wreckage. In the decades that followed, David suffered from long-term leg injuries and survivor guilt, but managed to build a new life. He remarried and had another son and daughter. He met his second wife, Liisa, when she was helping to nurse him as he recovered in hospital in London. David died of cancer in 2001. He never knew that at that time an undercover police officer was using the name Kevin Crossland - the five-year-old son David had lost in the plane crash. Liisa Crossland remembers her husband once telling her that he had heard from his police acquaintances that some officers would adopt the identities of dead children. It was a practice used by the assassin in the 1970s Fredrick Forsyth thriller, The Day of the Jackal, later a film. Liisa says she has felt enormous anger for the two years since the family was first informed about the use of Kevin's name by police. ""How can someone stoop so low? My husband is not here to fight for the truth. But on behalf of him and my family, I want to get to the bottom of the way Kevin's identity was used,"" she said. Liisa and David's son, Mark - whose middle name is Kevin in memory of the brother he never knew - describes it as ""the most irresponsible thing the officer could have done. I really don't know how my dad would have dealt with this if he had still been alive. We are looking for a proper apology from someone who actually means it."" David and Liisa Crossland in 1999 The Crosslands are one of four families who have begun legal action against the Metropolitan Police over the use of their dead children's identities by undercover officers between the 1980s and early 2000s. The other children whose identities were used were: Rod Richardson, who died of pneumonia two days after he was born in January 1963 in hospital in south London Neil Martin, who died a month after his sixth birthday in hospital in County Durham in October 1969. He was severely disabled Michael Hartley, whose body was never found after he fell from a fishing trawler when he was a teenager in August 1968 The practice of taking dead children's identities has been exposed as a tactic used by police officers from two units, the Special Demonstration Squad and the National Public Order Intelligence Unit, who infiltrated protest groups and political movements over a 40-year period from 1968. They would use the children's birth certificates to apply for passports and driving licences to allow them to build a back story or ""legend"". The families of Kevin, Rod, Neil and Michael are claiming for misuse of private information, negligence and personal injury - and are calling on the Met to apologise and admit liability. In a statement the Met said it was investigating the claims and was ""unable to comment further at this time"". This photo of Kevin was taken not long before he was killed It comes at the end of a year which has seen the much-delayed public inquiry into undercover policing finally get under way. It's examining the role of police spies over a 40-year period from the late 1960s. During opening statements last month, Heather Williams QC, representing the families of Kevin, Rod, Neil and Michael, as well as other families, denounced the use of dead children's identities by officers as an ""abhorrent practice"". ""It has caused our clients' memories of their loved ones to be forever tarnished. The intensity of their original grief has been brought back with full force,"" she said. This video can not be played Faith Masonâs son, Neil, died in 1969. An undercover officer used his identity A ""tradecraft manual"" for the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) is among a cache of documents released to the inquiry. It reads: ""By tradition the aspiring SDS officer's first major task was to spend hours and hours at St Catherine's House leafing through death registers in search of a name he could call his own."" And it goes on: ""The SDS officer would assume squatters' rights over the unfortunate's identity for the next four years."" In some cases officers are believed to have visited the graves of children whose names they were using. They also researched their families, described in the manual as establishing their respiratory status and ""if they were still breathing, where they were living"". The officers who used the identities of Kevin, Rod, Neil and Michael infiltrated groups including the Animal Liberation Front, Class War and the Revolutionary Communist Party. Their true identities, like most of their colleagues', remain secret, as do even the cover names of more than 50 other police. More than 40 officers are said to have taken the names of dead children. Undercover Policing Inquiry: We want answers Undercover police officer 'not forgiven' Lawrence family 'losing confidence' in inquiry The officer who used Kevin's identity did not appear to have been authorised to do this, according to a statement from the inquiry in 2018. He had been given permission to use his second undercover name, James Straven, but not the identity of a dead child. The inquiry has heard that he was known as James Straven when he had relationships with two female activists. This is another practice used by a number of officers which is under scrutiny by the public inquiry, which had its initial hearings last month and will resume next year. Liisa says she is grateful for the difficult work done by the police generally, but her family is now in torment as a result of the undercover tactics. ""Kevin's memory belongs to us. He was laid to rest. Why was his identity stolen?""

"San Francisco's local lockdown began slightly earlier than in some other parts of the state Most parts of the US state of California are under a strict new lockdown, as Covid-19 continues to surge across the country. The stay-at-home order affects around 85% of the state's 40 million people. It will be in place for at least three weeks and cover the Christmas holiday. Many businesses will be closed, and people will be banned from meeting anyone outside their household. On Sunday, the US had a record number of people in hospital with Covid-19. The country has seen a sharp rise in cases and Covid-related deaths in recent weeks, a surge that could be partly down to last month's Thanksgiving holiday, when millions of Americans travelled around the US. A US city engulfed by Covid, but no lockdown Where has been hit hardest? US vaccine chief sees 'light at end of the tunnel' The new restrictions in California - the country's most populous state - were triggered by intensive care capacity in hospitals shrinking. The measures apply to the southern part of the state and its central valley, while other areas could follow within days. San Francisco has also gone into lockdown, with the mayor imposing a separate set of orders. California's lockdown in March, in which all non-essential businesses were closed, was seen as an early model for the US at the beginning of the pandemic. Governor Gavin Newsom has ordered that when capacity at intensive care units in any of five regions of the state goes below 15%, that region will go into lockdown within 24 hours. The stay-at-home orders triggered in this way will be similar to the far-reaching order issued for the state after the pandemic first hit in March, but with a few significant relaxations: All retail stores are able to stay open, although only at 20% capacity, along with outside spaces such as parks and beaches Gatherings are prohibited, and people are required to stay at home and minimise contact with other households Bars, hair salons and indoor restaurants are closed The lockdown will last for at least three weeks, and until ICU capacity goes above 15% again. Mr Newsom said the measures would help to ""flatten the curve"" and reduce the pressure on health services. ""We are at a tipping point in our fight against the virus and we need to take decisive action now to prevent California's hospital system from being overwhelmed in the coming weeks,"" he said last week. Reactions to the new lockdown measures have been mixed. Some small businesses owners and service-industry employees fear the economic burden will become overwhelming. Others see the governor's orders as a relief. Mimi Marylon Moore Routh, 78, from Lake Tahoe: ""I'm glad for the lockdown.  It is so important to have it, I want to live 10 or 20 more years. I will spend my Christmas with some good music, knitting and listening to audio books."" Joshua Roizman, 22, from Orange County:""It's necessary, but I think the way Gavin Newsom is handling this is not the best. Restaurants are hurting. I worked in the restaurant industry, so I sympathise with them. They're just trying to stay alive."" Heidi Whelchel, 43, from Rancho Cucamonga:""The lockdown is an annoyance because nobody is really observing it and nobody really cares.  It's not like you have the police outside watching that people comply."" The situation in California reflects a surge in infections nationwide. The state, which has the largest number of confirmed cases in the US, reported an additional 30,000 infections on Sunday, a new record. It has recorded more than 1.3 million cases and around 21,000 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Intensive care capacity in two of the five regions set up by state officials for the purposes of the stay-at-home order - Southern California and the central San Joaquin Valley - fell below 15% on Friday. Southern California, which includes Los Angeles and San Diego, the state's two largest cities, fell to 12.5% on Saturday, and San Joaquin to just 8.6%. This video can not be played ""I don't need your instruction"": Two US senators clash on wearing face masks in the chamber Republican opponents of the Democratic authorities in the state and many of its municipalities have questioned the efficacy of the new measures, and say they could harm the local economy. ""Every state is experiencing a surge, which begs the question, how do these shutdowns actually reduce cases?"" state legislator James Gallagher told Fox News. Research has found thatlockdown measures have been associated with reduced infection numbers,external, while the World Health Organization also urges people to ""avoid spaces that are closed,external, crowded or involve close contact"" during the pandemic. But some law enforcement officials said they did not plan to help enforce the new rules, with Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes saying: ""Compliance with health orders is a matter of personal responsibility and not a matter of law enforcement."" Meanwhile, Governor Newsom has been facing accusations of hypocrisy. In November he visited a high-class restaurant in the Napa Valley, contrary to his own guidance. San Francisco Mayor London Breed dined at the same restaurant on a different night. Both have apologised. But White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany seized on the errors: ""These images... make clear Democrats' mind-set: rules for thee but not for me."" According to the Covid Tracking Project,101,487 people were being treated in hospital,externalwith the disease on Sunday, while an additional 1,138 deaths were recorded. Nearly 14.6 million people have been infected with Covid-19 in the US, and 273,374 people have died - the highest figures of any country in the world. On Sunday, Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator, criticised the Trump administration for flouting guidelines and peddling ""myths"" about the pandemic. ""I hear community members parroting back those situations, parroting back that masks don't work, parroting back that we should work towards herd immunity,"" Dr Birx told NBC. ""This is the worst event that this country will face."" This video can not be played Moncef Slaoui told CBS News that Americans could take comfort in vaccine news but still needed to follow Covid-19 guidance The scientist in charge of the US push for a vaccine,Moncef Slaoui, said there was ""light at the end of the tunnel""and that he hoped the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could give the go-ahead for a vaccine when it meets on Thursday. But for life to get back to normal by the spring, Americans still needed to follow safety measures, he said in an interview with CBS News. States are preparing to distribute a vaccine, with possible approval approaching. Doses are expected to be made available first to the country's million healthcare workers and three million elderly people living in long-term care homes.

"The vaccine arrived at Wrexham Maelor Hospital in a brown carboard box on Monday afternoon The first batch of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine has arrived in Wales ahead of Tuesday's much-anticipated rollout. The vaccine arrived at Wales' seven health boards in unassuming brown cardboard boxes on Monday afternoon. Front-line NHS staff and over-80s will be the first to get the jab. There will be nearly 40,000 doses of the vaccine available initially, enough to vaccinate nearly 20,000 people, the Welsh Government has said. Dr Matt Morgan, an intensive care consultant at University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, will be among the first to get the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. Vaccine rollout could be 'decisive turning point' First people to be vaccinated in Wales on Tuesday Q&A: How will the vaccine rollout work in Wales? He said the vaccinations had brought ""hope for the first time in a long time"". On Sunday, Health Minister Vaughan Gethingwarned it would take monthsbefore some people were able to receive the vaccine. Dr Matt Morgan will be among the first to receive the coronavirus vaccine on Tuesday Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Dr Morgan said: ""I'm feeling kind of proud, in a way, that science and medicine and humanity has made this vaccine in less than a duration of a pregnancy. ""From when the first patient was admitted to intensive care in Cardiff with Covid, it will be 38 weeks to the day, and it is pretty remarkable that in that time, the vaccine is here. ""Because of that, I am feeling hopeful, for the first time in a long time. ""But also, I am realistic - this isn't going to make things better overnight and all of the other things that society and the public have been doing, sadly, remain more important than ever."" How do I know the Covid vaccine is safe? Wedding cancelled for Covid vaccination centre The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was the first to be approved for use by UK regulators last week, and requires two separate injections, a few weeks apart. Ahead of the vaccination programme beginning on Tuesday, a Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""It is expected nearly 1,000 doses will be administered in the first phase by each of the seven health boards in Wales by the end of the weekend. ""This will take place at one vaccination centre in each of the seven health boards, mostly in hospitals."" The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine has been trialled on more than 40,000 people, with only mild side-effects reported. Dr Morgan said the biggest risk in getting the vaccine was driving to the test centre to have it done, while the benefits of the injections were ""huge"". ""This vaccine has risks which are tiny. Absolutely tiny. It has been tested on 40,000 people. ""The benefits, to me, are not getting sick, hopefully my patients not getting sick, my colleagues not getting sick, my family not getting sick and all those other downstream benefits."" People will be given these cards once vaccinated in England Once vaccinated, people will be issued with a card with details of the vaccine name, date of vaccination and the batch numbers of each of the dose. It will also act as a reminder for a second appointment, as the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine requires two doses, but the cards will not hold any personal information. The Welsh Government said: ""We have no plans to produce vaccine passports or ID cards but everyone who receives a Covid-19 vaccination will be given an NHS Wales immunisation card with the vaccine name, date of vaccination and the batch numbers of each of the dose. ""This is designed to be a reminder about when the second dose is due and will help people report any side effects.""

"This video can not be played NHS in Wales is under ""considerable and sustained pressure"", says health minister Wales' health minister has warned there could be further restrictions after Christmas as Covid cases continue to rise. Vaughan Gething said Wales was the only part of the UK where figures were not falling at the end of November. Mr Gething confirmed ministers were looking at whether further measures would be needed. At a press conference he said choices made by the public would determine how many die from the virus. It comes as officials in Swansea Bay warned case levels could soon reach""catastrophic levels""unless people follow social distancing rules. Meanwhile the Welsh Conservatives called for ""detailed plans"" for how the Welsh Government would deal with the rising cases. Plaid Cymru's Adam Price said the Welsh Government was struggling to communicate to the public. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Q&A: Can people from Wales go to England to drink? According to UK government statistics, Wales' coronavirus case rate overtook England's on 23 November,two weeks after the firebreak endedand while England was locked down, and on 1 December had a seven-day case rate of 267.8 per 100,000 people. That compared to 149.5 in England, 143.6 in Northern Ireland, and 100.3 in Scotland. The number of deaths per 100,000 people in the seven days to 1 December was 5.07, compared to 4.3 in England, 3.5 in Scotland and 3.3 in Northern Ireland. New measuresstopping the sale of alcohol in pubs, and closing them - along with cafes, bars and restaurants - at 18:00 GMT, came into force last Friday. But Mr Gething said it would ""take a couple of weeks"" for them to have any impact on the rate of confirmed cases. The health minister said the Covid situation is Wales was ""very serious"" with the NHS under ""considerable and sustained pressure"". ""We're actively considering each day whether the measures we have are the right ones in place or not. ""We're committed to review the regulations in the next week and a half or so and we will then have to consider what we doâ¦ we're actively considering what we are going to need to do, what we may need to do after the Christmas period."" Restrictionsare set to be relaxed at Christmas, so three households can form a bubble. The latest data showed the all-Wales case rate was almost 70 points higher than it was on Friday, he told journalists. There were eight local authorities with rates higher than 400 cases per 100,000 people - four times as many areas as on Friday. Mr Gething said choices made by the public would influence how many people died of Covid over the Christmas period. He decisions about social contact made by each individual would ""determine how many of us are here in the New Year and beyond"". At Monday's press briefing, Mr Gething cited the most recentinfection surveyfrom the ONS which said one in 170 people in Wales were likely to have the virus at the end of November. That compared to one in 190 in Northern Ireland, one in 130 in Scotland and one in 105 in England. But he said it showed Wales, with an estimated 18,100 people with Covid-19, ""was the only part of the UK where infection rates did not appear to be falling in the last week of November"". However he said that reflected ""tighter measures elsewhere"". Mr Gething said there were now more than 1,800 coronavirus-related patients in hospitals in Wales - ""the highest number ever recorded"". ""If we do not see a reduction in coronavirus admissions, we will need to consider what action we can take and may need to take to support the NHS as we move into the New Year,"" he said. The figures, from last Thursday, include more than 550 patients still recovering from the effects of the virus, although they have not shown symptoms for more than two weeks. Patients in the Aneurin Bevan and Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board areas count for more than half of those being treated for Covid-19 in hospital. Covid-19 patients make up around 23% of all patients in hospital, compared to about 18% at the end of May. The press conference followed last week's controversyover the alcohol ban in pubs. What is the evidence for new hospitality rules? Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government has struggled to communicate with the public. ""I'm not sure that they're taking the public with them, and there's no clear roadmap, if you like, which takes us from now to where we're going to be in the spring"". He said there should have been ""a compromise"" with less strict hospitality rules. Meanwhile Mr Gething confirmed that the first Covid vaccine will not be delivered to care homes when the rollout begins on Tuesday. Last week the Welsh Government wasunable to saywhen the vaccine roll out would start with care homes, because of difficulties with how it is stored. Mr Gething said conversations had taken place with Pfizer and the regulator ""to understand how we can safely and lawfully deliver this vaccine to care homes"". But he stressed ""that won't be tomorrow"". The Welsh Conservatives said the news was a ""bitter blow"" and the decision needed a ""fuller explanation"". Welsh Conservative Andrew RT Davies, health spokesman, added: ""We've seen that the figures outlined today suggest higher cases of Covid in Wales. ""We, not just Welsh Conservatives but I'm sure all people in Wales, want to see detailed plans of how the administration here will address this. ""However, we have been calling for the publication of a detailed Winter plan for how the virus will be managed for months, and we're still waiting."" Record numbers of Covid-related inpatients in Welsh hospitals inevitably pose questions about recent policy decisions by ministers. Was the firebreak lockdown too short? Was the regime that succeeded it too liberal? On Friday, new (and highly controversial) restrictions on hospitality were imposed. It will be a few weeks before we see any data on their effect. What's interesting is that those measures still allow the most generous household mixing in hospitality venues than any equivalent measures elsewhere in Britain. With the Christmas relaxation looming, it's hard to escape the feeling that stricter restrictions are just around the corner. Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us?

"The National Trust, which owns the beach, said it was investigating the shiny pillar A monolith has mysteriously appeared in Britain - just days after similar ones were spotted in the US and Romania. The unusual mirrored structure was discovered on the Isle of Wight, an island off the south coast of England. Resident Alexia Fishwick said she ""was dumbstruck"" when she came across it during a beach walk on Sunday and described it as ""really quite magical"". A monolith found in Utah last month created wild speculation on social media and apparent copycats. Many observers have presumed they were art installations left by sculptors. The metal edifice in Utah was found planted in the ground before it disappeared just days later. This video can not be played The unusual object in the desert in the US state of Utah was found by a helicopter crew while conducting a count of big horn sheep in the area Two other shining metal towers later appeared in Romania and southern California. Ms Fishwick said: ""I'd read about the one in Utah and then Romania, so I knew the significance. Many people took no notice of it."" She said people first thought she had photoshopped the images when she put them online. Lee Peckham, a lawyer living on the island, said: ""I saw it and wondered what it was and thought it a rather strange thing to see on the beach. I wondered who put it there and why."" DJ Rob da Bank, another island resident, was also among those who took a stroll to see the sight for themselves. He mused: ""I'm not sure if it's aliens, a Coldplay PR stunt or a local mirror dealer drumming up trade, but it got us all down the beach anyway."" The National Trust, which owns the site, said it had no immediate plans to remove the monolith, which it said was erected without permission. A spokesman said: ""We were unaware of the monolith's presence until this morning, but we've now visited Compton Beach and it seems secure on a wooden plinth and is made from mirrored sections of plastic or perspex material. ""We need to monitor over the next few days to ensure the beach remains safe and does not become overcrowded."" Alexia Fishwick described the monolith as ""incredibly graceful"" An anonymous collective called The Most Famous Artist has taken credit for the monoliths in Utah and California. It posted an image of the Utah monolith on Instagram, with a 45,000 US dollar (Â£34,000) price tag. However, when asked about the Isle of Wight structure, it said: ""The monolith is out of my control at this point. Godspeed to all the aliens working hard around the globe to propagate the myth."" People have tracked down the mystery Utah monolith Mysterious metal monolith found in Utah desert News of the monolith on the island has caused a stir on social media with some posting in jest - that the monolith - which already has its own Instagram page - could be a portal to another dimension. In 2001: A Space Odyssey - the 1968 film directed by Stanley Kubrick - imposing black monoliths created by an unseen alien species appear in the movie, based on the writings of novelist Arthur C Clarke. Most observers reflecting on their trip to the mysterious monolith suspected it was left by an artist rather than an alien species. Allow Twitter content?

"San Francisco's local lockdown began slightly earlier than in some other parts of the state Most parts of the US state of California are under a strict new lockdown, as Covid-19 continues to surge across the country. The stay-at-home order affects around 85% of the state's 40 million people. It will be in place for at least three weeks and cover the Christmas holiday. Many businesses will be closed, and people will be banned from meeting anyone outside their household. On Sunday, the US had a record number of people in hospital with Covid-19. The country has seen a sharp rise in cases and Covid-related deaths in recent weeks, a surge that could be partly down to last month's Thanksgiving holiday, when millions of Americans travelled around the US. A US city engulfed by Covid, but no lockdown Where has been hit hardest? US vaccine chief sees 'light at end of the tunnel' The new restrictions in California - the country's most populous state - were triggered by intensive care capacity in hospitals shrinking. The measures apply to the southern part of the state and its central valley, while other areas could follow within days. San Francisco has also gone into lockdown, with the mayor imposing a separate set of orders. California's lockdown in March, in which all non-essential businesses were closed, was seen as an early model for the US at the beginning of the pandemic. Governor Gavin Newsom has ordered that when capacity at intensive care units in any of five regions of the state goes below 15%, that region will go into lockdown within 24 hours. The stay-at-home orders triggered in this way will be similar to the far-reaching order issued for the state after the pandemic first hit in March, but with a few significant relaxations: All retail stores are able to stay open, although only at 20% capacity, along with outside spaces such as parks and beaches Gatherings are prohibited, and people are required to stay at home and minimise contact with other households Bars, hair salons and indoor restaurants are closed The lockdown will last for at least three weeks, and until ICU capacity goes above 15% again. Mr Newsom said the measures would help to ""flatten the curve"" and reduce the pressure on health services. ""We are at a tipping point in our fight against the virus and we need to take decisive action now to prevent California's hospital system from being overwhelmed in the coming weeks,"" he said last week. Reactions to the new lockdown measures have been mixed. Some small businesses owners and service-industry employees fear the economic burden will become overwhelming. Others see the governor's orders as a relief. Mimi Marylon Moore Routh, 78, from Lake Tahoe: ""I'm glad for the lockdown.  It is so important to have it, I want to live 10 or 20 more years. I will spend my Christmas with some good music, knitting and listening to audio books."" Joshua Roizman, 22, from Orange County:""It's necessary, but I think the way Gavin Newsom is handling this is not the best. Restaurants are hurting. I worked in the restaurant industry, so I sympathise with them. They're just trying to stay alive."" Heidi Whelchel, 43, from Rancho Cucamonga:""The lockdown is an annoyance because nobody is really observing it and nobody really cares.  It's not like you have the police outside watching that people comply."" The situation in California reflects a surge in infections nationwide. The state, which has the largest number of confirmed cases in the US, reported an additional 30,000 infections on Sunday, a new record. It has recorded more than 1.3 million cases and around 21,000 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Intensive care capacity in two of the five regions set up by state officials for the purposes of the stay-at-home order - Southern California and the central San Joaquin Valley - fell below 15% on Friday. Southern California, which includes Los Angeles and San Diego, the state's two largest cities, fell to 12.5% on Saturday, and San Joaquin to just 8.6%. This video can not be played ""I don't need your instruction"": Two US senators clash on wearing face masks in the chamber Republican opponents of the Democratic authorities in the state and many of its municipalities have questioned the efficacy of the new measures, and say they could harm the local economy. ""Every state is experiencing a surge, which begs the question, how do these shutdowns actually reduce cases?"" state legislator James Gallagher told Fox News. Research has found thatlockdown measures have been associated with reduced infection numbers,external, while the World Health Organization also urges people to ""avoid spaces that are closed,external, crowded or involve close contact"" during the pandemic. But some law enforcement officials said they did not plan to help enforce the new rules, with Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes saying: ""Compliance with health orders is a matter of personal responsibility and not a matter of law enforcement."" Meanwhile, Governor Newsom has been facing accusations of hypocrisy. In November he visited a high-class restaurant in the Napa Valley, contrary to his own guidance. San Francisco Mayor London Breed dined at the same restaurant on a different night. Both have apologised. But White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany seized on the errors: ""These images... make clear Democrats' mind-set: rules for thee but not for me."" According to the Covid Tracking Project,101,487 people were being treated in hospital,externalwith the disease on Sunday, while an additional 1,138 deaths were recorded. Nearly 14.6 million people have been infected with Covid-19 in the US, and 273,374 people have died - the highest figures of any country in the world. On Sunday, Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator, criticised the Trump administration for flouting guidelines and peddling ""myths"" about the pandemic. ""I hear community members parroting back those situations, parroting back that masks don't work, parroting back that we should work towards herd immunity,"" Dr Birx told NBC. ""This is the worst event that this country will face."" This video can not be played Moncef Slaoui told CBS News that Americans could take comfort in vaccine news but still needed to follow Covid-19 guidance The scientist in charge of the US push for a vaccine,Moncef Slaoui, said there was ""light at the end of the tunnel""and that he hoped the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could give the go-ahead for a vaccine when it meets on Thursday. But for life to get back to normal by the spring, Americans still needed to follow safety measures, he said in an interview with CBS News. States are preparing to distribute a vaccine, with possible approval approaching. Doses are expected to be made available first to the country's million healthcare workers and three million elderly people living in long-term care homes. In other developments: President Donald Trump announced that his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani had tested positivefor the virus. He is the latest person close to the president, who was ill in October, to be infected US President-elect Joe Biden - who takes office on 20 January - has picked California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to be his health secretary.

So what have we learned?  Until our next live blog, you can keep up to date via the BBC News website and social media channels. Have a good day, and stay safe. A further two people have died with coronavirus in Wales, with another 2,021 people testing positive.

The test centres are operating in the Lower Cynon Valley until 20 December More than1,500 people attended mass-testing centresin the first two days they opened in Rhondda
Cynon Taf. Dr Kelechi Nnoaham, director of public health
for Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, said testing on Saturday and
Sunday resulted in 17 positive results. The centres were set up in the Lower Cynon Valley to help curb the number of Covid-19 cases. Thefirst mass-testing
programmewas opened in Merthyr Tydfil following a spike in coronavirus cases last month. Latest figures published on Sunday showed Rhondda
Cynon Taf had 377.2 cases per 100,000 people in the past seven days,
compared with an all-Wales average of 279.5.

Any disruption caused by Brexit could affect supplies of the coronavirus vaccine, according to Wales' health minister. Vaughan Gething said work had been done to make ""alternative arrangements"" but that any disruption was an ""unwelcome distraction"". ""There is no getting away from the fact that disrupting our ports could disrupt supplies,"" he said. Mr Gething said pharmaceutical companies had taken matters ""into their own hands"", and have planned to use different ports of entry. He said disruption ""may not happen on day one"" of Brexit but ""there's a challenge about longer term arrangements"". The UK left the EU in January but entered a transition
period until the end of 2020 in which the trading rules remained broadly the
same. If a deal is not reached, from 1 January border checks
and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. Students will be invited to return to university campuses in Wales over a four-week period, starting from 11 January, with a phased return to in-person teaching. Priority will be given students in healthcare professions, on placements, or who need access to campus facilities. Lateral-flow testing pilots, for students showing now students, will continue. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: âI know students will be eager to return to their university campus after the Christmas break, but will want to do that in a safe way. âStudents will also want to return to learning in person, where itâs safe to do so. ""Weâre putting these measures in place to ensure confidence in a return to learning in-person and minimise the risk of large numbers of students needing to self-isolate during the term."" Testing of students for Covid will continue in the new year Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online UK hospitals are getting ready to start giving the first doses of a coronavirus vaccine now that regulators have approved the Pfizer/BioNTech jab for widespread use. But while many people want an injection as soon as possible, others are worried about putting something unknown into their bodies. So, how do we know a vaccine is safe? Local Democracy Reporting Service Schools in Caerphilly county borough will move to online learning from Thursday, 17 December for the final two days of the school term. Chief education officer Keri Cole has written to parents and carers saying the council recognises the rise of cases in the county borough and the disruption children and young people have experienced to their education. But she added that some schools may take the decision to close earlier than that, for example by rescheduling inset days. âThe local authority and school communities are absolutely committed to offering the best provision under increasingly difficult circumstances and we recognise how worrying this situation must be for you,"" Ms Cole wrote. âI sincerely hope that you will enjoy a safe, family Christmas and that we will all look forward together to a new year.â Neighbouring Blaenau Gwent council, serving an area with one of the highest Covid infection rates in Wales, has already decided toclose schools after lessons on Wednesday, more than a week early. The Welsh Government and council leaders across Wales have agreed a joint pledge to keep schools open until term ends on 18 December, only moving to remote learning ""where it is proportionate to the prevalence and impact of the virus within the locality"". Here's a chart showing why Covid-19 cases are causing concern for health bosses inSwansea and Neath Port Talbot. Swansea Bay health board director Dr Keith Reid said the local health system will be ""overwhelmed"" if cases continue to rise at the current rate. There have been 800 new cases reported in the last two days in the region, he said. Beer was poured away prior to new rules being adopted on Friday evening Paul Davies, the Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd, said the hospitality sector needed help sooner rather than later to protect businesses and jobs over Christmas. Pubs in Wales have been banned from serving alcohol and ordered to close at 18:00 GMT, other than for takeaways. Barrels of beer were poured down drainson Friday as the hospitality industry prepared for the alcohol ban to come into force. First Minister Mark Drakeford has previously said firms hit by the restrictions would be offeredÂ£340m in supportwhich he claimed was ""the most generous package of financial assistance anywhere in the UK"".

Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price has said the Welsh Government has struggled to communicate with the public over the actions taken to tackle coronavirus. âIâm not sure that they're taking the public with them, and there's no clear road map, if you like, which takes us from now to where we're going to be in the spring,"" he said. Mr Price said there should have been âa compromiseâ with less strict hospitality rules which has seen pubsbanned from serving alcoholand ordered to close at 18:00 GMT, other than for takeaway service.. âIt's absolutely essential you take the public with you, step by step, and also give them a sense that you know the way forward over the next three to four months, and that's what's lacking, I think, at the moment,"" he said. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has confirmed ministers were considering whether any new restrictions would be needed after relaxation for a five-day window allowing family get-togethers over the holidays. Adam Price: ""It's absolutely essential you take the public with you, step by step"" Schools in Wales should remain open as planned up to the Christmas holiday, said Health Minister Vaughan Gething. He said there was no current Covid evidence to show that there was âsignificant harmâ in keeping schools open. Mr Gething said school was a âsafe placeâ for vulnerable children and a shut-down would disproportionately affect the least well-off. Blaenau Gwent council, serving an area with one of the highest Covid infection rates in Wales, has decided toclose schools after lessons on Wednesday, more than a week early. The decision comes despite a pledge from the Welsh Government and council leaders across Wales to keep schools open until term ends on 18 December. Vaccines will not be delivered to care homes in Wales onTuesday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has confirmed. There had been concerns surrounding the transporting of the vaccines to care homes due to the very low temperatures needed to store the vials. Mr Gething said conversations had taken place with manufacturer Pfizer and the regulator ""to understand how we can safely and lawfully deliver this vaccine to care homes"" but he stressed: ""That won't be tomorrow."" Whilst other parts of the UK have said they hope to deliver the vaccine to care homes before Christmas, Mr Gething said he wanted to give ""a rather more definitive date than that"". ""At present those conversations with the regulator are not complete,"" he said. ""So I'll follow thepriority list given by the JCVI(Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) with that important caveat that, at this point, and certainly tomorrow, we won't be able to deliver the vaccine to care homes. ""But we will vaccinate in accordance with those priorities, not in the first batch but, of course, the subsequent batches we expect to get through the month of December."" Choices made by the public will influence how many people
die of Covid over the Christmas period, according to Health Minister Vaughan
Gething. He confirmed ministers were considering whether any new
restrictions would be needed after relaxation for a five-day window allowing family get-togethers over the holidays. âWeâre in very odd position of a much more contested
environment, and rising harm being seen,â said Mr Gething, referring to new Covid infections. âWe know that this is much more about the choices weâre
making about who we see, how long we see them for. âWeâre actively considering each day whether the measures
we have are the right ones in place or not. ""Weâre committed to review the regulations in the
next week and a half or so and we will then have to consider what we do... weâre
actively considering what we are going to need to do, what we may need to do
after the Christmas period. âSo, if weâre going to be able to get through not just to
the end of the year but into the next year with the minimum amount of harm,
itâs not just the choices we make in government, itâs the choices each of us
make about how weâre living our lives that will determine how many of us are
here in the New Year and beyond.â Self-isolation paymentsin Wales are to be extended to include some parents and carers on low incomes of children who have to self-isolate. The Â£500 payment has been available to help people on low
incomes and as a statutory sick pay top-up to social care workers who have to
self-isolate. Health Minister Vaughan Gething told a Welsh Government
briefing it will be extended from next Monday to include parents and
carers on low incomes of children who have to self-isolate because of an
outbreak of coronavirus at their school or childcare setting. ""This will provide parents and carers on low incomes
with the financial support they need while they look after their children,""
he said. These children in Gwynedd had to self-isolate because of positive Covid tests at their school Having a vaccination against coronavirus will not be mandatory, according to Public Health Wales. It says people will be able to choose whether they take it or not, but it warns""it will be offered to those who are most at risk first"",external. Front-line NHS staff will be the first to get the Pfizer/BioNTech jab when it is rolled out from tomorrow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There are now more than 1,800 coronavirus-related patients in hospitals around Wales, the highest number since the pandemic began, according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said Wales was the only part of the UK where infection rates did not appear to be falling in the last week of November, according to an ONS infection survey. He said it reflected the tighter measures elsewhere in the UK at the time. Mr Gething said the government strengthenedcoronavirus restrictionsin response to this âvery serious situationâ on Friday in a bid to slow the spread of the virus and to protect peopleâs health. âBut, just like the firebreak period, we will not see the impact immediately â it will take a couple of weeksâ, he added. Wales was the only part of the UK whereCovid infection rates were not fallingat the end of November, the health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said it reflected tighter UK restrictions elsewhere. But he said if there is not a reduction in NHS Covid admissions ""we will need to consider what action we can take"". The coronavirus case rate overtook England's on 23 November - and Wales had a higher death rate in the week to 1 December. Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the situation with Covid in Wales remains âvery seriousâ, with cases rising in 19 of the 22 local authority areas. He told the Welsh Governmentâs coronavirus briefing: 
âOur health service is under considerable and sustained pressure because of the number of people who need to be admitted to hospital for treatment for coronavirus."" Mr Gething said the latest data shows that the all-Wales case rate is almost 70 points higher than it was on Friday. âThis shows you how just fast coronavirus is spreading,"" he said. Mr Gething said there were eight local authorities with rates higher than 400 cases per 100,000 people â four times as many areas as on Friday. âSadly, we are seeing a return to the very high rates of more than 500 in Blaenau Gwent and 600 in Neath Port Talbot,"" he added Dr Keith Reid: ""We have a chance to stave off a potential catastrophe"" Local health and social care services could be ""overwhelmed"" byan increase in coronavirus cases in Swansea and Neath Port Talbot, according to
the director of public health for Swansea Bay University Health Board. Dr Keith Reid said Neath
Port Talbot hit ""record"" levels of Covid-19 infection rates with 622
cases per 100,000 population in the past week, with 446 cases per 100,000
population in Swansea. There were 800 new
cases reported in the last two days alone in the Swansea Bay region, he said. 'We have a chance to stave off a potential catastrophe but we all have a role to play,"" he said, in astatement,externalpublished by the health board. âIf infections
continue to rise at the current rate then, without another lockdown before
Christmas, the local system will be overwhelmed.â Public Health Wales is due to publish the latest overall figures for coronavirus cases in Wales later on Monday. Allow Twitter content?

"One Newport school said under a Welsh Government scheme it received six laptops to share between 160 pupils School children are home-learning on games consoles and mobile phones, teachers have said, despite a Welsh Government pledge none would be ""left behind"" during the pandemic. It provided Â£3m for laptops and wifi devices in April, but some pupils still do not have equipment. Plaid Cymru questioned why there was no nationwide register of digitally-excluded learners. The Welsh Government said it had supplied thousands of devices. Covid and home schooling: Children 'flourishing' as numbers rise Covid: Wales' lockdown IT praised but learning hours low Covid: Mass testing in Wales schools and colleges considered Some schools in Newport are relying on a ""Donate IT"" appeal to provide hundreds of required laptops and kit. In April, Education Minister Kirsty Williams pledged an extra Â£3m for computers so pupils could work from home. She said it was her priority that ""no child or family is left behind during this crisis and all children have the opportunity to continue learning"". And in June, the Welsh Government said pupils ""should now be in receipt of the required device and connectivity"". But not everyone is. Maggie Bain, a governor at Newport's Lliswerry Primary School, said some devices had been provided, but added: ""I don't think it's met the level of need that's out there."" School governor Maggie Bain said the Welsh Government needed to take the matter ""more seriously"" Lliswerry Primary School deputy head, Lisa Peterson, said: ""A lot of children have Xboxes or PlayStations but they weren't suitable for home learning. ""A significant number have phones, but again that's not an appropriate device,"" she added. Ms Peterson said the school received six laptops to share between 160 pupils as part of the Welsh Government scheme. She said: ""The project identified far more children that needed devices than were available."" Computers were now as crucial as a ""pen, a pencil and a piece of paper,"" she said. ""Far more children needed devices than were available,"" says Lliswerry Primary's deputy head Lisa Peterson Senior staff at Maindee Primary School in Newport said a ""very small minority"" of children - ""less than a handful in each class"" - had been able to access ""good home-learning opportunities throughout the whole of lockdown"". Maindee Primary School headteacher, Jo Cueto, said: ""We estimated around 160 devices were needed to be able to ensure that all children, all families, were able to access home-learning. ""That would not be a device per child, [but] a device per family, so sometimes there may be three or four children using that device."" The school had invested in some equipment, but was ""still probably in need of around 120 devices"". ""Unfortunately, I don't think there's enough money to plug the gaps,"" Mrs Cueto said. Both Maindee and Lliswerry are relying on local charities to provide the hundreds of laptops they need. More than 2,500 digitally-excluded pupils were identified across Newport, with the council loaning 1,300 wifi devices and 800 other devices, including laptops. Llamau, a charity that supports homeless young people, women and children across Wales, said it has been helping families struggling to access online learning throughout the pandemic. A young mum of two, who lost her job because of the pandemic, was forced to sell her mobile phone and her children's tablets to help make ends meet. Sharon - not her real name - had to call the children's school and arrange for their work to be sent in the post, which she found very upsetting. The charity has since secured funding that allows the family to have six months of free broadband and another that secured tablets for the children. The Welsh Government said it had funded 10,848 wifi devices and 9,717 software licences across Wales. And in April, it said replacement kit would be funded by its digital education programme, Hwb. An Education Policy Institute report found Wales' attempt to address the lack of access to online learning was ""commendable"". It said: ""The Welsh Government was able to draw on well-established infrastructure, allowing them to act quickly."" But opposition politicians questioned whether ministers had a ""clear picture"" of the scale of digital poverty in Wales. The Welsh Government said there was no single, nationwide register of digitally-excluded learners and that ""schools and local authorities are best placed to support their learners"". It is the responsibility of councils to issue devices and manage internet connections. However, Plaid Cymru is calling for a centralised ""audit"" by the Welsh Government to improve ""monitoring and measurement of digital poverty"". Its education spokeswoman, SiÃ¢n Gwenllian, said: ""Having this audit is just the first step, but it's essential, because then you can actually see the extent of the problem and know where to target support"". Close schools early for Christmas, says union Almost half of Welsh schools report Covid cases Laptops offered to school pupils during lockdown She said there was no ""clear picture of the extent of the digital divide and digital poverty in Wales"". ""The picture painted by government isn't really consistent with what we are hearing on the ground,"" she said. The Welsh Government said it had provided guidance to help councils and schools ensure children who cannot attend school because of Covid-19 can continue learning. A spokesman said: ""Since September, teachers across Wales have created over 30,000 digital classrooms through Hwb, which exceeds the total amount created for the whole of the previous academic year. ""Through these digital classrooms, teachers are delivering a range of blended learning activities, which also support learners who are isolating at home.""

"This video can not be played The witness chose to keep her face mask on after Mr Giuliani made the request President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has tested positive for Covid-19 and is being treated in hospital. Mr Giuliani, who has led the Trump campaign's legal challenges to the election results, is the latest person close to the president to be infected. Since November, he has been on a cross-country tour in an effort to convince state governments to overturn the vote. Like other Trump officials, he has been criticised for shunning face masks. Mr Trump, who was ill with the virus in October, announced the diagnosis in a tweet, writing: ""Get better soon Rudy, we will carry on!"" Mr Giuliani, 76, was admitted to the Medstar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington DC on Sunday. The news came after Mr Giuliani had visited Arizona, Georgia and Michigan all in the past week - where he spoke to government officials while not wearing masks. Following news of Mr Giuliani's diagnosis, the Arizona legislature announced sudden plans to shut down for one week. Several Republican lawmakers there had spent over 10 hours with the former New York mayor last week discussing election results. Following Mr Giuliani's visit to Phoenix, Arizona, the state's Republican partytweeted a photo,externalof him with other mask-less state lawmakers. In a tweet, Mr Giuliani thanked well-wishers for their messages, and said he was ""recovering quickly"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nearly 14.6 million people have been infected with Covid-19 in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University, and 281,234 people have died - the highest figures of any country in the world. US vaccine chief sees 'light at end of the tunnel' No, it won't alter your DNA - vaccine rumours debunked On Sunday, Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator, criticised the Trump administration for flouting guidelines and peddling ""myths"" about the pandemic. ""I hear community members parroting back those situations, parroting back that masks don't work, parroting back that we should work towards herd immunity,"" Dr Birx told NBC. ""This is the worst event that this country will face,"" she said.

During many of his events, he was seen without a face mask and ignoring social distancing. Last Wednesday, he appeared at a hearing on alleged election fraud in Michigan where he asked a witness beside him if she would be comfortable removing her face mask. ""I don't want you to do this if you feel uncomfortable, but would you be comfortable taking your mask off, so we can hear you more clearly?"" said Mr Giuliani, who was not wearing a face mask. The witness chose to keep her mask on after asking the panel if she could be heard. On Thursday Mr Giuliani travelled to Georgia where he repeated unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud at a Senate committee hearing about election security. Trump campaigns in crucial Senate battleground Top US lawyer refutes Trump election fraud claims What legal challenges remain for Trump? Dozens of people in Mr Trump's orbit are said to have tested positive for Covid-19 since October. Boris Epshteyn, another Trump adviser, tested positive shortly after appearing alongside Rudy Giuliani at a news conference on 25 November. Others include the president's chief of staff Mark Meadows and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, along with his wife Melania and sons Donald Jnr and Baron. Mr Trump's own diagnosis and hospital stay upended his campaign for a second term in office, less than a month before he faced Joe Biden in the presidential election. Mr Trump has refused to concede, insisting without evidence that the election was stolen or rigged. Attorney General William Barr said last week that his department had not seen any evidence of widespread voter fraud that would change the result.

"For months, the government has been urging businesses to get ready for a new era in trading with the EU. But it was only on Boxing Day that details of all the new rules were actually published. Business groups are relieved that the threat of a no-deal Brexit, which would have meant tariffs (or taxes) on goods crossing the border with the EU, has been removed. But companies that trade with the EU are still facing a lot of new bureaucracy. And the disruption in mid-December, caused by border closures related to the new variant of Covid-19, was a reminder of how dependent the UK economy is on trade across the English Channel. From 1 January 2021, goods entering the EU from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) face large amounts of new paperwork and checks, including: customs declarations rules of origin checks product safety certificates food inspections This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Hauliers will also need to make sure they have the right transportation paperwork before they drive to the border. There is particular focus on the ""short straits"" route between Dover and Calais, and the nearby Channel Tunnel, which taken together handle about four million lorries a year. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" says William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. Full controls on British exports to the EU began on 1 January. Thefirst day of the new regimeappears to have gone relatively smoothly. But it's feared that later in the year, the new controls could cause disruption, even though new border infrastructure has been built at ports such as Calais, to help process vehicles more efficiently. There are some mitigating measures though. In response to the Covid crisis, the government is delaying full controls on goods entering Great Britain from the EU for a further six months. There will be checks from 1 January on controlled substances such as alcohol and tobacco, and traders deemed to be a risk will also be asked to fill in customs declarations. But most checks on goods coming in from the EU will be delayed until 1 July, a deadline that could in theory be extended. ""I think we will want to monitor it,"" the chief executive of HM Revenue and Customs, Jim Harra, told MPs in November. ""Hopefully we will not still be in a situation where Covid-19 is consuming as much of people's attention."" Other measures to tackle potential disruption include diverting trade to other ports around the country and opening lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. Some of these contingencies were put into action early, to deal with the Covid border closures in December. Operation Brock, for example, involved changing the layout of a section of the M20, using a concrete barrier to allow lorries heading for mainland Europe to queue safely on the motorway. Thousands of lorries were also diverted to temporary parking at a disused airport at Manston. From 1 January drivers of lorries weighing more than 7.5 tonnes will need to acquire a Kent Access Permit before they enter the county. They will have to show that they have all the paperwork they need to ferry goods to Europe. But that doesn't deal with the challenge of the thousands of vans that cross the Channel every week. ""What has been serially misunderstood by various parts of government is the scale of the complexity for people on the ground dealing with the paperwork,"" says Duncan Buchanan, the Policy Director of the Road Haulage Association. That could mean that instead of queues on motorways, many traders won't be able to leave their depots. ""Either they won't be able to get vets to sign off on their meat exports, or they won't be able to get their permit because they don't have the right bits of paper,"" says Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Storage Federation. ""We might see a quite significant holding off of trading - people just not moving stuff in the first few weeks."" Eighty-five per cent of the volume of trade between the EU and Great Britain is carried by EU hauliers, who are often paid not by the hour, but by the kilometre. If they think there will be too many delays, many may simply not come. The government says the readiness of traders to deal with the new system remains its biggest concern. Lorries parked on the M20 in Kent ""The sheer scale of the overall operation means there are literally many millions of moving parts,"" permanent secretary of the cabinet office Alex Chisholm told MPs. ""Inevitably there are going to be some difficulties for some individual people as they adjust to the new regime."" The government has also announced a new Border Operations Centre as part of plans ""for the UK to have the world's most effective border by 2025"". Questions have been asked about how changes at the border might affect food supply. The short answer is no-one can say for sure, but nearly 30% of all the food consumed in the UK is imported from the EU. The good news is that there is a deal, which makes a big difference. But the challenge is particularly acute because the UK grows relatively small amounts of fruit and vegetables in January and February and is most dependent on supplies from southern Europe at this time of year. So, if there are delays, they could cause some shortages on the shelves. ""Some gaps are possible but we're not going to run out of food - that's not going to happen"" says Ian Wright. When it comes to non-perishable items, there had been some stockpiling in preparation for either outcome, but extra supplies won't last forever. ""The crunch point is probably not going to be in the first few days or weeks of January,"" William Bain argues. ""Towards the end of the month, when new orders start being placed and delivered, we will start to see the processes in Kent and the other ports really tested."" And it's not only about food. Other retailers, which are used to moving their stock freely around the EU customs union, have had to create separate supply chains for the UK. That is costing them more money, and their new systems have yet to be tested properly. It's not just about trade across the English Channel. Trade across the Irish Sea between Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland will be subject to the same pressures, while Northern Ireland will be a special case under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. Northern Ireland will remain in the EU single market for goods, and unlike the rest of the UK it will continue to enjoy frictionless trade with the EU with no checks of any kind at the land border with the Republic. But there is a price to pay for that - new bureaucracy within the UK between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EU, for example, has strict rules on products of animal origin: meat, milk, fish and eggs. These products must enter the single market (and, from 1 January, Northern Ireland) through a border control post where paperwork is checked, and a proportion of goods physically inspected. There will be a grace period of three months for supermarkets and their suppliers, but some smaller traders may have to get used to thenew rules,externalstraight away. All shipments from Great Britain to Northern Ireland will also need a safety and security declaration, and a customs declaration from a new IT system which none of the traders have used before. The government has set up a Trader Support Service to help. The details of the new trading arrangements for Northern Ireland were announced separately in early December, and provided some clarity. They include an agreement which means the vast majority of goods being shipped from GB to NI will not be at risk of having tariffs imposed. But there are plenty of unresolved issues. Traders are seeking answers about how to send parcels from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, and someonline retailers have already suspended deliveries. The trade from British to Northern Irish ports often involves multiple small shipments on a single lorry - all of which will need the right paperwork. ""We need clear rules for everyone in the supply chain,"" says Duncan Buchanan, ""and when you scratch the surface it is just not ready."" It is expected that many checks will be carried out on a 'light touch' basis to begin with. But anyone trading between Great Britain and Northern Ireland is going to have to get used to a new way of working very quickly. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"The much-loved combination of beer and crisps is being harnessed for the first time to tackle climate change. Crisps firm Walkers has adopted a technique it says will slash CO2 emissions from its manufacturing process by 70%. The technology will use CO2 captured from beer fermentation in a brewery, which is then mixed with potato waste and turned into fertiliser. It will then be spread on UK fields to feed the following year's potato crop. Creating fertiliser normally produces high CO2 emissions, but the technology adopted by Walkers makes fertiliser without generating CO2. So, the beer-and-crisps combo performs a dual function. It stops the emission of brewery CO2 into the atmosphere â and it saves on the CO2 normally generated by fertiliser manufacture. This ingenious double whammy was developed with a grant from the UK government by a 14-employee start-up called CCm. Turning carbon dioxide into cash The year 2020 set to be in top three warmest A really simple guide to climate change CO2 plant 'worth 22,000 cars off the road' The fertiliser was trialled on potato seed beds this year, and next year Walkers will install CCm equipment at its Leicester factory to prepare for its 2022 crop. A decision has not yet been made on which brewery Walkers will work with on this. The new technology adds to carbon-saving techniques already under way. This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough has been a staunch defender of the planet and its biodiversity The firm has installed an anaerobic digester, which feeds potato waste to bacteria to produce useful methane. The methane is burned to make electricity for the crisp-frying process â so this saves on burning fossil fuel gas. The new system will go a step further by taking away potato âcakeâ left after digestion - and stirring the brewery CO2 into it to make an enriched fertiliser which will help put carbon back into the soil as well as encouraging plant growth. Itâs an example of scientists finding ways to use CO2 emissions which otherwise would increase the over-heating of the planet. The CCm Technologies falls into the industrial category of Carbon Capture and Usage (CCU). Related inventions are already being harnessed in novel ways to create fuels, polymers, fertilisers, proteins, foams and building blocks. CCU is currently at a tiny scale, though - partly because the technologies are new, and partly because production of waste CO2 from society vastly outweighs demand for it. CCU is a sister technology to the better-established Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) which catches emissions from chimneys, compresses them and pumps them into underground rocks where they canât heat the climate. The prime minister is keen on CCS, which can be used on a large scale. Fertiliser plants like this one using CO2 in Swindon can help solve the problem of climate change Katy Armstrong, manager of the Carbon Utilisation Centre at Sheffield University, previously told BBC News: âWe need products for the way we live - and everything we do has an impact. ""We need to manufacture our products without increasing CO2 emissions, and if we can use waste CO2 to help make them, so much the better.â Many of the young carbon usage firms are actually carbon-negative: that means they take in more CO2 than they put out. These firms are pioneers in whatâs known as the circular economy, in which wastes are turned into raw materials. The EU is trying to prompt all industries to adopt this principle, because firms will need to emit zero emissions by 2050. Walkers brand owner, PepsiCo, is looking to extend the CCm project by feeding oats and corn with the âcircularâ fertiliser. David Wilkinson from PepsiCoâs said: âThis innovation could provide learnings for the whole of the food system, enabling the agriculture sector to play its part in combating climate change. âThis is just the beginning of an ambitious journey, weâre incredibly excited to trial the fertiliser on a bigger scale and discover its full potential.â CCm says it produces CO2-based fertiliser at roughly the same price as the conventional product. CO2 from the production of conventional fertilisers has been a large factor in keeping emissions from agriculture static as most other emissions across society have been falling. Peter Hammond from CCm told BBC News: âThere has been an increase in public awareness that we should get something done about the climate â and lot of baby steps have come together to make something significant. âThe key challenge for us as a business wasnât getting down the cost â it was marketing the fertiliser. This link with PepsiCo takes care of that for us.â PepsiCo has a mixed record on the environment. It has long been among the leaders in tackling carbon emissions, and it recently committed to eliminating all virgin plastic from its bottles sold in nine European states by 2022. Buta recent survey from by the Break Free From Plastic Campaign,externalranked it second highest (after Coke) in the amount of plastic pollution it creates. Some environmentalists consider Pepsi to be among the symbols of the throwaway culture, with its plastic waste found in 43 countries.

"Hundreds have been admitted to hospital. At least one person has died and 227 have been hospitalised by an unidentified illness in India's southern state of Andhra Pradesh. The patients had a wide range of symptoms from nausea to fits and falling unconscious, doctors said. Officials are investigating the cause of the illness, which swept through the town of Eluru over the weekend. It comes as India continues to battle a pandemic, with the world's second-highest coronavirus caseload. Andhra Pradesh has been one of the worst-affected states - at more than 800,000, it has the country's third-highest case count. But Covid-19 doesn't appear to be the cause of the hospitalisations over the weekend. The state's health minister, Alla Kali Krishna Srinivas, said that all the patients had tested negative for coronavirus. ""The people who fell sick, especially the children, suddenly started vomiting after complaining of burning eyes.Some of them fainted or suffered bouts of seizures,external,"" a medical officer at Eluru Government Hospital told The Indian Express newspaper. Seventy people have been discharged, while another 157 are still being treated, officials said.

Mr Reddy is also expected to visit the town to meet the patients and their families. Patients' symptoms include nausea and fainting Mr Srinivas said that the patients' blood samples did not reveal any evidence of a viral infection. ""We ruled out water contamination or air pollution as the cause after officials visited the areas where people fell sick,"" he said. ""It is some mystery illness and only lab analysis will reveal what it is.""

"A chief executive of Europe's largest online fashion site has announced plans to step down from his role, saying his wife's ""professional ambitions should take priority"". Rubin Ritter has been co-chief executive of Zalando since 2010. The company, which began as a Berlin-based start-up 12 years ago, now has 36 million customers and recorded revenue of â¬6.5bn (Â£5.8bn) last year. He will step down in May, cutting short a contract that runs to late-2023. ""My wife and I have agreed that for the coming years, her professional ambitions should take priority,""Mr Ritter said in a statement.,external ""I want to devote more time to my growing family. After more than 11 amazing years where Zalando has been my priority, I feel that it is time to give my life a new direction."" The company declined to name Mr Ritter's wife or her occupation. But it said the couple had one child and were expecting another in early 2021. Mr Ritter, 38, earned â¬6.8m in 2019 and â¬20.2m in 2018, making him one of Germany's highest paid executives. Zalando's other two bosses, Robert Gentz and David Schneider, will continue to lead the company, the firm said. Zalando is Europe's biggest online fashion retailer, with 36 million customers Mr Ritter has been spearheading efforts to improve equality at Zalando, which sells fashion and beauty products in 17 countries. Currently no women sit on its management board and its gender pay gap is 22% in favour of men, slightly wider than the national average in Germany. However, in NovemberMr Ritter said the retailer was progressing towards its goal,externalof achieving balanced representation in its top tiers of management by 2023. ""While transformation takes time, and we are still at the beginning of our journey, our progress indicates that we are moving in the right direction,"" Mr Ritter said. The executive has been in charge of strategy and communications on the three-way management team, but he was also finance chief until last year. Commenting on Mr Ritter's decision, Mr Gentz said: ""When we started to ship the first shoes to our customers from the basement of our office, we did not know where the journey would lead us. ""It is impossible to overstate Rubin's impact on Zalando's success."" Zalando's customers are spread across 17 countries. The online platform sells accessories and beauty products alongside fashion.

"This video can not be played Fifty hospitals in England have been chosen as hubs for administering the vaccine The armed forces could help transport further stocks of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from Belgium to the UK, with vaccinations due to begin on Tuesday. Asked if a no-deal Brexit could delay supplies, James Cleverly said it was a ""top priority"" and the government would look to ensure supplies were available ""in whatever circumstance"". Military personnel are already helping to construct vaccination centres. Health Secretary Matt Hancocktweeted,externalall parts of the UK had vaccine doses. Front-line health staff, those over 80, and care home workers will be first in line for the vaccine. In England, 50 hospitals have been initially chosen to serve as hubs for administering it. Scotland,Wales, andNorthern Irelandwill also begin their vaccination programmes from hospitals on Tuesday. On Monday, the government announced a further 14,718 people had tested positive for the virus, while a further 189 people had died within 28 days of a positive test - taking the total by that measure to 61,434. The Ministry of Defence said 60 military planners are working with the government's vaccine task force, with a further 56 personnel helping to construct vaccination centres. Armed Forces minister James Heappey said around 13,500 military personnel were on ""high readiness"" - with more than 2,000 deployed so far to help with testing and the government's Covid response. What are the safety checks for vaccines? Who will get the Covid vaccine first? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' Refrigerated containers holding the vaccine doses, which need to be kept at -70C,have been arriving in the UK from Belgium, where it is made, and are being prepared to be moved from secure locations to the hospitals. Asked whether the armed forces would be used to help transport the vaccine to the UK, Mr Cleverly told BBC Breakfast: ""Potentially - we are looking at non-commercial flight options."" In response to concerns a no-deal Brexit could cause delays in getting the vaccine into the UK, he said: ""This is such an important product, it's probably perhaps the most important product, so we will look to ensure that those supplies are available in the UK in whatever circumstance."" Asked to confirm if this meant the armed forces would be used if needed, he said: ""If we need to."" It comes as talks between the UK and the EU continuein a bid to reach a post-Brexit trade deal. Downing Street did not deny that RAF flights could be used to bring supplies of the vaccine over from other European countries if there were problems at ports caused by a no-deal Brexit. The prime minister's official spokesman would not comment on specific plans for ""security reasons"". But he said ""the military will have a role to play in what's been an enormous logistical challenge and I'm sure they will continue to do so as we move forward"". Vaccines were delivered to Croydon University Hospital on Sunday About 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be available in the UK from next week. So far the government has ordered a total of 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, with two shots each, 21 days apart. With limited quantities initially available, elderly people who are already attending hospital as an outpatient, as well as those who are being discharged after a hospital stay, will be among the first to receive the jab. Others over the age of 80 will be invited to attend the hospital to receive a jab, and care home providers will be able to book their staff into vaccination clinics. Any appointments not used for these groups will be used for healthcare workers who are at highest risk of serious illness from the virus. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - which represents hospitals and other NHS trusts in England - said people over 80 should not be concerned if they did not receive a letter calling them to be vaccinated this month, as the ""vast majority"" of people would have to wait until next year. The Mail on Sunday,externalreported that the Queen, who is 94, is expected to receive the vaccine ""within weeks"" - and then reveal she has had it to boost public take-up of the jab. The paper quoted senior sources who said the monarch and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, 99, will not get ""preferential treatment"" but will wait their turn in the priorities list. Asked whether the Queen would receive the vaccination this week, the prime minister's official spokesman said it was a matter for Buckingham Palace. However, he added: ""It is obviously a statement of fact that the Queen and Prince Philip are over 80 and are in a priority group."" This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? Although care home residents and staff were placed at the top of the priority list agreed by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), they are not getting the very first vaccinations. The government has explained this is because the chosen hospital hubs already have the facilities to store the vaccine at the required temperature of -70C. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government was doing everything it could to overcome ""significant challenges"" to ensure care home residents were vaccinated as soon as possible.

"Former Court of Appeal judge Sir Peter Gross has been appointed to lead an independent review of the Human Rights Act. The government wants to examine whether the 1998 act - which allows UK nationals to rely on theEuropean Convention of Human Rights,externalin domestic courts - is working effectively. A panel of eight is expected to report its findings by next summer. Labour called the review of human rights law ""bonkers"". Justice Secretary Robert Buckland insisted that ""human rights are deeply rooted in our constitution and the UK has a proud tradition of upholding and promoting them at home and abroad."" While previous Conservative governments had promised to replace the existing act entirely with a new Bill of Rights, the 2019 Conservative Party manifesto said it would only be ""updated"". The government insists it remains committed to the European Convention - which includes articles on fair trials, freedom of expression, free elections and privacy - but wants to look at its application in the UK. It says the case law of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has evolved over time and it is right to look at how UK courts respond. The panel, led by Sir Peter, is expected to evaluate whether UK judges are being drawn into policy matters, traditionally decided by politicians. Ministers see the review as part of a wider constitutional reappraisal, examining the relationship between the judiciary, the executive and Parliament. Mr Buckland recently described prisoner votes - mandated by the court in Strasbourg but opposed by the government - as a ""difficult case"" relating to the Human Rights Act. Andwriting in the Telegraph,,externalhe said the Human Rights Act allowed courts to rewrite laws passed in Parliament to ensure they comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. He said this had ""not always been limited to minor, uncontroversial technical changes"". He said it ""is surely worth asking whether...such important and controversial decisions should be returned to Parliament"". A separate panel is already looking at whether there is a need to reform the process of judicial review - where a judge decides the lawfulness of a decision or action made by a public body, in response to a challenge over the way the decision was made. Campaigners say the government is already trying to place limitations on the Human Rights Act through other proposed legislation. The civil liberties campaigning group Liberty said it was concerned the review would focus on ""limiting our ability"" to challenge governments ""when they make bad decisions"". For Labour, shadow justice secretary David Lammy said: ""It is bonkers that the government is prioritising launching an attack on human rights in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic."" He added: ""There is no need for a review into the rights and freedoms that underpin our democracy and all of us enjoy."" The European Convention predates the European Union and is separate to it.

" How high might temperatures climb and how much rain might fall in your area and how? The BBC and the Met Office have looked at the UK's changing climate in detail to find out. Temperatures in the UK exceeded 40C for the first time on record earlier this summer, and extreme weather events are likely to become even more frequent. The Met Office climate projections cover different levels of global warming. When, or if, these levels are reached will depend on the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. The data is measured in 12km-square (7.5-mile-square) grids across the UK. The results for your postcode represent an average for the grids closest to you and the mid-point of a range of future possibilities, which come from the Met Office’s most recent major climate modelling data.

The hottest day recorded in the UK came in July 2022, with40.3C measured in at Coningsby in Lincolnshire. Human activity has increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and caused rising temperatures worldwide since the growth of industrialisation in the 19th Century. If global average temperatures rise by 2C above pre-industrial levels, days at least as hot the 2019 record could be more frequent and widespread. And with a 4C rise, parts of the UK could see temperatures above 42C. Urgent cuts in emissions are needed to keep the rise in global average temperatures in check. The Glasgow Climate Pact,reached at the COP26 summit in 2021, agreed countries will meet this year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Use buttons to change season In the the 30 summers from 1991 to 2019, there were {{beginHighlight}} {{current_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}} above 25C per month on average. If global temperatures rise by 2C, there could be {{beginHighlight}}{{medium_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. With a 4C rise, there could be {{beginHighlight}}{{high_summer_days}} days{{endHighlight}}. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines any day with a maximum temperature above 25C as a ""summer day"". In the 30 summers from 1991 to 2019, even the warmest places in the UK, located in the South, had no more than seven days a month above 25C on average. If global average temperatures rise by 2C, southern parts of the country could see more than 11 days per summer month go beyond 25C. If the rise is 4C, those places could have 20 or more summer days per month, and higher likelihood of hot spells triggering public-health warnings. The cooler, northern parts of the UK, which may not see many days above 25C even with a 4C rise, can nonetheless expect average daytime temperatures in summer to increase by at least 2.5C. The average daytime temperature in the UK in summercurrentlyranges from about 14C in northern Scotland to 22C in southern England.But summers have been getting warmer, with four of the 10 hottest summers up to 2019 recorded in the past two decades. Even if countries cut emissions and theworld warms by 2C, the whole UK could see higher summer temperatures.In some northern locations, the increase could be small. In southern areas, average summer temperatures could reach 24C. If emissions continue to increase and average global temperaturesrise by 4C, summers will be even hotter.Nearly a third of the UK could see average summer temperatures above 25C. The Met Office climate projections for the UK indicate significant temperature rises in the decades ahead for both winter and summer, with the greatest increases in the already warmer South. Extreme weather could become more frequent and intense. Not every summer will be hotter than the last – but temperature records are expected to be regularly broken, while heatwaves are likely to be longer and happen more often. Use buttons to change season In the 30 years from 1991 to 2019, there were {{beginHighlight}} {{current_rainy_days}} rainy days{{endHighlight}} on average per month in summer. If global average temperatures rise by 2C, this could be {{beginHighlight}}{{medium_rainy_days}} days{{endHighlight}} per month.

In the 30 years from 1991 to 2019, there were {{beginHighlight}}{{current_rainy_days}} rainy days{{endHighlight}} on average per month in winter. At both 2C and 4C rises, the number of rainy days per month could be roughly the same. As the world warms, fewer rainy days in summer are expected. Currently, over a quarter of the UK has 20 or more days without rain each summer month. This could grow to more than half the country if we reach 4C global warming. Winter rains could remain as likely as they are now. The number of days will vary from year-to-year, but rainy days in a warmer future could be wetter than today with total rainfall expected to rise. Use buttons to change season   In warmer winters the heaviest rains are likely to get more intense. If global average temperatures rise by 4C above pre-industrial levels, half the country could expect at least 20% more rainfall on the wettest winter days. Summer rains may also become heavier in many places, although total rainfall is expected to decline. Of course, not all of the heaviest rains will necessarily fall in these two seasons. The current wettest day on record was 3 October 2020, whenenough rain fell across all four nations to fill Loch Ness. Currently,the wettest areas of the UK dominate the west coast, with nearly all of Wales and western Scotland receiving most rain in winter months. So how much will change in future winters? With a2C rise, very little compared to what we've seen recently.But winters over the past 30 years have been rainier on average than previously, and the pattern of wetter winters could continue. The exact amount of change in rainfall at2C global warmingwill vary across the country. Most places could have slightly wetter winters than in the 20th Century. If global average temperatures were torise by 4C, more than half the country could see at least 10% more rain over the winter months. The UK climate projections suggest increases in winter rainfall in most parts of the country, as well as drier summers. Rainfall measurements fluctuate from year to year, making projections challenging. Not every winter will necessarily be rainier than the one before, and not every summer will be dry, but both trends could have big impacts. As the world warms, the UK is likely to have hotter, drier summers and warmer, wetter winters, according to the Met Office. Extreme weather events such as heatwaves and heavy downpours could become more frequent and more intense. Many scientists are concerned. ""I think it’s really frightening,” says Dr Lizzie Kendon, a senior Met Office scientist. “It's just a wake-up call really as to what we’re talking about here.” We are already seeing the impacts of climate change, but the level of global warming we reach and by when will depend primarily on the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. To some, warming weather may not seem like such a big deal. But even the smallest incremental changes in climate can have far-reaching effects. Temperatures above 30C for two or more days can trigger a public-health warning. In the 1990s, this happened about once every four years for locations in the South. By the 2070s, projections suggest it could be as frequently as four times per year - 16 times more often, if we do not curb our emissions. The Met Office projects rainy winters, which keep the soil wet into spring, and dry summers of infrequent rainfall will become the norm. Summer rain is likely to become less frequent but could be heavier. Without regular rainfall, the ground has a harder time absorbing water when it finally does come, leading to a greater risk of flash flooding. Floods will likely become a staple of warming winters as well. Steady rain, which is currently a feature of winter months, will probably continue, and total rainfall is expected to increase. When the ground is already saturated, waterways tend to rise. Bridges and sewers designed for historical rainfall levels may come increasingly under pressure. Warming temperatures could also mean cold spells become less frequent. Andsnowy UK winters could become thing of the pastas climate change affects the UK, according to Met Office analysis shared with BBC Panorama. Temperatures below freezing during the day and areas with considerable amounts of snow on the ground may be limited to parts of Scotland by the end of the century if emissions continue to rise. The BBC has collaborated with scientists from the Met Office to analyse data from their extensive weather measurement records and their major climate modelling project, theUK Climate Projections (UKCP). The present-day data shows averages of observed measurements for 1991-2019. The future data shows projected temperature and rainfall measurements produced by climate models for two different levels of global warming: if global average temperatures rise 2C above records from the mid-19th Century, the start of major industrialisation, and if that rise is 4C. Twelve different versions of the Met Office's Hadley Centre climate model were used in calculating the UKCP Regional (12km) projections using a high emissions gas scenario (RCP8.5). Climate models are computer simulations of how the atmosphere, oceans, land, plants and ice behave under various levels of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. They help scientists come up with projections for what conditions on Earth we are likely to see as global warming continues. The level of global warming depends on a number of factors. The most important is the amount of emissions produced in the coming years. Emissions are greenhouse gases released into our atmosphere. The accumulation of these gases has a warming effect on the globe, which in turn leads to changes in climatic conditions. Governments around the world have pledged to reduce their emissions to limit the degree of warming. During the Glasgow COP26 summit in 2021, countries agreed to meet the following year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of keeping temperature rises within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effectssuch as millions more people being exposed to extreme heat. If no interventions are taken, global average temperatures could rise by up to 4C by 2100. This high-emissions future is highlighted in themost recent Evidence Report for the UK's Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA)as possible, if less likely. Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C, while at current rates of global emissions, the world is on a pathway somewhere between 2C and 4C. The modelled projections in this data do not represent a specific time period. Instead, they show what conditions could be like in these two different levels of global warming. Some other climate data may project specific points in time by which a certain level of global warming may be reached. However, this model allows for the possibility of actions that may reduce or increase emissions enough to change the timing before we would experience a 2C or 4C future. More information on the methods used to calculate the timing of different levels of global warming can be found inthis 2018 Met Office paper. This tool presents six different measurements among those scientists use to gain a picture of the environment under various conditions. Each represents a specific predefined climate metric. 1. Hottest day is the maximum temperature recorded or projected on a single day 2. Summer days, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), have a maximum temperature above 25C 3. Average daytime temperature is the average of daily maximum air temperatures over a season 4. Rainy days are when more than 1mm of rain is recorded. This excludes days that may have had very light rain or a heavy morning dew or mist 5. Wettest day is the maximum amount of recorded or projected rainfall on a single day 6. Total rainfall is the amount in millimetres measured across a season. We also calculated and display the change in rainfall for the future scenarios as a percentage change from the current period (1991-2019) Climate data is typically presented in gridded squares that make up a large surface area. The grids used in this model are 12km by 12km. This level of detail is able to capture many of the varied climate conditions across the UK's diverse geography far better than other, broader-scale models. Each UK postcode has been matched to its nearest 12km-square grid. The results displayed for your area represent an average (mean) for the grids closest to that location, as long as they are no further than 34km away. In most cases a grid has been averaged with its eight nearest grids, except along irregular coastlines and small islands. Averaging means that the figures displayed are never for a single grid alone. While natural variability between grid areas is normal, this process minimises dramatic differences that may be down to chance. Both current and future data are organised into the same 12km-square grids. However, unlike future modelled predictions, the present-day data comes from actual observed measurements. We have presented a single number that represents an average for each grid and season. This helps to reduce the influence of outliers in observed data. For instance, the current number of summer days represents the mean number of days recording maximum temperatures of at least 25C per month in June, July and August across every year from 1991 to 2019. Each number presented in the two future scenarios represents the median of 12 possible outcomes as projected by the 12 model simulations. All future projection data has been calibrated by Met Office scientists against the data in the present-day range, 1991-2019, so the model results can be compared directly with observations. More information on the calibration technique used can be foundin this 2017 paper. Because climate data is gridded, the data may represent a larger area than that covered by a single weather station. Measurements from multiple weather stations are averaged together to give a single datapoint for a grid. Take the hottest day, for instance. If the highest temperature recorded at Cambridge Royal Botanic Gardens was 38.7C, that number is combined with measurements from other stations across the region to produce an average for a 12km-square area that includes Cambridge. Other weather stations will have recorded slightly lower temperatures, so the average highest temperature in this area would be less than 38.7C.

The accumulation of these gases has a warming effect on the globe, which in turn leads to changes in climatic conditions. Governments around the world have pledged to reduce their emissions to limit the degree of warming. During the Glasgow COP26 summit in 2021, countries agreed to meet the following year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of keeping temperature rises within 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effectssuch as millions more people being exposed to extreme heat. If no interventions are taken, global average temperatures could rise by up to 4C by 2100. This high-emissions future is highlighted in themost recent Evidence Report for the UK's Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA)as possible, if less likely. Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C, while at current rates of global emissions, the world is on a pathway somewhere between 2C and 4C. The modelled projections in this data do not represent a specific time period. Instead, they show what conditions could be like in these two different levels of global warming. Some other climate data may project specific points in time by which a certain level of global warming may be reached. However, this model allows for the possibility of actions that may reduce or increase emissions enough to change the timing before we would experience a 2C or 4C future. More information on the methods used to calculate the timing of different levels of global warming can be found inthis 2018 Met Office paper. This tool presents six different measurements among those scientists use to gain a picture of the environment under various conditions. Each represents a specific predefined climate metric. 1. Hottest day is the maximum temperature recorded or projected on a single day 2. Summer days, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), have a maximum temperature above 25C 3. Average daytime temperature is the average of daily maximum air temperatures over a season 4. Rainy days are when more than 1mm of rain is recorded. This excludes days that may have had very light rain or a heavy morning dew or mist 5. Wettest day is the maximum amount of recorded or projected rainfall on a single day 6. Total rainfall is the amount in millimetres measured across a season. We also calculated and display the change in rainfall for the future scenarios as a percentage change from the current period (1991-2019) Climate data is typically presented in gridded squares that make up a large surface area. The grids used in this model are 12km by 12km. This level of detail is able to capture many of the varied climate conditions across the UK's diverse geography far better than other, broader-scale models. Each UK postcode has been matched to its nearest 12km-square grid. The results displayed for your area represent an average (mean) for the grids closest to that location, as long as they are no further than 34km away. In most cases a grid has been averaged with its eight nearest grids, except along irregular coastlines and small islands. Averaging means that the figures displayed are never for a single grid alone. While natural variability between grid areas is normal, this process minimises dramatic differences that may be down to chance. Both current and future data are organised into the same 12km-square grids. However, unlike future modelled predictions, the present-day data comes from actual observed measurements. We have presented a single number that represents an average for each grid and season. This helps to reduce the influence of outliers in observed data. For instance, the current number of summer days represents the mean number of days recording maximum temperatures of at least 25C per month in June, July and August across every year from 1991 to 2019. Each number presented in the two future scenarios represents the median of 12 possible outcomes as projected by the 12 model simulations. All future projection data has been calibrated by Met Office scientists against the data in the present-day range, 1991-2019, so the model results can be compared directly with observations. More information on the calibration technique used can be foundin this 2017 paper. Because climate data is gridded, the data may represent a larger area than that covered by a single weather station. Measurements from multiple weather stations are averaged together to give a single datapoint for a grid. Take the hottest day, for instance. If the highest temperature recorded at Cambridge Royal Botanic Gardens was 38.7C, that number is combined with measurements from other stations across the region to produce an average for a 12km-square area that includes Cambridge. Other weather stations will have recorded slightly lower temperatures, so the average highest temperature in this area would be less than 38.7C.

"This video can not be played The witness chose to keep her face mask on after Mr Giuliani made the request President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has tested positive for Covid-19 and is being treated in hospital. Mr Giuliani, who has led the Trump campaign's legal challenges to the election results, is the latest person close to the president to be infected. Since November, he has been on a cross-country tour in an effort to convince state governments to overturn the vote. Like other Trump officials, he has been criticised for shunning face masks. Mr Trump, who was ill with the virus in October, announced the diagnosis in a tweet, writing: ""Get better soon Rudy, we will carry on!"" Mr Giuliani, 76, was admitted to the Medstar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington DC on Sunday. The news came after Mr Giuliani had visited Arizona, Georgia and Michigan all in the past week - where he spoke to government officials while not wearing masks. Following news of Mr Giuliani's diagnosis, the Arizona legislature announced sudden plans to shut down for one week. Several Republican lawmakers there had spent over 10 hours with the former New York mayor last week discussing election results. Following Mr Giuliani's visit to Phoenix, Arizona, the state's Republican partytweeted a photo,externalof him with other mask-less state lawmakers. In a tweet, Mr Giuliani thanked well-wishers for their messages, and said he was ""recovering quickly"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It is not clear if Mr Giuliani is experiencing symptoms or when he caught the virus. Nearly 14.6 million people have been infected with Covid-19 in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University, and 281,234 people have died - the highest figures of any country in the world. US vaccine chief sees 'light at end of the tunnel' No, it won't alter your DNA - vaccine rumours debunked On Sunday, Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator, criticised the Trump administration for flouting guidelines and peddling ""myths"" about the pandemic. ""I hear community members parroting back those situations, parroting back that masks don't work, parroting back that we should work towards herd immunity,"" Dr Birx told NBC. ""This is the worst event that this country will face,"" she said. This video can not be played ""Grow up, mask up"": Tensions in US Covid hotspot of North Dakota Since the 3 November election, Mr Giuliani has travelled the country as part of unsuccessful efforts to overturn Mr Trump's election defeat. During many of his events, he was seen without a face mask and ignoring social distancing. Last Wednesday, he appeared at a hearing on alleged election fraud in Michigan where he asked a witness beside him if she would be comfortable removing her face mask. ""I don't want you to do this if you feel uncomfortable, but would you be comfortable taking your mask off, so we can hear you more clearly?"" said Mr Giuliani, who was not wearing a face mask. The witness chose to keep her mask on after asking the panel if she could be heard. On Thursday Mr Giuliani travelled to Georgia where he repeated unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud at a Senate committee hearing about election security. Trump campaigns in crucial Senate battleground Top US lawyer refutes Trump election fraud claims What legal challenges remain for Trump? Dozens of people in Mr Trump's orbit are said to have tested positive for Covid-19 since October. Boris Epshteyn, another Trump adviser, tested positive shortly after appearing alongside Rudy Giuliani at a news conference on 25 November. Others include the president's chief of staff Mark Meadows and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, along with his wife Melania and sons Donald Jnr and Baron. Mr Trump's own diagnosis and hospital stay upended his campaign for a second term in office, less than a month before he faced Joe Biden in the presidential election. Mr Trump has refused to concede, insisting without evidence that the election was stolen or rigged. Attorney General William Barr said last week that his department had not seen any evidence of widespread voter fraud that would change the result.

"One Newport school said under a Welsh Government scheme it received six laptops to share between 160 pupils School children are home-learning on games consoles and mobile phones, teachers have said, despite a Welsh Government pledge none would be ""left behind"" during the pandemic. It provided Â£3m for laptops and wifi devices in April, but some pupils still do not have equipment. Plaid Cymru questioned why there was no nationwide register of digitally-excluded learners. The Welsh Government said it had supplied thousands of devices. Covid and home schooling: Children 'flourishing' as numbers rise Covid: Wales' lockdown IT praised but learning hours low Covid: Mass testing in Wales schools and colleges considered Some schools in Newport are relying on a ""Donate IT"" appeal to provide hundreds of required laptops and kit. In April, Education Minister Kirsty Williams pledged an extra Â£3m for computers so pupils could work from home. She said it was her priority that ""no child or family is left behind during this crisis and all children have the opportunity to continue learning"". And in June, the Welsh Government said pupils ""should now be in receipt of the required device and connectivity"". But not everyone is. Maggie Bain, a governor at Newport's Lliswerry Primary School, said some devices had been provided, but added: ""I don't think it's met the level of need that's out there."" School governor Maggie Bain said the Welsh Government needed to take the matter ""more seriously"" Lliswerry Primary School deputy head, Lisa Peterson, said: ""A lot of children have Xboxes or PlayStations but they weren't suitable for home learning. ""A significant number have phones, but again that's not an appropriate device,"" she added. Ms Peterson said the school received six laptops to share between 160 pupils as part of the Welsh Government scheme. She said: ""The project identified far more children that needed devices than were available."" Computers were now as crucial as a ""pen, a pencil and a piece of paper,"" she said. ""Far more children needed devices than were available,"" says Lliswerry Primary's deputy head Lisa Peterson Senior staff at Maindee Primary School in Newport said a ""very small minority"" of children - ""less than a handful in each class"" - had been able to access ""good home-learning opportunities throughout the whole of lockdown"". Maindee Primary School headteacher, Jo Cueto, said: ""We estimated around 160 devices were needed to be able to ensure that all children, all families, were able to access home-learning. ""That would not be a device per child, [but] a device per family, so sometimes there may be three or four children using that device."" The school had invested in some equipment, but was ""still probably in need of around 120 devices"". ""Unfortunately, I don't think there's enough money to plug the gaps,"" Mrs Cueto said. Both Maindee and Lliswerry are relying on local charities to provide the hundreds of laptops they need. More than 2,500 digitally-excluded pupils were identified across Newport, with the council loaning 1,300 wifi devices and 800 other devices, including laptops. Llamau, a charity that supports homeless young people, women and children across Wales, said it has been helping families struggling to access online learning throughout the pandemic. A young mum of two, who lost her job because of the pandemic, was forced to sell her mobile phone and her children's tablets to help make ends meet. Sharon - not her real name - had to call the children's school and arrange for their work to be sent in the post, which she found very upsetting. The charity has since secured funding that allows the family to have six months of free broadband and another that secured tablets for the children. The Welsh Government said it had funded 10,848 wifi devices and 9,717 software licences across Wales. And in April, it said replacement kit would be funded by its digital education programme, Hwb. An Education Policy Institute report found Wales' attempt to address the lack of access to online learning was ""commendable"". It said: ""The Welsh Government was able to draw on well-established infrastructure, allowing them to act quickly."" But opposition politicians questioned whether ministers had a ""clear picture"" of the scale of digital poverty in Wales. The Welsh Government said there was no single, nationwide register of digitally-excluded learners and that ""schools and local authorities are best placed to support their learners"". It is the responsibility of councils to issue devices and manage internet connections. However, Plaid Cymru is calling for a centralised ""audit"" by the Welsh Government to improve ""monitoring and measurement of digital poverty"". Its education spokeswoman, SiÃ¢n Gwenllian, said: ""Having this audit is just the first step, but it's essential, because then you can actually see the extent of the problem and know where to target support"". Close schools early for Christmas, says union Almost half of Welsh schools report Covid cases Laptops offered to school pupils during lockdown She said there was no ""clear picture of the extent of the digital divide and digital poverty in Wales"". ""The picture painted by government isn't really consistent with what we are hearing on the ground,"" she said. The Welsh Government said it had provided guidance to help councils and schools ensure children who cannot attend school because of Covid-19 can continue learning. A spokesman said: ""Since September, teachers across Wales have created over 30,000 digital classrooms through Hwb, which exceeds the total amount created for the whole of the previous academic year. ""Through these digital classrooms, teachers are delivering a range of blended learning activities, which also support learners who are isolating at home.""

"This video can not be played In February 2020, Storm Dennis battered Wales causing widespread flooding Renewed calls have been made for an independent public inquiry into severe flooding in the south Wales valleys. Storms Ciara, Dennis and Jorge in early 2020 led to record rainfall and river flows across Wales and the most widespread flooding seen since 1979. A debate over holding an inquiry will take place in the Senedd after nearly 6,000 people signed a petition. The Welsh Government said it had taken ""significant steps"" to learn from this year's flooding. Plaid Cymru also wants more money spent on flood prevention and a single body being responsible for flooding. Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) was one of the worst-hit areas, where almost 1,500 homes and businesses were affected, with people forced to leave their homes. Floods and Covid 'left people traumatised' Flood-hit families struggle with virus lockdown Securing 2,000 coal tips 'could cost over Â£500m' Watchdog's flooding response 'fell short' Plaid has also said compensation should be available for flood victims. The calls come in a report by the party into the flooding across the county. Leanne Wood, Member of the Senedd (MS) for Rhondda, said: ""Having a multi-agency approach, each with their own different take on what happened and their own agenda, has created a scenario whereby lines of responsibility are blurred. ""A public inquiry would untangle this confusion and get to the heart of what happened and what needs to happen to stand the best chance of preventing it from happening again. Streets in RCT were left under water during February's storms ""This is much needed in the Rhondda, as we have seen successive floods this year and they have mainly been in places with no real history of flooding."" Chris Bryant, Rhondda's Labour MP, criticised the renewed calls and said lawyers would be the ""only people who will make money out of an inquiry"". He added: ""I'm focused on delivering hundreds of floodgates and more robust flood prevention measures now and getting the money RCT needs - and was promised - from Westminster to pay for the repair bill."" Plaid previously criticised a Labour Party reportwritten by Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones and MS Mick Antoniw, which called for flood emergency drills to be carried out to check areas are protected. Ms Wood said the failure to support an independent public inquiry into the floods was a ""glaring omission"" from the report. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""We recognise the devastating impact of the flooding earlier this year on residents' well-being as well as the effect on their homes and businesses and have taken significant steps to learn the lessons from this year's floods.""

"Former Court of Appeal judge Sir Peter Gross has been appointed to lead an independent review of the Human Rights Act. The government wants to examine whether the 1998 act - which allows UK nationals to rely on theEuropean Convention of Human Rights,externalin domestic courts - is working effectively. A panel of eight is expected to report its findings by next summer. Labour called the review of human rights law ""bonkers"". Justice Secretary Robert Buckland insisted that ""human rights are deeply rooted in our constitution and the UK has a proud tradition of upholding and promoting them at home and abroad."" While previous Conservative governments had promised to replace the existing act entirely with a new Bill of Rights, the 2019 Conservative Party manifesto said it would only be ""updated"". The government insists it remains committed to the European Convention - which includes articles on fair trials, freedom of expression, free elections and privacy - but wants to look at its application in the UK. It says the case law of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has evolved over time and it is right to look at how UK courts respond. The panel, led by Sir Peter, is expected to evaluate whether UK judges are being drawn into policy matters, traditionally decided by politicians. Ministers see the review as part of a wider constitutional reappraisal, examining the relationship between the judiciary, the executive and Parliament. Mr Buckland recently described prisoner votes - mandated by the court in Strasbourg but opposed by the government - as a ""difficult case"" relating to the Human Rights Act. Andwriting in the Telegraph,,externalhe said the Human Rights Act allowed courts to rewrite laws passed in Parliament to ensure they comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. He said this had ""not always been limited to minor, uncontroversial technical changes"". He said it ""is surely worth asking whether...such important and controversial decisions should be returned to Parliament"". A separate panel is already looking at whether there is a need to reform the process of judicial review - where a judge decides the lawfulness of a decision or action made by a public body, in response to a challenge over the way the decision was made. Campaigners say the government is already trying to place limitations on the Human Rights Act through other proposed legislation. The civil liberties campaigning group Liberty said it was concerned the review would focus on ""limiting our ability"" to challenge governments ""when they make bad decisions"". For Labour, shadow justice secretary David Lammy said: ""It is bonkers that the government is prioritising launching an attack on human rights in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic."" He added: ""There is no need for a review into the rights and freedoms that underpin our democracy and all of us enjoy."" The European Convention predates the European Union and is separate to it.

"Shoppers embraced a pedestrianised Regent Street in central London on Saturday Shoppers flocked to High Streets and shopping malls across England this weekend, but in numbers well below pre-pandemic levels. It was the first weekend since stores in England reopened on Wednesday. Many business owners are pinning their hopes on a curtailed pre-Christmas trading period, having endured two national lockdowns already this year. But on average, shopper numbers were a quarter below 2019 levels, according to market research firm Springboard. It says across the UK as a whole, footfall was down by 30% compared to the same December weekend last year. It comes on the back of a dreadful week for the retail industry with Topshop-owner Arcadia falling into administration and Debenhams saying it would be closing its 124 stores by March after it failed to find a buyer. Shoppers out in force under new England tier rules Debenhams set to close putting 12,000 jobs at risk Topshop owner Arcadia goes into administration Central London remains far emptier than usual because of the coronavirus pandemic, despite some crowds flocking to specially pedestrianised shopping areas in Regent Street on Saturday. On Sunday, shopper numbers in the capital were half what they would normally be weeks out from Christmas, Springboard reported. Boutique-owner Rowena Howie says her central London store had far fewer shoppers than a normal December weekend Rowena Howie, who runs a womenswear boutique called Revival Retro in central London, said there were far fewer shoppers in her store than she would normally expect in the lead up to Christmas. ""We definitely wouldn't have been as busy in the shop as we might have been in a normal year, particularly in the first weekend of December,"" she said. Although Ms Howie - who took part in a campaign promoting small businesses on Saturday - said strong online sales meant she was able to record a good day's trading, the first since before Covid-19. ""We're in Fitzrovia, having a bricks and mortar store, our takings have been really impacted,"" she said. Anna Blackburn, managing director of jewellery chain Beaverbrooks, said footfall had increased by about 10% in its 70 High Street stores this weekend. ""There has been a trend of reducing footfall for sometime, but an increase in the average transaction size. People coming to the High Street are definitely spending more money,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. Ms Blackburn said there had also been a spike in wedding and engagement ring sales. ""It's been a tough year, people want to treat their loved ones."" Shoppers appear more eager to visit retail parks than malls and High Streets. On Saturday, footfall numbers for England's retail parks were slightly higher than they were this time last year, but on Sunday they fell back and were 10% below last year's figure. Shoppers queue up outside Primark in Coventry this weekend. We are still a nation of shoppers. Overall, retail sales are above pre-pandemic levels, according to the ONS. But that number masks a mixed picture of what we're buying and how we are buying it. Clothing sales for example are down by 25%. And there has been a dramatic shift to online, accelerating a growing trend. It's this dramatic change that has been so devastating for the High Street. Some of the pictures from this weekend might seem to show a bounce back. But the figures show that the numbers of people out and about are well down on last December. That comes on top of lengthy closures for non-essential shops. The Centre for Retail Research predicts more than 20,000 shops will close compared to 16,000 last year - and that job losses will rise to 235,000 people compared to 143,000 last year. The cost of running a shop is just too much for many. One independent retailer in central London told me she couldn't see herself still in bricks and mortar next year. Despite a 12-month break from business rates offered by the government, the rent, coupled with falling shopper numbers, is just too much to bear. In one encouraging sign for retailers and small business owners, shoppers seem far more comfortable returning to public shopping areas after the second national lockdown than they did after the first. Footfall across England was 60% higher this weekend than on 20-21 June, the first weekend shops were allowed to reopen after the country's first lockdown, which began in March. ""Part of this is timing - the proximity to Christmas means there is huge pent up demand amongst consumers to shop in store to purchase gifts,"" said Diane Wehrle, Springboard's marketing director. ""However, it is also an indicator of 'lockdown fatigue', whereby after many months of being restricted to their homes, consumers are keen to visit retail stores again, particularly to experience the excitement of Christmas. ""They have become accustomed to the 'new normal' that involves wearing face masks in stores and queuing in order to adhere to social distancing rules which we were not all comfortable with in June.""

"The fire has been bearing down on the east coast of Fraser Island Firefighters are battling to keep a large bushfire which has come within 700 metres of a small township on an Australian holiday island at bay. Dozens of residents of Happy Valley were earlier urged to evacuate as the blaze raged east across Fraser Island. For six weeks, firefighters have been struggling to control the blazes on the island - a popular tourist destination off the coast of Queensland. However efforts have been thwarted by a continuing heatwave and dry ground. The bushfire was sparked by an illegal campfire in mid-October and has burnt through over half of the island - about 83,000 hectares. Australia warned on future of 'simultaneous' natural disasters A visual guide to Australia's Black Summer bushfire crisis Fraser Island is the world's largest sand island and listed as a Unesco World Heritage site. It has a population of fewer than 200 permanent residents, some of whom were evacuated weeks ago alongside the tourists. However, other residents - including many trained to fight bushfires - have stayed behind to defend their properties. The Fraser Island fires are among the most serious blazes seen in Australia since its ""Black Summer"" last year. The 2019-20 bushfire season was by far its largest and most intense on record and was driven by the increasing effects of climate change, scientists said. Authorities pushed Fraser Island's bushfire warning to emergency level late on Sunday and told residents in Happy Valley, on the island's east coast, to leave immediately as temperatures soared above 30C (86F) on the weekend. On Monday, about 100 firefighters and more than 25 water-dropping planes were focusing efforts on containing the front racing towards the coast. Firefighters are dropping massive loads of water and fire suppressant on the blaze, and deliberately burning bush around the town's perimeter to rid the area of any further fuel for the fire. The blazes have already burnt across half the island ""At the moment, the fire front is around 700m away from the Happy Valley area, "" said Queensland Fire and Emergency Services director Brian Cox on Monday morning. ""Hopefully the backburning operation combined with the air attack plans we have this morning will make a  significant difference."" He said fire crews planned to repeat previous aerial operations by dropping a million litres of water on the blaze. However, with a continuing forecast of strong winds and hot days, the only thing that would put out the huge fire would be rain, he said. ""We would like a lot of rain if possible,"" Mr Cox said. ""[But] we are preparing for the worst and we're going to try to hit it with everything we have got today."" Fire trucks have been stationed on the beaches as authorities use planes to tackle the blazes inland Other fires are also burning on the other side of the island at Kingfisher Bay, whereresidents have been told to be prepared to leave.,external Australia's last bushfire season ran from September 2019 to March 2020 - much longer than usual. It was an environmental national disaster of unprecedented scale. Every Australian state experienced the flare-up of blazes. Cumulatively, the thousands of fires scorched through an area of land twice the size of England. At least 34 people died directly in the fires, which also burnt down more than 3,000 homes andkilled or displaced about three billion animals. Scientists say climate change led to the unprecedented intensity and scale of the fires, and the season came after a lengthy drought, particularly severe across south-eastern Australia. The fires so were so large and intense, that in several cases they escalated beyond the scope of firefighting efforts to control them. The blazes only died out in late February and March after a lengthy spell of hard rain. Wetter conditions this year mean there will be ""normal fire potential"" - particularly in wooded temperate forest areas - as opposed to last year's increased level. However, the Bushfire and Natural Hazard Co-operative Research Centre, which issues the annual national report, said this year would see an increase in ""grass fires"" as opposed to bush fires, in the southern states like Victoria and New South Wales. ""Grass and crop fires are the main concern in these locations for the summer months as the growth dries out in the warmer weather,"" the report said. It added that the ""landscape and weather conditions"" forecast, including the effects of a La Nina season, will ""continue to be vastly different to the previous two years"".

"The market is a popular annual tradition in the city A Christmas market which sparked concerns over the spread of coronavirus has closed - one day after it opened. Nottingham's Winter Wonderland opened on Saturday despiteobjections from residentsin the city, which is under tier three restrictions. Organiser Mellors Group initially announced a temporary closure due to ""unprecedented high footfall"". On Sunday, the city councilsaid it had made a joint decision with the organisers,externalnot to reopen this year. The market was set to run from 10:00 to 21:00 GMT every day until Christmas Eve. Crowds forced it to close at 18:00 on Saturday. Similar annual events in cities including Birmingham and Manchester were cancelled this year due to the pandemic. Concerns have been raised over the levels of social distancing observed at the Christmas market in Nottingham Jo Cox-Brown, from Night Time Economy Solutions, said she had been in the city centre to support Small Business Saturday and witnessed crowds where people were close together and not wearing masks. She said she worried the market could cause a spike in local coronavirus cases. ""It wasn't being well-managed it wasn't being very well-controlled,"" she said. ""People were defecating in doorways because there's no toilets open."" Ms Cox-Brown said many people who had been in touch were ""really angry"" the event went ahead and felt organisers were ""putting their Christmas at risk"". Simon Bonsai said he was ""hugely disappointed"" to see the market closed Trader Simon Bonsai said he was ""hugely disappointed"" by the closure after a brisk day of trading on Saturday, but said the decision was ""obvious"". ""It was so busy last night, there were too many people about,"" he said. In a joint statement, Mellors Group and the city council said it implemented a ""wide range of measures"" to ensure compliance with tier three restrictions. ""However, numbers were too large to implement these effectively,"" they said. ""We're sorry it has not worked out."" Mellors previously said there had been ""pent-up demand"" for city-centre shopping after the second nationwide lockdown, which ended on Wednesday.

"One Newport school said under a Welsh Government scheme it received six laptops to share between 160 pupils School children are home-learning on games consoles and mobile phones, teachers have said, despite a Welsh Government pledge none would be ""left behind"" during the pandemic. It provided Â£3m for laptops and wifi devices in April, but some pupils still do not have equipment. Plaid Cymru questioned why there was no nationwide register of digitally-excluded learners. The Welsh Government said it had supplied thousands of devices. Covid and home schooling: Children 'flourishing' as numbers rise Covid: Wales' lockdown IT praised but learning hours low Covid: Mass testing in Wales schools and colleges considered Some schools in Newport are relying on a ""Donate IT"" appeal to provide hundreds of required laptops and kit. In April, Education Minister Kirsty Williams pledged an extra Â£3m for computers so pupils could work from home. She said it was her priority that ""no child or family is left behind during this crisis and all children have the opportunity to continue learning"". And in June, the Welsh Government said pupils ""should now be in receipt of the required device and connectivity"". But not everyone is. Maggie Bain, a governor at Newport's Lliswerry Primary School, said some devices had been provided, but added: ""I don't think it's met the level of need that's out there."" School governor Maggie Bain said the Welsh Government needed to take the matter ""more seriously"" Lliswerry Primary School deputy head, Lisa Peterson, said: ""A lot of children have Xboxes or PlayStations but they weren't suitable for home learning. ""A significant number have phones, but again that's not an appropriate device,"" she added. Ms Peterson said the school received six laptops to share between 160 pupils as part of the Welsh Government scheme. She said: ""The project identified far more children that needed devices than were available."" Computers were now as crucial as a ""pen, a pencil and a piece of paper,"" she said. ""Far more children needed devices than were available,"" says Lliswerry Primary's deputy head Lisa Peterson Senior staff at Maindee Primary School in Newport said a ""very small minority"" of children - ""less than a handful in each class"" - had been able to access ""good home-learning opportunities throughout the whole of lockdown"". Maindee Primary School headteacher, Jo Cueto, said: ""We estimated around 160 devices were needed to be able to ensure that all children, all families, were able to access home-learning. ""That would not be a device per child, [but] a device per family, so sometimes there may be three or four children using that device."" The school had invested in some equipment, but was ""still probably in need of around 120 devices"". ""Unfortunately, I don't think there's enough money to plug the gaps,"" Mrs Cueto said. Both Maindee and Lliswerry are relying on local charities to provide the hundreds of laptops they need. More than 2,500 digitally-excluded pupils were identified across Newport, with the council loaning 1,300 wifi devices and 800 other devices, including laptops. Llamau, a charity that supports homeless young people, women and children across Wales, said it has been helping families struggling to access online learning throughout the pandemic. A young mum of two, who lost her job because of the pandemic, was forced to sell her mobile phone and her children's tablets to help make ends meet. Sharon - not her real name - had to call the children's school and arrange for their work to be sent in the post, which she found very upsetting. The charity has since secured funding that allows the family to have six months of free broadband and another that secured tablets for the children. The Welsh Government said it had funded 10,848 wifi devices and 9,717 software licences across Wales. And in April, it said replacement kit would be funded by its digital education programme, Hwb. An Education Policy Institute report found Wales' attempt to address the lack of access to online learning was ""commendable"". It said: ""The Welsh Government was able to draw on well-established infrastructure, allowing them to act quickly."" But opposition politicians questioned whether ministers had a ""clear picture"" of the scale of digital poverty in Wales. The Welsh Government said there was no single, nationwide register of digitally-excluded learners and that ""schools and local authorities are best placed to support their learners"". It is the responsibility of councils to issue devices and manage internet connections. However, Plaid Cymru is calling for a centralised ""audit"" by the Welsh Government to improve ""monitoring and measurement of digital poverty"". Its education spokeswoman, SiÃ¢n Gwenllian, said: ""Having this audit is just the first step, but it's essential, because then you can actually see the extent of the problem and know where to target support"". Close schools early for Christmas, says union Almost half of Welsh schools report Covid cases Laptops offered to school pupils during lockdown She said there was no ""clear picture of the extent of the digital divide and digital poverty in Wales"". ""The picture painted by government isn't really consistent with what we are hearing on the ground,"" she said. The Welsh Government said it had provided guidance to help councils and schools ensure children who cannot attend school because of Covid-19 can continue learning. A spokesman said: ""Since September, teachers across Wales have created over 30,000 digital classrooms through Hwb, which exceeds the total amount created for the whole of the previous academic year. ""Through these digital classrooms, teachers are delivering a range of blended learning activities, which also support learners who are isolating at home.""

"San Francisco's local lockdown began slightly earlier than in some other parts of the state Most parts of the US state of California are under a strict new lockdown, as Covid-19 continues to surge across the country. The stay-at-home order affects around 85% of the state's 40 million people. It will be in place for at least three weeks and cover the Christmas holiday. Many businesses will be closed, and people will be banned from meeting anyone outside their household. On Sunday, the US had a record number of people in hospital with Covid-19. The country has seen a sharp rise in cases and Covid-related deaths in recent weeks, a surge that could be partly down to last month's Thanksgiving holiday, when millions of Americans travelled around the US. A US city engulfed by Covid, but no lockdown Where has been hit hardest? US vaccine chief sees 'light at end of the tunnel' The new restrictions in California - the country's most populous state - were triggered by intensive care capacity in hospitals shrinking. The measures apply to the southern part of the state and its central valley, while other areas could follow within days. San Francisco has also gone into lockdown, with the mayor imposing a separate set of orders. California's lockdown in March, in which all non-essential businesses were closed, was seen as an early model for the US at the beginning of the pandemic. Governor Gavin Newsom has ordered that when capacity at intensive care units in any of five regions of the state goes below 15%, that region will go into lockdown within 24 hours. The stay-at-home orders triggered in this way will be similar to the far-reaching order issued for the state after the pandemic first hit in March, but with a few significant relaxations: All retail stores are able to stay open, although only at 20% capacity, along with outside spaces such as parks and beaches Gatherings are prohibited, and people are required to stay at home and minimise contact with other households Bars, hair salons and indoor restaurants are closed The lockdown will last for at least three weeks, and until ICU capacity goes above 15% again. Mr Newsom said the measures would help to ""flatten the curve"" and reduce the pressure on health services. ""We are at a tipping point in our fight against the virus and we need to take decisive action now to prevent California's hospital system from being overwhelmed in the coming weeks,"" he said last week. Reactions to the new lockdown measures have been mixed. Some small businesses owners and service-industry employees fear the economic burden will become overwhelming. Others see the governor's orders as a relief. Mimi Marylon Moore Routh, 78, from Lake Tahoe: ""I'm glad for the lockdown.  It is so important to have it, I want to live 10 or 20 more years. I will spend my Christmas with some good music, knitting and listening to audio books."" Joshua Roizman, 22, from Orange County:""It's necessary, but I think the way Gavin Newsom is handling this is not the best. Restaurants are hurting. I worked in the restaurant industry, so I sympathise with them. They're just trying to stay alive."" Heidi Whelchel, 43, from Rancho Cucamonga:""The lockdown is an annoyance because nobody is really observing it and nobody really cares.  It's not like you have the police outside watching that people comply."" The situation in California reflects a surge in infections nationwide. The state, which has the largest number of confirmed cases in the US, reported an additional 30,000 infections on Sunday, a new record. It has recorded more than 1.3 million cases and around 21,000 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Intensive care capacity in two of the five regions set up by state officials for the purposes of the stay-at-home order - Southern California and the central San Joaquin Valley - fell below 15% on Friday. Southern California, which includes Los Angeles and San Diego, the state's two largest cities, fell to 12.5% on Saturday, and San Joaquin to just 8.6%. This video can not be played ""I don't need your instruction"": Two US senators clash on wearing face masks in the chamber Republican opponents of the Democratic authorities in the state and many of its municipalities have questioned the efficacy of the new measures, and say they could harm the local economy. ""Every state is experiencing a surge, which begs the question, how do these shutdowns actually reduce cases?"" state legislator James Gallagher told Fox News. Research has found thatlockdown measures have been associated with reduced infection numbers,external, while the World Health Organization also urges people to ""avoid spaces that are closed,external, crowded or involve close contact"" during the pandemic. But some law enforcement officials said they did not plan to help enforce the new rules, with Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes saying: ""Compliance with health orders is a matter of personal responsibility and not a matter of law enforcement."" Meanwhile, Governor Newsom has been facing accusations of hypocrisy. In November he visited a high-class restaurant in the Napa Valley, contrary to his own guidance. San Francisco Mayor London Breed dined at the same restaurant on a different night. Both have apologised. But White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany seized on the errors: ""These images... make clear Democrats' mind-set: rules for thee but not for me."" According to the Covid Tracking Project,101,487 people were being treated in hospital,externalwith the disease on Sunday, while an additional 1,138 deaths were recorded. Nearly 14.6 million people have been infected with Covid-19 in the US, and 273,374 people have died - the highest figures of any country in the world. On Sunday, Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator, criticised the Trump administration for flouting guidelines and peddling ""myths"" about the pandemic. ""I hear community members parroting back those situations, parroting back that masks don't work, parroting back that we should work towards herd immunity,"" Dr Birx told NBC. ""This is the worst event that this country will face."" This video can not be played Moncef Slaoui told CBS News that Americans could take comfort in vaccine news but still needed to follow Covid-19 guidance The scientist in charge of the US push for a vaccine,Moncef Slaoui, said there was ""light at the end of the tunnel""and that he hoped the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) could give the go-ahead for a vaccine when it meets on Thursday. But for life to get back to normal by the spring, Americans still needed to follow safety measures, he said in an interview with CBS News. States are preparing to distribute a vaccine, with possible approval approaching. Doses are expected to be made available first to the country's million healthcare workers and three million elderly people living in long-term care homes. In other developments: President Donald Trump announced that his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani had tested positivefor the virus.

"Griff, Girl In Red and Greentea Peng are among the rising music stars being tipped for success The longlist for the BBC's Sound of 2021 has been revealed, with a strong showing for DIY pop artists and UK rap. Norway'sGirl In Redis the most prominent name on the list, with seven million fans playing her lo-fi tales of teenage angst on Spotify every month. She's joined by bedroom pop artistGriff, psychedelic soul singerGreentea Pengand rap maverickPa Salieu. Now in its 19th year, the list looks at the best rising talent in music. Former winners include Adele and Celeste. This year's longlist was compiled by a panel of 161 industry experts, including former nominees Billie Eilish and Stormzy. The winner will be announced in January on BBC News and BBC Radio 1. This video can not be played Watch clips from all the artists on the BBC's Sound Of 2021 list. The 10 acts in the running are: Alfie Templeman Berwyn Bree Runway Dutchavelli Girl In Red Greentea Peng Griff Holly Humberstone Pa Salieu The Lathums The Covid-19 pandemic has made launching a music career trickier than ever - and to date, only four of the acts on the Sound of 2021 longlist have played a headline gig. Some, like Wigan indie bandThe Lathums, had built a sizeable live following before the lockdown. The quartet were due to tour with Paul Weller this summer. Instead, they ended up livestreaming a concert from the circus ring at Blackpool Tower, with two clowns as special guests. Pa Salieu is one of the most talked-about up-and-coming British rappers Coventry-based rapperPa Salieuplayed his first ever full show to a camera in an otherwise-deserted studio earlier this year, but says the lockdown also gave him space to make his debut album without distractions from the outside world. The 23-year-old is one of several artists on the longlist whose music defies categorisation, combining dancehall, drill and the hand-drum sounds of his Gambian heritage on the recent mixtape Send Them To Coventry. The Guardian called the collection ""too fresh to ignore,external"", while NME simply dubbed him the ""UK's next star,external"". East London'sBree Runwayhas a similar disregard for convention, drawing on elements of trap, R&B and hardcore metal on songs like ATM and Little Nokia. The rapper and singer describes her music as ""genre fluid and destructive"" and has recently collaborated with kindred spirit Missy Elliot. Selected winners and nominees 200350 Cent, Electric Six, Dizzee Rascal 2008Adele, Vampire Weekend, MGMT 2011Jessie J, James Blake, Anna Calvi 2015Years & Years, Stormzy, Wolf Alice 2018Sigrid, Khalid, Billie Eilish 2020Celeste, Yungblud, Georgia Hailing from Grantham in Lincolnshire,Holly Humberstoneis one of seven artists on the longlist who got their break by uploading songs to BBC Introducing. Praised by Variety magazine for her ""Olympic-level pop ability,external"", the 20-year-old's dark, moody ballads will appeal to fans of Lorde and Maggie Rogers. Multi-instrumentalistAlfie Templemanis another BBC Introducing graduate, and his easy-going indie pop feels destined for daytime radio. The 17-year-old started making music by banging pots and pans in his family kitchen in Bedfordshire, inspired by a televised Rush concert. After mastering the saucepans, he taught himself another 10 instruments, including guitar, violin, harmonica and bass. Alfie Templeman describes his music as ""colourful sugary disco pop"" Girl In Red,meanwhile has built up a huge fanbase with songs that reflect on boredom, depression and making sense of her sexuality. After scoring a viral hit with her first ever song, I Wanna Be Your Girlfriend, the singer, whose real name is Marie Ulven, was called ""a teenage queer icon for queer teenagers,external"". But she is looking forward to a day when her sexuality won't be a talking point. ""We need queer art to make it normal,""she told the New York Times,external. ""We need protagonists who are just, like, living their best life and gay - that's just part of their character."" Other nominees included hotly-tipped MCDutchavelli, the younger brother of rapper Stefflon Don; and soul poetBerwyn, whose evisceratingly candid ballads draw on his experiences of homelessness and neglect. To be eligible, musicians must not have been the lead artist on a UK top 10 album, or more than one top 10 single, by 30 October 2020. Artists who have appeared on TV talent shows within the last three years are also ineligible. The top five will be revealed in the New Year on BBC Radio 1 and BBC News, with one artist announced each day from Sunday 3 January until the winner is unveiled on Thursday 7 January. Last year's winner Celeste had plans for her debut album delayed by the pandemic, but has slowly built up her profile through buzzworthy singles like Stop This Flame and Little Runaway. She was also chosen to record the song for this year's John Lewis Christmas advert - becoming the first singer ever to record an original song for the retailer's festive campaign. Her debut album, Not Your Muse, will now come out in February. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

"This video can not be played George Eustice: ""There is still a deal to be done... the end of last week was quite a setback"" The UK and EU have resumed talks on post-Brexit trade, with a minister telling the BBC there is ""still a deal to be done"" despite time running short. Environment Secretary George Eustice said ""sticking points"" on fishing and business rules remained. UK chief negotiator Lord Frost is taking part in discussions with EU counterpart Michel Barnier in Brussels. EU sourcestold the BBC,externalan agreement on fishing was close but a No 10 source said there had been ""no breakthrough"". The UK government source told the BBC on Sunday evening: ""Nothing new has been achieved on this today."" A senior EU diplomat told the BBC that fishing ""was definitely not the issue the talks are stuck on"". The diplomat added there was still a dispute over what measures there should be to ensure a ""level playing field"" for businesses on both sides and how to enforce agreed standards. Ireland's foreign minister has said it is ""in everybody's interest"" to reach an agreement soon. Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU if a trade deal is not reached and ratified by the end of the year. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: What is a level playing field? Vaccine rollout 'ready' for any Brexit outcome Mr Eustice told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""There's still a deal to be done, but there's no denying that the end of last week was quite a setback."" He added: ""The sticking points remain - quite fundamental ones. We've been clear all along that we can only do an agreement if it respects our sovereignty."" Mr Eustice also said: ""I think we probably are now in the final few days in terms of deciding whether there can be an agreement."" After receiving instructions from their respective corners, the two chief negotiators embarked on what could be one of the final rounds of this increasingly bruising encounter. On Sunday evening, several EU diplomats told the BBC the two sides were close to resolving their disagreements over EU access to UK fishing waters. But a British government source said nothing new had been achieved. If fishing were to be resolved it would still leave competition rules - including future government subsidies - and the policing of a deal as the remaining two hurdles to clear. Each has the potential to derail the process. First thing Monday morning, Michel Barnier will brief ambassadors from the 27 member states. The last time he did so, he was warned by a handful of anxious countries against giving ground to the British at the final moment and France announced it would veto a bad deal. Arriving in Brussels, Lord Frost said: ""We're working very hard to try and get a deal. We're going to see what happens in negotiations today."" Sunday's meeting follows talks between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday. In a joint statement,externalafterwards they said fishing rights, competition rules and how any deal would be enforced were still causing problems, and that ""no agreement is feasible if these issues are not resolved"". They have agreed to talk again on Monday evening. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months Talks are on again:The UK and the EU have until 31 December to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes What happens next with Brexit? Speaking to Ireland's Sunday Independent newspaper,Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said:,external""We are more likely to get a deal than not because I think it's in everybody's interest."" He added that reports the EU had hardened its negotiating stance at France's behest were inaccurate. But Mr Eustice said revised demands from the bloc on fishing rights last week meant talks had ""gone backwards"". He added the UK was ""asking for a normal type of trade agreement such as the one [the EU] put together with Canada"" and that this was ""really not too much to ask"". The EU wants this deal. A no-deal scenario would be costly for EU businesses - a nightmare for European fishing communities, largely dependent on access to UK waters. So the German car industry and others must be lobbying EU governments hard to use these two extra days of talks to finally seal the deal, right? Wrong. The UK government isn't the only one briefing that no deal ""is better than a bad deal"". EU countries that do most trade with the UK, like France, the Netherlands and Belgium, say that too. This week they piled the pressure on those representing them in negotiations not to give ""too much"" away. France threatens to use its veto, while Germany speaks softly of red lines and compromise. The tone is different; the message the same. The EU priority is to protect its single market in a deal with the UK. It insists the government must sign up to ""fair competition rules"" and an agreed method to enforce them, before it gets better access to the single market than any other non-EU country not closely aligned to the bloc. During this last-minute negotiating push, EU governments say they're mindful not to sign up to a deal in a panicked rush. If push comes to shove, they say, they prefer the short-term pain of no deal, in order to protect their longer-term interests: not exposing their businesses to what they view as unfair competition in their own single market. But EU fingers are tightly crossed a compromise can still be found. Mr Barnier tweeted after Saturday's statement was published, saying: ""We will see if there is a way forward."" But, even if the two sides agree a deal, there are still obstacles to overcome. Any agreement will need to be turned into legal text and translated into all EU languages, then ratified by the European Parliament. The UK government is likely to introduce legislation implementing parts of any deal reached, which MPs will be able to vote on. For Labour, shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves told the Andrew Marr Show the government ""has to deliver"" a deal but her party would ""have to see the content"" before backing or rejecting it. The 27 EU national parliaments could also need to ratify an agreement - depending on the actual contents of the deal. And on Monday, the UK Internal Market Bill will return to the House of Commons. Certain clauses could allow the government to break international law, by overriding elements of the original treaty with the EU for Brexit - the withdrawal agreement. The EU is unhappy with it, as is the House of Lords, which voted to scrap those clauses of the bill. But the government is still backing its measures, which could cause tensions in the trade talks, and it is expected to push them through the Commons on Monday night. The Taxation (Post-Transition Period) Bill - which contains more powers to break the legal requirements of the withdrawal agreement - will also return to the Commons this week.

"The European Commission head and PM Boris Johnson had a long phone conversation on Monday evening The UK government has said talks with the EU on reaching a post-Brexit trade deal have reached a ""critical stage"". With time running out, the two sides are still arguing over fishing rights and business competition rules. Boris Johnson and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen have been discussing the state of negotiations - their second phone call in 48 hours. The EU mood was described as ""gloomy"", while the UK said it was still ""working to get"" an agreement in place. If a deal is not reached and ratified by 31 December, the UK and EU could introduce import charges on each other's goods. Live: PM and EU chief talk as trade negotiations continue UK signals possible changes to bill in Brexit row Pound sinks as UK-EU talks enter 'critical stage' The phone call between the UK prime minster and European Commission president is reported to have lasted for 90 minutes, but neither side has yet to release a statement on what was discussed. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK counterpart Lord Frost are still locked in talks. Cabinet Office minister Penny Mordaunt told the House of Commons: ""We are at a critical moment in the negotiations."" She added: ""We are all working to get a deal, but the only way that's possible is if it's compatible with our sovereignty and takes back control of our country's trade and waters."" The UK was prepared to walk away from negotiations if the EU could not ""find compromises"", Ms Mordaunt said. Asked when the cut-off point for a deal was, a European Commission spokesman said: ""We are not going to speculate on a last-chance date. ""We are fully committed to substantial negotiations. We've always said and continue to say it's the substance that prevails over timing."" Earlier, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney described the EU negotiating team's frame of mind as ""gloomy"" and ""downbeat"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months Talks are on again:The UK and the EU have until 31 December to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes What happens next with Brexit? The EU is warning that, without ongoing access to UK waters for its fleets, UK fishermen will no longer have special access to EU markets to sell their goods. But the UK argues that what goes on in its own waters should be under its control as a sovereign country. Brexit: What is a level playing field? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: Will the borders be ready? Vaccine rollout 'ready' for any Brexit outcome The UK and EU are also at loggerheads over the so-called""level playing field""- a set of shared rules and standards to ensure businesses in one country do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors in others. Brussels wants the UK to adhere to EU rules on workers' rights, environmental regulations and state aid, but the UK says the goal of Brexit is to break free from following common rules and reassert national sovereignty. And the two sides disagree on how any future trading disputes should be resolved. The UK's Lord Frost is in Brussels for the negotiations If the EU and UK reach a deal, it will have to be turned into legal text and translated into all EU languages, then ratified by the European Parliament by 31 December. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What happens if there's a no-deal Brexit? The deadline also applies to the UK government, which is likely to introduce legislation implementing parts of any deal reached, which MPs would vote on. The 27 EU national parliaments may also need to ratify an agreement, depending on the contents of the deal. Later on Monday, theUK Internal Market Billwill return to the House of Commons. It could allow the government to break international law, by overriding elements of its original Brexit treaty with the EU, known as the withdrawal agreement. The EU is unhappy with this, as is the House of Lords,which voted to scrap key parts in the bill. The government is expected to put those measures back in the bill, in the Commons on Monday evening. But in what is being seen as an ""olive branch"" to the EU, the UK government has put out a statement saying it will drop the most controversial parts of the Internal Market Bill - those that would break international law - if a trade deal is done. The Taxation (Post-Transition Period) Bill, which contains more powers to break the legal requirements of the withdrawal agreement, will also return to the Commons this week. And on Thursday, EU leaders will meet in Brussels for a two-day summit where they could sign off a deal, if the two sides can reach an agreement by then.
