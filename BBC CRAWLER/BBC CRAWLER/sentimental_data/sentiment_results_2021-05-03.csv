"There is a ""good chance"" the 1m plus social distancing rule can be scrapped on 21 June in England, the prime minister has said. Boris Johnson said the results of the vaccine rollout are ""really starting to show up in the epidemiology"" - but any change would depend on the data. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer agreed that caution was necessary. Mr Johnson also suggested there could be some""opening up"" of foreign travel on 17 May. During a campaign visit to Hartlepool the prime minister said ministers would say more about travel ""as soon as we can"" but ""we have got to be very, very tough"". He said that ""the way things are going"" with the vaccine rollout, the 1m plus rule - which allows people to be 1m apart if they take extra precautions such as wearing face coverings - could end when England reaches the final step of itsroadmap out of lockdown. Mr Johnson said 50 million doses of coronavirus vaccine have been administered. That includes more than 34 million people who have had a first dose and more than 15 million who have had a second, according tothe latest government figures.,external He said he felt as though the next stage of reopening on 17 May - which covers indoor hospitality, entertainment and possibly foreign travel - would ""be good"". ""I think we have got a good chance of being able to dispense with the 1m plus from 21 June,"" he added. ""That is still dependent on the data, we can't say it categorically yet. We have got to look at the epidemiology as we progress, we have got to look at where we get to with the disease. But that's what it feels like to me right now."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said any easing of social distancing measures would have to be ""cautious and careful"". ""All of us want to see the restrictions eased but also want to make sure we don't go into another lockdown,"" he said. ""I will listen to what scientists say - there are a number of weeks to run until 21 June. I hope we get to situation we can ease restrictions but have got to be led by science."" Are we are on the brink of beating the virus? Talk of foreign travel and the end of social distancing raises the very real prospect we are. It would be foolish to say, categorically, this is it. Even with the continued successful rollout of the vaccination programme, there is still scope for the virus to spread, given the jabs are not 100% perfect and not everyone will get vaccinated. Variants could also still cause problems - although there is plenty of evidence to suggest these will be more limited than sometimes seems to be the case. Experts remain confident that even if the mutations help the virus dodge some of the immune response from the vaccines, the jabs will still be very effective at preventing serious illness. So while the virus is not going away (cases are certainly going to rise again) the risk it poses has been dramatically reduced. And that means our response to it can be, too, so some of the non-Covid harms of the past year can really start to be tackled. In Scotland,the government timetable,externalfor lifting Covid restrictions suggests physical distancing will be in place beyond ""Level 0"" - the lowest level of curbs - currently expected from late June. In Wales, where ""alert level 3"" restrictions are in place, even its lowest alert level 1 suggests people should still observe ""social distancing rules with people you do not live with or who are not in your exclusive extended household"". The Northern Ireland Executivehas described,externalsocial distancing as part of the ""personal responsibility to protect ourselves and others"" that could be required ""for some time"". The British Beer and Pub Association said the prime minister's comments offered the sector ""hope of a return to normality and viability"". Chief executive Emma McClarkin said: ""Given pubs are financially unviable under the current restrictions they face, being able to reopen without any restrictions at all from 21 June is going to be vital to their survival."" She added: ""Our recovery only begins when the restrictions are removed."" Speaking before Mr Johnson's comments, Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UKHospitality, said recommencing unrestricted trading on 21 June would be ""critical"" and would allow companies to ""come off life support"". ""We urge the government to confirm reopening dates and these plans at the earliest opportunity, which will boost confidence and allow companies to step up planning and bring staff back,"" she said.

THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters VACCINE:When will I get the jab? Asked about international travel, Mr Johnson said experts were assessing which countries were safe. ""We do want to do some opening up on 17 May, but I don't think the people of this country want to see an influx of disease from anywhere else,"" he said. ""I certainly don't and we have got to be very, very tough and have got to be as cautious as we can whilst we continue to open up."" Mr Johnson's comments came aftera group of MPs called on the government to keep travel rulesin England in place beyond mid-May. Foreign holidays are currently banned, but a traffic light system of rules will be introduced with countries classed as green, amber or red. Travellers to green countries will not need to isolate on their return, but they will need to take a Covid test. Arrivals from amber countries will need to quarantine, while red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals allowed to return and they must pay to stay in a government quarantine hotel. Further details are expected this week, after the government said it will ""set out by early May"" how countries will be categorised. Many in the travel industry are hopeful for holidays this summer, while countries such asSpain,France,Greece,external,Portugal and Cyprusare preparing to open to tourists. The European Commission has also recommendedopening up to travellers who have received both doses of the vaccine. The boss of Thomas Cook earlier told the BBC he expected many popular destinations, particularly in Europe, to be open to UK holidaymakers this summer as they were making ""great progress"". The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have previously argued that 17 May would be too early for foreign holidays to resume, and no date has yet been set for rules to be relaxed. Northern Ireland'sexecutive has not said anythingabout when it expects to make an announcement. But a representative from the travel industry in Scotland has said any plan needs to be agreed between the four nations. ""There's no way it's going to work [with] Scotland operating a different system to England when you can freely travel across the border and fly out of an English airport - and that's exactly what will happen,"" said Alan Glen, from the Scottish Passenger Agents Association. The next stage of England's lockdown easing is expected in a fortnight, on 17 May. As well as the possibility of international travel, people will be able to meet in groups of up to 30 outdoors, while six people or two households can meet indoors.

"Hospitality bosses have lost a legal challenge for a faster reopening for indoor dining in England. The High Court ruled in favour of the government after a case was brought by Punch Taverns founder Hugh Osmond, and Sacha Lord, the night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester. Pubs and restaurants were allowed to reopen - but only outdoors - on 12 April, along with non-essential shops. Mr Lord said they were disappointed by the outcome. Mr Lord and Mr Osmond argued there was no justification or scientific basis for hospitality to be kept closed for five weeks, after retailers in England were allowed to serve customers indoors from mid-April. Mr Lord said: ""While this fight has always been an uphill battle... we are pleased that the case has shone a light on the hospitality sector and the unfair and unequal guidance within the recovery roadmap."" ""Despite the outcome, we will continue to hold the government to account and demand evidence-based decisions, rather than those drafted without detailed analysis or based on bias or whim."" Hospitality bosses threaten government with court Restaurants and pubs are reopening, but what are the rules? The government has insisted the lockdown easing must be cautious if it is to be irreversible, adding that it will driven by ""data and not dates"". A date - 17 May - has been set as the next stage for relaxing restrictions in England. Pubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors. In Scotland, pubs and restaurants are already allowed to open indoors until 20:00 - but alcohol can only be served to those seated outside. It is hoped venues in Wales will be able to open indoors on 17 May. In Northern Ireland, hospitality may reopen on 24 May. The hospitality bosses pointed to recent findings by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which suggested that the hospitality sector was associated with a relatively low risk of Covid-19 transmission, although it was slightly higher than leisure and retail. In statement, the two men also expressed disappointment that the call for faster reopening dates was described as ""academic"". Mr Osmond, a former director of Pizza Express, said: ""This case is not 'academic' for an industry that is losing Â£200m every day it remains closed, for the over three million people who work in our industry, or for the tens of thousands of businesses, suppliers, landlords and contractors forced into bankruptcy by Government measures."" The sector has been one of the worst-affected by coronavirus shutdowns. Trade body UK Hospitality warned recently that about that Â£2bn in rent is owed by hospitality businesses with 40% of premises still currently negotiating over unpaid rent with landlords. About 20 to 30% are still in talks over how to settle debts from 2020 lockdowns, it said, calling for the government to step in as a ban on evictions for commercial tenants and business rates holidays end. A UK government spokesperson said: ""Our roadmap sets out a cautious approach to easing restrictions, based on the best scientific evidence available at the time. We published a full range of scientific papers alongside it, on 22 February."" ""It is widely acknowledged that the risk of transmission outdoors is significantly less than indoors, which is why businesses have already been able to open in some outdoor settings, ahead of indoor hospitality later this month,"" they said. They added that the government has provided support to the sector through schemes such as the Restart Grant scheme, the furlough scheme and VAT cuts. About 750,000 business in ""hospitality and other sectors"" had benefitted from business rates relief, they said.

"People enjoy La Concha beach in San SebastiÃ¡n, northern Spain, last month Prime Minister Boris Johnson has indicated there will be some ""opening up"" of foreign travel on 17 May - but said it was important to be cautious. More details are expected this week to confirm when and how international travel will restart in England. Speaking on Monday, the PM said ""we'll be saying more as soon as we can"" but ""we have got to be very, very tough"". He also said there was a ""good chance"" of the one-metre plus social distancing rule being scrapped on 21 June. He stressed any decision on changing the rules was dependent on the data. On Monday, Public Health England reported 1,649 new cases alongside a single death within 28 days of a positive test across the UK. The recorded number of daily deaths is often lower at weekends and on bank holidays due to delays in reporting. Fifty million doses of coronavirus vaccine had now been administered across the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed. Mr Johnson was speaking after a group of MPs called on the government to keep travel rules in place beyond mid-May. Theall-party parliamentary group on coronavirus said,externalarrival halls in airports risked becoming a ""breeding ground"" for the virus. The group of more than 60 MPs and peers said the government should discourage people from travelling abroad unless it was essential. EU unveils plans for overseas tourists to return Can I go on a foreign holiday this summer? What are the vaccine passport plans for summer holidays? Foreign holidays are currently banned, but a traffic light system of rules is going to be introduced with countries classed as green, amber or red. Travellers to green countries will not need to isolate on their return, but they will need to take a Covid test. Arrivals from amber countries will need to quarantine, while red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals allowed to return and they must pay to stay in a government quarantine hotel. Further details are expected this week, after the government said it will ""set out by early May"" how countries will be categorised. Mr Johnson was asked about holidays during a visit to Hartlepool, Teesside, and said experts were currently assessing which countries were safe. ""But I do think that it's important to be cautious in this,"" he said. ""We do want to do some opening up on 17 May but I don't think the people of this country want to see an influx of disease from anywhere else. ""I certainly don't and we have got to be very, very tough and have got to be as cautious as we can whilst we continue to open up."" Asked whether people should be planning their summer holidays, Mr Johnson said: ""We'll be saying more as soon as we can. ""I think that there will be some openings up on the 17th but we have got to be cautious, we have got to be sensible, we have got to make sure we don't see the virus coming back in."" He added that ""we have got a good chance of being able to dispense with the one-metre plus from 21 June"" - but it was dependant on the data. Many in the travel industry are hopeful for holidays this summer, while countries such asSpain,France,Greece,external,Portugal and Cyprusare preparing to open to tourists.

""When the holidays proper start at the end of June, we are expecting most of the countries that the UK goes on holiday to - Europe particularly - to be open,"" said Alan French. ""We are expecting Portugal, Spain, Greece, Croatia and so forth to be open; it would be nice if Turkey was open."" Mr French also said his company had noticed many people were booking holidays as larger groups since they had not seen their families and friends in such a long time. This video can not be played EU plans for a 'vaccine passport' to allow travel The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have previously argued that 17 May would be too early for foreign holidays to resume, and no date has yet been set for rules to be relaxed.

""What we can't have is a repeat of last summer, where the lists were chopping and changing on a daily or even weekly basis,"" he said. According to the all-party group of MPs who want the government to slow down with the reopening of foreign travel, airports should be made safer to make sure arrival halls have enough space for social distancing and to separate travellers coming from higher-risk countries. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, who chairs the group of MPs , said ""the model we have right now has too many holes [and] is too risky"". ""It is staggering that the government is even contemplating encouraging overseas holidays when airports are already struggling to keep the virus and new variants at bay,"" she said. The group also wants stricter checks on Covid test certificates, after the trade union representing border staff said officials spot around 100 fake Covid test certificates a day. This video can not be played Chris Gentile said his coach company is one of many choosing to delay foreign trips A government spokesperson said the traffic light system would allow the UK to manage the risk from different countries.

"The Covid pandemic has led to the loss of about 660,000 jobs in the UK's hospitality sector this year, the industry's trade body has told MPs. UK Hospitality chief Kate Nicholls said that at the end of 2019, the sector was the third-largest employer in the UK. The industry was forecast to generate one-in-six net new jobs this year, she said, but instead some 20% of the sector's 3.2 million jobs had gone. Hospitality sector revenue is down 40% compared with last year, she said. Ms Nicholls said businesses should be enjoying a ""golden"" time of year, since more than a third of annual revenue is usually earned between Halloween and New Year's Eve. But instead she said the sector was in ""intensive care"" and called for pubs and restaurants to be able to open with as few restrictions as safely possible in December. âPubs and restaurants facing jobs cliff edgeâ London rules 'put 250,000 hospitality jobs at risk' Pub chain Wetherspoon sees first loss since 1984 Business leaders from a range of industries were giving evidence to the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Committee of MPs. The boss of the British Retail Consortium, Helen Dickinson OBE, said there had been job losses across big and small retailers, particularly in clothing and footwear stores. ""I spoke to one business yesterday who has seen their turnover fall from $200m to $160m. They are on their third round of redundancies,"" she said. Clothing and footwear stores have been hit particularly hard Earlier, the chair of the BEIS Committee, Darren Jones, said it was unfair that some big retailers were able to keep trading during lockdown, while many small shops were closed. Speaking to BBC 5 Live's Wake Up To Money programme, Mr Jones said: ""It's evidently unfair that some retailers can sell everything and others cannot sell anything at all."" He said it was ""unfortunate"" ministers had been unable to set out a mechanism for retailers to continue to operate in a Covid-secure way during lockdown, while other countries such as Germany had done so. Supermarkets' greeting card sales 'grossly unfair' Are big retailers exploiting lockdown loopholes? The Labour MP also called for more financial support to go to businesses forced to close, and criticised some supermarkets - which have stayed open during lockdowns - for accepting public money for help with business rates. ""Christmas is the most important time of the year for retailers and we don't just want them to survive the Christmas shopping period but to be able to survive into the new year,"" he said. ""Ministers need to quickly be able to get to a position where they can allow retailers to operate in a Covid-secure way.""

"Mr Johnson previously met with the Prime Minister of India at the 2019 G7 summit The prime minister has announced new trade and investment deals with India worth Â£1bn. It includes more than Â£533m of new investment from India into the UK, which is expected to create about 6,000 jobs. Downing Street said the new partnership would ""pave the way"" for a future UK-India Free Trade Agreement. ""The economic links between our countries make our people stronger and safer,"" said Mr Johnson. The deal, announced ahead of a virtual meeting with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, includes a Â£240m investment by the Serum Institute of India, which will support clinical trials, research and possibly the manufacturing of vaccines. Serum has already started phase one trials in the UK of a one-dose nasal vaccine for coronavirus, in partnership with Codagenix. What trade deals has the UK done so far? Boris Johnson to visit India in bid to boost trade ties Indian investment deals will create 1,000 new UK jobs each at health and tech firms Infosys, HCL Technologies and Mphasis. Some 667 UK jobs will be created at Q-Rich Creations, 500 jobs at Wipro and 465 at 12 Agro. ""Each and every one of the more than 6,500 jobs we have announced today will help families and communities build back from coronavirus and boost the British and Indian economies,"" said Mr Johnson. Trade Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC that the jobs would be created ""within the next year or so"". She said those commitments were ""very different"" from a free-trade deal, which the two governments will start negotiating on this autumn. Discussions will include lowering tariff barriers and new agreements on ""digital and data"". The announcement on 6,000 jobs ""is really the tip of an iceberg"" Ms Truss said. Trade between the UK and India is worth about Â£23bn per year, and the government hopes to double that by 2030. ""What we need to do is get the huge tariffs removed on products like whisky, which is over 100%; cars, which is over 100% - that is where the real opportunities lie for us,"" she said. The do that, the UK is likely to have to relax immigration rules between India and the UK, Ms Truss added. ""We've already made significant steps in improving the immigration regime with the post-study work visa. We've seen a massive rise in Indian students coming to the UK."" ""Business mobility is a key part of trade. Particularly as the UK and India are both very strong in services, you need to make sure you're able to get your professionals over to the country,"" Ms Truss added. In recent years, the UK has sold more to Belgium or Sweden than India. But the government hopes that closer ties with one of the most populous and fastest-growing major economies could have huge long-term potential - especially as tensions with China mount. It believes that this announcement, which boosts access to India for producers of British fruit and medical devices - and means investment in the UK from India's vaccine producers - is just a taste of what could be achieved. But economists warn that getting a full deal with Delhi that lowers tariff and non-tariff barriers won't be easy. India is likely, for example, to want UK entry visa requirements for its workers and students to be eased. Attempts by the European Union, Australia and New Zealand to strike free trade deals with India have all stalled. But as that nation grapples with the economic damage caused by the pandemic and the rising threat from China, it may now take a more pragmatic approach to brokering an agreement. Meanwhile, British businesses have secured export deals with India worth more than Â£446m, which are expected to create more than 400 British jobs. They include a Â£200m deal involving CMR Surgical, which will create 100 new UK jobs. The company's next-generation 'Versius' surgical robotic system - which helps surgeons perform minimal access surgery - will be rolled out to hospitals in India. Trade between the UK and India is already worth around Â£23bn a year, supporting more than half a million jobs, according to the government. Mr Johnson said: ""In the decade ahead, with the help of new partnership signed today and a comprehensive free trade agreement, we will double the value of our trading partnership with India and take the relationship between our two countries to new highs."" Trade body the CBI said the updated trade partnership ""shows the world the strength of our relationship"". CBI president Lord Bilimoria said the talks would ""unlock opportunities for businesses, boost job creation and growth across the country"". Mr Johnson had been forced to cancel a planned visit to Delhi as it battles with a brutal second wave of coronavirus cases. The visit was designed to foster closer ties between the two countries and had first been scheduled for January. It was delayed after the UK's higher wave of Covid infections over winter. A four-day trip was scheduled for April before being cut back to just one day in Delhi, before being postponed indefinitely last month, with India subsequently added to the UK's travel ""red list"". On Monday, authorities in Delhi called for helpfrom the army. The government wants it to run Covid care facilities and intensive care units. Across India, case numbers since the start of the outbreak are closing in on 20 million. In response to India's coronavirus surge, the British Asian Trust has raised more than Â£1.6m in the last week through its emergency appeal. What trade deals has the UK done so far?

"German authorities said the platform had more than 400,000 users German police have arrested three men and a fourth is being held in Paraguay for allegedly running one of the world's biggest online networks for sharing images of child sex abuse. The international operation, involving several police forces, targeted a dark net platform called Boystown, which has now been taken down. Officials say Boystown had more than 400,000 registered users. They say some images showed the most serious sexual abuse of young children. The dark net is an internet area beyond the reach of mainstream search engines. The German-led investigation involved law enforcement agencies in the Netherlands, Sweden, Australia, the US and Canada. TheEU police agency Europol says,externalit will also examine intelligence gained from the operation, and ""more arrests and rescues are to be expected globally"" on that basis. Several related paedophile chat sites on the dark net were also dismantled, Europol says. German police say three men detained since mid-April are believed to have run the paedophile network: one aged 40 from Paderborn, one aged 49 from the Munich area and a 58-year-old from north Germany who has been living in South America for several years. He was detained in Paraguay's ConcepciÃ³n region under an international arrest warrant, and German authorities have asked for his extradition. The fourth suspect is a 64-year-old from Hamburg who was allegedly one of the most active members, responsible for more than 3,500 posts. The dark web is a notorious layer of the web that many people never see. You won't find its pages on mainstream search engines such as Google - you'll need a specialised web browser like Tor to access it at all. Once you're in, if you know how to look, you'll find all sorts of activity. The dark web itself is not illegal and neither is being on it. Indeed it is used by some for whistleblowing and activism in parts of the world where censorship is rife and such behaviour is heavily punished. But there is plenty of material on it that is absolutely outside of the law. There are forums where harrowing images of child sexual abuse and other extreme explicit content is shared or traded. In the many illegal marketplaces you'll also find banned drugs and weapons for sale. Anonymous sellers spring up as quickly as they disappear. Payment is generally in cryptocurrency and there are no consumer rights or customer support here if the merchant - or indeed the entire store - suddenly vanishes. It happens, and it's not unusual. That's in part because law enforcement is getting better targeting at these operations. I've met several experts who specialise in tracking illegal traders across the dark web - and, much like all criminals, cyber criminals also make mistakes.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Michelle Fleury breaks down the story of Bill and Melinda Gates' relationship Bill and Melinda Gates have announced their divorce after 27 years of marriage, saying ""we no longer believe we can grow together as a couple"". ""After a great deal of thought and a lot of work on our relationship, we have made the decision to end our marriage,"" the pair tweeted. They first met in the 1980s when Melinda joined Bill's Microsoft firm. The billionaire couple have three children and jointly run the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The organisation has spent billions fighting causes such as infectious diseases and encouraging vaccinations in children. Bill and Melinda Gates: A life in pictures The Bill Gates âmicrochipâ claim fact-checked Solving Covid easy compared with climate - Gates The Gates - along with investor Warren Buffett - are behind the Giving Pledge, which calls on billionaires to commit to giving away the majority of their wealth to good causes. Bill Gates, 65, is the fourth wealthiest person in the world, according to Forbes, and is worth $124bn (Â£89bn). The couple - pictured here in 2018 - have given billions to charity He made his money through the firm he co-founded in the 1970s, Microsoft, the world's biggest software company. The pair both posted the statement announcing their divorce on Twitter. ""Over the last 27 years, we have raised three incredible children and built a foundation that works all over the world to enable all people to lead healthy, productive lives,"" it read. ""We continue to share a belief in that mission and will continue our work together at the foundation, but we no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in the next phase of our lives. ""We ask for space and privacy for our family as we begin to navigate this new life."" Their 25-year-old daughter, Jennifer Gates, wrote on Instagram: ""It's been a challenging stretch of time for our whole family. I'm still learning how to best support my own process and emotions"". Melinda, now 56, joined Microsoft as a product manager in 1987, and the two sat together at a business dinner that year in New York. They began dating, but as Bill told a Netflix documentary: ""We cared a lot for each other and there were only two possibilities: either, we were going to break up or we were going to get married."" Melinda said she found Bill - methodical it seems even in matters of the heart - writing a list on a whiteboard with the ""pros and the cons of getting married"". They got married in 1994 on the Hawaiian island of Lanai, reportedly hiring all the local helicopters to stop unwanted guests flying over. Bill stepped down from Microsoft's board last year to focus on his philanthropic activities. The couples who split in the pandemic The couple established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000 in Seattle The foundation focuses primarily on public health, education and climate change Its grants included some $1.75bn to vaccine initiatives and research during the Covid-19 pandemic In 2019, the foundation had net assets of more than $43bn Bill and Melinda Gates pumped more than $36bn into the foundation between 1994 and 2018 Source: Reuters news agency While the pair may branch off into separate charity initiatives, analysts say the work of the Gates Foundation is likely to continue. ""They have built this from the ground up, over the last 20 years, they share a deep commitment to it,"" US author and journalistDavid Callahan told the BBC World Service. ""The work of the foundation is likely to go on. This is not some small family foundation that's going to fall apart because a marriage is falling apart,"" he said. ""Bill and I are equal partners,"" she told the Associated Press in an interview in 2019. ""Men and women should be equal at work."" In her recent memoir The Moment of Lift, she wrote about her childhood, life and private struggles as the wife of a famous figure and and stay-at-home mother with three kids. Barack Obama awarded Bill and Melinda Gates the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016 for their charity work Working together at the foundation had made their relationship better, she argued. ""He's had to learn how to be an equal, and I've had to learn how to step up and be an equal,"" she wrote. Apart from her work with the foundation she founded Pivotal Ventures, an investment company focused on women and families, in 2015. ""The world is finally waking up to the fact that none of us can move forward when half of us are held back,"" she said at the time. ""The data is clear: empowered women transform societies.""

"This video can not be played Watch the best shots as Mark Selby beat Shaun Murphy to win the snooker World Championship Mark Selby claimed his fourth World Championship title with an 18-15 victory over Shaun Murphy at a sold-out Crucible Theatre. Selby, who led 14-11 prior to the final session, is now three Crucible crowns off Stephen Hendry's record of seven. Runs of 66, 68 and a superb 120 helped him break Murphy's resistance in a high-quality encounter. Selby, 37, collects Â£500,000 in prize money and moves up to second in the world behind Judd Trump. Selby not chasing records of 'all-time greats' Relive how Selby won his fourth world title 'Goosebumps time' - fans buzzing as Crucible hosts capacity crowd Full tournament results and prize money Having been perched at the top of the world rankings during the period in which he claimed three world titles in four years, Selby's dominance once looked unquestionable. And while those days appeared to have gone, his return to form under Chris Henry, who also coaches Murphy, and the quality of his all-round game suggests he is more than capable of continuing to win snooker's biggest prizes. Now level with Scotland's John Higgins on four, only Hendry (seven), Ronnie O'Sullivan, Steve Davis and Ray Reardon (all six) have won more world titles than Selby in the modern era. And while he is now likely to turn his attention to usurping Trump, Selby's 20th major ranking title also cements his place among the greats in Triple Crown events - equalling Higgins' tally of nine, placing him behind only Davis, Hendry and O'Sullivan. ""To win it once against Ronnie O'Sullivan for the first time was a dream come true - to win it four times is something I could only have dreamed of,"" Selby said on BBC Two. ""Every time you get to a world final you always try your hardest - it's such a tough tournament to get there and you never know whether it's going to be your last. ""My aim is to get back to world number one. You still have goals in your career. I'm going in the right direction."" With the coach of both players Henry an intrigued spectator, Selby had earlier maintained his control of the match in Monday afternoon's session. This video can not be played 'The Crucible roar like never before!' - capacity crowd for final The concluding sessions of the Championship marked a notable sporting milestone with a capacity crowd returning to a major UK sporting event for the first time since March 2020. And as well as adding a semblance of normality, the 980 fans brought a return of the Crucible roar and added to the nervous tension, particularly when Murphy threatened an improbable comeback - turning thoughts towards a first final-frame decider since Peter Ebdon's 18-17 win over Hendry in 2002 - with back-to-back centuries. With Selby on the verge of victory at 17-13, Murphy clawed himself back to 17-15 with a superb show of under-pressure potting, but a missed red down the left cushion when well placed ended his hopes of adding to his 2005 title. This video can not be played Watch the conclusion to an entertaining last frame at the World Snooker Championship ""Mark is super-granite, unfortunately for me,"" Murphy said on BBC Two. ""I started well but he went into super-hard mode. He broke me last night with that three-frame lead which was a tough lead to give him in a match of this calibre. ""Life has been difficult for everybody over the last 12 months but I want to say a very deep and personal thank you for every one of you who has bought a ticket over the last 17 days. ""Sport is nothing without fans and we've been thrilled to have everyone back and a full house tonight. It's been very tough for me this year with the travel restrictions but you've brought me back."" As well as the consolation of a runners-up cheque worth Â£200,000 and a Â£15,000 prize for the tournament's top break of 144 in his second-round clash with Yan Bingtao, Murphy can leave Sheffield with his head held high. Elaine Murphy had expressed her pride in her husband in a BBC interview earlier on Monday and those sentiments are likely to be shared by fans who were delighted by the raw emotion he showed at times as well as his attacking style.

"Boris Johnson visited Barry Island on his visit to south Wales on Bank Holiday Monday Boris Johnson has accused Welsh Labour of ""separatism"" on a Bank Holiday Monday visit to Wales. The UK prime minister was campaigning in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, as parties began the last week of the Welsh Parliament election campaign. Mr Johnson said voters wanted to see politicians working together to beat the pandemic. But Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford it was Mr Johnson who was encouraging support for Welsh independence. On a visit to Swansea, Wales' first minister said there would be a mandate for more powers in Cardiff if voters backed a majority supporting more devolution. Meanwhile, Plaid Cymru said a pro-independence government in Wales would have more leverage over Westminster. Voters go to the polls in the Senedd elections on Thursday. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Mr Drakeford, who has been Welsh Labour leader since 2018, is opposed to independence, unlike Plaid Cymru's Adam Price who has made it a key part of his campaign. Both parties also argue for more issues in Wales to be in the control of ministers in Cardiff rather than London, such as policing and justice. ""I don't think the people of this country are obsessing right now about further constitutional change,"" Mr Johnson, who was visiting the Conservative party office in Barry town centre, told BBC Wales. ""I think what they want to see is politicians working together to beat the pandemic."" The prime minister said he was a ""believer in devolution"" but he wanted to see ""people using their powers effectively"". But he added that both Plaid Cymru and Labour ""are obsessed with the constitutional issues, trying to go for more separatism. I don't think that's the right way forward."" ""I think we should be working together,"" he said. ""I think we should have a situation which people can be proudly emphatically Welsh, but also see the merits and the beauty of doing things together."" Mark Drakeford visited the site of Swansea Arena Mr Drakeford said there could be a mandate for further powers to come to Cardiff if a pro-devolution majority is returned to the Senedd after the election. ""It could well be that they will be a majority of voters in Wales supporting parties who want to see devolution strengthened and entrenched,"" he said. ""And that's a message that the UK government really will need to heed. ""I often think that the prime minister is the greatest recruiting sergeant for people who believe that Wales will be better off outside the United Kingdom. ""I hope the prime minister would act in ways that reinforce those of us who make the positive case for the union rather than undermining us"". Asked about his remarks captured in a S4C documentary when he called the PM""awful""after a Cobra meeting, Mr Drakeford said: ""My views of the prime minister are a good deal kinder than many people who have worked in Downing Street with him"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price was campaigning in Ystrad Mynach on Monday Meanwhile, Mr Price, Plaid's leader since 2018, said the Welsh government would have ""greater leverage"" in London if it was led by a pro-independence party. ""That's exactly what we will get from the election of a Plaid Cymru government,"" he said. ""A strong Welsh Government with a strong voice able to negotiate a far better deal than anything we've seen under a Labour government over the last 22 years."" Mr Price, who was campaigning in Ystrad Mynach in the constituency of Caerphilly, said there had been ""one economic plan"" from Welsh Labour. ""It's all been about just looking to salvation from companies coming in from outside, that's not going to build the economic foundation for the future. ""We've got to shift the focus from just relying on foreign-owned companies coming in for a while - we've got to invest in our own homegrown businesses. Welsh Labour said this was a ""false choice"". Mr Drakeford added: ""I absolutely think that we need to invest in indigenous companies and to grow indigenous companies that then stay rooted here in Wales. ""But a Labour government is never going to turn our back on people who want to come and invest in Wales from elsewhere."" Jane Dodds, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, spent the day campaigning in the Wrexham area of north Wales. She said her party had a ""big message"" on Covid recovery in the final few days of the campaign and that was putting the economy, mental health and the planet ""first"". The Liberal Democrats had one Senedd seat at the last election. Its former occupant, Brecon and Radnorshire's Kirsty Williams, isquitting the Welsh Parliament after 22 years. Ms Dodds denied that her party was facing a fight for survival in mid-Wales. ""Every single vote important,"" she said, ""it doesn't matter where it is.""

"Mr Johnson previously met with the Prime Minister of India at the 2019 G7 summit The prime minister has announced new trade and investment deals with India worth Â£1bn. It includes more than Â£533m of new investment from India into the UK, which is expected to create about 6,000 jobs. Downing Street said the new partnership would ""pave the way"" for a future UK-India Free Trade Agreement. ""The economic links between our countries make our people stronger and safer,"" said Mr Johnson. The deal, announced ahead of a virtual meeting with India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, includes a Â£240m investment by the Serum Institute of India, which will support clinical trials, research and possibly the manufacturing of vaccines. Serum has already started phase one trials in the UK of a one-dose nasal vaccine for coronavirus, in partnership with Codagenix. What trade deals has the UK done so far? Boris Johnson to visit India in bid to boost trade ties Indian investment deals will create 1,000 new UK jobs each at health and tech firms Infosys, HCL Technologies and Mphasis. Some 667 UK jobs will be created at Q-Rich Creations, 500 jobs at Wipro and 465 at 12 Agro. ""Each and every one of the more than 6,500 jobs we have announced today will help families and communities build back from coronavirus and boost the British and Indian economies,"" said Mr Johnson. Trade Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC that the jobs would be created ""within the next year or so"". She said those commitments were ""very different"" from a free-trade deal, which the two governments will start negotiating on this autumn. Discussions will include lowering tariff barriers and new agreements on ""digital and data"". The announcement on 6,000 jobs ""is really the tip of an iceberg"" Ms Truss said. Trade between the UK and India is worth about Â£23bn per year, and the government hopes to double that by 2030. ""What we need to do is get the huge tariffs removed on products like whisky, which is over 100%; cars, which is over 100% - that is where the real opportunities lie for us,"" she said. The do that, the UK is likely to have to relax immigration rules between India and the UK, Ms Truss added. ""We've already made significant steps in improving the immigration regime with the post-study work visa. We've seen a massive rise in Indian students coming to the UK."" ""Business mobility is a key part of trade. Particularly as the UK and India are both very strong in services, you need to make sure you're able to get your professionals over to the country,"" Ms Truss added. In recent years, the UK has sold more to Belgium or Sweden than India. But the government hopes that closer ties with one of the most populous and fastest-growing major economies could have huge long-term potential - especially as tensions with China mount. It believes that this announcement, which boosts access to India for producers of British fruit and medical devices - and means investment in the UK from India's vaccine producers - is just a taste of what could be achieved. But economists warn that getting a full deal with Delhi that lowers tariff and non-tariff barriers won't be easy. India is likely, for example, to want UK entry visa requirements for its workers and students to be eased. Attempts by the European Union, Australia and New Zealand to strike free trade deals with India have all stalled. But as that nation grapples with the economic damage caused by the pandemic and the rising threat from China, it may now take a more pragmatic approach to brokering an agreement. Meanwhile, British businesses have secured export deals with India worth more than Â£446m, which are expected to create more than 400 British jobs. They include a Â£200m deal involving CMR Surgical, which will create 100 new UK jobs. The company's next-generation 'Versius' surgical robotic system - which helps surgeons perform minimal access surgery - will be rolled out to hospitals in India. Trade between the UK and India is already worth around Â£23bn a year, supporting more than half a million jobs, according to the government. Mr Johnson said: ""In the decade ahead, with the help of new partnership signed today and a comprehensive free trade agreement, we will double the value of our trading partnership with India and take the relationship between our two countries to new highs."" Trade body the CBI said the updated trade partnership ""shows the world the strength of our relationship"". CBI president Lord Bilimoria said the talks would ""unlock opportunities for businesses, boost job creation and growth across the country"". Mr Johnson had been forced to cancel a planned visit to Delhi as it battles with a brutal second wave of coronavirus cases. The visit was designed to foster closer ties between the two countries and had first been scheduled for January. It was delayed after the UK's higher wave of Covid infections over winter. A four-day trip was scheduled for April before being cut back to just one day in Delhi, before being postponed indefinitely last month, with India subsequently added to the UK's travel ""red list"". On Monday, authorities in Delhi called for helpfrom the army. The government wants it to run Covid care facilities and intensive care units. Across India, case numbers since the start of the outbreak are closing in on 20 million. In response to India's coronavirus surge, the British Asian Trust has raised more than Â£1.6m in the last week through its emergency appeal. What trade deals has the UK done so far?

"Hospitality bosses have lost a legal challenge for a faster reopening for indoor dining in England. The High Court ruled in favour of the government after a case was brought by Punch Taverns founder Hugh Osmond, and Sacha Lord, the night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester. Pubs and restaurants were allowed to reopen - but only outdoors - on 12 April, along with non-essential shops. Mr Lord said they were disappointed by the outcome. Mr Lord and Mr Osmond argued there was no justification or scientific basis for hospitality to be kept closed for five weeks, after retailers in England were allowed to serve customers indoors from mid-April. Mr Lord said: ""While this fight has always been an uphill battle... we are pleased that the case has shone a light on the hospitality sector and the unfair and unequal guidance within the recovery roadmap."" ""Despite the outcome, we will continue to hold the government to account and demand evidence-based decisions, rather than those drafted without detailed analysis or based on bias or whim."" Hospitality bosses threaten government with court Restaurants and pubs are reopening, but what are the rules? The government has insisted the lockdown easing must be cautious if it is to be irreversible, adding that it will driven by ""data and not dates"". A date - 17 May - has been set as the next stage for relaxing restrictions in England. Pubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to serve customers indoors. In Scotland, pubs and restaurants are already allowed to open indoors until 20:00 - but alcohol can only be served to those seated outside. It is hoped venues in Wales will be able to open indoors on 17 May. In Northern Ireland, hospitality may reopen on 24 May. The hospitality bosses pointed to recent findings by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which suggested that the hospitality sector was associated with a relatively low risk of Covid-19 transmission, although it was slightly higher than leisure and retail. In statement, the two men also expressed disappointment that the call for faster reopening dates was described as ""academic"". Mr Osmond, a former director of Pizza Express, said: ""This case is not 'academic' for an industry that is losing Â£200m every day it remains closed, for the over three million people who work in our industry, or for the tens of thousands of businesses, suppliers, landlords and contractors forced into bankruptcy by Government measures."" The sector has been one of the worst-affected by coronavirus shutdowns. Trade body UK Hospitality warned recently that about that Â£2bn in rent is owed by hospitality businesses with 40% of premises still currently negotiating over unpaid rent with landlords. About 20 to 30% are still in talks over how to settle debts from 2020 lockdowns, it said, calling for the government to step in as a ban on evictions for commercial tenants and business rates holidays end. A UK government spokesperson said: ""Our roadmap sets out a cautious approach to easing restrictions, based on the best scientific evidence available at the time. We published a full range of scientific papers alongside it, on 22 February."" ""It is widely acknowledged that the risk of transmission outdoors is significantly less than indoors, which is why businesses have already been able to open in some outdoor settings, ahead of indoor hospitality later this month,"" they said. They added that the government has provided support to the sector through schemes such as the Restart Grant scheme, the furlough scheme and VAT cuts. About 750,000 business in ""hospitality and other sectors"" had benefitted from business rates relief, they said.

Addressing thousands of fully vaccinated guests at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, Prince Harry praised the efforts of front line workers during the pandemic. ""Tonight is a celebration of each of you here, the vaccinated frontline workers in the audience and the millions of frontline heroes around the world,"" he said. Selena Gomez hosted the event, calling for ""doses and dollars"" to go to the world's poorest countries ""You spent the last year battling courageously and selflessly to protect us all. You served and sacrificed, put yourselves in harm's way, and acted with bravery, knowing the costs. We owe you an incredible debt of gratitude. Thank you."" It was the duke's first public appearance sincethe funeral of his grandfather, Prince Philip on 17 April. His wife the Duchess of Sussex, who is pregnant, stayed at home. The couple are campaign chairs of Vax Live, organised by anti-poverty group Global Citizen. US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden also appeared at the concert in a pre-recorded video.

""Tonight, we stand in solidarity with the millions of families across India, who are battling a devastating second wave,"" he said. ""The virus does not respect borders, and access to the vaccine cannot be determined by geography."" Vax Live is calling on governments to commit to vaccine equity by donating doses and resources. The event raised $53.8 million (Â£38.8 million) forCovax, which is working to to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations, rich and poor. Organisers said it was enough to help purchase almost 10.3 million vaccine doses. More than one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have now been administered worldwide. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world, with some countries having delivered doses to a large proportion of their population and others still waiting for their first shipments to arrive.

"Delhi hospitals are struggling to cope with huge numbers of Covid patients The authorities in the Indian capital Delhi have called for help from the army as the city grapples with a brutal second wave of Covid-19 cases. Hospitals in the city are in crisis, with intensive care beds full and an acute shortage of medical oxygen. Delhi's government wants the army to run Covid care facilities and intensive care units. Across India, case numbers since the start of the outbreak are closing in on 20 million. India's Covid crisis: Your questions answered Deadly second wave spreads from cities to small towns Backlash after China Weibo post mocks India Covid crisis The country has seen more than 300,000 new cases a day for nearly two weeks straight while deaths stand at 220,000. Experts say total Covid cases and deaths in India are likely to be much higher, citing lack of testing and patients dying at home without being seen by doctors. Delhi, which this weekend reported record daily deaths at more than 400, wants the army to run medical care with oxygen facilities for around 10,000 patients, and a further 1,000 intensive care units. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that with healthcare ""overwhelmed... it will be a timely help to the people of Delhi if the Ministry of Defence, with the considerable resources at its command, is tasked with the responsibility to provide and man the additional Covid health facilities"". He also asked for ""urgent"" help transporting much-needed oxygen. India has already ordered its army to send its oxygen from army reserves to hospital while retired military medical personnel have been called up to help. This video can not be played The BBC's Yogita Limaye reports from a hospital in Delhi, which like others is facing oxygen shortages Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has repeatedly said that the city is not getting enough oxygen from the federal government, which allocates oxygen quotas to states. But federal officials deny there are shortages, saying the challenge has come from transportation. India produces thousands of tonnes of oxygen a day, but some experts say the supply crunch comes from a lack of investment in distribution networks. Delhi hospitals have resorted to sending SOS messages on social media to secure supplies. For residents, hours spent in queues to top up portable canisters have become part of daily life. Hospitals plead for oxygen as more patients die ""It's a battle we are fighting every day,"" said Dr Gautam Singh, who runs the Shri Ram Singh hospital. ""Half of my hospital staff are on the road with cylinders to get them filled every day, going from one place to another."" There are severe strains outside of the capital too. In the southern state of Karnataka, 24 people died in one hospital, but the government there has denied reports that all of them died due to a shortage of oxygen. India's Covid crisis has been compounded by a sluggish vaccination campaign. Despite being the world's biggest producer of vaccines, there is a shortage of supplies. Since January, just over 10% of India's 1.4 billion people have had one dose and only about 2% two doses. Much of India's population is still awaiting a vaccine The chief executive of India's Serum Institute, the world's biggest vaccine manufacturer,has warned shortages will last for months.,external Adar Poonawalla told the Financial Times the institute had been unfairly maligned over the lack of supplies. He had not boosted capacity earlier, he said, because ""there were no orders, we did not think we needed to make more than 1bn doses a year"".

"The G7 group of nations is to agree a new target of sending 40 million more girls from low and middle income countries to school within five years. Foreign ministers will use a London summit to commit to helping women in developing countries with a $15bn (Â£10.8bn) two-year package of support. At their first in-person meeting for two years, they will also agree to help 20 million more girls read by age 10. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said educating girls was a smart investment. He added that the new targets would help ensure 12 years of continuous education for young women and transform ""the fortunes not just of individuals, but whole communities and nations"". Charities have welcomed the pledge - but said it was at odds with the UK's decision to cut its overseas aid spending. The UK government announced last year it would cut UK aid spending from 0.7% of national income to 0.5% - a reduction of more than Â£4bn. It has yet to confirm which programmes will be affected. ""We know the reality of these aid cuts,"" said Gwen Hines from Save the Children. ""Life-changing, life-saving support [is] being pulled from families in the middle of a pandemic from schooling, medicine and food. ""I just don't see how that is global leadership at a time when the UK is hosting the G7 summit."" UK to host seaside G7 summit in summer G7 'should finance global vaccine scheme' What is the G7 and what does it do? The UK holds the rotating presidency of the G7 group, which also includes the US, France, Germany, Canada, Japan and Italy, and will host a summit of leaders in Cornwall next month. Mr Raab will meet US Secretary of State Antony Blinken later to discuss trade, Iran and China, as part of a three-day meeting of G7 foreign ministers in London. The collective agreement on girls' education, which will be formally signed on Wednesday and also includes the EU, aims to put ""gender equality at the heart of global co-operation to build back better"" from Covid, the government said. Women make up more than two-thirds of the world's 796 million illiterate people, according to the United Nations. The UN said 39% of girls in rural areas attend secondary school worldwide - fewer than rural boys (45%), urban girls (59%) and urban boys (60%). It was estimated that, before the pandemic worsened education outcomes, 90% of children in low income countries were unable to read a simple text by age 10. As part of the funding, there will be renewed support for women-led businesses, and for products or services that particularly benefit women and support their empowerment. The government said the G7 nations would also ""recommit to collective action to defend and protect sexual and reproductive health and rights for all"" and ""scale up gender-based violence prevention and elimination"". The G7 announcement comes amid criticism over the UK's cut to aid spending. The Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) has been accusedof going back on a promiseto continue funding for UN family planning projects aimed at helping women and girls. The UN Population Fund - which helps provide contraceptives and maternal health care for millions of women - said the UK pledged Â£154m for its projects, but then said it would instead receive about Â£23m. It has also been criticised for the timing of a planned cut in bilateral fundingfor clean water and sanitation projects. Annette Zera, who works for an education charity helping girls working as domestic servants in Bangladesh, said the aid authorities ""have just let us down"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that their project ""is going to have to stop"" because it will no longer receive the grant it expected. Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said ""there will always be, sadly, individual projects we are not able to support"". ""We are experiencing a once in a 300-year - the worst in 300 years - economic contraction as a direct result of coronavirus,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme as he defended the cuts. ""We have to make the decisions in keeping with those economic circumstances."" He said the UK remained one of the world's leading aid donors and that the reduction in aid spending to 0.5% of national income would be ""temporary"".

World Health Organisation to discuss whether to include two Chinese vaccines -
Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines - in the Covax global vaccine distribution
programme. Chinese state broadcaster CGTN says the outcome of these meetings is expected to be announcedâby the end of next weekâ,external. If these vaccines are approved, they will be the
first from a non-Western country to gain approval from the international health
body. This would significantly boost Chinaâs role as a
distributor of vaccines globally, but it is worth noting that China has already
played a key role internationally by donating vaccines to countries it
considers friendly allies. According to a CGTN map, 67 countries and
regionshave already received or are actively using,externalChinese vaccines as part of
their vaccine programme. Sinovac and Sinopharm have been slow to reach
this stage of potentially gaining approval, because of concerns âover efficacy

Boris Johnson said more details will come this week on how and when international travel from England can take place. He stressed it was important to be cautious however, adding: ""We have got to be very, very tough."" It comes as a group of MPs called on the government to keep travel rules in place beyond mid-May. Theall-party parliamentary group on coronavirus said,externalairports were a ""breeding ground"" for the virus, with arrivals mixing together even if they had travelled from green, amber or red countries. The group of more than 60 MPs and peers said the government should discourage people from travelling abroad unless it is essential. There have been over 4.4 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 127,000 people have died, government figures show.

Delhi's deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on average they were getting around 25,000 new cases a day. BBC World Service South Asia editor Anbarasan Ethirajan says: ""The urgent appeal from the Delhi authorities came as several hospitals said they were struggling to admit new patients as they were running short of supplies. ""They are requesting the army to immediately establish medical care with oxygen facilities for around 10,000 patients. The Supreme Court has also instructed the federal government to supply medical oxygen to Delhi hospitals by tonight.""

""All we can do is try to reduce the delays - and the sad reality is that we need to see... a large increase in the number of staff who can actually check these documents,"" he says. And he warns that - even as restrictions remain in place - there has been an increase in the number of forged documents used to prove a negative Covid test at the border. ""If you're going to do border security you have to actually invest in border security... if you're going to do it properly you have to round the whole circle you can't just do parts of it. ""The moment you get a delay people start to mingle, and the 2m gap goes out the window.

Chinese media today is full of videosshowing crowds of people at popular tourist sites,externallike the Great Wall, Tienanmen Square, and the Hangzhou West Lake. Many people can be seen wearing masks, but it is not mandatory. Many sites have made it a precondition that visitors show negative results for a Covid-19 test before arriving. And people in China are generally confident there is limited risk of an outbreak, given the country has not reported any new, domestic-transmitted cases for a number of days. NHS workers at Walesâ largest hospital are creating a woodland to offset the carbon emissions and waste that came from the machines needed to treat patients with Covid-19.

During his campaign visit to Hartlepool, the prime minister said that, ""as things stand, and the way things are going"" with the vaccine, distancing could well end with the final step of England's roadmap out of lockdown. ""You are seeing the results of that really starting to show up in the epidemiology,"" he said. ""I think that we will be able to go ahead, feels like 17 May is going to be good. ""But it also looks to me as though 21 June we'll be able to say social distancing as we currently have to do it, the one-metre plus, I think we have got a good chance of being able to dispense with the one-metre plus from 21 June. ""That is still dependent on the data, we can't say it categorically yet. We have got to look at the epidemiology as we progress. We have got to look at where we get to with the disease.

"People enjoy La Concha beach in San SebastiÃ¡n, northern Spain, last month Prime Minister Boris Johnson has indicated there will be some ""opening up"" of foreign travel on 17 May - but said it was important to be cautious. More details are expected this week to confirm when and how international travel will restart in England. Speaking on Monday, the PM said ""we'll be saying more as soon as we can"" but ""we have got to be very, very tough"". He also said there was a ""good chance"" of the one-metre plus social distancing rule being scrapped on 21 June. He stressed any decision on changing the rules was dependent on the data. On Monday, Public Health England reported 1,649 new cases alongside a single death within 28 days of a positive test across the UK. The recorded number of daily deaths is often lower at weekends and on bank holidays due to delays in reporting. Fifty million doses of coronavirus vaccine had now been administered across the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed. Mr Johnson was speaking after a group of MPs called on the government to keep travel rules in place beyond mid-May. Theall-party parliamentary group on coronavirus said,externalarrival halls in airports risked becoming a ""breeding ground"" for the virus. The group of more than 60 MPs and peers said the government should discourage people from travelling abroad unless it was essential. EU unveils plans for overseas tourists to return Can I go on a foreign holiday this summer? What are the vaccine passport plans for summer holidays? Foreign holidays are currently banned, but a traffic light system of rules is going to be introduced with countries classed as green, amber or red. Travellers to green countries will not need to isolate on their return, but they will need to take a Covid test. Arrivals from amber countries will need to quarantine, while red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals allowed to return and they must pay to stay in a government quarantine hotel. Further details are expected this week, after the government said it will ""set out by early May"" how countries will be categorised. Mr Johnson was asked about holidays during a visit to Hartlepool, Teesside, and said experts were currently assessing which countries were safe. ""But I do think that it's important to be cautious in this,"" he said. ""We do want to do some opening up on 17 May but I don't think the people of this country want to see an influx of disease from anywhere else. ""I certainly don't and we have got to be very, very tough and have got to be as cautious as we can whilst we continue to open up."" Asked whether people should be planning their summer holidays, Mr Johnson said: ""We'll be saying more as soon as we can. ""I think that there will be some openings up on the 17th but we have got to be cautious, we have got to be sensible, we have got to make sure we don't see the virus coming back in."" He added that ""we have got a good chance of being able to dispense with the one-metre plus from 21 June"" - but it was dependant on the data. Many in the travel industry are hopeful for holidays this summer, while countries such asSpain,France,Greece,external,Portugal and Cyprusare preparing to open to tourists. The European Commission has also recommendedopening up to travellers who have received both doses of the vaccine. The boss of Thomas Cook earlier told the BBC he expected many popular destinations, particularly in Europe, to be open to UK holidaymakers this summer as they were making ""great progress"". ""When the holidays proper start at the end of June, we are expecting most of the countries that the UK goes on holiday to - Europe particularly - to be open,"" said Alan French. ""We are expecting Portugal, Spain, Greece, Croatia and so forth to be open; it would be nice if Turkey was open."" Mr French also said his company had noticed many people were booking holidays as larger groups since they had not seen their families and friends in such a long time. This video can not be played EU plans for a 'vaccine passport' to allow travel The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have previously argued that 17 May would be too early for foreign holidays to resume, and no date has yet been set for rules to be relaxed. Northern Ireland'sexecutive has not said anythingabout when it expects to make an announcement. But a representative from the travel industry in Scotland has said any plan needs to be agreed between the four nations. ""There's no way it's going to work [with] Scotland operating a different system to England when you can freely travel across the border and fly out of an English airport - and that's exactly what will happen,"" said Alan Glen, from the Scottish Passenger Agents Association. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he will ""wait and see"" what the government announces, but said: ""We need to be very careful."" ""What we can't have is a repeat of last summer, where the lists were chopping and changing on a daily or even weekly basis,"" he said. According to the all-party group of MPs who want the government to slow down with the reopening of foreign travel, airports should be made safer to make sure arrival halls have enough space for social distancing and to separate travellers coming from higher-risk countries. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, who chairs the group of MPs , said ""the model we have right now has too many holes [and] is too risky"". ""It is staggering that the government is even contemplating encouraging overseas holidays when airports are already struggling to keep the virus and new variants at bay,"" she said. The group also wants stricter checks on Covid test certificates, after the trade union representing border staff said officials spot around 100 fake Covid test certificates a day. This video can not be played Chris Gentile said his coach company is one of many choosing to delay foreign trips A government spokesperson said the traffic light system would allow the UK to manage the risk from different countries. ""We introduced robust border controls to stop coronavirus variants in their tracks and every essential check we've introduced for arrivals has strengthened our defences against new mutations."" The next stage of England's lockdown easing is expected in a fortnight, on 17 May. As well as the possibility of international travel, people will be able to meet in groups of up to 30 outdoors, while six people or two households can meet indoors.

"The continued peace in Northern Ireland is a credit to its people, the Queen has said. In a message to mark 100 years since the creation of NI, she called it ""a significant centenary for both the United Kingdom and Ireland"". ""This anniversary reminds us of our complex history,"" she said. She added that it provided ""an opportunity to reflect on our togetherness and our diversity"". Her message came exactly 100 years since the state was founded on 3 May 1921. Legislation wasenacted which created a border in Ireland for the first time,and led to its partition. The Queen also paid tribute to NI's ""rich mix of identities, backgrounds and aspirations"". She said political progress and the peace process were ""rightly credited to a generation of leaders who had the vision and courage to put reconciliation before division"". ""Above all, the continued peace is a credit to its people, upon whose shoulders the future rests,"" she added. She also acknowledged the contribution of ""our friends and closest neighbours"" towards peace in Northern Ireland. She recalled her visit with Prince Philip to Ireland ten years ago. Sending her warmest good wishes, she said: ""Across generations, the people of Northern Ireland are choosing to build an inclusive, prosperous, and hopeful society, strengthened by the gains of the peace process. ""May this be our guiding thread in the coming years."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson called it a ""very significant national anniversary"". Throughout this centenary year, the government would highlight all that is brilliant about Northern Ireland, he said on Twitter. From its ""world class fintech industry and research capabilities"" to its ""inspiring young people and its vibrant culture of arts and sport"". But he added that it was important to reflect on Northern Ireland's ""complex history"". ""People from all parts of Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, the United Kingdom and across the globe will approach this anniversary in different ways with differing perspectives,"" he said. Michael D Higgins said events of the past should be recalled in their ""factual setting"" Meanwhile, Irish President Michael D Higgins has urged caution about how the events on the island a century ago are interpreted. ""We have much, much more information. Take advantage of the new material that we have,"" he said in an interview for BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme. ""There are events that took place and, I think, they should be recalled in their factual setting as much as possible."" Brandon Lewis, who is the Northern Ireland Secretary, also said it was a time for reflection. Speaking to BBC News NI, Mr Lewis ruled out calling a border poll on Irish reunification in the near future. A 'proud to be British' poster displayed in shop window to mark the centenary Looking back on what happened on 3 May 1921, he said: ""It's not just the start of Northern Ireland as we know it, it's the start of the United Kingdom as we know it."" Mr Lewis said he recognised that there had been ""difficult periods"" in the past, and that people disagreed over the future. However, he added: ""A hundred years on, Northern Ireland is a beacon around the world with the Good Friday Agreement for how to reconcile, and have peace and prosperity and grow from what has been a troubled past in some part. ""I think there is a lot to be hugely proud of, not least of all when you look at the innovation and enterprise that's across Northern Ireland."" Historians declare 3 May as birthdate of N Ireland Who were the major players in 1920? NI's birthdate not marked by pomp or fanfare The BBC News NI website has a dedicated section marking the 100th anniversary of the creation of Northern Ireland and partition of the island. There are special reports on the major figures of the time and the events that shaped modern Ireland available atbbc.co.uk/ni100. Year '21:You can also explore how Northern Ireland was created a hundred years ago in the company of Tara Mills and Declan Harvey. Listen to the latestYear '21podcast onBBC Soundsor catch-up on previous episodes. Mr Lewis said at the moment people want the focus to be on ""getting the economy back into a position where it can grow and develop and deliver jobs"" as we come out of the pandemic. Asked if he believed Northern Ireland would still exist in another 100 years, he said: ""I think there will be a Northern Ireland in the years ahead. ""Northern Ireland's story is still in the making and what it has to offer the world is a phenomenal place to live, to work, to grow and spend time,"" he added. In a detailed statement, Colum Eastwood, leader of the Social Democrat and Labour Party (SDLP) called for an ""open and generous"" conversation about the constitutional future. Colum Eastwood said partition was an ""act of immense constitutional trauma"" ""I recognise and respect that for many people, Northern Ireland is a critical part of their identity and I absolutely want them to have the space to celebrate that,"" said the SDLP leader. ""But for many, partition was an act of immense constitutional trauma that severed relationships, economic opportunities and created a new state where sectarian discrimination was hardwired into the institutions of government. ""That's also why the experience of communities like mine, and of people like me, are critical to this story and should be heard."" The Northern Ireland Economy Minister, Diane Dodds of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said the centenary presented an opportunity to celebrate past achievements but also look to the future. ""From having a reputation as leaders in shipbuilding, rope works and linen mills over the past century, Northern Ireland is now established as a global leader in cyber security, fintech and advanced manufacturing,"" she said. The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Steve Aiken said the centenary was ""a time of pride, commemoration and hope for the future"". ""The achievements in science, industry, sport, the arts and so much more, has shown that our greatest asset, our people, have not only been influential in our nation of the United Kingdom but across all of these islands and across the globe."" UUP leader Steve Aiken said the centenary was a time of hope and pride He said the ""very real impact of terrorism must never be forgotten"" as it has driven many people away from Northern Ireland. ""That the scourge of sectarianism, of hatred and bigotry has blighted generations of our people, is a sad reflection,"" Mr Aiken said. ""I want to live in a Northern Ireland where our diaspora want to come back, to visit, to rekindle their links, to invest in, and to be proud of."" Official events to mark the centenary of Northern Irelandwill include a special post-mark, an inter-denominational church service and a plan to plant a tree at every school. The programme of events also includes an investment conference, a concert and a centenary rose.

"Boris Johnson visited Barry Island on his visit to south Wales on Bank Holiday Monday Boris Johnson has accused Welsh Labour of ""separatism"" on a Bank Holiday Monday visit to Wales. The UK prime minister was campaigning in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, as parties began the last week of the Welsh Parliament election campaign. Mr Johnson said voters wanted to see politicians working together to beat the pandemic. But Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford it was Mr Johnson who was encouraging support for Welsh independence. On a visit to Swansea, Wales' first minister said there would be a mandate for more powers in Cardiff if voters backed a majority supporting more devolution. Meanwhile, Plaid Cymru said a pro-independence government in Wales would have more leverage over Westminster. Voters go to the polls in the Senedd elections on Thursday. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Mr Drakeford, who has been Welsh Labour leader since 2018, is opposed to independence, unlike Plaid Cymru's Adam Price who has made it a key part of his campaign. Both parties also argue for more issues in Wales to be in the control of ministers in Cardiff rather than London, such as policing and justice. ""I don't think the people of this country are obsessing right now about further constitutional change,"" Mr Johnson, who was visiting the Conservative party office in Barry town centre, told BBC Wales. ""I think what they want to see is politicians working together to beat the pandemic."" The prime minister said he was a ""believer in devolution"" but he wanted to see ""people using their powers effectively"". But he added that both Plaid Cymru and Labour ""are obsessed with the constitutional issues, trying to go for more separatism. I don't think that's the right way forward."" ""I think we should be working together,"" he said. ""I think we should have a situation which people can be proudly emphatically Welsh, but also see the merits and the beauty of doing things together."" Mark Drakeford visited the site of Swansea Arena Mr Drakeford said there could be a mandate for further powers to come to Cardiff if a pro-devolution majority is returned to the Senedd after the election. ""It could well be that they will be a majority of voters in Wales supporting parties who want to see devolution strengthened and entrenched,"" he said. ""And that's a message that the UK government really will need to heed. ""I often think that the prime minister is the greatest recruiting sergeant for people who believe that Wales will be better off outside the United Kingdom. ""I hope the prime minister would act in ways that reinforce those of us who make the positive case for the union rather than undermining us"". Asked about his remarks captured in a S4C documentary when he called the PM""awful""after a Cobra meeting, Mr Drakeford said: ""My views of the prime minister are a good deal kinder than many people who have worked in Downing Street with him"". Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price was campaigning in Ystrad Mynach on Monday Meanwhile, Mr Price, Plaid's leader since 2018, said the Welsh government would have ""greater leverage"" in London if it was led by a pro-independence party. ""That's exactly what we will get from the election of a Plaid Cymru government,"" he said. ""A strong Welsh Government with a strong voice able to negotiate a far better deal than anything we've seen under a Labour government over the last 22 years."" Mr Price, who was campaigning in Ystrad Mynach in the constituency of Caerphilly, said there had been ""one economic plan"" from Welsh Labour. ""It's all been about just looking to salvation from companies coming in from outside, that's not going to build the economic foundation for the future. ""We've got to shift the focus from just relying on foreign-owned companies coming in for a while - we've got to invest in our own homegrown businesses. Welsh Labour said this was a ""false choice"". Mr Drakeford added: ""I absolutely think that we need to invest in indigenous companies and to grow indigenous companies that then stay rooted here in Wales. ""But a Labour government is never going to turn our back on people who want to come and invest in Wales from elsewhere."" Jane Dodds, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, spent the day campaigning in the Wrexham area of north Wales. She said her party had a ""big message"" on Covid recovery in the final few days of the campaign and that was putting the economy, mental health and the planet ""first"". The Liberal Democrats had one Senedd seat at the last election. Its former occupant, Brecon and Radnorshire's Kirsty Williams, isquitting the Welsh Parliament after 22 years. Ms Dodds denied that her party was facing a fight for survival in mid-Wales. ""Every single vote important,"" she said, ""it doesn't matter where it is.""

"Student Jamie Cross said the government, not universities, were to blame Frustrated at the impact of the pandemic on his studies, Jamie Cross took matters into his own hands. The Penarth film student has launched a campaign with friends to secure compensation for university students. With the value of tuition fees being questioned, some parties are promising to cut fees for certain students if they win the Welsh Parliament election. But this would put the viability of universities in doubt, a former vice-chancellor has warned. Jamie, 22, and fellow students in Bristol,launched Write Off Write Now (WORN)after what they say is an unfair decision to charge full fees for those studying remotely during lockdown, when in-person classes have been limited. ""If you're paying an awful lot of money for a service and they're not able to deliver it, people are going to start complaining,"" he said. ""If you're paying for wi-fi and the service you're getting is rubbish, you phone your provider and ask either for money back or for them to drastically improve the way they're performing, otherwise chances are you're going to leave that provider. I see universities exactly the same."" Should university students get a refund? University fees defended Student mental health suffering In England, students pay up to Â£9,250 a year. In Wales it's Â£9,000 though most students take up loans which are only repaid once their earnings reach a certain level. The UK and Welsh governments have previously rejected calls for blanket fee rebates. Historically a contentious political issue, tuition fees are in the spotlight again in this week's Senedd election due to the pandemic. Most higher-education learning remains online The Welsh Conservatives would introduce a compensation scheme for students whose courses have been disrupted over the past year. Beyond the pandemic, they would also halve fees for Welsh students studying science, technology, engineering or maths (STEM) and modern foreign languages at Welsh universities. They would also refund tuition fees for those who choose to work for at least five years in Wales as doctors, nurses or teachers after their studies. Plaid Cymru pledges to lower the maximum fee for students living in Wales and who study at Welsh universities to Â£7,500 - a step towards the long-term goal of making university education free. Neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats are offering to cut tuition fees. However, Welsh Labour says Wales has the most generous student support system anywhere in the UK, based on evidence that up-front living costs was the biggest barrier to young people going to university. The Lib Dems say plans to reduce tuition fees risk underfunding universities and that a system based on support for living costs, introduced by their education minister Kirsty Williams, has seen record numbers of disadvantaged pupils applying to university. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Former university vice-chancellor Professor Sir Deian Hopkin, a member of the Higher Education Commission, said those people calling for a cut in fees must consider how universities will be funded. ""Any discussion of reducing the income of universities, raises fundamental questions about their sustainability,"" he said. ""There has been concern about the level of debt that students incur and that's stimulated a debate about the level of fees in the future."" But he added there was ""no real evidence"" that the level of fees deter students from applying. ""So you have to ask, if students are quite content to accept this, what kind of provision do you make for them? What kind of support do you give them to justify those fees rather than reducing the fees themselves?"" Lowering tuition fees would encourage Welsh students to apply to Welsh universities, says Elain Gwynedd Elain Gwynedd, from Anglesey, is in her first year studying Welsh at Aberystwyth University - and the 18-year-old said lowering tuition fees would be attractive. ""It would definitely make more students want to stay in Wales if it was cheaper, but I know I wanted to come to Aberystwyth right from the start,"" she said. ""If someone told me, if you go to Liverpool it would be Â£7,500, I'd still want to go to Aber. ""It's a lot of money, but I would rather be happy somewhere I wanted to be, rather than somewhere that I didn't really want to go because it was cheaper."" Rhydian Cleaver fears students face a ""trade off"" between the cost and quality of education Rhydian Cleaver, 21, from Swansea, is a third-year politics student at London School of Economics. As a low-income student, he said fees were ""one of the key priorities"" for him, while also selecting a course with the best job prospects. What happens when the Welsh election is all over? How parties are targeting you on social media How do I vote in the Welsh election? But he felt many students faced a ""trade off"" between costs and the quality of education. ""I was able to get the security that I was at a university that was a little more tailored to what I wanted to do, maybe more competitive and offered things that weren't available in Wales,"" he said. NUS Wales President Becky Ricketts said education funding was ""unsustainable"" The president of the National Union of Students in Wales welcomed any discussion about tuition fees in this week's election. ""There is no reason why Wales can't take the lead on this, why Wales can't stand up and have a discussion around tuition fees and around the marketization of our education system,"" said Becky Ricketts. But she agreed that cuts to fees must go hand-in-hand with additional funding for institutions. ""There has to be a discussion around making sure universities don't lose out - making sure they are able to offer those courses to students"". Jamie said he could see the benefits of incentives to stay in Wales but felt STEM subjects should not be favoured over creative paths. ""We need to hold parties responsible for their promises and make sure no party creates empty incentives that try to win over the student vote then don't get delivered,"" he said.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People in Cambodia have received the Sinovac jab There are expected to be meetings today at the
World Health Organisation to discuss whether to include two Chinese vaccines -
Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines - in the Covax global vaccine distribution
programme. Chinese state broadcaster CGTN says the outcome of these meetings is expected to be announcedâby the end of next weekâ,external. If these vaccines are approved, they will be the
first from a non-Western country to gain approval from the international health
body. This would significantly boost Chinaâs role as a
distributor of vaccines globally, but it is worth noting that China has already
played a key role internationally by donating vaccines to countries it
considers friendly allies. According to a CGTN map, 67 countries and
regionshave already received or are actively using,externalChinese vaccines as part of
their vaccine programme. Sinovac and Sinopharm have been slow to reach
this stage of potentially gaining approval, because of concerns âover efficacy
and data transparencyâ,the South China Morning Post notes,external. A single death within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test has been reported in the UK on bank holiday Monday, Public Health England says. A further 1,649 new Covid cases were also recorded.

Foreign holidays are currently banned, but as we've reported today - they could potentially return as early as 17 May. A ""traffic light"" system of rules is being introduced and countries will be classed as green, amber or red - with green having the fewest restrictions and red the most. Details of a green list of countries, where quarantine won't be required when you return home, is being drawn up. But the PM says he doesn't want to risk the importation of variants. So when can you look forward to some guaranteed sunshine abroad?Read more here. There will be some foreign travel allowed in two weeks' time, the PM has said. Boris Johnson said more details will come this week on how and when international travel from England can take place. He stressed it was important to be cautious however, adding: ""We have got to be very, very tough."" It comes as a group of MPs called on the government to keep travel rules in place beyond mid-May. Theall-party parliamentary group on coronavirus said,externalairports were a ""breeding ground"" for the virus, with arrivals mixing together even if they had travelled from green, amber or red countries. The group of more than 60 MPs and peers said the government should discourage people from travelling abroad unless it is essential. There have been over 4.4 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 127,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. More than 50 million jabs have been given in the UK.

The government said the person was self isolating and their contacts had been informed. Surge testing in the area will be carried out for 10 days until 14 May.

Millions of Muslims around the world are currently observing Ramadan - but some mosques in the UK have not been allowing women inside to pray, citing coronavirus restrictions.

""In the classic beer tents at the big festivals, social distancing, masks and other measures are practically impossible to implement,"" he said after talks with Munich mayor Dieter Reiter. The Munich event usually attracts about six million visitors from around the world every year for the beer, sausages and music. Here's how some chose to honour the event in 2020 after its cancellation.

Community leaders say such abuse has increased dramatically since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

But campaigners and police agree many go unreported. A man being treated for Covid-19 being comforted by his daughter Authorities in the Indian capital Delhi have asked the army to set up Covid care facilities and intensive care units as the city grapples with the pandemic. Delhi's deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on average they were getting around 25,000 new cases a day. BBC World Service South Asia editor Anbarasan Ethirajan says: ""The urgent appeal from the Delhi authorities came as several hospitals said they were struggling to admit new patients as they were running short of supplies. ""They are requesting the army to immediately establish medical care with oxygen facilities for around 10,000 patients. The Supreme Court has also instructed the federal government to supply medical oxygen to Delhi hospitals by tonight."" Kevin Mills, of the Border Force officers' trade union PCS, has been telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme how his members will try to keep queues moving when international travel begins again. ""All we can do is try to reduce the delays - and the sad reality is that we need to see... a large increase in the number of staff who can actually check these documents,"" he says. And he warns that - even as restrictions remain in place - there has been an increase in the number of forged documents used to prove a negative Covid test at the border. ""If you're going to do border security you have to actually invest in border security... if you're going to do it properly you have to round the whole circle you can't just do parts of it. ""The moment you get a delay people start to mingle, and the 2m gap goes out the window. ""And you need to make sure they can socially distance, because sadly there'll be people in most arrivals who told porky pies, who haven't got the proper paperwork and haven't gone through all the checks.""

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Crowds at the Great Wall this weekend Itâs a public holiday in China from 1-5 May, and so this weekend tens of millions of people traveled across the country for the May Day holidays. Some 265 million passenger trips have been officially projected during this period, and according to the official Xinhua news agency, over the last two days,the number of passenger trips has exceeded pre-pandemic levels,externalandbroken records,external. Chinese media today is full of videosshowing crowds of people at popular tourist sites,externallike the Great Wall, Tienanmen Square, and the Hangzhou West Lake. Many people can be seen wearing masks, but it is not mandatory. Many sites have made it a precondition that visitors show negative results for a Covid-19 test before arriving. And people in China are generally confident there is limited risk of an outbreak, given the country has not reported any new, domestic-transmitted cases for a number of days. NHS workers at Walesâ largest hospital are creating a woodland to offset the carbon emissions and waste that came from the machines needed to treat patients with Covid-19.

During his campaign visit to Hartlepool, the prime minister said that, ""as things stand, and the way things are going"" with the vaccine, distancing could well end with the final step of England's roadmap out of lockdown. ""You are seeing the results of that really starting to show up in the epidemiology,"" he said. ""I think that we will be able to go ahead, feels like 17 May is going to be good. ""But it also looks to me as though 21 June we'll be able to say social distancing as we currently have to do it, the one-metre plus, I think we have got a good chance of being able to dispense with the one-metre plus from 21 June. ""That is still dependent on the data, we can't say it categorically yet. We have got to look at the epidemiology as we progress. We have got to look at where we get to with the disease.

"People enjoy La Concha beach in San SebastiÃ¡n, northern Spain, last month Prime Minister Boris Johnson has indicated there will be some ""opening up"" of foreign travel on 17 May - but said it was important to be cautious. More details are expected this week to confirm when and how international travel will restart in England. Speaking on Monday, the PM said ""we'll be saying more as soon as we can"" but ""we have got to be very, very tough"". He also said there was a ""good chance"" of the one-metre plus social distancing rule being scrapped on 21 June. He stressed any decision on changing the rules was dependent on the data. On Monday, Public Health England reported 1,649 new cases alongside a single death within 28 days of a positive test across the UK. The recorded number of daily deaths is often lower at weekends and on bank holidays due to delays in reporting. Fifty million doses of coronavirus vaccine had now been administered across the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed. Mr Johnson was speaking after a group of MPs called on the government to keep travel rules in place beyond mid-May. Theall-party parliamentary group on coronavirus said,externalarrival halls in airports risked becoming a ""breeding ground"" for the virus. The group of more than 60 MPs and peers said the government should discourage people from travelling abroad unless it was essential. EU unveils plans for overseas tourists to return Can I go on a foreign holiday this summer? What are the vaccine passport plans for summer holidays? Foreign holidays are currently banned, but a traffic light system of rules is going to be introduced with countries classed as green, amber or red. Travellers to green countries will not need to isolate on their return, but they will need to take a Covid test. Arrivals from amber countries will need to quarantine, while red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals allowed to return and they must pay to stay in a government quarantine hotel. Further details are expected this week, after the government said it will ""set out by early May"" how countries will be categorised. Mr Johnson was asked about holidays during a visit to Hartlepool, Teesside, and said experts were currently assessing which countries were safe. ""But I do think that it's important to be cautious in this,"" he said. ""We do want to do some opening up on 17 May but I don't think the people of this country want to see an influx of disease from anywhere else. ""I certainly don't and we have got to be very, very tough and have got to be as cautious as we can whilst we continue to open up."" Asked whether people should be planning their summer holidays, Mr Johnson said: ""We'll be saying more as soon as we can. ""I think that there will be some openings up on the 17th but we have got to be cautious, we have got to be sensible, we have got to make sure we don't see the virus coming back in."" He added that ""we have got a good chance of being able to dispense with the one-metre plus from 21 June"" - but it was dependant on the data. Many in the travel industry are hopeful for holidays this summer, while countries such asSpain,France,Greece,external,Portugal and Cyprusare preparing to open to tourists. The European Commission has also recommendedopening up to travellers who have received both doses of the vaccine. The boss of Thomas Cook earlier told the BBC he expected many popular destinations, particularly in Europe, to be open to UK holidaymakers this summer as they were making ""great progress"". ""When the holidays proper start at the end of June, we are expecting most of the countries that the UK goes on holiday to - Europe particularly - to be open,"" said Alan French. ""We are expecting Portugal, Spain, Greece, Croatia and so forth to be open; it would be nice if Turkey was open."" Mr French also said his company had noticed many people were booking holidays as larger groups since they had not seen their families and friends in such a long time. This video can not be played EU plans for a 'vaccine passport' to allow travel The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have previously argued that 17 May would be too early for foreign holidays to resume, and no date has yet been set for rules to be relaxed. Northern Ireland'sexecutive has not said anythingabout when it expects to make an announcement. But a representative from the travel industry in Scotland has said any plan needs to be agreed between the four nations. ""There's no way it's going to work [with] Scotland operating a different system to England when you can freely travel across the border and fly out of an English airport - and that's exactly what will happen,"" said Alan Glen, from the Scottish Passenger Agents Association. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he will ""wait and see"" what the government announces, but said: ""We need to be very careful."" ""What we can't have is a repeat of last summer, where the lists were chopping and changing on a daily or even weekly basis,"" he said. According to the all-party group of MPs who want the government to slow down with the reopening of foreign travel, airports should be made safer to make sure arrival halls have enough space for social distancing and to separate travellers coming from higher-risk countries. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, who chairs the group of MPs , said ""the model we have right now has too many holes [and] is too risky"". ""It is staggering that the government is even contemplating encouraging overseas holidays when airports are already struggling to keep the virus and new variants at bay,"" she said. The group also wants stricter checks on Covid test certificates, after the trade union representing border staff said officials spot around 100 fake Covid test certificates a day. This video can not be played Chris Gentile said his coach company is one of many choosing to delay foreign trips A government spokesperson said the traffic light system would allow the UK to manage the risk from different countries. ""We introduced robust border controls to stop coronavirus variants in their tracks and every essential check we've introduced for arrivals has strengthened our defences against new mutations."" The next stage of England's lockdown easing is expected in a fortnight, on 17 May. As well as the possibility of international travel, people will be able to meet in groups of up to 30 outdoors, while six people or two households can meet indoors.

Addressing thousands of fully vaccinated guests at the SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles, Prince Harry praised the efforts of front line workers during the pandemic. ""Tonight is a celebration of each of you here, the vaccinated frontline workers in the audience and the millions of frontline heroes around the world,"" he said. Selena Gomez hosted the event, calling for ""doses and dollars"" to go to the world's poorest countries ""You spent the last year battling courageously and selflessly to protect us all. You served and sacrificed, put yourselves in harm's way, and acted with bravery, knowing the costs. We owe you an incredible debt of gratitude. Thank you."" It was the duke's first public appearance sincethe funeral of his grandfather, Prince Philip on 17 April. His wife the Duchess of Sussex, who is pregnant, stayed at home.

Prince Harry also voiced support for India, which is in the midst ofa Covid crisis which has overwhelmed hospitals. ""Tonight, we stand in solidarity with the millions of families across India, who are battling a devastating second wave,"" he said. ""The virus does not respect borders, and access to the vaccine cannot be determined by geography."" Vax Live is calling on governments to commit to vaccine equity by donating doses and resources. The event raised $53.8 million (Â£38.8 million) forCovax, which is working to to ensure vaccines are shared fairly among all nations, rich and poor. Organisers said it was enough to help purchase almost 10.3 million vaccine doses. More than one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have now been administered worldwide.

"Google has failed to stop ""shyster"" websites advertising on its search engine, despite promising to fix the problem, the BBC has found. Adverts for unofficial services selling government documents such as travel permits and driving licences are against Google's own rules. But the BBC found adverts for expensive third-party sellers every time it searched during a 12-month period. In a statement Google said it had taken down billions of rule-breaking adverts. In the UK, changing the address on your driving licence is free - but Google consistently showed adverts for services charging Â£49.99. Applying for an Esta travel permit to visit the US should cost no more than $14 (Â£10) - but Google repeatedly allowed adverts for websites charging more than $80. In Google's search results, adverts look similar to organic results and appear at the top of the list. Websites like these are not illegal and customers may still get the documents for which they have applied. However, some of the companies charge more than five times the amount that the official websites do. ""They are not scams, they're shysters,"" said Martin Lewis, founder of the website Money Saving Expert. ""They're not stealing your money, they're charging you a fee for something that is completely pointless."" Some justify their prices by offering support to anybody struggling with an application. Advertising such services is against Google's own policies. In October 2018, theBBC brought several adverts to Google's attentionthat broke its rules. A month later, Google told the BBC it haddeveloped a machine learning systemthat could prevent the adverts appearing again. At the time, it only banned adverts for third-party services that charged more than the official government website. However, in May 2020it changed its policy,externalto ban ""adverts for documents and/or services that can be obtained directly from a government or a delegated provider"" including ""offers of assistance to obtain these products or services"". Since that change, the BBC has repeated the same set of Google searches on seven separate occasions over a 12-month period. Every time, there were adverts for expensive third-party services when searching for: Esta US Esta apply for Esta US visa Canada ETA (a travel document for Canada) apply for Canada ETA apply for Canada visa apply for Australia visa apply driving licence renew driving licence driving licence change address Some of the websites continued to appear in the adverts even after they were flagged to Google with its reporting tools. ""Machine learning is very good when you have a clear target in mind,"" said Prof Sandra Wachter, from the Oxford Internet Institute. But trying to catch rule-breakers is a game of ""cat and mouse"", as the companies can change their tactics and reappear. ""Consumers trust Google. There is an expectation that what is happening on Google is legitimate,"" said Prof Wachter. ""If they know there are certain problems out there, they need to take more precautions."" Facebook and Google 'failed to remove scam adverts' Suspected scam gadget store topped Google results Travel permit adverts are not the only ones slipping through Google's systems. Earlier in April, news websiteThis Is Money set up a fake online investment company,externaland was able to advertise it on Google. In May 2020, the BBC found a suspected scam store had topped Google's search and shopping results for weeks, encouraging customers to pay for tech via direct bank transfer. MyTechDomestic topped Google's search results Last week, the BBC found another fake gadget store at the top of Google's search results when customers were hunting for gadgets such as iPhone 12, Samsung S21 and Sony headphones. Google has since removed the store from its results. In a statement, Google said: ""We have strict policies that govern the types of ads and advertisers we allow on our platforms. We only allow governments or their delegated providers to advertise for official documents or services."" It said it used machine learning and human reviewers to spot problems, and had removed 3.1 billion adverts that violated its policies in 2020. In addition, it started to verify advertisers on its platforms in January 2021. ""When you use the major search engines including Google, you have to always look for the 'ad' label,"" said Mr Lewis. ""If there's a little box that says 'ad' on the left, the only reason they are where they are is because they have paid to be there.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People in Cambodia have received the Sinovac jab There are expected to be meetings today at the
World Health Organisation to discuss whether to include two Chinese vaccines -
Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines - in the Covax global vaccine distribution
programme. Chinese state broadcaster CGTN says the outcome of these meetings is expected to be announcedâby the end of next weekâ,external. If these vaccines are approved, they will be the
first from a non-Western country to gain approval from the international health
body. This would significantly boost Chinaâs role as a
distributor of vaccines globally, but it is worth noting that China has already
played a key role internationally by donating vaccines to countries it
considers friendly allies. According to a CGTN map, 67 countries and
regionshave already received or are actively using,externalChinese vaccines as part of
their vaccine programme. Sinovac and Sinopharm have been slow to reach
this stage of potentially gaining approval, because of concerns âover efficacy
and data transparencyâ,the South China Morning Post notes,external.

So when can you look forward to some guaranteed sunshine abroad?Read more here. There will be some foreign travel allowed in two weeks' time, the PM has said. Boris Johnson said more details will come this week on how and when international travel from England can take place. He stressed it was important to be cautious however, adding: ""We have got to be very, very tough."" It comes as a group of MPs called on the government to keep travel rules in place beyond mid-May. Theall-party parliamentary group on coronavirus said,externalairports were a ""breeding ground"" for the virus, with arrivals mixing together even if they had travelled from green, amber or red countries. The group of more than 60 MPs and peers said the government should discourage people from travelling abroad unless it is essential. There have been over 4.4 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK and more than 127,000 people have died, government figures show. However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. More than 50 million jabs have been given in the UK.

Delhi's deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on average they were getting around 25,000 new cases a day. BBC World Service South Asia editor Anbarasan Ethirajan says: ""The urgent appeal from the Delhi authorities came as several hospitals said they were struggling to admit new patients as they were running short of supplies. ""They are requesting the army to immediately establish medical care with oxygen facilities for around 10,000 patients. The Supreme Court has also instructed the federal government to supply medical oxygen to Delhi hospitals by tonight."" Kevin Mills, of the Border Force officers' trade union PCS, has been telling BBC Radio 4's World at One programme how his members will try to keep queues moving when international travel begins again. ""All we can do is try to reduce the delays - and the sad reality is that we need to see... a large increase in the number of staff who can actually check these documents,"" he says. And he warns that - even as restrictions remain in place - there has been an increase in the number of forged documents used to prove a negative Covid test at the border. ""If you're going to do border security you have to actually invest in border security... if you're going to do it properly you have to round the whole circle you can't just do parts of it. ""The moment you get a delay people start to mingle, and the 2m gap goes out the window.

"Student Jamie Cross said the government, not universities, were to blame Frustrated at the impact of the pandemic on his studies, Jamie Cross took matters into his own hands. The Penarth film student has launched a campaign with friends to secure compensation for university students. With the value of tuition fees being questioned, some parties are promising to cut fees for certain students if they win the Welsh Parliament election. But this would put the viability of universities in doubt, a former vice-chancellor has warned. Jamie, 22, and fellow students in Bristol,launched Write Off Write Now (WORN)after what they say is an unfair decision to charge full fees for those studying remotely during lockdown, when in-person classes have been limited. ""If you're paying an awful lot of money for a service and they're not able to deliver it, people are going to start complaining,"" he said. ""If you're paying for wi-fi and the service you're getting is rubbish, you phone your provider and ask either for money back or for them to drastically improve the way they're performing, otherwise chances are you're going to leave that provider. I see universities exactly the same."" Should university students get a refund? University fees defended Student mental health suffering In England, students pay up to Â£9,250 a year. In Wales it's Â£9,000 though most students take up loans which are only repaid once their earnings reach a certain level. The UK and Welsh governments have previously rejected calls for blanket fee rebates. Historically a contentious political issue, tuition fees are in the spotlight again in this week's Senedd election due to the pandemic. Most higher-education learning remains online The Welsh Conservatives would introduce a compensation scheme for students whose courses have been disrupted over the past year. Beyond the pandemic, they would also halve fees for Welsh students studying science, technology, engineering or maths (STEM) and modern foreign languages at Welsh universities. They would also refund tuition fees for those who choose to work for at least five years in Wales as doctors, nurses or teachers after their studies. Plaid Cymru pledges to lower the maximum fee for students living in Wales and who study at Welsh universities to Â£7,500 - a step towards the long-term goal of making university education free. Neither Labour nor the Liberal Democrats are offering to cut tuition fees. However, Welsh Labour says Wales has the most generous student support system anywhere in the UK, based on evidence that up-front living costs was the biggest barrier to young people going to university. The Lib Dems say plans to reduce tuition fees risk underfunding universities and that a system based on support for living costs, introduced by their education minister Kirsty Williams, has seen record numbers of disadvantaged pupils applying to university. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Former university vice-chancellor Professor Sir Deian Hopkin, a member of the Higher Education Commission, said those people calling for a cut in fees must consider how universities will be funded. ""Any discussion of reducing the income of universities, raises fundamental questions about their sustainability,"" he said. ""There has been concern about the level of debt that students incur and that's stimulated a debate about the level of fees in the future."" But he added there was ""no real evidence"" that the level of fees deter students from applying. ""So you have to ask, if students are quite content to accept this, what kind of provision do you make for them? What kind of support do you give them to justify those fees rather than reducing the fees themselves?"" Lowering tuition fees would encourage Welsh students to apply to Welsh universities, says Elain Gwynedd Elain Gwynedd, from Anglesey, is in her first year studying Welsh at Aberystwyth University - and the 18-year-old said lowering tuition fees would be attractive. ""It would definitely make more students want to stay in Wales if it was cheaper, but I know I wanted to come to Aberystwyth right from the start,"" she said. ""If someone told me, if you go to Liverpool it would be Â£7,500, I'd still want to go to Aber. ""It's a lot of money, but I would rather be happy somewhere I wanted to be, rather than somewhere that I didn't really want to go because it was cheaper."" Rhydian Cleaver fears students face a ""trade off"" between the cost and quality of education Rhydian Cleaver, 21, from Swansea, is a third-year politics student at London School of Economics. As a low-income student, he said fees were ""one of the key priorities"" for him, while also selecting a course with the best job prospects. What happens when the Welsh election is all over? How parties are targeting you on social media How do I vote in the Welsh election? But he felt many students faced a ""trade off"" between costs and the quality of education. ""I was able to get the security that I was at a university that was a little more tailored to what I wanted to do, maybe more competitive and offered things that weren't available in Wales,"" he said. NUS Wales President Becky Ricketts said education funding was ""unsustainable"" The president of the National Union of Students in Wales welcomed any discussion about tuition fees in this week's election. ""There is no reason why Wales can't take the lead on this, why Wales can't stand up and have a discussion around tuition fees and around the marketization of our education system,"" said Becky Ricketts. But she agreed that cuts to fees must go hand-in-hand with additional funding for institutions. ""There has to be a discussion around making sure universities don't lose out - making sure they are able to offer those courses to students"". Jamie said he could see the benefits of incentives to stay in Wales but felt STEM subjects should not be favoured over creative paths. ""We need to hold parties responsible for their promises and make sure no party creates empty incentives that try to win over the student vote then don't get delivered,"" he said.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst People in Cambodia have received the Sinovac jab There are expected to be meetings today at the
World Health Organisation to discuss whether to include two Chinese vaccines -
Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines - in the Covax global vaccine distribution
programme. Chinese state broadcaster CGTN says the outcome of these meetings is expected to be announcedâby the end of next weekâ,external. If these vaccines are approved, they will be the
first from a non-Western country to gain approval from the international health
body. This would significantly boost Chinaâs role as a
distributor of vaccines globally, but it is worth noting that China has already
played a key role internationally by donating vaccines to countries it
considers friendly allies. According to a CGTN map, 67 countries and
regionshave already received or are actively using,externalChinese vaccines as part of
their vaccine programme. Sinovac and Sinopharm have been slow to reach
this stage of potentially gaining approval, because of concerns âover efficacy

"TMC supporters have been celebrating after being returned to power in West Bengal Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party has failed to win a key state in elections held amid record Covid-19 deaths and cases. The BJP targeted West Bengal heavily during campaigning but the state was comfortably held by the incumbent, Mamata Banerjee, a fierce Modi critic. Her win came as a surprise to political observers, who noted how much time and money the BJP invested in the state. Mr Modi was even accused of focusing on polls rather than the pandemic. Despite the defeat, the BJP won nearly 80 seats to become the main opposition party in the state In the 2016 vote, Narendra Modi's party won just three seats there. Elections also went ahead in Assam, Tamil Nadu and Kerala states as well as the territory of Pondicherry (Puducherry). The BJP held power in the north-eastern state of Assam but failed to make major gains elsewhere. For 10 straight days, daily cases in India have topped 300,000. It recorded more than 360,000 new cases and 3,417 deaths on Monday.On Sunday, the country set a new record for daily deaths, with 3,689 recorded.Hospitals are facing dire shortages of beds and medical oxygen, with many Indians resorting to desperate pleas on social media to secure help. Modi loses a battle in the 'war for Indian democracy' Why India's Covid crisis matters to the whole world UK sending 1,000 more ventilators to India Campaign rallies and votinghave been blamed for the surge in cases. Mr Modi and his home minister made dozens of speeches in West Bengal and were accused of focusing on the polls rather than the pandemic. With almost all the results counted, the Trinamool Congress party (TMC) led by the state's Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has won more than 200 seats in the 294-seat assembly. The results are set to make Ms Banerjee the leader of West Bengal for a third time. She is also India's only female chief minister. The 'daughter of Bengal' taking on India's PM Celebrating the win, she said West Bengal had ""saved"" India with the result and tackling Covid-19 would be her first priority. Mamata Banerjee has been a fierce critic of Prime Minister Modi Victory was soured by the loss of her seat in Nandigram to a former aide turned defector to the BJP. She has said she will challenge the result in court but may have to run again to remain chief minister. West Bengal, home to 90 million people and the city of Kolkata, is of particular interest to election watchers. It is one of the few states that have never been governed by Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist BJP. Although assembly elections were held in five Indian states, the real battle was over West Bengal. The BJP had pulled out all the stops for electioneering, with PM Narendra Modi leading its campaign from the front. To enhance his appeal further to the Bengali voter, he had grown his beard long, with his supporters drawing comparisons with the state's much loved icon - Nobel Prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore. But in the end, it all came to nothing. At a time when a deadly second wave of coronavirus swept India and led thousands of Indians across the country to beg for hospital beds and oxygen cylinders, Mr Modi's frequent visits to the state to address huge rallies were called out as a major failure of his prime ministerial duties. So Mamata Banerjee fought back anti-incumbency, the BJP's mammoth election machinery, last-minute desertions from within her own party, and a largely unfriendly media to return for a third term. Congratulating Ms Banerjee in a tweet, Mr Modi also noted: ""From a negligible presence earlier [in West Bengal], BJP's presence has significantly increased."" Leader of the opposition Congress party Rahul Gandhi congratulated Ms Banerjee for ""soundly defeating the BJP"" even though his party lost a significant number of seats in the state.

Social media was flooded with memes and posts about the success of ""Didi"" - a nickname for Ms Banerjee, meaning older sister. Voting in the state was held in eight phases over a month. The Election Commission is facing a great deal of criticism for refusing to reduce the number of phases and make campaigning virtual. Critics have accused the commission of being controlled by the BJP. A number of congratulatory tweets noted that the TMC had won ""despite"" the commission. As well as the north-eastern states of West Bengal and Assam, there was voting in the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala, the South Indian union territory of Pondicherry, and local council elections in some parts of Uttar Pradesh in the north and Telangana in the south. In Tamil Nadu, the main regional opposition party, the DMK, took power. A left-wing coalition retained power in Kerala, while a BJP-led alliance won no seats there. On top of the coronavirus pandemic, some analysts saw the results as showing the limits of the BJP's rhetoric in states with sizeable Muslim populations. India has recorded more than 19 million cases of coronavirus - second only to the US. It has also confirmed more than 218,000 deaths, though the real toll is thought to be far higher. Experts have cited low testing rates and the number of people dying at home, especially in rural areas, as contributing factors to under-reported figures. The country's previous highest daily death toll, also reported this week, was 3,645. The head of the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, the Serum Institute of India, which manufactures the AstraZeneca vaccine, has blamed India's government for the shortage of Covid jabs. Adar Poonawalla told the Financial Times that initially Narendra Modi's government only ordered 21 million doses, and a larger order was not placed until March, when the second wave of the pandemic had already hit India. The country has a population of 1.3 billion people. In a separate statement,external, Mr Poonawalla said the Serum Institute of India has now received a total order of more than 260 million doses. Brazil and the US have both registered daily tolls of more than 4,000 during the course of the pandemic. In India, distressing images of families begging for hospital beds and life-saving supplies have been emerging for more than 10 days, while morgues and crematoriums remain overwhelmed.

Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines - in the Covax global vaccine distribution

first from a non-Western country to gain approval from the international health

considers friendly allies. According to a CGTN map, 67 countries and
regionshave already received or are actively using,externalChinese vaccines as part of

"The G7 group of nations is to agree a new target of sending 40 million more girls from low and middle income countries to school within five years. Foreign ministers will use a London summit to commit to helping women in developing countries with a $15bn (Â£10.8bn) two-year package of support. At their first in-person meeting for two years, they will also agree to help 20 million more girls read by age 10. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said educating girls was a smart investment. He added that the new targets would help ensure 12 years of continuous education for young women and transform ""the fortunes not just of individuals, but whole communities and nations"". Charities have welcomed the pledge - but said it was at odds with the UK's decision to cut its overseas aid spending. The UK government announced last year it would cut UK aid spending from 0.7% of national income to 0.5% - a reduction of more than Â£4bn. It has yet to confirm which programmes will be affected. ""We know the reality of these aid cuts,"" said Gwen Hines from Save the Children. ""Life-changing, life-saving support [is] being pulled from families in the middle of a pandemic from schooling, medicine and food. ""I just don't see how that is global leadership at a time when the UK is hosting the G7 summit."" UK to host seaside G7 summit in summer G7 'should finance global vaccine scheme' What is the G7 and what does it do? The UK holds the rotating presidency of the G7 group, which also includes the US, France, Germany, Canada, Japan and Italy, and will host a summit of leaders in Cornwall next month. Mr Raab will meet US Secretary of State Antony Blinken later to discuss trade, Iran and China, as part of a three-day meeting of G7 foreign ministers in London. The collective agreement on girls' education, which will be formally signed on Wednesday and also includes the EU, aims to put ""gender equality at the heart of global co-operation to build back better"" from Covid, the government said. Women make up more than two-thirds of the world's 796 million illiterate people, according to the United Nations. The UN said 39% of girls in rural areas attend secondary school worldwide - fewer than rural boys (45%), urban girls (59%) and urban boys (60%). It was estimated that, before the pandemic worsened education outcomes, 90% of children in low income countries were unable to read a simple text by age 10. As part of the funding, there will be renewed support for women-led businesses, and for products or services that particularly benefit women and support their empowerment. The government said the G7 nations would also ""recommit to collective action to defend and protect sexual and reproductive health and rights for all"" and ""scale up gender-based violence prevention and elimination"". The G7 announcement comes amid criticism over the UK's cut to aid spending. The Foreign and Commonwealth Development Office (FCDO) has been accusedof going back on a promiseto continue funding for UN family planning projects aimed at helping women and girls. The UN Population Fund - which helps provide contraceptives and maternal health care for millions of women - said the UK pledged Â£154m for its projects, but then said it would instead receive about Â£23m. It has also been criticised for the timing of a planned cut in bilateral fundingfor clean water and sanitation projects. Annette Zera, who works for an education charity helping girls working as domestic servants in Bangladesh, said the aid authorities ""have just let us down"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that their project ""is going to have to stop"" because it will no longer receive the grant it expected. Foreign Office minister James Cleverly said ""there will always be, sadly, individual projects we are not able to support"". ""We are experiencing a once in a 300-year - the worst in 300 years - economic contraction as a direct result of coronavirus,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme as he defended the cuts. ""We have to make the decisions in keeping with those economic circumstances."" He said the UK remained one of the world's leading aid donors and that the reduction in aid spending to 0.5% of national income would be ""temporary"".

"John Williams struggled to prove a local connection to Swansea, despite it being his hometown A man has called for all those who are homeless in Wales to receive speedy help even if they do not fit into a priority group. John Williams, 52, became homeless in Weston-super-Mare, where he had been volunteering to help homeless people. It prompted him to return home to Swansea, where he thought he would be helped. But it took months to prove his ""local connection"" - a condition on getting help if you are homeless in the city. As part of a series looking at the issues people in Wales would like to see tackled by politicians after the Senedd election, BBC News spoke to Mr Williams about the campaign. ""My mum lived here in a nursing home, she's lived here all her life, but it still took months and all that time I was living in shelters,"" Mr Williams said. ""It was hard, I didn't know what to do, I was expecting to come back to where I was born, where my mum lives, and be put on the council list. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage ""I didn't know which way to turn, it gave me a feeling of not belonging, like I was coming back as a newcomer and starting again."" Mr Williams was then placed in a homeless hostel, before he finally had his connection confirmed with the help of charities and moved into a one-bed flat just before lockdown. He is now working as a Big Issue seller. Mr Williams said while he was supporting homeless people, he saw many struggle with the same ""local connection"" rule. ""You just could not win,"" he said. Mr Williams is now supporting a campaign with the charity Crisis to pull people out of a ""cycle of homelessness"". They want to see barriers removed so everyone can access support without having to meet sets of demands first. The charity says since 2015 one in eight people in Wales (9,261) who went to their local council for help to end their homelessness were unable to access further support, adding that the average age of death for people experiencing homelessness is 46 for men, and 43 for women. The Housing (Wales) Act 2014 placed a legal duty on councils to prevent homelessness from happening in the first place and to help people out of it when it does and Crisis says the legislation has made a huge difference. Tents used by homeless people were a common sight in Cardiff before the pandemic But when efforts fail, it says, homelessness can be prolonged because a person must meet certain criteria before they are given support. People who fall into the priority category for help include those with dependants, a connection to a local area and whether they can prove they have not become homeless intentionally. But there is renewed hope as a result of the emergency response to the pandemic that ending homelessness is possible across Wales, Crisis says, due to a Welsh Government directive which saw more than 7,000 rough sleepers provided with temporary accommodation and support. WALES ELECTION: THE BASICS What's happening?On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.Find out more here. What powers does the Senedd have?MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. Campaigners want this to be built on further, leading to a law change to remove barriers so anyone facing homelessness in Wales can access support. BBC Wales asked each political party whether they support the campaign, and what they would do to tackle homelessness if elected. Welsh Labour said it had a ""proud track record"" of tackling homelessness and has housed more than 7,000 people into temporary accommodation during the pandemic and made additional funding available to local authorities. It has promised to build 20,000 low-carbon homes for social rent and introduce a scheme restricting rent for anyone at risk of homelessness. A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said the party would change the law to ensure everyone in Wales who needs housing and homeless services can access it, abolishing the priority need system and delivering 50,000 social and affordable homes. The Welsh Conservatives said they would introduce a ""housing first"" model and commit to tackling rough sleeping in Wales by 2026 by appointing a Homelessness Commissioner, as well as bringing 150 empty social housing properties back into use for people at risk of homelessness. BASICS:Simple guide to the Senedd election POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for? FIRST TIME:Will 16-year-olds vote? Propel said it would being in a new law to end ""injustices"" in Welsh housing, ""meaning a person will simply be housed, no ifs, no buts"", including compulsory targets for local authorities to bring empty properties back into use. Reform UK said it supported the campaign, and would make it a statutory duty for councils to put a roof over everyone's head every night of the year. UKIP said it would reduce demand and pressure on housing stock by implementing ""firm and fair"" immigration controls"", and has pledged to end homelessness amongst veterans in the next Senedd term. The Green Party said it wants to ring-fence funding for councils to provide shelter to every rough sleeper who wants it, and they should be given more guidance and power to control local rents.

"Stephen Doughty is Labour's shadow foreign affairs and international development minister A Labour MP has apologised ""unreservedly for any error he made"" by asking a constituent for prescription-only anxiety drugs. Byron Longclaimed to the Mail on Sunday he gave his MP Stephen Doughty,externalup to 140diazepam,externalpills during up to 20 meetings at a Cardiff coffee shop. Mr Doughty's spokesman categorically denied the paper's report. But he said the MP did ask his ""friend"" Mr Long for ""a few spare diazepam"" once in 2019, to take ahead of a flight. The spokesman added: ""To the best of his recollection, at the time he was panicking, had been unable to get to a GP for an appointment, and as a friend who he regularly shared confidential personal mental health worries and anxieties with, asked Byron if he had a few spare diazepam, which he had previously been prescribed for such circumstances, and taken without any issues. ""Stephen apologises unreservedly for any error he made in making this request, which was to a friend who he had shared many highly personal, trusted and mutually supportive conversations with about mental health over many years. ""In the event Stephen subsequently cancelled his trip - and did not need medication."" Possession of diazepam, which is a Class C drug without a prescription, carries amaximum sentence of two years in prison,external. It is available on prescription only and is used to treat anxiety, muscle spasms and fits. The Mail on Sunday printed what it said was an exchange of messages between Mr Long and Mr Doughty, who is MP for Cardiff South and Penarth and Labour's shadow foreign affairs and international development minister. In the alleged exchange, Mr Doughty invited Mr Long to his home to meet his new cat, adding: ""PS do you have any spare diazepam by any chance? I haven't been able to get to GP and need some for flying next week! X."" Earlier on Sunday, when asked about the allegations, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""Well, I haven't seen the article myself but I understand that Mr Doughty has provided a full explanation. ""He refutes many of the allegations that are made in that article and he explains part of why one aspect of it has some grounding is the truth, so I think it's fair that he has that opportunity to set that record straight."" Mr Doughty's spokesman added: ""Stephen has spoken openly about his own struggles about mental health. He is sad to have to reveal personal medical information in these circumstances - but feels that others talking about their mental health experiences can help destigmatise the challenges so many people go through. ""He has been prescribed medication over the last 12 years on a number of occasions, including diazepam, to deal with panic attacks and anxiety disorder, alongside talking therapies.""
