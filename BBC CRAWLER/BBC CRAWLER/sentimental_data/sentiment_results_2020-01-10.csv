"Sweden has seen a 4% drop in the number of people flying via its airports, a rare decrease in recent years for a European country. More than 40 million people travelled through the country's 10 airports, compared with 42 million during 2018. The figure for domestic travel was down 9%, according to Sweden's airport operators, Swedavia. The figures come as the Swedish-born movement of ""flight shaming"" is gaining prominence. Swedavia spokesman Robert Pletzin said there were a number of reasons for the decrease, citing Swedish aviation tax, softening economy worries, the weak Swedish crown and the climate debate. Flygskam or ""flight shame"" originated in Sweden in 2017, when Swedish singer Staffan Lingberg pledged to give up flying.

In September, Citigroup analysts said greater consumer awareness about global carbon emissions had already had a tangible effect in Sweden and could call into question the longer-term growth potential of the entire industry. The Swedish schoolgirl who inspired a generation A number of people have since decided to take on thechallenge of travelling without flying. More than 22,500 people have signed a pledge to go flight-free in 2020. The last occasions where air passenger numbers dropped had distinct reasons - the 9/11 terror attacks and the financial crash. Aside from Sweden, Europe is still seeing an increase in the number of people flying. The EU overall saw figures rise to 1.1 billion passengers in 2018, up from 1 billion the year before. In 2018, the UK saw more than 272 million passengers, up from 264 million in 2017. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) says current trends suggest passenger numbers could double to 8.2 billion by 2037. Cities in Asia are expected to overtake European cities in regards to air passenger markets.

"Gemma Watts posed as 16-year-old ""Jake Waton"" on social media A woman disguised herself as a teenage boy to sexually assault girls after grooming them online. Gemma Watts posed as 16-year-old ""Jake Waton"" on social media and swapped intimate photos with victims before meeting at locations across England. Watts, 21, of Enfield, pleaded guilty at Winchester Crown Court to sexual offences involving four girls and was jailed for eight years. Police believe she may have assaulted up to 50 victims in total. Scotland Yard said Watts had used her own picture on Snapchat and Instagram accounts as ""Jake"" and targeted girls aged 13 to 16 by liking their profiles. She used teenage slang, sent flattering messages and shared intimate photographs before travelling to meet them in person. Her disguise included tying her hair back in a bun and wearing a baseball cap, jogging bottoms and a hoodie. Watts created a series of fake social media accounts to trick victims Police said all of her victims believed they were in a relationship with a teenage boy until officers revealed Watts was actually an adult woman. She was so convincing she even spent time as ""Jake"" with some of the girls' parents. The court heard two of the victims had since made several suicide attempts because of their experiences. One 14-year-old girl said her ""heart exploded"" when she learned the truth about Watts from the police. In a victim statement read out in court, she said: ""My world stopped, I actually stopped breathing... I loved him so much."" The offences she has admitted relate to a 13-year-old from Plymouth, two 14-year-olds from Surrey and Hampshire and a 16-year-old from the West Midlands. This video can not be played Det Con Phillipa Kenwright said the victims ""all believed they were in a relationship with a male"" Barnaby Shaw, prosecuting, said Watts repeatedly groped one of the victims during regular overnight stays over a three-month period. On one occasion, he said the girl believed she was touching Watts' genitals but was deceived by ""what must have been a number of socks tightly rolled together"". Passing sentence, Judge Susan Evans QC said Watts had groomed young girls for her own gratification. ""Their youth, as you plainly knew, made them more naive and made you more likely to get away with your deception,"" she told Watts. Det Con Phillipa Kenwright said the victims ""all believed they were in a relationship with a male"" and had been ""completely taken in"" by Watts. She added: ""It's been life-changing for all of the victims involved."" The officer said she believed Watts could have duped ""20 to 50"" victims in total. Watts arrives at Winchester Crown Court for her sentencing A doctor in Hampshire first raised concerns to police in March 2018 after a young patient revealed she was in a relationship with an older boy. In July that year Watts admitted to Met officers she had been sexually active as ""Jake"" with the first three victims. She was released under investigation and arrested again in October 2018 by British Transport Police who found her on a train with a fourth victim. Officers initially thought Watts was a 16-year-old boy and were taking her home to London before they realised her true identity. In November 2019, Watts pleaded guilty to one count of assault by penetration, three counts of meeting a child following sexual grooming and three counts of sexual assault. Det Ch Insp Nicholas Plummer, from Hampshire Constabulary, said: ""This is a truly shocking case. It serves as a reminder to us all about the lengths a perpetrator will go to exploit children. ""Parents and carers should have the confidence to speak to their children about their online activity.""

"Online food ordering company Takeaway.com has won the battle for the UK-listed Just Eat with a Â£5.9bn all-share offer. The deal will create one of the world's largest meal delivery companies. Dutch giant Takeaway.com was bidding against tech investment firm Prosus. The merged company, which will be led by Takeaway chief executive Jitse Groen, will have its headquarters in Amsterdam and a listing in London. The joint group will bring together businesses that process 360 million annual orders worth â¬7.3bn (Â£6.6bn). ""I am thrilled,"" said Mr Groen. ""Just Eat Takeaway.com is a dream combination and I am very much looking forward to leading the company for many years to come."" Takeaway said that 80.4% of Just Eat shareholders had agreed to its latest all-share offer, passing a 50% threshold needed to make the offer unconditional. The bid was worth 889 pence per share at the latest close, trumping a rival bid of 800 pence per share in cash from Prosus. The fight to buy Just Eat began in August, when Takeaway struck a management-backed deal to buy Just Eat that would see Takeaway holding a 48% stake in the combined firm. That plan was upended when Prosus laid down the first of three unsolicited rival bids in October. All were rejected as inadequate by Just Eat managers. Prosus argued Takeaway was underestimating the investment needed to fend off rivals such as Uber Eats and Amazon.com. Mr Groen responded that food delivery was a low-margin business, and investments should focus on becoming the dominant ordering platform. The combined firm will have 23 subsidiaries, mostly in Europe but also in Canada, Australia and Latin America. Just Eat was founded by a group of five Danish entrepreneurs in 2000 and launched a year later. It employs 3,600 staff globally. As well as the Just Eat brand in Europe, it trades as Skip The Dishes in Canada, iFood in Mexico and Brazil, and Menulog in Australia and New Zealand.

"The Duchess of Sussex has returned to Canada to join her son amid discussions over the future role for her and Prince Harry in the Royal Family. Meghan and Prince Harry had been in Canada over Christmas with baby Archie. It comes as the Queen, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge asked staff to find a workable solution after the couple announced they will step back as senior royals. The Royal Family was said to be ""hurt"" at the couple's statement. Palace sources have told BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond that Prince Harry and Meghan did not consult any other royal about making their personal statement. Your questions answered on Harry and Meghan statement Where do Prince Harry and Meghan get their money? How Meghan âtripped and fellâ into Harryâs life Prince Harry: A life in the spotlight In their announcementon Wednesday evening, Prince Harry and Meghan revealed they intend ""to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family, and work to become financially independent"". They plan to split their time between the UK and North America, while ""continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages"". The decision came ""after many months of reflection and internal discussions"", they added. This video can not be played Prince Harry and Meghan: Who else has taken 'early retirement'? On Thursday, BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said the Queen had been in touch with the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Cambridge. They all directed senior staff to work with the Sussex household and government to find a solution within days. It was later confirmed to the BBC that Meghan had left for Canada, said BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond. This video can not be played ""People should back off"": The public react to Prince Harry and Meghan stepping back Our correspondent said Buckingham Palace was ""blindsided"" by the couple's statement. There had been talks within the Royal Family about the Sussexes' future - but they were at an early stage, he said. US President Donald Trumptold Fox News,externalhe thought the announcement from Harry and Meghan was ""sad"". He said: ""I don't want to get into the whole thing, I just have such respect for the Queen, it shouldn't be happening to her."" In a statement on Wednesday, Buckingham Palace said: ""We understand their desire to take a different approach, but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through."" Despite the couple's decision, Harrywill remain sixth in line to the throne.,external Meghan said the family's time in Canada was ""incredible"" Last October, Prince Harry and Meghanpublicly revealed their strugglesunder the media spotlight. After returning to the UK after their six-week break in Canada on Tuesday, Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, visited Canada's High Commission in London to thank the country for hosting them and said the warmth and hospitality they had received was ""unbelievable"". Former actress Meghan, who is American, lived and worked in Toronto during her time starring in the popular US drama Suits, and she has several Canadian friends. The talk in some quarters is that the Sussexes' hand was forced bythe impressive scoop of the Sun newspaper,externalon Wednesday. If that's the case - and the couple's media strategy is certainly unconventional - it goes some way to explaining why there are many more questions than there are answers. But how did they get here? Those who have always had it in for Meghan put it down to her. But that's a long way from the truth. Harry's royal path has always been hard. There was the long shadow of his mother's early death, the media spotlight on his youthful mistakes and the extraordinary interest that his relationships and then his marriage sparked. Unlike his older brother Prince William, Harry has never grown used to media, and still visibly bridles at the cameras and the questions. And he is obviously - visibly - bored by the ceremonial side of the job. In short, he has long wanted out. And together with the woman he loves he now thinks he has found a way. But the manner of his leaving - their leaving - is breathtaking. Read more from Jonny. The pair were already preparing to launch their own Sussex Royal charity, which they set up after splitting from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's foundation in June last year. The Sussexes' new charity is expected to be global, linked to Africa and the US, rather than domestic - and will have a commitment to female empowerment. It was revealed in December the couplehad made an application to trademark their Sussex Royal brand,externalacross a string of items including books, calendars, clothing, charitable fundraising, education and social care services. Sentebale, the charity co-founded by Prince Harry, issued a statement saying that, as its patron, he has been a ""passionate advocate"" for its work, adding: ""We know that support will continue."" This video can not be played What would Canadians think about welcoming the royal couple? In stepping back as senior royals, Harry and Meghanhave announced they will no longer receive funding from the Sovereign Grant.,external The Sovereign Grant is public money - Â£82m in 2018-19 - which pays for the cost of official royal duties, in exchange for the surrender by the Queen of the revenue from the Crown Estate. The couple said the Sovereign Grant paid for 5% of their official office from 2019, with the remaining 95% being funded by Prince Charles through his income from the Duchy of Cornwall. The couple are classified as ""internationally protected people"", which means they must have armed security provided by the Metropolitan Police. They will retain Frogmore cottage, the Grade-2 listed property in Windsorthat cost taxpayers Â£2.4m to renovate, as their official residence so they have a ""place to call home"" in the UK. Reaction to the couple's announcement from royal commentators has been mixed, with numerous questions over what their future royal roles will entail. Bryony Gordon, a Daily Telegraph journalist who knows and has interviewed the couple, suggested their decision could be linked to their mental health, after becoming a ""punching bag"" for a ""misogynistic and racist"" nation. This video can not be played Meghan spoke to ITV as part of a documentary last year Graham Smith, a spokesman for Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, said Harry and Meghan's decision ""raises questions about the monarchy's future"" and will prompt taxpayers to ask how the couple's extra security and overseas lifestyle will be funded. ""This really is wanting to have your cake and eat it,"" he said. ""They have said they will dip in and out of royal duties as it suits them but won't stop taking public money until they find other sources of income."" Meanwhile, Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said ""we must continue to celebrate and support"" the contribution the Royal Family makes to the UK, adding that it has an ""important role in public service"". However, Labour leadership candidate Clive Lewissaid he believes there should be a referendum on the future of the Royal Family,adding: ""A lot of people would like to see the monarchy scaled down."" A happy memory of Canada? The moment in 1991 when Prince Harry and his brother were reunited with their mother in Toronto during an official visit In October last year, Meghanbegan legal actionagainst the Mail on Sunday over a claim that it unlawfully published one of her private letters. The paper stands by its story. At the time, Prince Harry said: ""Though we have continued to put on a brave face... I cannot begin to describe how painful it has been."" And in an ITV documentary last year, Meghan, who was born in the US, described motherhood as a ""struggle"" due to intense interest from newspapers. On Wednesday the royal couple also announced they would also be adopting a ""revised media approach"" from the spring. It will see them,external""engage with grassroots media organisations and young, up-and-coming journalists"". The National Union of Journalists criticised the plans, saying the move appears to try and ""prevent the media from functioning and compromising the ability of journalists to do their jobs, which is completely unacceptable"".

"Counter-terrorism police in south-east England have admitted an ""error of judgement"" after listing Extinction Rebellion as an ""extreme ideology"". First reported in the Guardian,external, the police guide - aimed at stopping young people being radicalised - suggested referring those at risk of extremism to the government'sPrevent programme. ""How dare they,"" said climate change group Extinction Rebellion. Police are now reviewing and recalling the document. The climate change group was listed alongside banned groups like National Action in the 12-page guide. The document was produced by Counter Terrorism Policing South East - part of the national counter-terrorism policing network - and given to police forces and government organisations. Called ""safeguarding young people and adults from ideological extremism"", the guide itself also says it was produced for those who work with young people or the public, as well as local authorities. It was designed to help ""recognise when young people or adults may be vulnerable to extreme or violent ideologies"", it reads. It says spotting one of the signs in isolation may not mean someone has been radicalised, but ""in combination or in circumstances where they do not 'fit', they may indicate an individual at risk"". ""In such cases, consider whether the individual is vulnerable to extremism and should be referred to the UK government's Prevent programme."" What is the Prevent strategy? The Prevent programme is part of the government's counter-terrorism strategy and urges local communities to flag up anyone at risk of joining extremist groups and carrying out terrorist activities. The guide lists several groups, such as the neo-Nazi group National Action and Islamist extremist group Al Muhajiroun - both of which are banned in the UK. It also has pages on far-right youth network Generation Identity, extreme Satanism and animal rights extremism. On the page about Extinction Rebellion, the guide describes the group as: ""A campaign encouraging protest and civil disobedience to pressure governments to take action on climate change and species extinction."" What does Extinction Rebellion want? Who is getting arrested over climate change? Under the heading ""why are they a threat?"", the guide reads: ""An anti-establishment philosophy that seeks system change underlies its activism; the group attracts to its events school-age children and adults unlikely to be aware of this. ""While non-violent against persons, the campaign encourages other law-breaking activities."" The guide says signs someone is involved in Extinction Rebellion might be the use of phrases like ""rise up"" or ""rebel"". Or ""you may see or hear of young people taking part in 'NVDA' (non-violent direct action) such as sit-down protests, 'die-ins',"" the guide suggests. A spokeswoman for the Extinction Rebellion group said: ""Teachers, grandparents, nurses have been trying their best with loving non-violence to get politicians and big business to do something about the dire state of our planet. ""And this is how the establishment responds."" In a statement, Det Ch Supt Kath Barnes, head of Counter Terrorism Policing South East, said: ""I would like to make it quite clear that we do not classify Extinction Rebellion as an extremist organisation. ""The inclusion of Extinction Rebellion in this document was an error of judgement and we will now be reviewing all of the contents as a result. ""It was produced by CTPSE to assist our statutory partners - including police forces and government organisations - in identifying people who may [be] vulnerable as a result of their links to some organisations."" Last year saw multiple protests organised by Extinction Rebellion across the UK Det Ch Supt Barnes added that the document was ""designed for a very specific audience who understand the complexities of the safeguarding environment we work within and who have statutory duties under Prevent"". She said they are in the process of confirming who the guide has been shared with and recalling it. ""We as Counter Terrorism Policing, along with our partners, have a responsibility to protect vulnerable people. Officers are trained to spot those who may be vulnerable, and the membership of an organisation that supports environmental or animal welfare issues alone would not be a trigger.""

"Anthony Knott was due home in the early hours of 21 December The family of a man who went missing during a work night out have said they are ""utterly devastated and completely heartbroken"" after a body was found. Land and water searches with boats and drones took place to find London firefighter Anthony Knott, 33, who was last seen in Lewes on 20 December. Sussex Police said a member of the public alerted it on Friday that a body had been found in Newhaven harbour. Mr Knott's family thanked everyone who had helped in the search for him. In a statement on Facebook, they said: ""Anthony's story has reached out and touched the hearts of thousands of people. ""We would like to thank everyone for your incredible support, shares, posters, volunteers and donations. ""The people of Lewes, we will be forever grateful for your support and understanding during our searches. ""These three weeks have been so very hard for us all."" East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service crews carried out searches along the River Ouse Det Insp Mark Rosser said officers believed the body to be that of Mr Knott. He thanked volunteers who had turned out to help with the search. ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Anthony at this difficult time,"" Det Insp Rosser said. Family, friends and members of the public had helped to search different locations across Lewes when Mr Knott failed to return home. Sussex Police and London Fire Brigade joined forces to search Pells Pool in Lewes and the Pellbrook Cut waterway. Emergency teams also carried out searches of the nearby River Ouse. By Piers Hopkirk, BBC News The body was discovered by a member of the public in the River Ouse at Denton Island. This is the final stretch of the Ouse before it reaches the sea at Newhaven, running through the town's industrial quarter just short of the port and ferry terminal and crossed by the A259 coast road bridge. It's about six miles as the crow flies downstream from Lewes, where Anthony Knott went missing on 20 December. At this stage, it is not known how and where he entered the water.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The Home Office has requested the extradition of a US woman to be charged with causing the death by dangerous driving of motorcyclist Harry Dunn. Mr Dunn, 19, died after a crash in Northamptonshire in August which led to the suspect, Anne Sacoolas, leaving for the US under diplomatic immunity. Extradition proceedings were started in December. The Home Office said the matter was ""now a decision for the US authorities"". The US State Department said an extradition request would be ""highly inappropriate"" and insisted that Ms Sacoolas' status at the time of the crash meant she had diplomatic immunity. A spokeswoman said they expressed their deepest sympathies and offered condolences to the Dunn family for their loss, and would continue to ""look at options for moving forward"". ""It is the position of the United States government that a request to extradite an individual under these circumstances would be an abuse,"" she said. ""The use of an extradition treaty to attempt to return the spouse of a former diplomat by force would establish an extraordinarily troubling precedent."" Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Mr Dunn died after his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Mrs Sacoolas. The crash happened outside RAF Croughton where Mrs Sacoolas' husband Jonathan worked as an intelligence officer. The 42-year-old left the UK and returned to her native US, claiming diplomatic immunity. A Home Office spokesman said:  ""Following the Crown Prosecution Service's charging decision, the Home Office has sent an extradition request to the United States for Anne Sacoolas on charges of causing death by dangerous driving. This is now a decision for the US authorities."" When the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced extradition proceedings, US officials said it was not ""a helpful development"" and Mrs Sacoolas' lawyer said she would not return to the UK. Lawyer Amy Jefress said: ""Anne will not return voluntarily to the UK to face a potential jail sentence for what was a terrible but unintentional accident."" The extradition request is sent via the British Embassy to the US State Department. A lawyer will then decide whether it falls under the dual-criminality treaty, where the alleged offence is a crime in both countries and carries a prison sentence of at least a year. The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years' imprisonment, although this is usually reserved for the most serious cases. The US may reject the request for extradition, arguing that Mrs Sacoolas is still entitled to diplomatic immunity. Reacting to the extradition request on behalf of Harry Dunn's family, spokesman Radd Seiger said: ""Anne Sacoolas will come back. She has to come back. There is no other way forward. ""So, whether they put up a fight and whether they actually refuse it, we will only know in time and the parents are determined to just take this a step at a time. It's being handled by the officials now, by the lawyers, and we're not going to get ahead of ourselves."" ""No-one, whether diplomat or otherwise, is above the law,"" he added. He said in the circumstances, considering all the family had been through, the family was pleased with the extradition request and felt it was a ""huge step towards achieving justice for Harry"". Charlotte Charles told reporters the charging decision was a ""huge step"" In December, Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the family was ""relieved"" Mrs Sacoolas had ""finally"" been charged. ""We made that promise to him the night we lost him to seek justice thinking it was going to be really easy,"" she said. ""We had no idea it was going to be so hard and it would take so long."" The family's constituency MP, cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom, has since written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking him to meet Mr Dunn's parents to hear their concerns.

"US regulators are seeking to fine Boeing $5.4m (Â£4.14m) for ""knowingly"" installing faulty parts on 737 Max planes. The move comes after the release of internal messages that raised more questions about the jet's safety. In one of the communications, an employee said the plane was ""designed by clowns"". Boeing has been under scrutiny since the fatal crashes of two 737 Max planes, which killed 346 people. What went wrong inside Boeing's cockpit? Boeing 737 Max: The battle over blame Boeing to halt 737 Max production in January The fine announced by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday is not connected to the software system that investigators have implicated in those crashes. It concerns ""slat tracks"" that are located on the wings. The FAA said the company submitted the jets for FAA approval despite determining that the wing parts had failed a strength test. It also accused Boeing of failing to oversee its suppliers properly. The planemaker has the right to contest the penalty, which follows a $3.9m fine the FAA proposed against the US aerospace giant for similar reasons last month. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The announcement heightens the pressure on the company, which is now facing multiple investigations following the 737 Max crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Last month,the company fired chief executive Dennis Muilenburg. The firm said Friday it had denied him severance and that he had forfeited stock awards worth about $14.6m. As part of the investigations, Boeing has provided hundreds of messages to the FAA and Congress. It said it had released redacted versions this week as part of its commitment to transparency. ""These communications do not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable,"" Boeing said. In one exchange in April 2017, an unnamed employee wrote: ""This airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys."" Thedocuments,externalalso showed Boeing planning to push back against requirements that 737 Max pilots receive training on simulators, which would have led to higher costs for its customers, making its aircraft less attractive. ""I want to stress the importance of holding firm that there will not be any type of simulator training required to transition from NG to Max,"" Boeing's 737 chief technical pilot at the time, Mark Forkner, said in a March 2017 email. ""Boeing will not allow that to happen. We'll go face to face with any regulator who tries to make that a requirement."" On Tuesday this week, Boeing reversed its position byrecommending 737 Max simulator training,externalfor all pilots. These messages refer to Boeing employees telling lies, covering up problems and treating regulators with contempt. They reinforce the impression - already expressed vividly by whistleblowers and in Congressional hearings - that Boeing was a company that had lost its way, focused on maximising production and keeping costs down, rather than on safety. Will all this actually harm Boeing though? It's questionable. The company's reputation has already been savaged; it may be calculating that it now has little to lose by being transparent about past failures. But it is easy to see now why the relationship between Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration has deteriorated so far - and why the recertification of the 737 Max has taken so long. Staff also appear to discuss problems with the simulators. In February 2018, a Boeing worker asked a colleague: ""Would you put your family on a Max simulator-trained aircraft? I wouldn't."" ""No,"" came the reply. Boeing has said it is redesigning the automated control system thought to have been the primary cause of the crashes. But 737 Max planes have been grounded worldwide since March and with no sign from regulators that the aircraft will be re-approved for flight anytime soon,the firm has been forced to halt production of the planes. On Friday, the economic costs started to be felt as Spirit Aerosystems, a major Boeing supplier, said it would cut 2,800 jobs at a plant in Kansas, and expected smaller layoffs at some of its other factories. ""Spirit is taking this action because of the 737 MAX production suspension and ongoing uncertainty regarding the timing of when production will resume and the level of production when it does resume,"" the company said in a statement, which noted that Boeing has hundreds of 737 planes in storage. 29 October 2018:A 737 Max 8 operated by Lion Air crashes after leaving Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board 31 January 2019:Boeing reports an order of 5,011 Max planes from 79 customers 10 March 2019:A 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashes, killing all 157 people on board 14 March 2019:Boeing grounds entire 737 Max aircraft fleet The FAA said of the emails that safety problems had been addressed. However, the regulator added: ""The tone and content of some of the language contained in the documents is disappointing."" In the emails and instant messages, employees spoke of their frustration with the company's culture, complaining about the drive to find the cheapest suppliers and ""impossible schedules"". ""I don't know how to fix these things... it's systemic. It's culture. It's the fact we have a senior leadership team that understand very little about the business and yet are driving us to certain objectives,"" said an employee in an email dated June 2018. And in a May 2018 message, an unnamed Boeing employee said: ""I still haven't been forgiven by God for the covering up I did last year."" Without citing what was covered up, the employee added: ""Can't do it one more time, the pearly gates will be closed."" Boeing said that some of the messages ""raise questions"" about the company's interactions with the FAA in discussions about the simulator. But the company dismissed safety concerns, saying that the issues raised in the emails occurred at the start of the simulators. It said: ""We remain confident in the regulatory process for qualifying these simulators.""

"Does a new dawn beckon for the Stormont institutions? NI Secretary Julian Smith is ""holding the people of Northern Ireland to ransom"", the union Unison has said. It follows comments he made to the BBC that extra money for workers would be withheld in the absence of a deal. The British and Irish governments havepublished a draft deal,externalto restore the executive after three years of political deadlock at Stormont. About 9,000health workers are currently on strikeover pay and staffing levels in NI. Get all the latest reaction on our live page What's in the draft Stormont deal? Will a deal be done to restore devolution? ""There is no money coming unless the executive gets up and running,"" Mr Smith told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""I want to focus on public services, they need to get back to work,"" he said. This video can not be played Stormont talks: Julian Smith warns that financial package depends on an agreed deal Patricia McKeown, from Unison, told the BBC that the dispute over health workers' pay could be ""resolved immediately"". ""That's about holding the people of Northern Ireland at ransom,"" she said. ""It's about really infringing on their human rights, health workers and patients alike."" Mr Smith and TÃ¡naiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveneymade the announcement of a draft deal at a media conference at Stormont on Thursday evening. The Northern Ireland Secretary had asked the Stormont speaker, Robin Newton, to arrange an urgent meeting of the assembly for Friday. However, on Friday morning, Mr Newton said the Northern Ireland Assembly will only be recalled if the political parties agree on a potential deal to restore power sharing. DUP leader Arlene Foster has said that the proposals are ""not perfect"" but offer a basis to move forward. Sinn FÃ©in is examining the draft deal at internal party meetings on Friday. If you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of theBBC websiteto submit your question on this topic. Speaking to BBC News NI, Mr Smith said politicians have ""decisions to make but now is the time"". If agreed, the deal, entitled New Decade, New Approach, could see the assembly reconvene on Friday.  Thursday marked three years to the day since Stormont collapsed. An assembly spokesperson said it was the speaker's responsibility to ensure arrangements are in place for a sitting to facilitate the appointment of an executive. Three years of political deadlock at Stormont 'Now is the moment' to restore devolution She added:  ""It is not for the speaker to react to political speculation and he has been clear that whether or not the deadline of 13 January can be met is a matter entirely for parties. ""While the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has requested that the speaker call a sitting of the assembly, the process of doing so remains one for the speaker to undertake in consultation with the parties."" Simon Coveney and Julian Smith held a joint media conference on Thursday night The statement added:  ""The speed and timing of any sitting therefore depends entirely on when the speaker hears positively from the parties."" Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Mrs Foster said she was ""hopeful"" that the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in can restore the executive. The DUP leader said she had spoken to Michelle O'Neill on Thursday evening. ""Discussions will continue throughout the day and hopefully we can get to a place where we can have the executive up and running again,"" she said. Two key sticking points in the Stormont talks were around an Irish language act and the petition of concern. The call for an Irish language act has been a key sticking point The purpose ofpetition of concern is to protect one community from legislation that would favour another and a valid petition requires the signatures of 30 MLAs. The draft deal says there is to be ""meaningful reform"" of the petition, which would be ""reduced and returned to its intended purpose"" and would ""only be used in the most exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, having used every other mechanism"". The proposed deal would see legislation created for the appointment of both an Irish language commissioner and an Ulster-Scots commissioner. Earlier in the week,the Orange Order reiterated its opposition to a standalone Irish language act. But Mrs Foster argued that the new deal was ""an entirely different construct to what was suggested before"". Questioned on BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan show about whether a unionist veto around the Irish language was included in the small print of the draft document, DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said standards ""set for the use of the Irish language have to be agreed by the first minister"". ""That does mean the DUP will have a very important and crucial say in how those standards are drawn up and what they will be,"" he said. In a statement on Thursday night, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said her party was ""studying the text and will give it careful consideration"". ""The Sinn FÃ©in Ard Chomhairle will meet tomorrow to fully assess it,"" she added. Mr Smith and Mr Coveney brief the press on the deal Mr Smith said the deal will transform public services and restore public confidence in devolved government and asked all parties to support it. The secretary of state said accepting the deal would also bring about the parties' commitment to immediately ending ongoing industrial action by healthcare staff. The proposed deal also makes provision for a number of long-standing demands of environmentalists, including the idea that a new Programme for Government would see a separate climate change act for Northern Ireland - the only part of the UK without such legislation.

"DUP leader Arlene Foster said parts of the deal were ""compromise outcomes"" DUP leader Arlene Foster has said the governments' draft deal is not ""perfect"", but ""there is a basis upon which the assembly and executive can be re-established"". The text waspublished on Thursday night,external. Arlene Foster said: ""There are elements within it which we recognise are the product of long negotiations and represent compromise outcomes."" She was speaking before Sinn FÃ©in backed the deal on Friday. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith said he hoped the the dealcould see the assembly reconvene on Fridaybut the speaker Robin Newton made clear that could only happen when the parties approached him. The DUP leader Mrs Foster said the party had weighed the governments' paper against its 10 commitments for negotiations. ""There will always need to be give and take,"" she said. ""The key to making devolution work will be having the resources to do so. ""This element of the paper will require further scrutiny."" Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary-Lou McDonald said her party would ""assess"" the text The draft deal was welcomed as an ""historic advancement"" by the Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge. However, it said the proposed legislation ""falls very much short"" of promises for an Irish language act. ""The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM [Office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister - now the Executive Office] leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services, said CiarÃ¡n Mac Giolla BhÃ©in from the group. ""The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive."" Questioned earlier on BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan show about whether a unionist veto around the Irish language was included in the small print of the draft document, DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson confirmed: ""Unionist consent will be required"". He said: ""That is the way Stormont operates. It operates on the basis that there has to be cross-community consent. ""We will not agree to standards that impose Irish on people who don't speak it. ""There will be no compulsory Irish in schools and there will be no Irish road signs."" The Orange Order released a statement saying it has ""very serious concerns"" about the draft deal and could not support the proposal to appoint an Irish language commissioner. ""The document, which has been released with a purposely narrow window for meaningful consideration, is clearly far reaching in its provision for the Irish language and its subsequent future role in the political and civic life of Northern Ireland,"" the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland's statement said. It added that in contrast to measures to promote the Irish language, ""references to Ulster-Scots/Ulster British culture are ambiguous -lacking meaningful detail"". The Orange Order said it would comment further on the draft deal in the coming days after consulting more widely with its members UUP leader Steve Aiken said the party is ""committed to a return to devolution that is fair and sustainable"". UUP leader Steve Aiken said his party will attend if the Assembly is recalled He said: ""We will consider this complex and far-reaching document carefully and consult widely within our party before making any further comments. ""If the assembly is recalled on Friday, the Ulster Unionist Party MLAs will attend and consider the business put before them."" Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong questioned whether the reforms of the petition of concern detailed in the draft deal go far enough. Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong has concerns about the petition of concern ""That is what we are trying to consider at the moment. This is a new approach,"" she said. She said detailed work was also needed on Friday to define the financial aspect of the deal and ""the amount of money that has been talked about"" for public services in Northern Ireland. Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey echoed Alliance's concerns that proposed reform of the petition of concern was insufficient and expressed some disappointment that environmental protections in the deal do not go far enough. However, Ms Bailey added she was ""hopeful that this is a deal that will see the restoration of the devolved institutions"". She said it ""provides a chance to build towards delivery and accountability"" at Stormont. A key focus of the deal is the implementation of health and social care reform, including an end to the healthcare strikes which demand pay parity and safe staffing levels. Speaking at a picket line in Antrim, the Royal College of Nursing President Anne Marie Rafferty said nurses ""want to see the ink on the paper and the deal delivered"". ""Words are not enough, deeds are what actually counts."" ""It has been a cliff edge moment."" The Royal College of Nursing said ""words are not enough"" Education is another area which has come under financial pressure, with the deal promising that schools will have a sustainable core budget. Geri Cameron, President of the National Association of Head Teachers in Northern Ireland, said while ""detail is scant"", its representatives are willing to work with MLAs going forward. Industry leaders have also been reacting to the proposals. Trade NI, which is an alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality NI, released a statement urging ""all the main parties in Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the assembly back up and running."" ""The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years."" The Institute of Directors Northern Ireland (IoDNI) said commitments for infrastructure projects such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A5 and A6 and Northern Ireland's sewage network were ""particularly pleasing"". ""Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance,"" said the IoD's National Director Kirsty McManus. ""From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal.

The secretary of state said accepting the deal would also bring about the parties' commitment to immediately ending ongoing industrial action by healthcare staff. The proposed deal also makes provision for a number of long-standing demands of environmentalists, including the idea that a new Programme for Government would see a separate climate change act for Northern Ireland - the only part of the UK without such legislation.

Until three years ago, Northern Ireland was jointly governed by its largest unionist party, the DUP, and its largest nationalist party, Sinn FÃ©in. They shared power in political institutions set up under the1998 Good Friday Agreement, a deal which brought peace to Northern Ireland after 30 years of violence known as the Troubles. Under the principles of power-sharing, Stormont's government cannot function unless it is comprised of a coalition of both unionists and nationalists. Relations between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in had deteriorated in recent years as the two parties were diametrically opposed not only on Northern Ireland's position within the UK, but also issues such as the Irish language; same-sex marriage; abortion and how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles. But unexpectedly it was a row over a green energy scheme which pushed their relationship past breaking point. TheRenewable Heat Incentive (RHI) schemewas set up by DUP leader Arlene Foster when she was enterprise minister, but it ran over budget and at one point threatened to cost taxpayers Â£490m. Sinn FÃ©in demanded that Mrs Foster step aside as first minister during an inquiry into the RHI scheme and when she refused, theypulled out of government on 9 January 2017. Two key sticking points in the Stormont talks were around an Irish language act and the petition of concern. The purpose ofpetition of concern is to protect one community from legislation that would favour another and a valid petition requires the signatures of 30 MLAs. The call for an Irish language act has been a key sticking point The draft deal says there is to be ""meaningful reform"" of the petition, which would be ""reduced and returned to its intended purpose"" and would ""only be used in the most exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, having used every other mechanism"". The proposed deal would see legislation created for the appointment of both an Irish language commissioner and an Ulster-Scots commissioner. Earlier, Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge welcomed the draft deal as ""historic advancement but added it ""falls very much short"" of promises for an Irish Language act. Other key points in the deal includethe Northern Ireland Executive settling an ongoing pay dispute with nurses and increasing policing numbers. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald told a Stormont press conference on Friday that her party will nominate ministers to an executive. She said Sinn FÃ©in was up for a return to ""genuine power sharing"". TÃ¡naiste (Irish Deputy PM) Simon Coveney and NI Secretary Julian Smith published the deal on Thursday night DUP leader Arlene Foster described the proposals as a ""fair and balanced deal"". ""I know there will be challenges in the deal, not least we need to make sure we have the finances to be able to deal with all of the issues in Northern Ireland that are present at the moment, particularly in and around the health sector."" This video can not be played 'It's a fair and balanced deal' The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood confirmed on Friday that his party will return to Stormont when the assembly is recalled. The Alliance Party also confirmed on Friday night it would support the deal. The Ulster Unionist Party are meeting on Saturday morning to decide. TÃ¡naiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney, who helped broker the deal, said: ""History is being made today."" He added: ""We now have confirmation from the two largest parties in Northern Ireland that they both are committed to re-entering an executive and establishing a functioning Stormont assembly again. The leaders of Ireland's main churches welcomed the agreement, saying it offered ""new hope"" and a ""new start"" for Northern Ireland's political institutions. In a joint statement, the leaders of the Church of Ireland, Methodist Church in Ireland, Roman Catholic Church, Presbyterian Church in Ireland and the Irish Council of Churches said the government's proposals ""offer an opportunity to build a peaceful and just society"". However, theOrange Order earlier said it has ""very serious concerns"" about the dealand could not support the proposal to appoint an Irish language commissioner.

"Tanaiste Simon Coveney and Secretary of State Julian Smith addressing the media at Stormont The British and Irish governments havepublished the text of a draft deal aimed at restoring power sharing in Northern Ireland.,external Secretary of State Julian Smith and TÃ¡naiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney made the announcement at a press conference at Stormont on Thursday evening. The move came three years to the day since devolution collapsed in Northern Ireland. If agreed, the deal, entitled New Decade, New Approach, will see the assembly reconvene on Friday. Mr Smith, who has written to the assembly speaker asking him to convene a sitting on Friday, said the deal will transform public services and restore public confidence in devolved government. This video can not be played The British and Irish governments have published the text of a draft deal aimed at restoring Stormont He asked all parties to support it, saying: ""Now is decision time, there is something in this deal for everyone."" Three years of political deadlock at Stormont 'Now is the moment' to restore devolution The secretary of state said accepting the deal would also bring about the parties' commitment to immediately ending ongoing industrial action by healthcare staff. It includes pay parity, a new action plan on waiting times and delivering reforms on health and social care. The deal would bring about the parties' commitment to ending ongoing industrial action by healthcare staff Health workers across Northern Ireland have been staging industrial action in protest against pay and staffing levels which they say are ""unsafe"". Simon Coveney said the path that led to this point had taken longer than many people thought. He said it was ""based on the extensive discussions and collective work undertaken by the parties since May last year, following the awful murder of Lyra McKee"". Ms McKee was murdered by the New IRA in April last year.The journalist was shot in the head while observing riots in Londonderry. ""The British and Irish governments, as well as all the party leaders, were left in no doubt by the wave of applause and the very public demonstration in St Anne's Cathedral that we had been called out to get politics in Northern Ireland working again,"" he said. This video can not be played 'Her murder brought us back to these talks' He added: ""I want you all to hear the words of Lyra McKee herself, the words she wrote in a book and never lived to publish. She said 'Northern Ireland is a beautiful tragedy strangled by the chains of its past, it's a place full of darkness and mysteries, but it's also my home.'"" Mr Coveney urged politicians to ""step up and fully represent their citizens"", adding: ""Forget win or lose... this is a deal full of compromises."" ""There is no need, and no public patience, for more process and more discussions. It is time for political leadership and a collective commitment to making politics work for people,"" he said. Analysis by BBC News NI Economics Editor John Campbell If the deal is done, the UK government is promising a large cash injection to tackle acute funding problems in Northern Ireland's hospitals and schools. The financial annex in the draft deal does not mention any specific figures. But last year, the most senior official in the Department of Health said he would need somewhere between Â£700m and Â£1bn to tackle waiting lists, which are the worst in the UK. So health service managers will have an expectation that a sum of a least that size will be on the way. Two key sticking points in the Stormont talks were around an Irish Language Act and the petition of concern. The purpose ofpetition of concern is to protect one community from legislation that would favour another and a valid petition requires the signatures of 30 MLAs. Simon Coveney said NI politicians need to 'step up and fully represent their citizens' The draft deal says there is to be ""meaningful reform"" of the petition, which would be ""reduced and returned to its intended purpose"" and would ""only be used in the most exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, having used every other mechanism"". The proposed deal would also see legislation created for the appointment of both an Irish language commissioner and an Ulster Scots commissioner. It also makes provision for a number of long-standing demands of environmentalists, including the idea that a new Programme for Government would see a separate climate change act for Northern Ireland - the only part of the UK without such legislation. The proposed deal would see the assembly reconvene on Friday Up until now, Northern Ireland has been bound by and fed into targets set by wider UK legislation. It proposes an independent environmental protection agency to hold government to account and to ensure compliance with environmental targets. And there is a suggestion that theill-fated RHI scheme,which helped collapse Stormont, would be shut down and replaced with different incentives to decarbonise heat. Other commitments include: Setting out a new action plan on waiting times Creating 900 new nursing and midwifery undergraduate places Police numbers increased to 7,500 New transparency measures for ministers New rules for special advisers Office of Identity and Cultural Expression set up In a statement released after the press conference,DUP leader Arlene Foster said: ""On balance, we believe there is a basis upon which the Assembly and Executive can be re-established in a fair and balanced way."" DUP leader Arlene Foster said it was 'not a perfect deal' but that 'there will always need to be give and take' The statement added: ""This is not a perfect deal and there are elements within it which we recognise are the product of long negotiations and represent compromise outcomes. There will always need to be give and take."" Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald TD said her party was ""studying the text and will give it careful consideration"". ""The Sinn FÃ©in Ard Chomhairle will meet tomorrow to fully assess it,"" she added. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the party would meet on Friday to discuss the proposed deal The Ulster Unionists said they would attend the sitting and consider the business put before them if the assembly is recalled on Friday.

"Thursday marks three years of deadlock at Stormont since the assembly and executive collapsed. Talks aimed atgetting devolved government back up and running are ongoing, but no agreement has yet been reached. Theinstitutions collapsed in January 2017when the two biggest parties - the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in - clashed over a green energy scandal. Since then, several attempts to broker a deal have failed. But following the general election in December, there was a renewed focus on restoring the institutions. If no deal is reached by Monday 13 January, Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith may hold a fresh assembly election, in line with the law. Stormont deadlock: Need-to-know guide 'Now is the moment' to restore devolution Stormont stalemate 'impacts on human rights' Before Christmas, Mr Smith blamed the DUP for the inability to secure a deal. But the party said it was unfair to single it out and that gaps remained over proposals for reforming the assembly's controversial veto mechanism - the petition of concern - and support for an Irish language act. Graffiti in Belfast calling for an Irish language act, a proposal that divides the political parties Since the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in - the two parties in government in Northern Ireland at the time - split in January 2017 the Northern Ireland Assembly has been suspended and attempts to restore it have failed. Timeline: Renewable Heat Incentive scandal Sinn FÃ©in has said it would not go back into an executive with the DUP, unless legislation for an Irish language act was implemented. The language is seen as important to the wider nationalist community, and a small number of unionists, as a symbol of identity - but in turn, it has been vigorously resisted by unionist parties. In February 2018, it appeared a deal was about to be brokered - but it collapsed at the last moment. The parties are currently engaged in a fresh round of talks to try to break the deadlock, which began after the general election in December. Going into the talks, unlike in previous negotiations, there was more optimism about the chances of a deal. The DUP lost its influence at Westminster as the Conservatives won a majority in Parliament and, along with Sinn FÃ©in, it saw its vote share drop in the general election. While they are still the biggest Stormont parties, neither will relish another election so soon. That being said, the negotiations are far from over and it is still a big ask to get the assembly restored soon. Calls for an Irish language act and reform of the petition of concern have remained sticking points. The veto mechanism is understood to be the biggest stumbling block to a deal. The petition is aimed at ensuring legislation cannot pass without cross-community support, but has faced accusations of misuse in the past. DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party favoured keeping it but reforming it. He said all parties ""agree it should be retained as an important safeguard"". The SDLP, Alliance, Sinn FÃ©in and the Ulster Unionist Party have all said they are in favour of reform. But the issue remains exactly what sort of reform can be agreed by all of the parties. Arlene Foster said a stand-alone Irish language act was not negotiable Those in favour of Irish language legislation say that it is time the language is given official recognition, protection and promotion in Northern Ireland. On Sunday, Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge described a meeting with Mr Smith as ""productive"" and that it got ""a fair hearing"". The campaign group said there was no ""legitimate justification for denying"" Irish language legislation. But the DUP opposes a stand-alone Irish language act. East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell said the language ""has a perfectly acceptable place in Northern Ireland society"". Mr Campbell added: ""Where there is an unacceptable demand to elevate it above all other minority languages, whether it is Sinn FÃ©in, other parties or HM government saying we will have to yield on this issue as it is preventing devolution returning, we will not do so.""

"The British and Irish governments have published the text of a draft deal aimed at restoring power sharing. The Northern Ireland secretary has asked the assembly speaker to convene a sitting on Friday. The DUP said the deal is ""a basis upon which the assembly can be re-established"" while Sinn FÃ©in's executive will meet to consider it. Luke Sproule, Amy Stewart and Ali Gordon The Green Party, which has two assembly members at Stormont, said it is hopeful a deal can be done. Leader Clare Bailey said: ""I think that this deal provides a chance to build towards
delivery and accountability within the institutions. âOf course, the devil is in the detail and we will continue
to scrutinise the document in full in the hope that a two party agreement can
create sustainable government.â But Ms Bailey added that there was not enough in the deal on the environment or in terms of reforming the petition of concern.  Allow Twitter content?

John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor The formulation Julian Smith is using is a significant financial package
but heâs not putting a specific figure on it. But - we can attempt to match money to some of what is in the
draft deal. Thereâs a commitment to tackle health waiting lists, the worst in
the UK. It would cost between Â£700m and Â£1bn to clear those lists. Then thereâs the health service dispute which has seen nurses
and other workers on strike, which would take another Â£50m. Thereâs a commitment to resolve a pay dispute with teachers that would require about Â£70m. Added to that is an additional education commitment to ensure schools have a sustainable core budget â in the past financial year schools combined exceeded their budget by Â£22m. Thereâs also that commitment to increase the number of police officers by about 800, requiring an additional Â£40m per year. The figures are just some of the headlines but there's a raft of other measures mentioned. The Irish government is also in the mix with Simon Coveney prepared to invest â¬110m (Â£93m) in infrastructure projects in NI over the next three years. They are also prepared to put money on the table for the new medical school in Magee. More from that statement by Conradh na Gaeilge on the Irish language provisions in the draft deal. CiarÃ¡n Mac Giolla BhÃ©in said it was ""undoubtedly a historic advancement for our community"" but also expressed concerns over some elements. He said: ""The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services."" ""The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming executive. ""Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the âofficial statusâ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation."" NI Secretary Julian Smith is ""holding the people of Northern Ireland to ransom"", the union Unison has said. It follows comments he made to BBC News NI that extra money for workers would be withheld in the absence of a deal. Health workers and nurses are currently on strike over pay and staffing levels in NI. Patricia McKeown, from Unison, told said the dispute over health workers' pay could be ""resolved immediately"". ""That's about holding the people to Northern Ireland at ransom,"" she said. ""It's about really infringing on their human rights, health workers and patients alike.""  Allow Twitter content?

"US President Donald Trump seems to think that he was overlooked for last year's Nobel Peace Prize. ""I'm going to tell you about the Nobel Peace Prize, I'll tell you about that. I made a deal, I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country. I said: 'What, did I have something to do with it?' Yeah, but you know, that's the way it is. As long as we know, that's all that matters... I saved a big war, I've saved a couple of them.""

Although he did not name the Nobel Peace Prize winner or the country, it is clear that Mr Trump was referring to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Mr Abiy, 43, is Africa's youngest head of government. Mr Abiy has been praised for introducing a series of reforms He came into office in April 2018 after months of anti-government protests forced his predecessor to resign. Mr Abiy has introduced massive liberalising reforms to Ethiopia, shaking up what was a tightly controlled nation. He freed thousands of opposition activists from jail and allowed exiled dissidents to return home. He has also allowed the media to operate freely and appointed women to prominent positions. And in October last year, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize - the only head of state to win the prize since Mr Trump was elected in 2016. The Norwegian Nobel Committee said Mr Abiy was honoured for his ""decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighbouring Eritrea"". The two countries fought a bitter border war from 1998-2000, which killed tens of thousands of people. Although a ceasefire was signed in 2000, the neighbours technically remained at war until July 2018, when Mr Abiy and Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki signed a peace deal. So for two decades, the long border was closed, dividing families and making trade impossible. The Nobel Committee said it hoped the peace agreement would help to bring about positive change to the citizens of Ethiopia and Eritrea. Since the peace deal with Eritrea, Mr Abiy has also been involved in peace processes in other African countries, the committee said. You may be interested in: Has Abiy brought peace to East Africa?

The United Arab Emirates, which has a lot of influence in the Horn of Africa, was key in helping to bring the two parties together, says the BBC's former Ethiopia correspondent, Emmanuel Igunza. Saudi Arabia also played a key role in helping end the dispute. This video can not be played Watch the massive celebrations as Ethiopia-Eritrea borders reopens The peace deal helped bring back Eritrea from the cold after sanctions were imposed in 2009. The UN Security Council lifted the sanctions in November 2018, four months after the peace deal was signed. This is not clear, given that the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded on 11 October last year, and Mr Abiy gave his acceptance speech in Oslo, Norway, on 10 December. Interestingly, Mr Trump has not officially congratulated Mr Abiy but his daughter, Ivanka Trump, who serves as his senior adviser, and the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have done so. However, Mr Trump has publicly said he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize for, among other things, his efforts to convince North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un to give up nuclear weapons. Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001. Before he became president, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling US troops out of the country. Back in 2013, hetweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!"" But in September 2017, he agreedto send 3,000 extra troopsto bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated. That same year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat,killing dozens of militantsfrom the so-called Islamic State group (IS) near the border with Pakistan. More recently though, President Trump talked of peace in the country and in February this year the USsigned an agreement with the Talibanto lift sanctions on the group and oversee a prisoner swap with the Afghan government in return for a ceasefire. Talks between the Taliban and the Afghan governmentremain ongoing, but President Trump is keen to push ahead with the withdrawal of US troops despiterecent violence. In early October, hetweetedthat the remaining troops ""should"" be home by Christmas - but thatwasn't endorsed by his top general. President Trump has dealt with two leaders of Argentina in his first term. The first, Mauricio Macri, is a man whose relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York. That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory. According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied. Mr Trump welcomed Mr Macri to the White House in April 2017 and his only trip to Latin America as president was to take part in the G20 summit hosted by the Argentine in 2018. But Mr Macri was defeated in 2019 by Alberto FernÃ¡ndez, a centre-left politician who in 2016 described Mr Trump's election win as a victory for the ""worst reactionary politics"". Unsurprisingly, Mr Trump's relationship with Mr FernÃ¡ndez has been less positive than it was with his predecessor. Just days before Mr FernÃ¡ndez entered office in December 2019, Mr Trump said he wasrestoring tariffs on steel and aluminium importsfrom Argentina - a threat that turned out to be empty but signalled a shift in the relationship. There has been less tension between the two countries this year, mostly because both have had to focus their attention on dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House. Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January 2017, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia. A Washington Postreportsaid the president abruptly ended the call after calling it ""the worst deal ever"". Mr Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation. Later in 2017,footageleaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart but officials in both countries dismissed it as harmless fun. Still, on the face of it neither episode appeared to affect the relationship much, with President Trump saying it was ""terrific"" and ""probably stronger now than ever before"". That continued when Scott Morrison replaced Mr Turnbull in 2018. He was given the full red-carpet treatment on a visit to the US in 2019 and was only the second person to have been givena state dinnerby President Trump - the other being French President Emmanuel Macron. The pair have lavished praise on one another, with Mr Trump a particular fan of Prime Minister Morrison's immigration policies. Hetweetedabout a controversial ad campaign in Australia last year, saying that ""much can be learned"" from the approach. In return, Mr Morrison haspraisedthe American president as ""a strong leader who says what he's going to do and then goes and does it"". On the campaign trail in 2016, Donald Trump referred to Belgium's capital Brussels as a ""hellhole"" and said it was no longer beautiful or safe after being attacked by terrorists earlier that year. Still, everything appeared to be amicable when he was welcomed to the country by King Philippe and Queen Mathilde in May 2017 before a Nato summit in the country. Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"". He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" andto meet Nato spending commitments- a topic Mr Trump has raised again and again during his time as president. But his most memorable moment in Belgium was when heappeared to shoveDusko Markovic, the prime minister of Montenegro, out of the way before a Nato family photo - putting his campaign slogan of ""America First"" firmly into action. President Trump has not had much to say about Brazil, South American's most influential country - a sign, perhaps, of his more isolationist approach to foreign policy. He had few public dealings with Michel Temer, while the latter was Brazil's president, but he's had a much more vocal relationship with Jair Bolsonaro, since he took over in January 2019. The Brazilian's first trip overseas after becoming president was to the US, where he swapped football shirts with Mr Trump andtold him: ""I've always admired the USA and this sense of admiration has only increased since you took office."" That high praise wouldn't have shocked many back home in Brazil, where he was dubbed the ""Trump of the Tropics"" by some parts of the media in the run-up to his election victory. President Trump has been equally lavish in his praise of Mr Bolsonaro and even said he would help Brazil join Nato - a suggestionruled outby the head of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. But the White House did designate Brazil as a ""major non-NATO ally"" in 2019, giving the country preferential access to US military equipment and training. Also notable is that Mr Trump and Mr Bolsonaro have shared a similar view of the coronavirus pandemic with both downplaying the seriousness of the threat it posed. They are also among a handful of world leaders to have caught the virus themselves, with both recovering fully. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language. As the African Union expressed ""shock, dismay and outrage"" and demanded an apology, Botswanasummoned the US ambassadorand asked the envoy ""to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a 'shithole' country given that there are Botswana nationals residing in the US."" According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and he will have been pleased with how it went. Not only did he deal with President Trump'sfierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada. But the relationship between the two leaders became strained not long after that first meeting with those tensions surfacing in public in June 2018 at a G7 summit in Quebec. When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade before tweeting that the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Most of the animosity was generated by President Trump's desire to replace Nafta, the North American Free Trade Agreement signed in 1994 by the US, Mexico and Canada. He used tariffs to encourage both nations torenegotiate a deal, which was eventually agreed in October 2018. After theannouncement, Mr Trumptweeted: ""Mexico, Canada and the United States are a great partnership and will be a very formidable trading force. We will now, because of the USMCA, work very well together. Great Spirit!"" Mr Trudeau, who has been in office since November 2015, has certainly had a slightly different relationship with Mr Trump to the ""bromance"" he had with former President Barack Obama. Describing Mr Trump's style, the Canadian PMsaid in 2018: ""The president prides himself on a level of disruption and unpredictability that is challenging certain aspects of global systems that we've perhaps taken for granted. And, it does keep me on my toes."" President Trump was quick to congratulate SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, a conservative like himself, when he was voted into office in January 2018,sayinghe looked forward to working together on ""issues of mutual interest"". Since then, the two billionaire presidents - Mr PiÃ±era's estimated personal fortune is about $2.7bn (£2bn) - have had few dealings in public. But when the country was rocked by protests over inequality in late 2019, President Trumpbackedhis Chilean counterpart despite accusations from Amnesty International and others that the security forces were using excessive force on demonstrators. More recently, President PiÃ±era has tried to use his good relationship with Mr Trump to put Chile in ""pole position"" to get early access to a vaccine for coronavirus should the US develop one. Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail in 2016 that it turned intoa meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US. After entering the White House, he antagonised Beijing again by breaking with diplomatic norms and accepting a call from the president of Taiwan, which is considered a breakaway province by China. When China raised objections, however, President Trump spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping on the phone andagreed to followthe so-called ""One China"" policy, which states that there is only one Chinese government. After that initial tension, Mr Trump changed tack and in April 2017 hosted his Chinese counterpart at Mar-a-Lago, his retreat on the Florida coast,sayingtheir relationship was ""outstanding"" and that ""tremendous progress"" had been made in their talks. President Xi then welcomed Mr Trump to Beijing in November that year, with the Americandescribingthe ceremony as a ""truly memorable and impressive display"". At a joint press conference afterwards, Mr Trumptoldthe Chinese president: ""You are a very special man."" The two countries spent a lot of 2018 discussing a trade deal, with President Trump complaining that previous negotiations had been ""so one sided in favour of China"". But despite the talks, no agreement emerged and the two countries engaged in a trade war that carried over into 2019. A ""phase one"" deal was eventually signed at the beginning of 2020, with Mr Trump modestlydeclaring it""one of the greatest trade deals ever made!"" Analysts were split over how good a deal it was, but both leaders were able topresent themselves as winners. Not long after celebrating the deal, President Trumptweetedabout a little known virus in China that was beginning to look concerning: ""China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!"" Two months later, more than 1,000 people infected with the virus had died in the US and the number of confirmed cases was fast approaching 100,000. Mr Trumpdescribedhaving had a ""good conversation"" with President Xi and said: ""We are working closely together. Much respect!"" But by the summer of 2020 though, his tone had changed. Mr Trump began referring to coronavirus as the ""China virus"" andtweeted: ""China has caused great damage to the United States and the rest of the World!"" And as the election has neared, he's upped his anti-China rhetoric,accusing themof working to replace him with his Democratic rival Joe Biden ""so they can continue to rip-off the United States"". Donald Trump's relationship with the two Colombian presidents he's dealt with - first Juan Manuel Santos and then IvÃ¡n Duque - has concentrated on drug cartels and Venezuela. He has hosted both men at the White House and held talks with them on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. President Duque visited the White House in February 2019, mainly to discuss the situation in Colombia's neighbour Venezuela, which has been engulfed ina political crisisfor several years now. In a joint press conference after the meeting, the US president was asked if he would be visiting Colombia, to which hereplied: ""I'll be visiting. I really want to. I want to visit Colombia. I look forward to visiting."" He's yet to make the trip. Later that year, President Trumpsaidof US-Colombia ties: ""We have a great relationship. They're not doing badly. They have a problem because of Venezuela a lot of people are pouring in. But Colombia, we've had a great relationship with Colombia."" One of Donald Trump's many campaign promises was that he would roll back on President Obama's historic move in 2014 to restore full diplomatic relations with Cuba. Once in office, Mr Trump did indeedsayhe was ""cancelling"" the deal with Cuba and he re-imposed certain travel and trade restrictions eased by his predecessor. But the president's approach has not scrapped all of the Obama-era policy regarding the island nation. Both countries will keep their embassies open in each other's capitals, commercial flights will continue and US tourists can still visit the country, albeit under stricter conditions. During a speech in 2017 in Miami's Little Havana neighbourhood, where Mr Trump signed a directive outlining his policy, he lambasted President Obama's deal with the ""brutal"" Castro government as ""terrible and misguided"". He said the US would not lift sanctions on Cuba until ""all political prisoners are freed"" and vowed to ""help the Cuban people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives"". Later that year, the US withdrew most staff from its embassy in Havana after several people there came down with mysterious health issues, including hearing loss, nausea and dizziness. US officials said the incident was an acoustic attack, but it remainsa bit of a mystery. As the election approaches, President Trump has sought to win over the large population of Cuban-Americans in the swing state of Florida by tightening the sanctions on the country. Talking at a ceremony in September honoring veterans of the failed Bay of Pigs operation in 1961, Mr Trump described his predecessors' policy as ""weak"" and ""pathetic"" andboasted: ""I canceled the Obama-Biden sellout to the Castro regime."" President Trump has had a bumpy relationship with Denmark's leaders. Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House. Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence. But the meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" However, things got a little bizarre in August 2019 when it emerged that President Trump haddiscussed buying Greenland, the autonomous Danish territory. Mr Rasmussen, who had been replaced as PM a couple of months earlier,tweetedhis response to the story: ""It must be an April Fool's Day joke ... but totally out of season!"" But it wasn't a joke and Mr Trump promptly cancelled a planned trip to Denmark after Mette Frederiksen, the new Danish prime minister, described the suggested sale as ""absurd"" - a comment Mr Trumpcalled""nasty"". Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him. Their close relationship continued once Mr Trump was in office and President Sisi visited the White House in April 2017 for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013. Human rights groups, however, criticised Mr Trump for meeting a man accused of a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead. But officials said the US was seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because President Trump saw a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against terrorism. Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East. The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia in May 2017. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstances"". An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands ona glowing orbat the meeting set social media abuzz. The US did withhold $195 million in military aid to Egypt in 2017 amid concerns about the country's human rights record - butthe funds were releasedthe following year. Mr Trump has not visited Egypt as president but his wife has been there while first lady. The most memorable moment of Melania Trump's visit, which was part of a whistle-stop tour of Africa in October 2018, was a tour of the Giza pyramids she didsporting a Panama hat. President Trump's relationship with El Salvador got off to a bumpy start when he was reported to have made a controversial remark during a meeting with US lawmakers about a new immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language. Mr Trump's administrationannouncedin January 2018 that it would cancel permits that allow nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the US. They were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) after earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001. Salvadoreans were originally given until January 2020 to leave, face deportation, or find a legal way to stay. But that deadlinewas extendedto January 2021. President Trump met Salvadorean President Nayib Bukele on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September 2019, wherehe told reportersthat the relationship between the two men ""has been excellent"". In April this year, Mr Trumptweetedthat the US would be helping El Salvador get ventilators amid the coronavirus pandemic, saying: ""They have worked well with us on immigration at the Southern Border!"" Ethiopia hasn't featured on Mr Trump's agenda for much of his presidency, but he has caused some controversy in the capital Addis Ababa this year. In January, President Trump said he deserved a Nobel Peace Prize because he had ""made a deal"" that ""saved a country"" - seemingly a reference to negotiations between Ethiopia and Eritrea that ended in a peace deal between the two countries. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed won the prestigious prize for his part in the process, which appeared to upset Mr Trump somewhat. Speaking at a campaign rally in Ohio, the presidentsaid: ""I made a deal, I saved a country, and I just heard that the head of that country is now getting the Nobel Peace Prize for saving the country... As long as we know, that's all that matters... I saved a big war."" While not integral to the talks between Ethiopia and Eritrea, Mr Trump did play a role in discussions over water resources in the region between Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan. Ethiopia is building a huge dam on part of the River Nile within its borders, but this has upset neighbouring Sudan and Egypt who are concerned about water shortages further up the river. In Addis Ababa, the US is seenas having sided with Egypton the dispute. The US announced in September that it would cut some aid to Ethiopia after it began filling the reservoir behind the dam in July, while discussions with Egypt and Sudan were still under way. In October, while on a call with the leaders of Sudan and Israel, Mr Trump said the issue of the dam was a ""very dangerous situation because Egypt is not going to be able to live that way,"" adding: ""I say it loud and clear - they'll blow up that dam. And they have to do something."" In response, PM Abiy Ahmedsaid: ""Ethiopia will not cave in to aggression of any kind."" He added that threats of any kind over the issue were ""misguided, unproductive and clear violations of international law"". Finland's President Sauli NiinistÃ¶ was invited to the White House in October 2019 but his relationship with Donald Trump has been fairly low-key. In fact, his visit was overshadowed by questions surrounding Mr Trump's impending impeachment and much of the leaders' joint press conference was taken up byan angry exchangebetween the American president and a reporter. Another notable moment in the relationship came in 2018 amid bad wildfires in California, when Mr Trump said poor management was to blame and pointed towards Finland as a country that managed the risk better. ""I was with the president of Finland,"" Mr Trumptold reporters, ""and he said: 'We're a forest nation' and they spent a lot of time on raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don't have any problem."" President Niinisto, however, said he could not remember talking about raking when the two met. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president. After the first meeting between the two men in Brussels in May 2017, Mr Macron described his white-knuckledhandshakewith Mr Trump as ""not innocent"". But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day event as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"". Although there was an awkward moment during the trip, when Mr Trumptold President Macron and his wifethat she was ""in such good shape"". President Macron visited the White House in April 2018 and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel. But despite their differences on policy, they appear to get on well. There have been several moments of tension though. In November 2019, President MacrondescribedNato as ""brain dead"" because of a waning commitment to the alliance by the US. Mr Trumphit backby saying the French leader had been ""nasty"" and ""very disrespectful"". He also called Mr Macron ""foolish"" when France moved to introduce a tax on US technology companies and threatened to add a tax on French wine as retaliation, tweeting: ""I've always said American wine is better than French wine!"" Mr Macron put the new taxon hold. President Trump's only mention of Georgia on Twitter  was in 2017, when heposed for a photowith the country's leader at the time, Giorgi Kvirikashvili, at the White House. He has not yet met the new Georgian prime minister, Giorgi Gakharia, but hereportedlysent him a letter in May this year to celebrate the country's independence day. In the letter, President Trump thanked Georgia for its ""significant contributions"" to the Nato mission in Afghanistan and said the US would continue to support the country's bid to become a Nato member state. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world. Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017. President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, hetook to Twitterto describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year. The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"". The pair have met several times since that first meeting and while Mr Trump has paid tribute to Mrs Merkel in public, his tone on Twitter is often less approving. President Trump has repeatedly taken issue with Germany failing to spend the Nato target of 2% on defence,accusingthe country of being ""delinquent"" in its payments to the alliance. He has also accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"". But it has not been empty rhetoric from President Trump. In July this year, the USannouncedit was withdrawing about 12,000 of its troops from Germany in what officials described as a ""strategic"" repositioning of its forces in Europe. Mr Trump's explanation was a little more direct, telling reporters: ""We don't want to be the suckers anymore. We're reducing the force because they're not paying their bills; it's very simple."" The visit of Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October 2017 could have been awkward, as he had previously criticised Mr Trump and even called him ""evil"". But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Mr Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech."" Mr Tsipras said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. The Greek prime minister was replaced by Kyriakos Mitsotakis in January 2019 and Mr Trump hosted him and his wife at the White House a year later. Speaking in the Oval Office, Mr Trump said the relationship between the two countries was ""really extraordinary"" and said Greece had made a ""tremendous comeback"" after its financial crisis. Mr Mitsotakis will have charmed the president by comparing his economic policy to Mr Trump's, saying: ""The Greek economy has done extremely well over the past months. We have lowered taxes. We are deregulating. We're following a recipe that has also worked here."" The pair spoke again on the phone in August this year, with Mr Trumpexpressing concernsabout rising tension between Greece and Turkey. In September, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met Mr Mitsotakis during a visit to a US naval base on the Greek island of Crete andsaid: ""The relationship between our two countries is at an all-time high and getting stronger."" Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Hetweetedthat he had ""never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said 'take them out.'"" Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump reportedly asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language. Haiti's US Ambassador Paul Altidortold the BBCthe idea that ""we're simply immigrants who come here to take advantage of the US"" is wrong. In 2017, the Department of Homeland Securityannouncedthat Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation, granted to Haitians following the 2010 earthquake, would end in July 2019. The move was initially deemed unlawful but in September 2020, an appeals courtsided with the Trump administration, meaning those with TPS could be forced to leave the US early next year. Joe Biden, Mr Trump's Democratic rival in the election, has vowed to reverse the decision if he wins. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked: ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"". President Trump has sought to decrease the number of migrants coming into the country from Latin America,threateningto cut aid to Honduras unless its government stopped large caravans of people heading towards the US. He has also tried to reduce the number of Hondurans already in the country, with his administration announcing in June 2018 that it was ending the Temporary Protection Status (TPS) that had granted nearly 60,000 Hondurans the right to live in the US. Hondurans were granted this status after Hurricane Mitch hit the Central American country in 1998, but the Department of Homeland Security said conditions in the country had ""notably improved"" since the disaster. At the moment, the TPS for Hondurans in the US is due to end in January 2021, but Joe Biden, Mr Trump's Democratic rival in the election, has vowed to reverse the decision if he wins. President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi several times and the pair appear to have developed a strong relationship. At the White House in June 2017, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations. ""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who described himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"". President Trump dispatched his daughter Ivanka to India in November 2017 for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"", with officials in Hyderabadremoving beggarsfrom the streets and rushing through road repairs before she arrived. But the president himself finally visited the country in February this year and was welcomed by huge crowds everywhere he went. Mr Modi organiseda huge eventto honour President Trump - thought to have cost more than $13m - with 100,000 people turning up to hear the two men speak. Although, most of them wereon their way outby half-way through Mr Trump's speech. During the speech, Mr Trump spoke of increasing defence cooperation between the two countries and said India had agreed to buy helicopters and other US military equipment worth $3bn. He told the crowd: ""I believe that the United States should be India's premier defence partner, and that's the way it's working out."" The pair wereunable to agree a trade dealduring President Trump's visit though, but they announced that negotiations would continue. Trade has been the major hiccup to their relationship so far, with Mr Trumpcomplainingin 2019 that Indian tariffs on US products were ""unacceptable"". Another recent move that will have strained relations between the two was Mr Trump'slate-night Twitter announcement in Aprilthat he was suspending immigration into the US in a bid to ease unemployment among Americans due to the coronavirus pandemic. The move included the H-1B visa, which allows US companies to employ highly-skilled foreign workers and is widely used by the technology sector. Indiansreportedlymake up nearly 70% of the 85,000 H-1B visas issued every year. Mr Trump and Indonesia's President Joko Widodo have met a few times at international and regional summits. The only mention Mr Widodo has had in the president's tweetswas in April this yearwhen Mr Trump said his ""friend"" had asked for ventilators to help cope with the coronavirus pandemic, which the US would provide. ""Great cooperation between us!"" he added. Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration in 2017, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised some eyebrows in the US. ""I don't know whether I am the only Indonesian who was invited, but I didn't see any other over there,"" he told Indonesian magazineTempoin February 2017. Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and he told the magazine he has ""close access"" to the US president. In June 2019, it wasreportedthat President Trump had sold a mansion he owned in Los Angeles to Mr Tanoesoedibjo for some $13.5 million. While Donald Trump hasn't spoken to Iran's leader since coming to power, he has spent a lot of his time talking about the country. One of his administration's first moves was to impose new sanctions against the country in response to a ballistic missile test, which Tehran said had not violated a UN resolution on its nuclear activities. The US confirmed that Tehran was continuing to comply with the UN agreement but Mr Trumplabelled ita ""terrible deal"" and ordered a review into it nonetheless. During a trip to Israel in 2017, Mr TrumpsaidIran ""must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon - never, ever - and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias."" He later claimed in a tweet that Iran was working with North Korea to develop nuclear weapons. Then in May 2018, President Trump finally decided to pull out of the UN agreement with Iran,saying: ""It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of this deal."" Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015. In June 2019, Iranannouncedit would ignore some elements on the deal and begin ramping up enrichment of low-grade uranium. President Trumprespondedon Twitter by saying: ""Be careful with the threats, Iran. They can come back to bite you like nobody has been bitten before!"" Then in December 2019, the rhetoric turned into violence when the USconducted air strikesin Iraq and Syria against an Iran-backed Iraqi militia blamed for an attack that killed a US civilian contractor. In response, protesters attacked the US embassy in Baghdad and Mr Trump said Iran was responsible,tweeting: ""They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat."" Then just a couple of days later,a US air strikein Iraq killed Iran's most powerful military commander, General Qasem Soleimani. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei promised ""severe revenge"" on those behind the attack and missiles were fired at air bases housing US forces in Iraq. In September, Mr Trumptweetedabout reports that Iran was preparing to retaliate for the killing of Gen Soleimani and said any attack on the US would be met with an attack on Iran ""that will be 1,000 times greater in magnitude!"" Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq was central to his initial foreign policy objectives in office. However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq. Eventually, however, Iraq was taken off the list after it agreed to conditions from the US government. That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trumpover the phonein February 2017 amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters. Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trumptold reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now."" In July 2018, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart,sayingthe city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. Battles against IS continued into 2019, but a happy President Trumppresented a mapin March of that year showing how their territory had been eradicated since he came into office, telling reporters: ""So that's the way it goes."" Then in October 2019, Mr TrumpannouncedIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had killed himself during a US military operation in Syria, saying he had been ""violently eliminated"" and ""died like a coward"". The president later praised a US military dog for the ""wonderful job"" it did in the operation,tweeting a photothat he said had been declassified. Despite the successful operation against IS forces, there was some tension between the US and Iraq later in 2019. Whena US air strikein Baghdad killed Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, Iraq's parliament called on US troops to leave the country. Mr TrumpthreatenedIraq with ""sanctions like they've never seen before"" and US troops remained in the country. President Trump is now talking about US troops in Iraq returning home though. During a meeting with the country's new prime minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, President Trumpsaid: ""We're going to be leaving, and hopefully we're going to be leaving a country that can defend itself."" In September, the USannouncedit was reducing its force in the country that month from about 5,200 to 3,000. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Latin America and the Middle East, but thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US have also been concerned. Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March 2017,sayingthere were ""millions out there who want to... make America great."" Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March 2018, saying the two had ""become friends - fast friends - over a short period of time"". After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US. President Trump did visit Ireland in June 2019,telling reportersduring the trip: ""We love the Irish, so it's an honour to be here."" Mr Trump spent two nights at the golf resort he owns in Doonbeg, County Clare, during the trip - where his sonspaid a visitto a local pub. Despite the pair's good relationship, Mr Varadkar was critical of the US earlier this year when hesaidthere had been an ""absence of moral leadership"" in the wake of protests over the killing of unarmed black men by white police officers. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel. He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he had come to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the two countries. In August that year, Mr Trumptweetedthat ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!"" But by December he had chosen a new path,recognisingJerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called the move ""deplorable"" and said the US could no longer be a peace broker. Mr Trump pushed ahead with the decision though and in May 2018, his daughter Ivanka waspart of a delegationdispatched to open a new US embassy in Jerusalem. Marking the one year anniversary of the opening, President Trumptweetedin May 2019: ""Our beautiful embassy stands as a proud reminder of our strong relationship with Israel and of the importance of keeping a promise and standing for the truth."" In a sign of his warm relationship with Mr Netanyahu, the president congratulated him on becoming the country's longest serving prime minister in July 2019,tweetingthat he had ""led Israel with a commitment to the values of democracy, freedom, and equal opportunity that both our nations cherish and share!"" In January 2020, President Trumpunveiledhis long-awaited ""vision for peace, prosperity and a brighter future for the Israelis and Palestinians"". Mr Netanyahu called the plan the ""opportunity of the century"" but the Palestinian president dismissed it as the ""slap of the century"". In September, Mr Trumphailedthe ""dawn of a new Middle East"" after the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed agreements fully normalising their relations with Israel - becoming just the third and fourth Arab countries to recognise Israel since its founding in 1948. President Trump has dealt with two Italian prime ministers during his time in the White House. The first, Paolo Gentiloni, waswelcomedto Washington DC in April 2017 and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough. But the president was clearly happier after meeting Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June 2018. After a brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US presidentcalledMr Conte a ""great guy"". The two leaders have some similarities in their policies, with Mr Trump tweeting in 2018 that he'dspoken toMr Conte about Italy's ""very hard line on illegal immigration"" and said: ""I agree with their stance 100%, and the US is likewise taking a very hard line on illegal immigration."" In March this year, Mr Trumptweeted a videoof Italian air force jets creating their national flag with coloured smoke and said: ""THE UNITED STATES LOVES ITALY!"" The display came amid a rising death toll from the coronavirus pandemic in Italy. President Trump visited the country twice in quick succession in May 2017 and he also travelled to Vatican City where hemetwith Pope Francis, which hedescribedas the ""honour of a lifetime"". Amid the NFL national anthem controversy in 2017, President Trump singled out Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt as an example for other sportspeople to follow. Hetweeted: ""Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!"" Mr Trump had criticised NFL players who kneel during the national anthem as a protest, to highlight the treatment of black Americans. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan. Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice and paid several visits to the White House. Mr Trump spoke to the Japanese leader frequently throughout his first two years in office, mainly to discuss US negotiations with North Korea. Golf has been a key part of their relationship and they've managed to fit in several rounds, playingin Floridaand alsoin Virginia. The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November 2017 - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he tooka tumble into a bunker. Mr Trump was keen to land a new trade deal with Japan,tweetingin 2019 that Mr Abe has been ""working with me to help balance out the one-sided Trade with Japan"". The two countries did agree an initial deal focusing on agriculture in September that year, with President Trumpcalling ita ""tremendous"" agreement. Prime Minister Aberesignedfor health reasons in August 2020, with Mr Trumpsayinghe would soon be ""recognised as the greatest Prime Minister in the history of Japan"". Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had several meetings since. The first occasion came in February 2017 on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation. King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April that year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June 2018 as well. Jordan was a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help. ""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. The relationship was strained in late 2017 though, when President Trump announced that the US would be recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and moving its embassy there. King Abdullahsaidthe decision would ""undermine efforts to resume the peace process"". US relations with Kenya were always likely to be very different under Donald Trump to how they were under Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan. When Mr Trump entered office in 2017, his decision to speak to the leaders of three African nations - Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa - before speaking to Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta was taken as a snub by some in the country. When they did speak, the two leadersdiscussedsecurity in the region and President Trump praised Kenya's ""significant contributions"" to the African Union force fighting against the al-Shabaab group in neighbouring Somalia. While President Trump has not visited the country - or any others in Africa - First Lady Melania Trump did stop in Kenya briefly during herwhirlwind tourof the continent in October 2018. But her decision to wear a pith helmet while on safaricaused some controversy. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, for the first time during his May 2017 visit to Saudi Arabia. He called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans. The emir then visited the White Houselater that yearand held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"". President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according toPolitico. The Kuwaiti emir visited the White House again in 2018, when President Trumpdescribedhim as ""a very special friend of mine"". Earlier this year, while the emir was being treated for an illness in the US, Mr Trump awarded him the Legion of Merit, a rarely awarded honour,sayinghe had ""been a truly unwavering friend and partner to the United States"" and an ""unparalleled diplomat"". The emir died at the age of 91in September. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record showshe backed actionat the time. HehostedLibyan Prime Minister Fayez Al-Sarraj at the White House in December 2017, where the pair ""agreed to work together to advance Libyan stability and unity"". The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. But the US leader has been keen to take a less engaged approach to the country's problems,telling reportersin 2017 that he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. Since then, however, the country has become a battleground for regional powers with Turkey and Russia backing opposing forces. Mr Trump has appeared keen not to get involved in the ground war. Astatementfrom Robert O'Brien, his national security adviser, in August said the US was deeply troubled by the ""escalating conflict"" but remained an ""active, but neutral, actor"". No Donald Trump rally during his 2016 election campaign was complete without the crowd chanting: ""Build the wall, build the wall!"" It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency. Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay for it, officially announced his intention to build the wall inan executive ordersigned on 25 January 2017. Two days later, Mexican President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall."" Mr PeÃ±a Nieto and Mr Trump unsurprisingly had a bumpy relationship at best. The Mexican leader was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president. But Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador, who became the new Mexican president in 2018. They spoke for the first time in July that year, with Mr Trumpsayinghe had predicted Mr Obrador would become president of Mexico years earlier. In 2019, President Trump turned up the rhetoric once again,accusingMexico of having ""taken advantage of the United States for decades"" andthreateningto put tariffs on their goods. But after negotiations, the two countriessigned a dealthat required Mexico to deploy troops along its southern border with Guatemala to stem the flow of migrants heading for the US. Earlier this year, Mr LÃ³pez Obrador said President Trump had ""completely changed his rhetoric"" towards the country,telling a reporter: ""The relationship with President Trump is very good and, as I said yesterday, he has treated us like friends, not as distant neighbours."" A few months after Jacinda Ardern became prime minister of New Zealand, the headline ofa featureabout her in Vogue magazine called her ""young, forward-looking, and unabashedly liberal - call her the Anti-Trump"". So it should come as no surprise that Ms Ardern and Mr Trump have not become best friends - but their relationship has appeared amicable enough most of the time. The pair met for the first time at a summit in Vietnam in 2017, where Ms Ardern said President Trump joked to someone else present that she had ""caused a lot of upset in her country"" with her election win. She replied: ""You know, no-one marched when I was elected."" When New Zealand suffered from a terrorist attack in March 2019, Mr Trump said he had spoken to Prime Minister Ardern andtold her""we stand in solidarity with New Zealand â and that any assistance the USA can give, we stand by ready to help. We love you New Zealand!"" The two leaders had a private meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in September 2019, with Mr Trumpdescribingit as ""wonderful"". But there has been some tension recently, specifically over the two countries' different approach to dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. In August this year, Mr TrumpallegedNew Zealand was experiencing a ""big surge"" in cases but Ms Ardernsaidhis comparison of her country and the US was ""patently wrong"". On the day of Mr Trump's remark, the US recorded 40,000 new cases while New Zealand had just nine. And in October, when Ms Ardern was asked whether President Trump had called to congratulate her on an historic election victory, shetold reporters: ""I don't tend to have those direct communications with the president of the United States."" Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal, in part to deal with an influx of migrants from Central America. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked: ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?"" Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language. Mr Trump's administrationannouncedin November 2017 that it would remove the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Nicaragua, introduced in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America. At the moment, the TPS for Nicaraguans in the US is due to end in January 2021, but Joe Biden, Mr Trump's Democratic rival in the election, has vowed to reverse the decision if he wins. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February 2017. During the call, Mr Trumpsignalled his intentionto renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people. Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April 2018, Mr Trumpsaidthe aircraft would help ""improve Nigeria's ability to target terrorists and protect civilians"". The controversial deal went ahead, despite some concerns from members of Congress, and the aircraft are due to be delivered in 2021. There wasan awkward momentfor both leaders at that joint press conference in 2018 when a journalist asked about reports that Mr Trump had referred to some African countries as ""shitholes"". President Buhari sidestepped the question, saying he was unsure of the report's validity, but Mr Trump didn't deny he'd made the comment. ""The [Nigerian] president knows me and he knows where I'm coming from,"" Mr Trump said. ""And you do have some countries that are in very bad shape and very tough places to live in."" Earlier this year, President Trumpexpandedhis administration's curbs on immigration to include six more countries, including Nigeria, reportedly due to them not meeting US security and information-sharing standards. In response, President Buharisaidthe country would work to fix the issues in order to maintain ""productive relations"" with the US. President Trump made history in June 2018 when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader. It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump hadthreatenedto unleash ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"" if North Korea endangered the US. The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk. Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months - including the presidenttweetingthat he had a ""nuclear button"" and it was ""much bigger and more powerful one than his"" - as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed. In 2018, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down with Mr Kim and eventually the long-awaited summit happened in Singapore in June, with the US presidentthankingthe North Korean leader for taking ""the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people"". The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It committed North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promised ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang. They met again in Hanoi in February 2019 but talks ended without agreement after the US refused North Korean demands for sanctions relief. ""Sometimes you have to walk and this was one of those times,"" Mr Trumpsaid afterwards. In May that year, North Korea tested several missiles, but President Trumptweeted: ""Deal will happen!"" The next month, Mr Trump became the first sitting US president to step foot in North Korea bymeeting Mr Kim in the Demilitarized Zone. But talks broke down again later in the year and North Korea conducteda further seriesof missile tests in March 2020. Speaking at the White House in September, Mr Trumpsaidhe had saved ""millions of lives"" by averting a war with North Korea. When Prime Minister Erna SolbergmetMr Trump in Washington in 2018 she may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jetonly available in Call of Duty, a computer game. A day later Norway wasreportedlymentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and called some African nations ""shitholes"". Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Responding to Mr Trump, Torbjoern Saetre, a politician in Norway's Conservative Party,tweeted: ""On behalf of Norway: Thanks, but no thanks."" Tensions between the US and its previously close ally have been strained for years, but it was clear that the relationship would become even more strained when President Trump outlined his strategy towards the region in his first year in office. ""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order and peace,"" Mr Trump said ina speechin August 2017. In January 2018, he took to Twitter again toaccusePakistan of giving ""safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan"" before adding: ""No more!"" Military aid worth $300m (£230m) was eventuallycutin September that year, with a Pentagon spokesman saying the US would continue ""to press Pakistan to indiscriminately target all terrorist groups"". It was with this as the backdrop that new Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan flew to Washington DCto meet President Trumpfor the first time in July 2019. There were smiles for the cameras and Mr Trump openeda joint press conferenceby calling Mr Khan ""very popular"" and ""a great athlete"". He once again accused Pakistan of failing to respect the US in recent years but he said the country was ""helping us a lot now"". Shortly after their meeting, there was renewed violence in Kashmir between Pakistani and Indian forces. At a meeting with Mr Khan in September during the UN General Assembly, Mr Trump offered to mediate between the two sides,saying: ""I think I would be an extremely good arbitrator. I have done it before, believe it or not, and I have never failed as an arbitrator."" The pair met again earlier this year, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos in January. Mr Trumpsaidthe relationship between the two countries had ""never been closer"" but admitted he had no plans to visit the country - although he didtravel to Indiathe next month. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017. He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"". During avisitto Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again later that month, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace. But Mr Trump'srecognitionof Jerusalem as Israel's capital in December 2017 led to a sharp deterioration in relations as didhis threatsto withdraw financial support. Discussing Mr Trump's plans for Middle East peace in January 2018, Mr Abbassaid: ""The deal of the century is the slap of the century and we will not accept it."" Later that year, the USended its fundingfor the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, describing it a ""irredeemably flawed"" - a move President Abbas said was an ""assault"" against his people. Despite the rift though, Mr Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, told reporters in June 2019 that the president was ""very fond"" of Mr Abbas,adding: ""He likes him very much personally. And at the right time, if they're willing to engage, I believe that they'll find that they'll have an opportunity."" President Trumpunveiled the detailsof his Middle East peace plan in January 2020, which involved recognising Israeli sovereignty over settlements in the West Bank. Mr Abbas rejected the plan andsaid: ""All our rights are not for sale and are not for bargain."" As recently as September, however, President Trump said his plan was still on the table. Talking at a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, hesaid: ""We're working on a deal. We're talking to the Palestinians. At the right time, they'll be joining too."" President TrumpmetPresident Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs. But the most memorable moment from their joint press conference was when Mr Trumpappeared to take creditfor building the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914. ""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" the president said at the meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it, right?"" ""Yeah. One hundred years ago,"" Mr Varela responded. Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"". Mr Varela was replaced by Laurentino Cortizo in 2019. Mr Trumpsent a delegationto Mr Cortizo's inauguration, led by Commerce secretary Wilbur Ross. Mr Cortizosaidhe spoke to Mr Trump on the phone in May this year, during which the American president offered to help Panama during the coronavirus pandemic. Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski had a substantial amount of contact with Mr Trump in his first few months in the White House. The two men spoke several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski also visited Washington DC for a meeting with the president. As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president was particularly interested in persuading the USto deportits fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo. Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. But he was eventuallyarrestedin the US in July 2019 before beingreleased on bailin March this year because of the risk he faced of contracting coronavirus while waiting for trial. Mr Kuczynski was replaced by MartÃ­n Vizcarra in March 2018. Mr Trump was due to meet President Vizcarra at a summit in Peru's capital Lima in April 2018, but hecancelled the tripat short notice to deal with reports of a chemical weapons attack in Syria. Donald Trump has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they caused a lot of controversy in the US. Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" in which theydiscussed""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world."" Mr Duterte has beenwidely criticisedfor human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila. His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Dutertecalled hima ""son of a whore"". Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart. After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trumphailedtheir ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"". Mr Trump did invite Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Earlier this year, Mr Dutertesaidhis American counterpart ""is a good president and deserves to be re-elected"". Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people. During avisitthere in July 2017, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"". Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victory over war"" during his speech in Warsaw. He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance. ""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. Polish President Andrzej Duda has visited the White House a couple of times since then, most recently in June 2019, when Mr Trumptweeted: ""US-Poland ties are at an all-time high. Thank you for being such an exemplary Ally!"" Mr Trump sent hiscongratulationsto Mr Duda after he was re-elected in July this year. A month later, the USannouncedit was redeploying about 1,000 American troops from Germany to Poland. The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself. The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition. But soon after that, several Gulf countriescut travel and embassy linkswith Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denied supporting radical Islamism. Mr Trump took initialcreditfor applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"". In June 2017, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism,tweeting: ""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar â look!"" Barely a year later, however, Mr Trump welcomed Sheikh Tamim to the White House andpraised himfor becoming a ""big advocate"" of combating terrorist financing. He also said the emir was a ""great gentleman"" and a ""friend of mine"". Theymet againin the White House the following year. Mr TrumpsaidQatar was ""creating a lot of jobs"" in the US by ""buying tremendous amounts of military equipment including planes and they are buying commercial planes... we very much appreciate it"". No US relationship has been more closely scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia. At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki in July 2018, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election. He was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election. ""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" hereplied. But a day later, Mr Trump saidhe had misspoken. ""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US. A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's team during the election campaign. Iteventually concludedthat Russia had interfered in the election with the intention of benefitting Mr Trump's campaign but that there was no evidence the campaign conspired with Russia. Mr Trump has tweeted more about Russia than any other country during his time as president, with the investigation being a big reason why. His administration has been pretty tough on Russia, punishing it with sanctions. But Mr Trump has also spoken of his desire to improve relations with Russia. In March 2018, hetweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory. The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thingâ¦"" Then the following month, healarmed alliesby saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. In December 2019, President Putinwarnedthat the US now viewed space as ""a military theatre"" and said Russia needed to develop its own space forces further. But a few weeks later, hethankedMr Trump for US intelligence that helped foil ""acts of terrorism"" on Russian soil. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that has continued under President Trump - despite some issues along the way. Mr Trumpmade his first foreign tripas president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud in Riyadh, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (£270bn). Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when hetook partin a ceremonial sword dance during the trip. Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to want to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia ina diplomatic standoffwith Qatar. When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trumptweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!"" There was some tension when Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist with US residency,was killed in Turkeyin October 2018. President Erdogan of Turkey said it was a ""political murder"" carried out by Saudi intelligence officers, which Saudi Arabia denied. Speaking to reporters at the White House, Mr Trumpsaid: ""They had a very bad original concept, it was carried out poorly and the cover-up was the worst in the history of cover-ups. He latersaidhe had spoken to King Salman, whose denial was ""very, very strong,"" beforeadding: ""It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers. Who knows?"" More recently, Mr Trump called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Hetweetedhis gratitude when the Saudis and Russia agreed on a deal in April. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong several times during his four years in office. Their relationship had an awkward moment early on, when the president's social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram after their first meeting at a G20 summit andmistakenly identifiedthe prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo. But Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House a few months later during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion. Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" The two men also signalled the two countries' alliance in 2019 when they renewed a military pact that allows US forces to use Singapore's air and naval bases, extending it to 2035. Announcing the move, PM Leesaidit reflected the ""very good cooperation"" of the countries on defence but also the broader cooperation ""in security, in economics, in counterterrorism, and in culture and education, as well"". Somalia felt the effects of the Trump presidency almost immediately, with the country among those whose citizenswere bannedfrom entering the US. The move followed Mr Trump's call in 2015 for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on"". His statement came after a mass shooting in California carried outby a radicalised couple. While the travel ban was initially blocked by court challenges, it was eventuallyupheld in 2018by the Supreme Court. In May 2017, a member of the US militarywas killedin Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the disastrous Black Hawk Down incident in 1993, when more than a dozen US soldiers and hundreds of Somalis were killed. There wasanother US fatalityin June 2018. The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. The number of drone strikes carried out by the US military in Somaliahas increaseda lot under President Trump. But the militant Islamist group has stubbornly resisted the offensive andkilled three Americansacross the border in Kenya in January this year. Mr Trump isreportedto have recently told his military advisers to draw up plans for the withdrawal of the remaining few hundred US troops still in the country. Ilhan Omar, a Democratic congresswoman in Minnesota who was born in Somalia, has found herself a focal point for much of President Trump's recent anti-immigration rhetoric. Talking about her at a campaign rally in Oklahoma in June, hesaid: ""She would like to make the government of our country just like the country from where she came - Somalia. No government, no safety, no police, no nothing, just anarchy. And now, she's telling us how to run our country. No, thank you."" Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa,tweetingthat the country was a ""mess"" back in 2015. He took a slightly different approach as president though,tellingPresident Jacob Zuma that he hoped to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September 2017. During the meeting, Mr Trumpsaid: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich."" Mr Zuma was replaced as president in February 2018 by Cyril Ramaphosa. President Trump caused some controversy in the country a few months later when hetweetedthat he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to ""closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers."" His tweet followed a piece on Fox News about South Africa's planned land reforms but a spokesman for Mr Ramaphosasaidthe American president was ""misinformed"". President Trump and Mr Ramaphosa spoke by phone earlier this year amid a growing outbreak of coronavirus in the US, with the South African leadersayinghe had ""passed our condolences to the Government and people of the US on the devastation the virus has wrought"". President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there was hope that tensions on the peninsula had been diffused when the US president brought North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table. After South Korean President Moon Jae-in'shistoric meetingwith Mr Kim in April 2018, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!"" Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks. Trade has also been a key part of the two countries' relationship during Mr Trump's term. The American president had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US. In September 2018, the two sides signed a revised trade pact that, among other things, allows US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US had introduced on steel. Mr Trumphailed itas a ""a very big deal"". There have been several moments of tension in the relationship, however. A frequent complaint of Mr Trump's has been that South Korea should pay the US more for its military support. In March 2019, hetweetedthat military drills between the countries had been cancelled ""to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. for which we are not reimbursed"". Later that year, he confirmed South Korea had started talks over increasing their payments to the US,saying: ""South Korea is a very wealthy nation that now feels an obligation to contribute to the military defence provided by the United States of America."" But in April this year, he said he had rejected an offer from Seoul,telling reporters: ""We're asking them to pay for a big percentage of what we're doing. It's not fair... It's a question of will they contribute toward the defence of their own nation."" Donald Trump has enjoyed relatively warm relations with Spain's leaders. At a meeting with Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy in June 2017, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence. Mr Rajoy was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June 2018 and replaced by Pedro SÃ¡nchez, who President Trump has met at Nato and G7 summits but not at the White House. Mr Trump and his wife Melania have, however,welcomedSpain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House, celebrating ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"" at a meeting in June 2018. The American president had been due to host the Spanish royals for a second time in April this year, but it was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. It would have been only the third state visit under Mr Trump - the other two were by the French and Australian leaders. In 2018, Mr Trumpreportedly suggestedto Spain's foreign minister that Europe should build a wall across the Sahara, similar to the one on the US-Mexico border, to solve the migrant crisis. In recent months, Mr Trump has mentioned Spain frequently when trying to suggest that Europe has had much bigger problems dealing with coronavirus compared to the US. Speaking at the White House in June, he said: ""Look what happened to Spainâ¦ It's just been shattered."" But both countries have been hit hard by the virus, withthe death ratein Spain only slightly higher than in the US. Sudan is another of the predominantly Muslim countries that Donald Trump included on his initialtravel ban list. The Supreme Court partlyreinstatedthe ban after it was twice rejected by judges in the US, but by that point Sudanhad been removedfrom the list reportedly due to improved cooperation. However, the country wasadded once againin early 2020, meaning Sudanese nationals can no longer apply for ""diversity visas"", which are available by lottery for applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the US. In better news for the relationship of the two countries, Mr Trump has recentlysignalled his intentionto remove Sudan from a US list of state sponsors of terror, meaning sanctions dating back to the 1990s could be removed. In another sign of the improving relations since Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir was ousted in 2019, Mr Trump alsorecently announcedthat the country was normalising its relations with Israel, saying it was a ""HUGE win today for the United States and for peace in the world"". Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdoksaidthe move was part of the new government's efforts in working ""towards international relations that best serve our people"". President Trump caused a bit of a stir in Sweden early on in his presidency. ""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbersof migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the president [told a crowd in Florida. The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident he was referring to - not leastlots of baffled Swedes. Mr Trump later said hehad been referringto a Fox News report on gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013 - but the police officers interviewed said their comments had been taken out of context anddatadidn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape. The president raised eyebrows again in 2019, when he took to Twitter tocall for the releaseof American rapper A$AP Rocky, who had been charged with assault in Stockholm. ""Give A$AP Rocky his FREEDOM. We do so much for Sweden but it doesn't seem to work the other way around. Sweden should focus on its real crime problem!"" the presidenttweetedin July 2019. ""Very disappointed in Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven for being unable to act,"" headded. The rapper was eventuallyfound guiltyand given a suspended sentence, but he had returned to the US by that point. In recent months, Mr Trump has mentioned Sweden frequently when talking about the coronavirus pandemic, tweeting in April that the country was ""paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown"". Sweden's foreign minister, however, has called Mr Trump's assessments ""factually wrong"". Despite the bumps, Mr LÃ¶fven insisted during a visit to the White House in 2018 that the two countries had a good relationship despite some differences because they shared the same values. Mr Trumptold reporters: ""Sweden is a great country. It's small, but it's very sharp, I will tell you. They are very sharp."" Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of military intervention - particularly in Syria - for some time. When his predecessor was considering military action in the country back in 2013, Mr Trumptweeted: ""Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack Syria - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the US gets nothing."" But just over two months into his term, President Trump said he was so moved by images of children in the aftermath of a chemical attack by Syrian forces that he was taking military action. ""Using a deadly nerve agent,Syrian President] Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,"" Mr Trump [said. ""No child of God should ever suffer such horror."" Two US Navy shipsfired 59 Tomahawk cruise missilesat a Syrian air base from their positions in the Mediterranean in April 2017. It was the first direct US military action against Mr Assad. Mr Trump deployed his military againin April 2018, with 100 missiles targeting suspected government chemical weapons facilities in response to another chemical attack. After the strikes, Mr Trumptweeted: ""A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!"" At the end of 2018, Mr Trump made thesurprise announcementthat US troops would be leaving Syria, saying they had achieved his objective of defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS). But even allies criticised the move and the withdrawal failed to materialise. US troopsdid begin withdrawingfrom northern Syria in 2019, however, leaving their Kurdish allies to face a Turkish offensive in the region. Senator Lindsey Graham, a close ally of Mr Trump's, was one of many Republicans to voice their anger at the move,tweetingin October: ""Pray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump Administration."" President Trumprejectedthe criticism andsaidTurkey and the Kurdish people had been ""fighting each other for 200 years"". He was involved with securing a ceasefire in the region though,sayingthat the ""Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us."" Later that month, Mr Trumpannouncedthat IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had killed himself during a US military operation in Syria, saying he had been ""violently eliminated"" and ""died like a coward"". President Trump moved quickly to establish a good relationship with Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup. The pair ""expressed a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries"" duringa callin April 2017. Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington. During their phone call, President Trump invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time, a trip that took place in October 2017. Talking to reporters with Mr Chan-ocha alongside him, Mr Trumpsaid: ""We have a very strong relationship right now, as of this moment, and it's getting stronger in the last nine months."" More recently, Mr Trump caused a stir in Thailand when hemispronouncedThailand as ""thigh-land"" at a campaign rally in Ohio. Perhaps the unlikeliest country to have made our list, Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Keith Rowley spoke to Donald Trumpon the phonein February 2017 to discuss ""shared priorities"". One of those priorities is terrorism, with some US officials worried that the small Caribbean island could become a ""breeding ground for extremists"",according to the New York Times. The island's former US ambassador John Estrada told the newspaper that more than 100 people had travelled from there to fight with the so-called Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. When Donald Trump announced a ban on people entering the US from several predominantly Muslim countries, some analysts were surprised not to see Tunisia on the list. The Arab Spring began there in 2010, but it became a breeding ground for the so-called Islamic State group (IS) - more Tunisians joined them to fight in Iraq and Syria than any other nationality. President Trump appeared to have decided that a close relationship with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi was important in the fight against IS and he praised the country's ""stability and security"" ina phone callwith its leader in February 2017. When Mr Essebsidiedat the age of 92 in July 2019, a White Housestatementpraised him for being a ""tireless advocate for the Tunisian people"". Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has had a lot of ups and downs over the past four years. Relations were strained initially by Mr Trump'sdecision to armthe Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group (IS). Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group. But the pair were united at the United Nations General Assembly in September 2017, where theyreaffirmed their rejectionof a planned Kurdistan referendum. In 2018, however, there were tensions over the case of an American pastor who had been arrested and charged in Turkey over alleged links to political groups. Taking to Twitter to protest, Mr TrumpaccusedTurkey of having ""taken advantage of the United States for many years"" and said the US would be ""cutting back on Turkey!"" In anothertweetaround the same time, Mr Trump announced increased tariffs on the country and said: ""Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!"" Two months later, the pastor was released and President Trumpsaidthat while there was no deal made, there was ""great appreciation on behalf of the United States, which will lead to good, perhaps great, relations between the United States & Turkey!"" In 2019, Mr Trump's decision to withdraw troops from northern Syria and allow Turkish forces to launch an offensive on Kurdish forces was criticised heavily both at home and abroad. In response, hetweeteda threat to Turkey: ""As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I've done before!)"" Mr Trump sent Mr Erdogan a letter at the time, telling him: ""Don't be a tough guy. Don't be a fool!"" But the Turkish leader wasreportedto have ""thoroughly rejected it and put it in the bin"". A fortnight later, President Trumplifted sanctionson Turkey after it agreed to a ceasefire in Syria. Earlier this year, Mr Erdogan suggested relations may be improving between the two countries,sayingafter a phone call with his American counterpart: ""To be honest, after our conversation tonight, a new era can begin between the United States and Turkey."" Ukraine was at the centre of the Democrats' bid to impeach President Trump so relations between the two countries have been under the spotlight in the last four years. Mr Trump has repeatedly accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine - the kind of rhetoric that will have pleased Kyiv. But early on in his presidency, the American also called for better ties to Russia, which will have worried Ukrainian authorities. In June 2017, Mr Trumpsaidhe had ""very, very good discussions"" with President Petro Poroshenko during a visit to the White House by the Ukrainian. The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014. The following month, Mr Trumpcalled onRussia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments. Mr Poroshenko was replaced by Volodymyr Zelensky in May 2019 and his name became well known in the US later in the year when a phone call he had with Mr Trump became a key part ofimpeachment proceedingsagainst the American president. Democrats accused Mr Trump of trying to pressure Mr Zelensky into investigating unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Joe Biden, who would later become his opponent in the 2020 president election. For his part, Mr Zelenskysaidthere was ""no blackmail"" in the phone call with President Trump, adding: ""This is not corruption, it was just a call."" In response, Mr Trumptweeted: ""This should immediately end the talk of impeachment!"" Mr Trump was eventuallyimpeachedat the end of 2019 butfound not guiltyafter a vote in the Senate in February 2020. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke to Donald Trumpon the phonejust a few days after the former businessman became the new US president. The two leaders discussed the fight against international terrorism and ""committed to further strengthen cooperation on fighting radical Islamic terrorism"". The UAE was not one of the Middle Eastern countries from which Mr Trump tried to ban travel to the US in 2017 and the state's foreign minister was one of the few officials in the region to defend the move. Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al NahyandescribedMr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with. The strength of the relationship was on show recently, when President Trump announced that his administration had overseen a deal with the UAE and Israel that will see the Arab state normalise relations with its historic foe. ""After decades of division and conflict we mark the dawn of a new Middle East,"" Mr Trumptolda crowd of hundreds gathered at the White House in September this year as he celebrated both the UAE deal with Israel and a similar one with Bahrain. President Trump had a slightly bumpy relationship with Theresa May, the first British prime minister he had to deal with in his presidency. He arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July 2018 but it was immediately overshadowed by the publication ofan interviewthe US president gave to The Sun newspaper. In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan went ahead. ""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way."" But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone andsaida trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"". Mr Trumpalso met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit. Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the president of the United States."" But when he arrived in London for a state visit the following year, he was welcomed byfurther protestsand a giant balloondepicting him as a baby. This time around, the president was given the honour ofa state banquetat Buckingham Palace with the Queen, during which he praised the ""eternal friendship"" between the UK and US. But earlier in the day, he hadcalledLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan - who had said the UK should ""not roll out the red carpet"" for Mr Trump - a ""stone cold loser"". A few weeks later, Mr Trump also laid into Mrs May and her proposed Brexit deal,tweeting: ""What a mess she and her representatives have created. I told her how it should be done, but she decided to go another way."" So it was little surprise when Mr Trump appeared excited to congratulate Boris Johnson on becoming the new prime minister in July 2019,saying: ""He will be great!"" When asked what advice he would give to Mr Johnson on Brexit, the presidentreplied: ""He needs no advice. He's the right man for the job. I've been saying that for a long time."" While the pair have enjoyed warm personal relations, there have been some differences on policy, most notably on China, the Iran nuclear deal and the future of Nato. But after this year, they now have another thing in common - they both got and recovered from coronavirus. When Mr Johnson left intensive care back in April, Mr Trumpsaidit was ""great news"" and after he returned to the White House to recover from the virus in October, hethankedthe British PM for ""his friendship and support"". Mr Trumpspoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyevin December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation."" That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate theNew York truck attack, in which eight people were killed. The suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant. The two leadersmet for the first timein May at the White House, with Mr Trumpsayingthe two countries were ""working together from the standpoint of the military"". Venezuela has suffered from economic and political crises for several years now and it is deeply divided between those who support the government of the socialist President NicolÃ¡s Maduro and those who blame him for the country's dire state. Mr Trump has discussed the situation in Venezuela with leaders of several neighbouring countries, including Brazil and Colombia, but he has not spoken directly to President Maduro. In atweetin October 2017, Mr Trump called ""for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela"". President Maduro, however, sent aword of warningto Mr Trump, saying in a televised speech: ""Don't repeat the errors of Obama and Bush when it comes to Venezuela and Latin America."" Mr Maduro was reelected in 2018 but the election was widely dismissed as rigged. After months of a political crisis, opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ labelled Mr Maduro a ""usurper"" and declared himself interim president in January 2019. Shortly afterwards, Mr Trumptweeted: ""The citizens of Venezuela have suffered for too long at the hands of the illegitimate Maduro regime. Today, I have officially recognized the President of the Venezuelan National Assembly, Juan GuaidÃ³, as the Interim President of Venezuela."" The following month Mr Trumpsaid: ""I ask every member of the Maduro regime: End this nightmare of poverty, hunger and death. LET YOUR PEOPLE GO. Set your country free!"" Dozens of countries around the world have recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as president but the Venezuelan military has remained loyal to Mr Maduro. Earlier this year, President Trump suggested he would be open to meeting Mr Maduro,telling Axios: ""I would maybe think about that... Maduro would like to meet."" But he later clarified his position,tweeting: ""I would only meet with Maduro to discuss one thing: a peaceful exit from power!"" Vietnam played host to President Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017. Mr Trumptweeted his thanksfor ""a wonderful visit"" and waskeen to highlighta $12bn (£9bn)purchase of Boeing aircraftin a joint statement after the visit. A little over a year later, Mr Trump was back in Hanoi to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. But talks ended without agreement after the US refused North Korean demands for sanctions relief. ""Sometimes you have to walk and this was one of those times,"" Mr Trumpsaid afterwards. After the talks, Mr Trumptweeted: ""THANK YOU to our generous hosts in Hanoi this week: President Trong, Prime Minister Phuc, and the wonderful people of Vietnam!"" President Trump's first action on Yemen was toban its citizensfrom travelling to America. While the travel ban was initially blocked by court challenges, it was eventuallyupheld in 2018by the Supreme Court. Yemen has been inthe midst of conflictsince 2014 and what began as a civil war has grown into a battle between regional powers. One of those most involved is Saudi Arabia, which has been a close ally to President Trump. In late 2018, Mr Trumpcalled on Saudi Arabiato ""allow food, fuel, water, and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it"". That request followed avotein the US Senate, which sought to withdraw American support for the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. President Trump, however,vetoed the billpassed by Congress in April 2019 and three months laterused his veto power againto dismiss similar resolutions that blocked the sale of $8.1bn (£6.5bn) worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Yemen was the site of thefirst military operationauthorised by Mr Trump in February 2017, in which a special forces team raided the compound of a suspected terrorist leader. The mission didn't go to plan. The US Navy Seals came under fire from fighters belonging to the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group (AQAP) and one member of the elite team was killed. It later emergedthat a number of civilians were also killed in the operation, which had been drawn up in November 2016 but approved by Mr Trump. Inan interview with Fox News, Mr Trump appeared to lay blame for the death of Navy Seal William ""Ryan"" Owens on military leaders. ""This was a mission that was started before I got here,"" Mr Trump said. ""They came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected... And they lost Ryan."" In February 2020, a less controversial US operation in Yemenkilled the AQAP leader, who had been linked to a series of attacks on Western interests in the 2000s.

"Anthony Knott was due home in the early hours of 21 December The family of a man who went missing during a work night out have said they are ""utterly devastated and completely heartbroken"" after a body was found. Land and water searches with boats and drones took place to find London firefighter Anthony Knott, 33, who was last seen in Lewes on 20 December. Sussex Police said a member of the public alerted it on Friday that a body had been found in Newhaven harbour. Mr Knott's family thanked everyone who had helped in the search for him. In a statement on Facebook, they said: ""Anthony's story has reached out and touched the hearts of thousands of people. ""We would like to thank everyone for your incredible support, shares, posters, volunteers and donations. ""The people of Lewes, we will be forever grateful for your support and understanding during our searches. ""These three weeks have been so very hard for us all."" East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service crews carried out searches along the River Ouse Det Insp Mark Rosser said officers believed the body to be that of Mr Knott. He thanked volunteers who had turned out to help with the search. ""Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Anthony at this difficult time,"" Det Insp Rosser said.

Sussex Police and London Fire Brigade joined forces to search Pells Pool in Lewes and the Pellbrook Cut waterway. Emergency teams also carried out searches of the nearby River Ouse. By Piers Hopkirk, BBC News The body was discovered by a member of the public in the River Ouse at Denton Island. This is the final stretch of the Ouse before it reaches the sea at Newhaven, running through the town's industrial quarter just short of the port and ferry terminal and crossed by the A259 coast road bridge. It's about six miles as the crow flies downstream from Lewes, where Anthony Knott went missing on 20 December. At this stage, it is not known how and where he entered the water. Mr Knott, of Orpington, south-east London, had left his friends at the The Lamb pub in Fisher Street, for unknown reasons, during his night out with colleagues. He had been due to return home in the early hours the following day. After he disappeared, his partner Lucy Otto wrote on Facebook that he had been in a happy mood, had loved his job and loved his family and had simply been on a Christmas night out.

"This video can not be played Footage appears to show a missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran Western countries say they have evidence that an Iranian missile shot down a Ukrainian plane close to Tehran airport on Wednesday. Iran has denied any involvement, and say the plane was not hit by a missile. So what's the evidence that an Iranian missile was to blame? Video footage shared on Iranian social media accounts appears to show the moment of impact on Ukrainian International Airlines flight PS752. The images show a flash followed by a loud bang. The plane then continues to fly, turning back in the direction of Tehran airport, then crashing into the ground in a ball of flame. BBC Monitoring has indentified the location from where the video was shot to Parand, a residential area west of Tehran. It's about 30km (18miles) from Imam Khomeini International Airport, where the aircraft began its journey. Rows of housing blocks, a construction site and a storage tank, which all appear in the video, match a Google Earth image of the location, according to BBC Monitoring. There are now many photos of the plane wreckage available on media sites. These photos, and the subsequent detailed examination of the wreckage itself, will hold vital clues such as burn marks indicating a fire, explosive residue which could point to a bomb on board or possible shrapnel damage from a missile. An anti-aircraft missile is generally designed to detonate at a distance from the target, sending shrapnel towards it, inflicting maximum damage. Puncture holes pointing inwards could indicate an explosion or damage from outside the aircraft. And detailed analysis of the size and shape of any holes could give an indication of the type of missile used. What we know about downed flight PS752 Plane crash victims 'were the best of us' How strong is Iran's military? At this stage, it's difficult to verify many of the images which are being shared which - it's claimed - show damage consistent with a missile attack. Some show the nose of a missile from the Russian-made Tor missile system. These photos have not been independently verified yet and we don't know where or when they were taken, because there are no identifiable landmarks. US intelligence sources say two missiles were fired, according to US media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Questions have been raised about why the nose of the missile in these photos appears to be intact. However, an expert we've spoken to explains that it's not surprising to see the nose - which contains its guidance system and does not itself impact the target - intact and at a distance from the crash site. There are reports from inside Iran that the crash site has already been bulldozed and the wreckage cleared away.  Elizabeth Palmer of CBS news reported that ""virtually all pieces"" of the plane had been removed by Thursday. This makes the digital evidence gathered so far a vital element in determining what actually happened to the aircraft. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The flight data recorder captures everything going on with the plane's systems. This will be crucial in revealing if there were any internal malfunctions. The voice recorder is designed to contain two hours of audio from the cockpit, and may hold vital clues, as it records what the flight crew were saying at the time. Iranian officials say it could take up to two months to download data from the black boxes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It takes a long time to investigate because there's a huge amount of data, says aviation expert Julian Bray.  However, he also says that skilled analysts may be able to get an initial idea from the data within a couple of weeks. There's a limit to what the black boxes can reveal if a bomb or missile destroys the aircraft. They could simply stop working, although the voice recorder might pick up a sound wave just beforehand. Some investigations can last years. A probe into the crash of an Ethiopian plane off Beirut in 2010 took two years to complete,even though the black boxes were sent to France, which has some of the world's top investigators.,external The Iranian military would have been on very high alert just hours after the launch of Iranian missiles at US targets in Iraq, in anticipation of possible retaliatory strikes by the US. The area where the plane came down was not only close to the capital, Tehran, but also a military base of the Iran's Revolutionary Guards. The plane wreckage could hold vital clues as to what happened There are however multiple precautions that should have been in place to prevent a civilian airliner being targeted in error. The radar system used by the missile operators is designed to pick up identifying signals from all civilian aircraft. ""Flight PS752 was transmitting a transponder code showing its civilian identity registration, position and altitude,"" says Justin Bronk, a Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, ""and the missile radar operator should have been able to see that information."" If this does prove to be a missile strike on a passenger plane, it would not be unprecedented. In 2014, a Russian-made missile hit a Malaysian civilian airliner over Ukraine, killing 298 people. An Iranian aircraft was shot down in error in 1988 by a US navy warship, the USS Vincennes, killing 290 people. In 1983, a Soviet fighter jet took down a Korean passenger plane after it strayed into Soviet airspace. All 269 people on board died.

"DUP leader Arlene Foster said parts of the deal were ""compromise outcomes"" DUP leader Arlene Foster has said the governments' draft deal is not ""perfect"", but ""there is a basis upon which the assembly and executive can be re-established"". The text waspublished on Thursday night,external. Arlene Foster said: ""There are elements within it which we recognise are the product of long negotiations and represent compromise outcomes."" She was speaking before Sinn FÃ©in backed the deal on Friday. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith said he hoped the the dealcould see the assembly reconvene on Fridaybut the speaker Robin Newton made clear that could only happen when the parties approached him. The DUP leader Mrs Foster said the party had weighed the governments' paper against its 10 commitments for negotiations. ""There will always need to be give and take,"" she said. ""The key to making devolution work will be having the resources to do so. ""This element of the paper will require further scrutiny."" Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary-Lou McDonald said her party would ""assess"" the text The draft deal was welcomed as an ""historic advancement"" by the Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge. However, it said the proposed legislation ""falls very much short"" of promises for an Irish language act. ""The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM [Office of First Minister and Deputy First Minister - now the Executive Office] leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services, said CiarÃ¡n Mac Giolla BhÃ©in from the group. ""The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming Executive."" Questioned earlier on BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan show about whether a unionist veto around the Irish language was included in the small print of the draft document, DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson confirmed: ""Unionist consent will be required"". He said: ""That is the way Stormont operates. It operates on the basis that there has to be cross-community consent. ""We will not agree to standards that impose Irish on people who don't speak it. ""There will be no compulsory Irish in schools and there will be no Irish road signs."" The Orange Order released a statement saying it has ""very serious concerns"" about the draft deal and could not support the proposal to appoint an Irish language commissioner. ""The document, which has been released with a purposely narrow window for meaningful consideration, is clearly far reaching in its provision for the Irish language and its subsequent future role in the political and civic life of Northern Ireland,"" the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland's statement said. It added that in contrast to measures to promote the Irish language, ""references to Ulster-Scots/Ulster British culture are ambiguous -lacking meaningful detail"". The Orange Order said it would comment further on the draft deal in the coming days after consulting more widely with its members UUP leader Steve Aiken said the party is ""committed to a return to devolution that is fair and sustainable"". UUP leader Steve Aiken said his party will attend if the Assembly is recalled He said: ""We will consider this complex and far-reaching document carefully and consult widely within our party before making any further comments. ""If the assembly is recalled on Friday, the Ulster Unionist Party MLAs will attend and consider the business put before them."" Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong questioned whether the reforms of the petition of concern detailed in the draft deal go far enough. Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong has concerns about the petition of concern ""That is what we are trying to consider at the moment. This is a new approach,"" she said. She said detailed work was also needed on Friday to define the financial aspect of the deal and ""the amount of money that has been talked about"" for public services in Northern Ireland. Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey echoed Alliance's concerns that proposed reform of the petition of concern was insufficient and expressed some disappointment that environmental protections in the deal do not go far enough. However, Ms Bailey added she was ""hopeful that this is a deal that will see the restoration of the devolved institutions"". She said it ""provides a chance to build towards delivery and accountability"" at Stormont. A key focus of the deal is the implementation of health and social care reform, including an end to the healthcare strikes which demand pay parity and safe staffing levels. Speaking at a picket line in Antrim, the Royal College of Nursing President Anne Marie Rafferty said nurses ""want to see the ink on the paper and the deal delivered"". ""Words are not enough, deeds are what actually counts."" ""It has been a cliff edge moment."" The Royal College of Nursing said ""words are not enough"" Education is another area which has come under financial pressure, with the deal promising that schools will have a sustainable core budget. Geri Cameron, President of the National Association of Head Teachers in Northern Ireland, said while ""detail is scant"", its representatives are willing to work with MLAs going forward. Industry leaders have also been reacting to the proposals. Trade NI, which is an alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality NI, released a statement urging ""all the main parties in Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the assembly back up and running."" ""The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years."" The Institute of Directors Northern Ireland (IoDNI) said commitments for infrastructure projects such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A5 and A6 and Northern Ireland's sewage network were ""particularly pleasing"". ""Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance,"" said the IoD's National Director Kirsty McManus. ""From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal.

"This video can not be played Lewis suggests referendum on royals Labour leadership candidate Clive Lewis has said there should be a referendum on the future of the Royal Family. Speaking at his campaign launch in London, he said: ""A lot of people would like to see the monarchy scaled down."" He said he understood the Duke and Duchess of Sussex'sdecision to step backas ""senior"" Royal Family members. Mr Lewis is running to replace Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader but has not yet secured the support from MPs and MEPs needed to stay in the contest. The shadow Treasury minister needs 22 MPs or MEPs to nominate him in order to stay in the race. Which Labour contender is the most working-class? Long Bailey, Nandy and Phillips secure nominations Who will be Labour's next leader? Corbyn won't endorse any leadership contenders Asked about the Royal Family at his leadership campaign launch in Brixton, south London, Mr Lewis said he understood why Prince Harry and his wife Meghan wanted to step back from their duties. ""I think it is extremely unfortunate and a sign of the media we have that they feel they had to do this,"" he said, arguing that Meghan had suffered from racism in the press. He said a lot of people had discussed the Royal Family being ""quite large"" and asked: ""Why not have a referendum on the future of the Royal Family?"" Mr Lewis added: ""Let's talk about what a modern state looks like and what the role of the Royal Family would be."" ""I'd rather see us as citizens than subjects in the 21st Century,"" he said. By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check Historically, the term ""subject"" has often been associated with people belonging to a country under a monarchy. Until 1949, nearly everyone with a close connection to the UK was called a ""British subject"". After that date, citizenship became the main form of nationality in the UK - replacing most people's ""British subject"" status. People in the Commonwealth - an association of countries formerly under British rule - continued to be collectively referred to as ""British subjects"" until 1983, according to the government (although it wasn't an official status for most of them). Nowadays, only a very small number of people qualify as British subjects, according to the government. For example, someone who is not recognised by any country as having a nationality may be allowed to become a British subject. After his campaign launch, Mr Lewis took to social media to emphasise he was not calling for the monarchy's abolition. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

And, in an interview later with the BBC, Mr Lewis sought to downplay the significance of his comments on the Royal Family, adding that his focus was on wider political and constitutional reform. He said: ""My whole speech today was talking about the crisis of democracy and the fact that we need to empower people."" On Wednesday, Prince Harry and Meghan revealed their intention ""to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family, and work to become financially independent"". They said they would split their time between the UK and North America, while ""continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages"". The decision came ""after many months of reflection and internal discussions"", they added. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said that ""we must continue to celebrate and support"" the contribution the Royal Family makes to the UK, adding that it had an ""important role in public service"". Mr Lewis also used his speech to call for the abolition of the House of Lords and the introduction of proportional representation, describing the voting system as ""the fairest way to elect a Parliament"". There are currently six MPs in the Labour leadership contest So far, Mr Lewis has only secured support from four of his MP and MEP colleagues in his bid to become Labour leader, with Monday the deadline for gathering enough backing. Also seeking more nominations is shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry who currently has seven. The other candidates - Rebecca Long Bailey, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips and Sir Keir Starmer - have secured the required support. There is also a contest to become deputy leader after Tom Watson stepped down in December. The new leader and deputy leader will be announced on 4 April. Addressing the future of his party, Mr Lewis said Labour needed to ""modernise or die"". He called for a ""progressive alliance"" with others and criticised his own party for failing to talk to the Greens and Liberal Democrats during the last election. ""Boris Johnson wasn't afraid of talking to the Brexit Party and that worked extremely well for them - we didn't do that,"" he said. He also criticised New Labour for ""stepping away from our values in order to get into office"" and said: ""When we won victories in the 2000s we were planting the seeds of future losses.""

"The British and Irish governments have published the text of a draft deal aimed at restoring power sharing. The Northern Ireland secretary has asked the assembly speaker to convene a sitting on Friday. The DUP said the deal is ""a basis upon which the assembly can be re-established"" while Sinn FÃ©in's executive will meet to consider it. Luke Sproule, Amy Stewart and Ali Gordon The Green Party, which has two assembly members at Stormont, said it is hopeful a deal can be done. Leader Clare Bailey said: ""I think that this deal provides a chance to build towards
delivery and accountability within the institutions. âOf course, the devil is in the detail and we will continue
to scrutinise the document in full in the hope that a two party agreement can
create sustainable government.â But Ms Bailey added that there was not enough in the deal on the environment or in terms of reforming the petition of concern.  Allow Twitter content?

Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme, she said the draft deal lays ""a good foundation in terms of a programme for government to move on"". The former South Belfast MP also stressed that Simon Coveney and Julian Smith have spoken to all of the parties and picked up different ideas and views to form the draft deal. ""But getting the executive back will not solve everything - it will still require a number of years of difficult decisions to get the transformations to bring the outcomes that people want to see.""

John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor The formulation Julian Smith is using is a significant financial package
but heâs not putting a specific figure on it. But - we can attempt to match money to some of what is in the
draft deal. Thereâs a commitment to tackle health waiting lists, the worst in
the UK. It would cost between Â£700m and Â£1bn to clear those lists. Then thereâs the health service dispute which has seen nurses
and other workers on strike, which would take another Â£50m. Thereâs a commitment to resolve a pay dispute with teachers that would require about Â£70m. Added to that is an additional education commitment to ensure schools have a sustainable core budget â in the past financial year schools combined exceeded their budget by Â£22m. Thereâs also that commitment to increase the number of police officers by about 800, requiring an additional Â£40m per year. The figures are just some of the headlines but there's a raft of other measures mentioned. The Irish government is also in the mix with Simon Coveney prepared to invest â¬110m (Â£93m) in infrastructure projects in NI over the next three years. They are also prepared to put money on the table for the new medical school in Magee. More from that statement by Conradh na Gaeilge on the Irish language provisions in the draft deal. CiarÃ¡n Mac Giolla BhÃ©in said it was ""undoubtedly a historic advancement for our community"" but also expressed concerns over some elements. He said: ""The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services."" ""The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming executive. ""Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the âofficial statusâ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation."" NI Secretary Julian Smith is ""holding the people of Northern Ireland to ransom"", the union Unison has said. It follows comments he made to BBC News NI that extra money for workers would be withheld in the absence of a deal. Health workers and nurses are currently on strike over pay and staffing levels in NI. Patricia McKeown, from Unison, told said the dispute over health workers' pay could be ""resolved immediately"". ""That's about holding the people to Northern Ireland at ransom,"" she said. ""It's about really infringing on their human rights, health workers and patients alike.""  Allow Twitter content?

Until three years ago, Northern Ireland was jointly governed by its largest unionist party, the DUP, and its largest nationalist party, Sinn FÃ©in. They shared power in political institutions set up under the1998 Good Friday Agreement, a deal which brought peace to Northern Ireland after 30 years of violence known as the Troubles. Under the principles of power-sharing, Stormont's government cannot function unless it is comprised of a coalition of both unionists and nationalists. Relations between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in had deteriorated in recent years as the two parties were diametrically opposed not only on Northern Ireland's position within the UK, but also issues such as the Irish language; same-sex marriage; abortion and how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles. But unexpectedly it was a row over a green energy scheme which pushed their relationship past breaking point. TheRenewable Heat Incentive (RHI) schemewas set up by DUP leader Arlene Foster when she was enterprise minister, but it ran over budget and at one point threatened to cost taxpayers Â£490m. Sinn FÃ©in demanded that Mrs Foster step aside as first minister during an inquiry into the RHI scheme and when she refused, theypulled out of government on 9 January 2017. Two key sticking points in the Stormont talks were around an Irish language act and the petition of concern. The purpose ofpetition of concern is to protect one community from legislation that would favour another and a valid petition requires the signatures of 30 MLAs. The call for an Irish language act has been a key sticking point The draft deal says there is to be ""meaningful reform"" of the petition, which would be ""reduced and returned to its intended purpose"" and would ""only be used in the most exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, having used every other mechanism"". The proposed deal would see legislation created for the appointment of both an Irish language commissioner and an Ulster-Scots commissioner. Earlier, Irish language group Conradh na Gaeilge welcomed the draft deal as ""historic advancement but added it ""falls very much short"" of promises for an Irish Language act. Other key points in the deal includethe Northern Ireland Executive settling an ongoing pay dispute with nurses and increasing policing numbers. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald told a Stormont press conference on Friday that her party will nominate ministers to an executive. She said Sinn FÃ©in was up for a return to ""genuine power sharing"". TÃ¡naiste (Irish Deputy PM) Simon Coveney and NI Secretary Julian Smith published the deal on Thursday night DUP leader Arlene Foster described the proposals as a ""fair and balanced deal"". ""I know there will be challenges in the deal, not least we need to make sure we have the finances to be able to deal with all of the issues in Northern Ireland that are present at the moment, particularly in and around the health sector."" This video can not be played 'It's a fair and balanced deal' The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood confirmed on Friday that his party will return to Stormont when the assembly is recalled. The Alliance Party also confirmed on Friday night it would support the deal. The Ulster Unionist Party are meeting on Saturday morning to decide. TÃ¡naiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney, who helped broker the deal, said: ""History is being made today."" He added: ""We now have confirmation from the two largest parties in Northern Ireland that they both are committed to re-entering an executive and establishing a functioning Stormont assembly again. The leaders of Ireland's main churches welcomed the agreement, saying it offered ""new hope"" and a ""new start"" for Northern Ireland's political institutions. In a joint statement, the leaders of the Church of Ireland, Methodist Church in Ireland, Roman Catholic Church, Presbyterian Church in Ireland and the Irish Council of Churches said the government's proposals ""offer an opportunity to build a peaceful and just society"". However, theOrange Order earlier said it has ""very serious concerns"" about the dealand could not support the proposal to appoint an Irish language commissioner.

" When Carlos Ghosn flew into Tokyo’s Haneda Airport on a November afternoon in 2018, he was at the height of his powers. He was the chairman of Nissan, the man credited with saving the Japanese carmaker from potential bankruptcy. He was also chief executive of the French carmaker Renault – and the driving force behind a global alliance between the two. Along with the smaller manufacturer Mitsubishi, they made up a motor industry group that sold more than 10 million cars a year. November 2018: Nissan's company jet landing at Tokyo's Haneda Airport November 2018: Nissan's company jet landing at Tokyo's Haneda Airport He was used to dividing his time between Paris and Tokyo, not to mention regularly checking in on the group’s operations in North America. This globetrotting lifestyle came with perks, such as the use of a corporate jet. Brazilian born, raised in Lebanon and educated in France, he had close ties to all three countries, and had the use of luxury homes in Rio de Janeiro, Paris and Beirut, as well as Tokyo. He arrived in Tokyo that day from Beirut. As his sleek corporate jet made its way across the airport tarmac it was easily identifiable by the registration emblazoned on the white engine nacelles - N155AN. Ghosn was unaware of what awaited him inside the terminal. On arrival, he says he was picked up by a car and taken to passport control, where he was informed that there was a problem with his visa. He was escorted to a small side room, where he was arrested, to be charged with serious financial crimes. Within hours of landing, he was locked in a prison cell. He was not the only target. Greg Kelly, one of Ghosn’s closest confidants, was apprehended separately after flying in to a different Japanese airport from the US - having been summoned to what he thought was an urgent meeting. The 63-year-old US citizen was a “representative director” of the company and was officially charged with carrying out the board’s wishes. In practical terms, he was Ghosn’s enforcer.  For health reasons, he had planned to join the meeting by video link. But according to his wife, the company insisted he attended in person - and arranged a private jet for him. Following their arrests, the pair were taken to Tokyo’s Kosuge Detention Centre in the city’s north-east. It was here, in a tiny cell, that Ghosn would remain for the next four months. He was subject to daily interrogations, as prosecutors sought a confession from him. Kelly, who suffers from spinal problems, was released on bail just over a month later – but not before his wife, Dee, had published a video message in the US in which she complained bitterly about his treatment at the hands of the Japanese authorities. He remains in Japan awaiting trial – in many ways the forgotten man of the whole affair. In March 2019, Ghosn was briefly released, having posted bail of $9m (£6.9m). But he was re-arrested on fresh charges before finally allowed to leave jail again in late April, on payment of a further $4.5m bond. But there were significant restrictions on his movements, including an effective ban on seeing or communicating with his wife. Even when he was allowed to speak with her by internet link on Christmas Eve - a very rare privilege approved by the court - a lawyer had to be present, listening in. Ghosn’s biographer Philippe Ries spent several weeks in Tokyo last year, meeting with him on a daily basis. He has spoken to him since his escape and thinks the way his wife was treated was a key factor in his decision to abscond. Carole Ghosn - his second wife - had been Ghosn’s most vocal supporter. Early in his incarceration, she wrote an excoriating nine-page letter to the Japan office of Human Rights Watch, in which she railed against the “draconian” Japanese legal system. It allowed prosecutors, she said, to “interrogate him, browbeat him, lecture him and berate him” on a daily basis, without a lawyer being present. April 2019: Carlos and Carole Ghosn in Tokyo April 2019: Carlos and Carole Ghosn in Tokyo When Ghosn was re-arrested in April, police raided his home in the early hours of the morning while the couple slept. Carole Ghosn later told the BBC that while her husband was being apprehended an officer had followed her through their apartment, and even stood watch while she took a shower. “I think they wanted to intimidate and humiliate us,” she said. “This woman even handed me the towel.” Carole Ghosn herself was later questioned by the authorities, ostensibly as part of the investigation into her husband’s business affairs. She was not charged at the time, but left the country soon afterwards. In December the Japanese authorities widened their inquiry to other family members, interviewing his son Anthony and one of his daughters in New York “They went after his family, and he is a family man,” says Philippe Ries. “His family is very important to him.” “I am certain that played a big role in his decision to try to escape.” January 2020: Carole Ghosn at her husband's press conference in Lebanon January 2020: Carole Ghosn at her husband's press conference in Lebanon Throughout her husband’s time in jail, Carole Ghosn appealed to global leaders, including US President Donald Trump, the French President Emmanuel Macron and Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro to intervene on her husband’s behalf. The details are still missing, but it is clear Ghosn’s escape from Japan was audacious, risky and well planned. There was certainly nothing furtive about his departure from his Tokyo home. Around lunchtime on 29 December, he simply walked out of the building during the early afternoon. With the country winding down for the New Year break, it is possible security measures were lighter than usual. According to Japanese media reports, CCTV pictures show that he went to a nearby hotel, where he met two men. These are believed to have been Michael Taylor, a former member of the US Special Forces, who is now a private security contractor; and his Lebanese associate George-Antoine Zayek. It’s thought that the three of them caught a bullet train from Tokyo to Osaka, a two-and-a-half-hour ride away. It was a big risk. On that day, the train would have been crowded with holiday travellers. Ghosn was a very well-known figure and easily recognisable, so to reduce the danger, he wore a hat and covered his face with a surgical mask. Wearing such masks in Japan is considered entirely normal, a precaution to prevent the spread of coughs and colds. On arrival in Osaka, the three men reportedly went to another hotel. A few hours later, according to broadcaster NHK, two of them left for the airport - but there was no sign of Ghosn. It is believed he was concealed in a large, black box-like luggage case, one of two they had with them. At the airport, the case was loaded on to an aircraft. Ghosn would leave Japan just as he had arrived more than a year beforehand - aboard a private jet. But whereas he had flown in as an emperor of the auto industry, he left Japanese soil as a fugitive - hidden in a box. That, at least, is the story which has been widely circulated. But in a lengthy interview in Beirut with the BBC’s John Simpson, Ghosn cryptically refused to confirm any details of his escape, beyond the bald fact that he had walked out of his front door in Tokyo. When asked what it had been like hiding in a box, he laughed, before denying point blank such a thing had ever happened. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Probably the last time I was in a box, I was a kid, you know, when I was playing. “I don’t have any memory of something like this, so I can’t comment on it.” It has been reported that at around 23:00 on Sunday 29 December, the aircraft carrying Ghosn and his companions took off from Japan bound for Turkey. In Istanbul, they switched planes. It was done discreetly – Ghosn certainly never officially entered the country. Shortly afterwards, they left for Beirut, on a second jet. All of this, it appears, was done without the knowledge of the company operating the flights. MNG Jet says it leased two separate aircraft to two different clients, and that the two leases were apparently unconnected. It insists that Ghosn’s name did not appear in any of the official paperwork. It has since launched an internal inquiry and filed a criminal complaint with the Turkish authorities over the illegal use of its services. It says one of its employees has admitted falsifying records. Turkish officials, meanwhile, later detained seven people in connection with the affair, including four pilots working under contract for MNG Jet. It is not clear, however, whether the pilots actually knew about their unofficial passenger. Despite his rather unorthodox travel arrangements, we know that Ghosn entered Lebanon perfectly legally, using a French passport and a Lebanese identity card. Ultimately, whatever the consequences for those involved, the escape itself was an unqualified success. Carlos Ghosn was in Lebanon, celebrating the New Year with his wife, and preparing to protest his innocence to the world.

Ultimately, whatever the consequences for those involved, the escape itself was an unqualified success. Carlos Ghosn was in Lebanon, celebrating the New Year with his wife, and preparing to protest his innocence to the world. At his peak, Ghosn was a titan of the motor industry, the creator of one of the most powerful car-making groups in the world. In France, he was “Le Cost Killer”, the ruthless executive who turned Renault around when it was ailing in the late 1990s. In Japan, he was the outsider who had been parachuted in to rescue Nissan from the brink of bankruptcy – and in the process became a national celebrity. In both cases, he took on established institutions and rode roughshod over vested interests, closing factories and cutting jobs in the short term, but paving the way for future growth and profitability. The two companies were linked under a strategic alliance first forged in 1999, and were joined in 2016 by the smaller Japanese firm Mitsubishi. By 2017 the group was collectively producing more than 10 million vehicles a year. Ghosn, as chief executive of Renault and chairman of the two Japanese firms, remained the linchpin of the entire project. But trouble was brewing. Feathers had already been thoroughly ruffled in Nissan’s Yokohama headquarters by decisions taken in Paris. The French government is a shareholder in Renault, and in 2015 it managed to double its voting rights in the company, significantly increasing its influence over boardroom decisions. For Nissan this mattered a great deal, because Renault is not only its partner, but also its biggest single shareholder. To put it simply, this meant that political decisions taken in France, and with French interests at heart, could have a significant impact on Nissan. By 2018, the French government was making its increased influence felt. Ghosn was handed a renewed mandate, giving him another four years as chairman and chief executive of Renault. But he was under intense pressure from Paris to make the alliance “irreversible”. What he planned to do, as he confirmed at a press conference in Beirut in early January, was to create a new structure for the combined business. There would be a single holding company in which shares would be traded. This would own both Renault and Nissan. But the two brands would continue to be run as separate businesses, with their own headquarters and maintaining their distinct identities. Ghosn also wanted to bring the Italian-American carmaker Fiat Chrysler into the Alliance, turning it into a truly formidable global manufacturer. But in Japan, it is clear all of this was greeted with the deepest suspicion. Former Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa Former Nissan chief executive Hiroto Saikawa Insiders say Nissan bosses such as chief executive Hiroto Saikawa were already feeling vulnerable due to a decline in the company’s performance. Stronger links with Renault, they thought, would undermine their own authority and their autonomy. Nissan could become just an outpost of an international group - shorn of its Japanese identity. Ghosn’s own view is that these concerns were shared by members of the Japanese government, who later became involved in manoeuvres against him. Whether or not that is true, it is clear that by mid-2018 nerves at Nissan were on edge - and that without his knowledge, Ghosn’s position had become precarious. Ghosn and his lawyers claim that his arrest was the direct result of a plot involving senior Nissan executives and members of Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which aimed to remove him as leader of the Alliance, and stop him forging stronger links between Renault and Nissan. He was initially charged with breaking Japanese law by under-reporting his salary over a four-year period, to the tune of $44m (£33.7m). Kelly was also indicted for failing to report his chief executive’s full earnings. This allegation was later extended, taking the total to more than $80m over eight years. It concerned deferred salary, to be paid after Ghosn’s retirement. He says the money was never received, and would have had to be approved by the Nissan board, which never happened. The issue attracted the attention of US market regulators. In September 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission reached a settlement with Ghosn, Kelly and Nissan itself over allegations that compensation of $140m had been left out of financial disclosures. Fines were paid - in Ghosn’s case $1m - but there was no admission of wrongdoing. In the months that followed, other charges of “breach of trust” were added. Ghosn was accused of abusing his position for personal gain, by temporarily shifting personal investment losses to Nissan, and using company funds to pay a Saudi business associate, Khaled al-Juffali, $14.7m. He was also later accused of siphoning off $5m funds paid to a Nissan distributor in Oman, Suhail Bahwan Automobiles, and retaining them for personal use. Carole Ghosn was later questioned over claims that diverted funds were used by a company she controlled to buy a luxury yacht. Ghosn insists that the transactions were all above board, and that he is innocent of all these charges. At his press conference in Beirut, he railed against the Japanese judicial system, which he said “violated the basic principles of humanity”. He condemned the “vindictive inglorious individuals” he claimed had conspired against him. He also promised to publish internal documents from Nissan which he said would help prove his case. The company itself, meanwhile, insists it “discovered numerous acts of misconduct by Ghosn through a robust, thorough internal investigation”. It adds that it found “incontrovertible evidence of various acts of misconduct by Ghosn, including misstatement of his compensation and misappropriation of the company’s assets for his personal benefit”. The allegations have yet to be tested in a court of law. But according to Ghosn’s supporters, they provided ample ammunition to a group of executives hell-bent on bringing him down.

A senior vice-president at Nissan, he had worked closely with Ghosn and Kelly. Insiders say that for many years he was seen as being deeply loyal to them. But in 2018, his loyalties appear to have changed. He took information about Ghosn’s financial dealings to the authorities - and subsequently began working with them to investigate further, having agreed a plea bargain to protect his own position. Ghosn’s lawyers claim the whole process was a sham, and that senior Nissan executives, prosecutors and members of the government deliberately colluded in an effort to prevent further integration between Renault and Nissan. At his press conference, Ghosn implicated a number of senior figures within Nissan, who he accused of conspiring against him - among them Hiroto Saikawa, the chief executive at the time of his arrest, and his former protégé. Nissan Motor Co headquarters, Yokohama Nissan Motor Co headquarters, Yokohama However, Ghosn refused to say who within the government had been part of the “conspiracy”, citing the sensitivity of relations between Lebanon and Japan as a result of his escape. Questioned by the BBC, he said, “I don’t personally think that the top level was involved… I don’t think [Prime Minister] Abe-san was involved.” In response, Saikawa told reporters he had been “a bit disappointed” by Ghosn’s allegations. “He was my trusted boss and we were heavily betrayed by him once,” he said. “And this time I feel I have been greatly betrayed by him a second time.” A corridor inside the Tokyo Detention Center, where Carlos Ghosn was held A corridor inside the Tokyo Detention Center, where Carlos Ghosn was held By Rupert Wingfield-Hayes Many people, including Ghosn, have appeared genuinely surprised that Japan’s justice system is so different from those of other democratic countries. They shouldn’t have been. Any long-term resident of Japan will tell you the one thing that makes them uneasy about living in this otherwise peaceful and friendly society, is the power of its police and public prosecutors. There are numerous stories of foreigners getting caught up in a drunken argument or traffic dispute, a punch being thrown, and then of spending the next three weeks in police detention. But it is wrong to think that foreigners are singled out for this sort of treatment. The reality is, prolonged detention without charge in Japan is the norm. To its critics, the Japanese system is known as “hostage justice”. Ghosn was held, in total, for 128 days but there are many Japanese who have been held much longer. Lawrence Repeta is a constitutional law professor who has spent many years teaching in Japan and fighting for legal reform. “Look at the case of [Hiroji] Yamashiro,” he says. “He was held for 153 days.” Hiroji Yamashiro was a leader of protests against the construction of a new US military base in Okinawa. In 2017, he was arrested after he tried to block the entrance to the construction site. He was held in isolation for more than five months before being charged. Environmental protester  Hiroji Yamashiro Environmental protester  Hiroji Yamashiro “Then there’s the Moritomo Gakuen case,” Prof Repeta says, naming another high-profile scandal that hit the headlines here in 2017. He says the couple at the centre of that case were held without charge for 299 days. “Very, very long detentions before trial are the norm in Japan,” he says, “and during those detentions suspects will be interrogated for up to eight hours a day.” People can be held for an initial period of 23 days without charge, during which time they will only be allowed to meet their lawyer. They can be interrogated for many hours a day without the presence of legal counsel. It is a system that has been widely criticised, including by the United Nations Human Rights Commission, but Japan’s justice ministry remains unmoved. At a recent meeting with senior justice ministry officials, I asked why Japan has refused to bring its pre-charge detention system into line with other democratic countries. “Interrogation serves a very important function in the Japanese judicial process,” the senior official said. “It has been decided by senior legal experts that the presence of defence counsel during interrogation would impair the advancement of the interrogation process. But the defendant’s right to remain silent is guaranteed.” “Japan’s constitution says you have the right to remain silent,” says Prof Repeta. “But the reality is, it is denied. The prosecutors will scream at you, say you are a cockroach who is betraying Japan. There is no lawyer present, you are berated for eight hours a day, for 23 days, with no hope of it stopping.” This certainly fits with what Ghosn has claimed he experienced; of being daily pressured in to making a confession, of prosecutors saying they would go after his family if he didn’t confess. All legal systems make efforts to get those accused of crimes to confess. But critics of Japan’s system say it takes the pressure to confess to a different level. Former prosecutor Nobuo Gohara says the problem with Japan’s public prosecutors is they think they are infallible. “People point to Japan’s 99.4% conviction rate and make a misjudgement,” he says. “In fact police drop about 30% of the cases that they investigate. That means only 70% proceed to prosecution.” He says prosecutors generally only go ahead if they think the evidence for conviction is overwhelming. “So, the prosecutors think they are right,” he says. “And because they think they are right, they think a confession in front of the prosecutor is the right thing for the defendant to do. And having a defence lawyer present just gets in the way of the defendant making the correct confession.” March 2019: Ghosn (in blue hat) being led from custody March 2019: Ghosn (in blue hat) being led from custody This, according to Gohara, is why Japanese prosecutors take such a dim view of those who deny guilt, and why they will often re-arrest a suspect on slightly different charges once the initial 23-day period is over. Then the process of interrogation can begin all over again. But this is not the only aspect of Japan’s judicial process that sets it apart. As Ghosn found out, even when bail is granted, Japan’s prosecutors can demand some extraordinary conditions. In Ghosn’s case the most obvious was the court’s decision that he could not meet or even communicate with his wife. Prosecutors say Carole Ghosn was closely tied to the case, and she could have assisted her husband in destroying evidence. We do not know what evidence they presented to back this claim. “International law is clear,” says Prof Repeta. “Family members should not be kept separate.” Even defenders of the Tokyo prosecutor’s office struggle to explain the decision on Carole Ghosn. Former prosecutor Yasayuki Takai has criticised those who say Ghosn couldn’t get a fair trial in Japan. He says Ghosn’s performance at his press conference in Lebanon was that of “a comedian”. But asked if it was justified to keep the couple apart he is more ambivalent. “It’s not the case that if he had stayed in Japan he wouldn’t have been able to see his wife,” he tells me. “His lawyers needed to do a better job of convincing the court.” But he says that if he were the prosecutor running this case, he would have allowed Ghosn to see his wife. Most of those I have spoken to, those who defend Ghosn and those who criticise him, have expressed frustration and disappointment in his decision to flee. For former prosecutor Nobuo Gohara it is a missed opportunity to expose the faults of Japan’s system. “I wanted him to fight this case. I share the view of his lawyers that there was a high possibility he could win, that the evidence against him was weak.” Yasayuki Takai described the case as “very unpredictable” one which was being prosecuted under a “new and untested law”. “So the chance of acquittal is higher. If Ghosn had attended the trial properly and presented his case clearly there is a probability of a not guilty verdict. But he fled.” Nobuo Gohara is more sympathetic. “The first trial would have taken one and a half years before the second trial on other charges could even begin. So, it could take four or five years to get a verdict.” And according to Prof Repeta, even if Ghosn won, his legal problems might not be over. “Ghosn had the best lawyers, all the advantages. He could have won,” he says. “But then the prosecutors could appeal the acquittal all the way up to the Supreme Court. And in many cases in Japan acquittals are overturned on appeal. A reasonable person in Ghosn’s position, if they could escape, I think they would do it.”  “I was called a cold, greedy dictator,” said Mr Ghosn, seething with anger as he described his treatment at the hands of the press in Japan and elsewhere. Since his arrest, he has come under fire over his lavish lifestyle - his luxury houses funded by Nissan, not to mention the lavish party he threw for his wife at the Palais de Versailles to celebrate her 50th birthday. Certainly, Ghosn is not short of critics. But others have rallied to defend his character. Born in Brazil to Lebanese parents, he spent most of his childhood in Beirut. His university education, at the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, followed by the equally distinguished engineering school, the Ecole des Mines, should have given Ghosn a direct passport into the close-knit world of the French elite. Ghosn with Emmanuel Macron in 2014 - the current French president was economy and industry minister at the time Ghosn with Emmanuel Macron in 2014 - the current French president was economy and industry minister at the time  Ghosn's rapid rise through the business world at Michelin, Renault and Nissan won him armies of admirers. He was viewed as the archetype of “Davos man”, the kind of jetsetting alpha-executive who liked to rub shoulders with world leaders. But according to his biographer, Philippe Ries, appearances can be deceptive. “He was always an outsider,” Ries says. “He never cultivated political connections. He was invited on dozens of presidential foreign trips. Never went on a single one. Not a single one. He refused to play that game, and of course they hated him for it.” Ries knew Ghosn well when working alongside him in Japan during the early 2000s. He describes an engaging, courteous man whose company he seems to have enjoyed. At the Cannes film festival, 2017 At the Cannes film festival, 2017 Fifteen years later, he renewed the acquaintance while Ghosn was on bail in Tokyo. The two spent several weeks working together on a new book. I asked him if he thought Ghosn’s character had changed. “I listened to all that stuff about how he had become a greedy dictator, and I said, maybe his ego had got the better of him and he has become a completely different person.” It wasn’t the case. “Circumstances had changed,” says Ries. “But he was exactly the same man, 15 years older.” The image of Ghosn as an autocratic leader, whose underlings were too scared of him to report any alleged wrongdoing they found, has also been challenged by former associates. He would certainly keep underperforming executives on a tight leash, one insider told me, but those who were good at their jobs would be given plenty of autonomy. My own impressions of Ghosn, having met and interviewed him many times over the years, were mixed. At major events, such as motor shows, I became used to the way in which his subordinates  seemed rather overawed by his presence. Arrangements had to be made, and stuck to rigidly. Last-minute changes were frowned upon. He was often accompanied by a large retinue, sweeping onto the stage in regal fashion. The interviews themselves were always businesslike, sometimes bland, but occasionally he would drop in a small bombshell, which he knew would create instant headlines. Then, on to the next meeting. Most of the time, he certainly fitted the picture of the imperious CEO. Yet when I met him in London at short notice, he turned up without the retinue. He was open, friendly, and happy to chat freely. He only became guarded once the cameras had been turned on. At those moments, the alpha executive looked more like a role to be performed. But, as his recent Beirut press conference showed, it is a role he appears to enjoy. A billboard in support of Ghosn, on a Beirut street A billboard in support of Ghosn, on a Beirut street Japan has obtained an international request for Ghosn's arrest through Interpol and put diplomatic pressure on Lebanon. But there is no extradition treaty between the two countries. There are other factors to consider as well. The BBC’s John Simpson points out that “given the huge pride and sympathy people in Lebanon have displayed for Carlos Ghosn, the chances that the government here will agree to extradite him to Japan are vanishingly small”. One possibility, according to legal sources, is that he could stand trial in France. That country does not normally extradite its own citizens, and Ghosn has French nationality. Moreover, under the French legal system, its citizens can be tried for crimes committed abroad. What makes this scenario more plausible is that Ghosn is already being investigated by the French authorities. His home near Paris was searched by police last year, as they looked for evidence of potential financial wrongdoing. His former employer, Renault, has highlighted 11m euros (£9.3m, $12.2m) of questionable expenses. He denies wrongdoing. Legal experts say this inquiry could potentially be broadened to include the allegations made against Ghosn in Japan. The house in Beirut where Ghosn is now based The house in Beirut where Ghosn is now based People within the Ghosn camp insist he would welcome the opportunity to stand trial. “He wants his legacy to have value,” says one. “He needs to clear his name in order to protect his legacy.” But a substantial part of that legacy seems to be evaporating. Renault and Nissan have seen their profits tumble since his departure. Tens of billions of dollars have been wiped from the market value of both companies. Intense boardroom battles have led to the chief executives of both companies - one of them Saikawa - being ousted. The Alliance limps on. The deep structural connections between the two companies cannot easily be got rid of, but the prospect of deeper integration between them seems dead in the water. Ghosn, himself, is clearly a much-diminished figure. But he has not lost hope of turning his fortunes around, however. “I am used to what you call Mission Impossible,” he told journalists. “I don’t consider I’m in a situation where I can’t do anything. I want to clear my name.” One thing he is not planning to do is disappear into obscurity. When John Simpson asked him if he had any plans to retire, he was emphatic. “Oh no!” he said. “There are a lot of challenges ahead. It’s not time for retirement!” ",Negative,0.003394932
"Fashion chain Superdry has warned that its profits could be wiped out after sales fell sharply over Christmas. The firm, which has been trying to sell more clothes at full price, said it had been hit by ""unprecedented levels of promotional activity"" by rivals. Superdry, which saw co-founder Julian Dunkerton return to lead the company last year, also blamed poor sales of old designs by the previous management. Revenues at the retailer fell 15.8% over the 10 weeks to 4 January. As a result, the company said it now expected full-year profits to be between zero and Â£10m, compared with analysts' expectations of about Â£40m. Shares in Superdry sank as much as 20% in reaction to the news. The profit warning drew a high number of comments on social media. Allow Twitter content?

The company has experienced a turbulent 12 months. In April last year, Mr Dunkerton returned to the firm following a lengthy campaign against the previous management, who - he argued - were following a ""misguided"" strategy. Since his return, Mr Dunkerton has been trying to focus on full-price sales and reducing promotions, but this meant the chain suffered over the crucial Christmas trading period as other brands slashed prices. Mr Dunkerton said: ""Everyone at Superdry continues to work intensively to deliver the turnaround of the business. While we have always said it will take time, we continue to make progress in implementing our strategy."" ""We halved the proportion of discounted sales over our peak trading period, benefiting both our margins and the Superdry brand. ""However, this adversely affected our sales during the peak trading period, given the level of promotional activity in the market. Despite this, our disciplined plan to reinvigorate the brand and return Superdry to sustainable long-term growth is on track."" Julian Dunkerton co-founded Superdry in 2003 The company said it had been ""encouraged"" by the reaction to the limited range of new designs brought in by the new management, but added this had not been enough ""to offset weaker trading on older product"". Analysts at Liberum said Superdry's problems were partly self-inflicted. ""We agree a full-price stance is appropriate for branded fashion companies,"" they said. ""However, this only works when the quality of the product and ranges are adequate, and maybe the management were too aggressive with this stance while still trying to clear a less-than-ideal mix of inventory."" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the return of Mr Dunkerton was ""starting to look like a difficult second album rather than an overnight success"". ""After nine months in charge, and after a lengthy campaign to oust the previous management, there will be increasing pressure on him from the market to deliver tangible signs of progress as we move through 2020."" Fashion brand Joules added to the retail sector's woes after it said profits were set to be ""significantly below market expectations"" following poor Christmas trading. The company said sales were ""significantly behind expectations"", dropping 4.5% in the seven weeks to 5 January from a year earlier, although it blamed this on ""one-off"" issues that hit the availability of stock. Joules also said it expected cost ""headwinds"" as a result of tariffs being imposed by the US-China trade war. Shares in Joules fell 20% in response to the update. Joules chief executive Nick Jones said: ""We are disappointed with our inability to fully satisfy our customers' demand through our online channel during the important Christmas sale period.

"Does a new dawn beckon for the Stormont institutions? NI Secretary Julian Smith is ""holding the people of Northern Ireland to ransom"", the union Unison has said. It follows comments he made to the BBC that extra money for workers would be withheld in the absence of a deal. The British and Irish governments havepublished a draft deal,externalto restore the executive after three years of political deadlock at Stormont. About 9,000health workers are currently on strikeover pay and staffing levels in NI. Get all the latest reaction on our live page What's in the draft Stormont deal? Will a deal be done to restore devolution? ""There is no money coming unless the executive gets up and running,"" Mr Smith told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""I want to focus on public services, they need to get back to work,"" he said. This video can not be played Stormont talks: Julian Smith warns that financial package depends on an agreed deal Patricia McKeown, from Unison, told the BBC that the dispute over health workers' pay could be ""resolved immediately"". ""That's about holding the people of Northern Ireland at ransom,"" she said. ""It's about really infringing on their human rights, health workers and patients alike."" Mr Smith and TÃ¡naiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveneymade the announcement of a draft deal at a media conference at Stormont on Thursday evening. The Northern Ireland Secretary had asked the Stormont speaker, Robin Newton, to arrange an urgent meeting of the assembly for Friday. However, on Friday morning, Mr Newton said the Northern Ireland Assembly will only be recalled if the political parties agree on a potential deal to restore power sharing. DUP leader Arlene Foster has said that the proposals are ""not perfect"" but offer a basis to move forward. Sinn FÃ©in is examining the draft deal at internal party meetings on Friday. If you are reading this page on the BBC News app, you will need to visit the mobile version of theBBC websiteto submit your question on this topic. Speaking to BBC News NI, Mr Smith said politicians have ""decisions to make but now is the time"". If agreed, the deal, entitled New Decade, New Approach, could see the assembly reconvene on Friday.  Thursday marked three years to the day since Stormont collapsed. An assembly spokesperson said it was the speaker's responsibility to ensure arrangements are in place for a sitting to facilitate the appointment of an executive. Three years of political deadlock at Stormont 'Now is the moment' to restore devolution She added:  ""It is not for the speaker to react to political speculation and he has been clear that whether or not the deadline of 13 January can be met is a matter entirely for parties. ""While the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has requested that the speaker call a sitting of the assembly, the process of doing so remains one for the speaker to undertake in consultation with the parties."" Simon Coveney and Julian Smith held a joint media conference on Thursday night The statement added:  ""The speed and timing of any sitting therefore depends entirely on when the speaker hears positively from the parties."" Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Mrs Foster said she was ""hopeful"" that the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in can restore the executive. The DUP leader said she had spoken to Michelle O'Neill on Thursday evening. ""Discussions will continue throughout the day and hopefully we can get to a place where we can have the executive up and running again,"" she said. Two key sticking points in the Stormont talks were around an Irish language act and the petition of concern. The call for an Irish language act has been a key sticking point The purpose ofpetition of concern is to protect one community from legislation that would favour another and a valid petition requires the signatures of 30 MLAs. The draft deal says there is to be ""meaningful reform"" of the petition, which would be ""reduced and returned to its intended purpose"" and would ""only be used in the most exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, having used every other mechanism"". The proposed deal would see legislation created for the appointment of both an Irish language commissioner and an Ulster-Scots commissioner. Earlier in the week,the Orange Order reiterated its opposition to a standalone Irish language act. But Mrs Foster argued that the new deal was ""an entirely different construct to what was suggested before"". Questioned on BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan show about whether a unionist veto around the Irish language was included in the small print of the draft document, DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said standards ""set for the use of the Irish language have to be agreed by the first minister"". ""That does mean the DUP will have a very important and crucial say in how those standards are drawn up and what they will be,"" he said. In a statement on Thursday night, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said her party was ""studying the text and will give it careful consideration"". ""The Sinn FÃ©in Ard Chomhairle will meet tomorrow to fully assess it,"" she added. Mr Smith and Mr Coveney brief the press on the deal Mr Smith said the deal will transform public services and restore public confidence in devolved government and asked all parties to support it. The secretary of state said accepting the deal would also bring about the parties' commitment to immediately ending ongoing industrial action by healthcare staff. The proposed deal also makes provision for a number of long-standing demands of environmentalists, including the idea that a new Programme for Government would see a separate climate change act for Northern Ireland - the only part of the UK without such legislation.

"This video can not be played Footage appears to show a missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran Western countries say they have evidence that an Iranian missile shot down a Ukrainian plane close to Tehran airport on Wednesday. Iran has denied any involvement, and say the plane was not hit by a missile. So what's the evidence that an Iranian missile was to blame? Video footage shared on Iranian social media accounts appears to show the moment of impact on Ukrainian International Airlines flight PS752. The images show a flash followed by a loud bang. The plane then continues to fly, turning back in the direction of Tehran airport, then crashing into the ground in a ball of flame. BBC Monitoring has indentified the location from where the video was shot to Parand, a residential area west of Tehran. It's about 30km (18miles) from Imam Khomeini International Airport, where the aircraft began its journey. Rows of housing blocks, a construction site and a storage tank, which all appear in the video, match a Google Earth image of the location, according to BBC Monitoring. There are now many photos of the plane wreckage available on media sites. These photos, and the subsequent detailed examination of the wreckage itself, will hold vital clues such as burn marks indicating a fire, explosive residue which could point to a bomb on board or possible shrapnel damage from a missile. An anti-aircraft missile is generally designed to detonate at a distance from the target, sending shrapnel towards it, inflicting maximum damage. Puncture holes pointing inwards could indicate an explosion or damage from outside the aircraft. And detailed analysis of the size and shape of any holes could give an indication of the type of missile used. What we know about downed flight PS752 Plane crash victims 'were the best of us' How strong is Iran's military? At this stage, it's difficult to verify many of the images which are being shared which - it's claimed - show damage consistent with a missile attack. Some show the nose of a missile from the Russian-made Tor missile system. These photos have not been independently verified yet and we don't know where or when they were taken, because there are no identifiable landmarks. US intelligence sources say two missiles were fired, according to US media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Questions have been raised about why the nose of the missile in these photos appears to be intact. However, an expert we've spoken to explains that it's not surprising to see the nose - which contains its guidance system and does not itself impact the target - intact and at a distance from the crash site. There are reports from inside Iran that the crash site has already been bulldozed and the wreckage cleared away.  Elizabeth Palmer of CBS news reported that ""virtually all pieces"" of the plane had been removed by Thursday. This makes the digital evidence gathered so far a vital element in determining what actually happened to the aircraft. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The flight data recorder captures everything going on with the plane's systems. This will be crucial in revealing if there were any internal malfunctions. The voice recorder is designed to contain two hours of audio from the cockpit, and may hold vital clues, as it records what the flight crew were saying at the time. Iranian officials say it could take up to two months to download data from the black boxes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It takes a long time to investigate because there's a huge amount of data, says aviation expert Julian Bray.  However, he also says that skilled analysts may be able to get an initial idea from the data within a couple of weeks. There's a limit to what the black boxes can reveal if a bomb or missile destroys the aircraft. They could simply stop working, although the voice recorder might pick up a sound wave just beforehand. Some investigations can last years. A probe into the crash of an Ethiopian plane off Beirut in 2010 took two years to complete,even though the black boxes were sent to France, which has some of the world's top investigators.,external The Iranian military would have been on very high alert just hours after the launch of Iranian missiles at US targets in Iraq, in anticipation of possible retaliatory strikes by the US. The area where the plane came down was not only close to the capital, Tehran, but also a military base of the Iran's Revolutionary Guards. The plane wreckage could hold vital clues as to what happened There are however multiple precautions that should have been in place to prevent a civilian airliner being targeted in error. The radar system used by the missile operators is designed to pick up identifying signals from all civilian aircraft. ""Flight PS752 was transmitting a transponder code showing its civilian identity registration, position and altitude,"" says Justin Bronk, a Research Fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, ""and the missile radar operator should have been able to see that information."" If this does prove to be a missile strike on a passenger plane, it would not be unprecedented. In 2014, a Russian-made missile hit a Malaysian civilian airliner over Ukraine, killing 298 people. An Iranian aircraft was shot down in error in 1988 by a US navy warship, the USS Vincennes, killing 290 people. In 1983, a Soviet fighter jet took down a Korean passenger plane after it strayed into Soviet airspace. All 269 people on board died.

"The government has been urged to consider imposing restrictions on pay-as-you-go mobile phones to prevent county lines drug gangs using them. Current rules that allow people to buy the phones anonymously are being exploited by drug dealers, the policing watchdog for England and Wales said. It called for a Home Office review of the ""criminal abuse"" of mobile phones. The Home Office said it was investing Â£20m to further disrupt county lines activity. The term ""county lines"" is used to describe gangs and organised criminal groups distributing drugs from typically larger cities to smaller towns around the country using mobile phones to arrange deals with suppliers and buyers. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services' report into how police forces have responded to the crime found gangs were sidestepping court orders that block phones and numbers suspected of being used for drug dealing. There was ""little support"" from officers for these orders, inspectors found, because dealers can obtain replacement numbers and phones - sometimes referred to as ""burners"" - ""quickly and anonymously"". In one instance, officers told inspectors a drug gang received and shared a new phone number within an hour of the service provider acting on an order. Former detective Mark Powell, one of the inspectors who worked on the report, told reporters the ""impression"" from officers they spoke to was that restrictions on buying phones anonymously would be ""welcome"". This could involve people registering personal details when buying a mobile phone or replacement SIM card, the report said. Mr Powell said: ""Officers have to resort to lengthy investigations to try to prove who had a phone. ""But clearly there's a wider debate to be had. ""We are not saying anonymity should no longer be available to everybody, but we are saying there needs to be a review of the criminal abuse of mobile phones."" He added this should look at whether regulations need ""strengthening"", but this was ""not the end of pay-as-you-go"". 'County-lines gangs fuelling' child slavery rise 'We're here to make money and not get killed' How I became a victim of a modern slavery gang Latest analysis suggests there are more than 2,000 individual deal line phone numbers in the UK, linked to around 1,000 county lines. London, Birmingham and Liverpool are the main exporting areas, with other county lines originating from a further 23 forces, inspectors said. Chief inspector of constabulary, Sir Thomas Winsor, said: ""People regard their communications as a species of privacy that should not be intruded into. ""That's why we say the matter should be considered."" Measures enabling the courts to block individual mobile phone numbers were contained in legislation passed in 2015, when county lines were starting to spread. It took another two years for the powers to be implemented, by which time the drug gangs had strengthened their grip. The paperwork involved in applying for the orders was burdensome - fewer than 50 have been granted since then - and police found that when mobile numbers were shut down others were quickly in their place. Being able to pin a particular phone number to an individual would therefore be a huge advantage for detectives - and not just those investigating drug dealing. Virtually every criminal conspiracy and serious offence involves the use of mobiles or SIM cards, purchased anonymously. But the ease and speed at which pay-as-you-go phones can be acquired is big business for retailers and a major attraction for customers, which is why the government is likely to proceed very cautiously before introducing any restrictions. County lines gangs typically coerce children and vulnerable adults to move and store the drugs and money. Inspectors suggested those excluded from school could be some of the most at risk of being targeted. They also raised concerns about how those who were considered vulnerable and had been drawn into the gangs were handled by police. A Home Office spokesman said: ""We are investing Â£20m to further disrupt county lines activity and established the National County Lines Co-ordination Centre, which has so far resulted in more than 2,500 arrests and the safeguarding of over 3,000 vulnerable children and adults.""

"This video can not be played Lewis suggests referendum on royals Labour leadership candidate Clive Lewis has said there should be a referendum on the future of the Royal Family. Speaking at his campaign launch in London, he said: ""A lot of people would like to see the monarchy scaled down."" He said he understood the Duke and Duchess of Sussex'sdecision to step backas ""senior"" Royal Family members. Mr Lewis is running to replace Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader but has not yet secured the support from MPs and MEPs needed to stay in the contest. The shadow Treasury minister needs 22 MPs or MEPs to nominate him in order to stay in the race. Which Labour contender is the most working-class? Long Bailey, Nandy and Phillips secure nominations Who will be Labour's next leader? Corbyn won't endorse any leadership contenders Asked about the Royal Family at his leadership campaign launch in Brixton, south London, Mr Lewis said he understood why Prince Harry and his wife Meghan wanted to step back from their duties. ""I think it is extremely unfortunate and a sign of the media we have that they feel they had to do this,"" he said, arguing that Meghan had suffered from racism in the press. He said a lot of people had discussed the Royal Family being ""quite large"" and asked: ""Why not have a referendum on the future of the Royal Family?"" Mr Lewis added: ""Let's talk about what a modern state looks like and what the role of the Royal Family would be."" ""I'd rather see us as citizens than subjects in the 21st Century,"" he said. By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check Historically, the term ""subject"" has often been associated with people belonging to a country under a monarchy. Until 1949, nearly everyone with a close connection to the UK was called a ""British subject"". After that date, citizenship became the main form of nationality in the UK - replacing most people's ""British subject"" status. People in the Commonwealth - an association of countries formerly under British rule - continued to be collectively referred to as ""British subjects"" until 1983, according to the government (although it wasn't an official status for most of them). Nowadays, only a very small number of people qualify as British subjects, according to the government. For example, someone who is not recognised by any country as having a nationality may be allowed to become a British subject. After his campaign launch, Mr Lewis took to social media to emphasise he was not calling for the monarchy's abolition. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

And, in an interview later with the BBC, Mr Lewis sought to downplay the significance of his comments on the Royal Family, adding that his focus was on wider political and constitutional reform. He said: ""My whole speech today was talking about the crisis of democracy and the fact that we need to empower people."" On Wednesday, Prince Harry and Meghan revealed their intention ""to step back as 'senior' members of the Royal Family, and work to become financially independent"". They said they would split their time between the UK and North America, while ""continuing to honour our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth, and our patronages"". The decision came ""after many months of reflection and internal discussions"", they added. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland said that ""we must continue to celebrate and support"" the contribution the Royal Family makes to the UK, adding that it had an ""important role in public service"". Mr Lewis also used his speech to call for the abolition of the House of Lords and the introduction of proportional representation, describing the voting system as ""the fairest way to elect a Parliament"". There are currently six MPs in the Labour leadership contest So far, Mr Lewis has only secured support from four of his MP and MEP colleagues in his bid to become Labour leader, with Monday the deadline for gathering enough backing. Also seeking more nominations is shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry who currently has seven. The other candidates - Rebecca Long Bailey, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips and Sir Keir Starmer - have secured the required support. There is also a contest to become deputy leader after Tom Watson stepped down in December. The new leader and deputy leader will be announced on 4 April. Addressing the future of his party, Mr Lewis said Labour needed to ""modernise or die"". He called for a ""progressive alliance"" with others and criticised his own party for failing to talk to the Greens and Liberal Democrats during the last election. ""Boris Johnson wasn't afraid of talking to the Brexit Party and that worked extremely well for them - we didn't do that,"" he said. He also criticised New Labour for ""stepping away from our values in order to get into office"" and said: ""When we won victories in the 2000s we were planting the seeds of future losses.""

"When Clare Crisp received an email from her energy provider, Shell Energy last November, she was shocked and confused. Her direct debit had been nearly doubled from Â£72 to Â£130 per month, despite her account previously being Â£148 in credit. ""I looked at my bills and thought: what on earth has gone on?"" she says. In fact, Shell Energy had looked back over the past five years to 2014 and decided that she had been underpaying for her electricity. To cover the extra cost of Â£512, they increased her direct debit. Shell Energy cancelled bills for Ms Crisp's electricity usage going back to 2014 However, energy firms are no longer allowed to issue these kinds of ""catch-up"" bills for a period of more than a year. Regulator Ofgem banned firms from doing so last year,to make sure customers such as Clare wouldn't be left struggling financially, or even in debt, after receiving unexpected bills. Shell Energy says that once it was notified of the mistake, it was corrected. Clare's account was refunded with the full amount of Â£512 and her direct debit amended. It also added that all of its customer accounts were monitored by ""dedicated teams"". Figures released to BBC News by the Energy Ombudsman show that it resolved 2,539 complaints about back-billing in 2019, the first full year in which the ban applied. This was an increase of more than a third, from 1,903 complaints in 2018. It also said more complaints were upheld last year. The Energy Ombudsman is responsible for looking into complaints about energy suppliers if customers are unhappy with the outcome or have not received a timely response from the company. It can also recommend a supplier change its decision. Citizens Advice,which runs a national consumer helpline and website,external, said it helped 2,691 people in England and Wales with catch-up bills in the year to November 2019. Billing errors are the most common problem reported to the helpline, the charity says. Previous research by Citizens Advice suggested,externalthat the typical back bill was Â£1,160. In extreme cases, they exceeded Â£10,000. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said that a ""large and unexpected bill is very worrying for anyone who receives it"". Ms Guy added: ""Customers who think their gas or electricity supplier may be billing them unfairly should contact the company directly in the first instance."" A spokesperson for the Ombudsman added that energy companies were having to ""get to grips"" with the new rules on billing. They said: ""It's important to point out, however, that any decision to uphold a back-billing complaint may or may not be due to a failure on the energy supplier's part to apply the new rules correctly."" From May 2018, energy firms were banned from back-billing domestic customers for energy used more than 12 months ago. Back bills are typically issued when suppliers estimate bills if they haven't received regular meter readings. Once a firm has the readings, they might send a catch-up bill if the estimated charge was too low. The ban started in November 2018 for the smallest businesses. The only exception is when customers have purposefully prevented the company from taking a reading. Some of the biggest suppliers had already been doing this before the ban as part of a voluntary agreement. Clare initially joined First Utility in May 2014. But after the company's takeover by Royal Dutch Shell, it was rebranded. ""I was told that I didn't need to do anything - and nothing changes. I just stayed with them because everything was the same,"" she says. Clare says that she was confused as to why she received a large ""back bill"" from the supplier after providing accurate meter readings. ""I had a smart meter installed in 2017. But even before that, when I was sending meter readings through, they were accurate and I was billed for exactly what I used."" Although Shell Energy's mistake was corrected, receiving a large catch-up bill dented Clare's trust in the supplier. She said: ""I'm absolutely going to cancel my contract with them. It might cost me Â£100 in exit fees, but with the way I've been made to feel, I don't want to give them any more of my custom."" If you think you might have been back-billed unfairly,Citizens Advice,external,the energy regulator Ofgem,externalandthe Energy Ombudsman,externaloffer guidance on their websites.

"The vehicles have been built by Alexander Dennis in Falkirk Electric buses are being launched in Glasgow on a commercial route for the first time since the 1960s. Bus company First Glasgow said the introduction of the two vehicles was a ""statement of intent"" as Glasgow aims to become a ""net zero"" city. Electric trolley buses previously operated in the city until they were decommissioned in 1967. The new buses will run on the M3 route, connecting Milton and Springburn with Stobhill Hospital and the city centre. Glasgow and Edinburgh battle to win first 'net-zero' crown Scotland's first low-emission zone launched Glasgow to host UN climate change summit They were built in Falkirk by Alexander Dennis and they were bought for First Glasgow with funding from electricity distributor SP Energy Networks. Described as ""state of the art"", the buses have ""mirrorless smartvision technology"" -  high definition digital cameras and an interior screen. The bus firm says it removes the need for wing mirrors, helps reduce blind spots and the effects of bad weather on their vision. They also have USB charging points, on-board audio-visual next stop announcements and free wi-fi. Their introduction comes after Glasgow became the first Scottish city to have alow emissions zone, where emissions standards must be met by 20% of buses which pass through the city centre. All vehicles entering the zone from December 2022 will have to meet the standards. Operator First said it was already 40% compliant with the regulations and it has promised to introduce more low-emissions buses. Managing director Andrew Jarvis said the business wanted to make buses ""part of the solution"" to improve air quality in the city. The new buses will make bus travel easier and more convenient for travellers as well as being better for the environment, he said. ""Every customer journey on the route will save around 2kg of CO2 compared with driving on your own in an average car, making bus the best choice in reducing the impact on the planet,"" he added. A Glasgow trolleybus on display at Sandtoft Glasgow last had all-electric buses in the 1960s. The city started to develop a network of trolleybuses in 1949. It was hoped they could combine some of the advantages of trams with the ability to steer round obstacles such as parked vehicles. But in 1967 they were phased out for what was seen as a more modern technology - the diesel bus. One the last of the Glasgow trolleybuses ended up as an exhibit at the Trolleybus Museum at Sandtoft in Lincolnshire. One of the new buses will be displayed at Glasgow's Riverside Museum over the weekend, before going into service on Monday. The project has been financed through SP Energy Networks' Â£20m Green Economy Fund. It is also backing the installation of 22 electric vehicle charging points in First Glasgow's Caledonia depot. Its chief executive Frank Mitchell said Glasgow's ambition to be the UK's first net zero carbon city by 2030 would require ""big changes"". ""The introduction of the low emission zone was the cities first big test and sets out a marker for its ambitions,"" he said. ""The introduction of this new electric bus technology which will ultimately improve air quality and noise pollution in the city centre and other communities.""

"Children take part in a science lesson at Tower View Nursery in Glasgow Families are being urged to apply for new funded nursery places as the national entitlement increases this summer. Previously parents could receive 600 hours of free childcare - roughly 16 hours per week in term time. In August this increases to 1,140 hours a year for all three and four-year-olds, and a quarter of two-year-olds. It is part of a""landmark"" Â£1.5bn funding dealbetween the Scottish government and local authorities. Children's minister Maree Todd said the new scheme could save each family as much as Â£4,500. However critics of the scheme have raised issues over cost, timing and a ""workforce crisis"" in nurseries. Thousands more staff have been put in post in preparation for the new scheme In 2017 the Scottish government announced it would almost double its funded childcare as part of a plan to reduce health, education and employment inequalities later in life. Spending watchdog Audit Scotland later warned of a ""significant risk"" that local authoritieswould not be able to fund the expansion. However the government and Cosla reached an agreement two months later. It set out plans to spend Â£990m on day-to-day funding for the scheme by 2021 - Â£150m more than the government's previous estimate. Opposition politicians had previously warned of a Â£160m ""black hole"" in the funding proposals. Funding will rise annually from Â£33m this financial year to Â£567m by 2021/22, totalling Â£1.5bn over five years. Ministers urged to fix childcare plan 'flaws' Childcare training places increased at Scottish universities and colleges Campaigners say half-day nursery places are 'not wanted' The National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA) produced research last year which showed 71% of employers struggled to recruit staff at practitioner level - and that Scotland's nursery staff turnover rate was 29%, higher than the UK average. It recommended the scheme be reviewed annually to ensure nurseries could cover the cost of the new offer as well as keeping staff. Since March 2018 more than 270 nurseries have been built, extended or refurbished and an additional 4,300 full time equivalent staff are in post, according to the Scottish government. A phasing system was implemented last year giving approximately 50,000 children1,140 hours of funded childcareahead of the national rollout. Ms Todd said this was to enable parents to explore work, training or education opportunities. She said: ""Tens of thousands of children are already benefitting from high-quality early learning and childcare, and I've heard first-hand how it's helped to boost their confidence and communication skills, and given them access to more opportunities such as outdoor learning. ""I've also heard how it has made an enormous difference to families in terms of enabling mums and dads to get back into, or spend more time studying, working or training."" Each council has separate application processes and deadlines. Parents or carers can register through their local authority and apply for the option that suits their needs from the choices available. This could be a council, private or third sector nursery, playgroup or childminder. TheParent Club website,externalwill link to your local authority for more information.

Mr Smith and TÃ¡naiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveneymade the announcement of a draft deal at a media conference at Stormont on Thursday evening. The Northern Ireland Secretary had asked the Stormont speaker, Robin Newton, to arrange an urgent meeting of the assembly for Friday. However, on Friday morning, Mr Newton said the Northern Ireland Assembly will only be recalled if the political parties agree on a potential deal to restore power sharing. DUP leader Arlene Foster has said that the proposals are ""not perfect"" but offer a basis to move forward. Sinn FÃ©in is examining the draft deal at internal party meetings on Friday.

An assembly spokesperson said it was the speaker's responsibility to ensure arrangements are in place for a sitting to facilitate the appointment of an executive. Three years of political deadlock at Stormont 'Now is the moment' to restore devolution She added:  ""It is not for the speaker to react to political speculation and he has been clear that whether or not the deadline of 13 January can be met is a matter entirely for parties. ""While the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has requested that the speaker call a sitting of the assembly, the process of doing so remains one for the speaker to undertake in consultation with the parties."" Simon Coveney and Julian Smith held a joint media conference on Thursday night The statement added:  ""The speed and timing of any sitting therefore depends entirely on when the speaker hears positively from the parties."" Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme on Friday, Mrs Foster said she was ""hopeful"" that the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in can restore the executive. The DUP leader said she had spoken to Michelle O'Neill on Thursday evening. ""Discussions will continue throughout the day and hopefully we can get to a place where we can have the executive up and running again,"" she said. Two key sticking points in the Stormont talks were around an Irish language act and the petition of concern. The call for an Irish language act has been a key sticking point The purpose ofpetition of concern is to protect one community from legislation that would favour another and a valid petition requires the signatures of 30 MLAs. The draft deal says there is to be ""meaningful reform"" of the petition, which would be ""reduced and returned to its intended purpose"" and would ""only be used in the most exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, having used every other mechanism"". The proposed deal would see legislation created for the appointment of both an Irish language commissioner and an Ulster-Scots commissioner. Earlier in the week,the Orange Order reiterated its opposition to a standalone Irish language act. But Mrs Foster argued that the new deal was ""an entirely different construct to what was suggested before"". Questioned on BBC Radio Ulster's Nolan show about whether a unionist veto around the Irish language was included in the small print of the draft document, DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said standards ""set for the use of the Irish language have to be agreed by the first minister"". ""That does mean the DUP will have a very important and crucial say in how those standards are drawn up and what they will be,"" he said. In a statement on Thursday night, Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said her party was ""studying the text and will give it careful consideration"". ""The Sinn FÃ©in Ard Chomhairle will meet tomorrow to fully assess it,"" she added. Mr Smith and Mr Coveney brief the press on the deal Mr Smith said the deal will transform public services and restore public confidence in devolved government and asked all parties to support it. The secretary of state said accepting the deal would also bring about the parties' commitment to immediately ending ongoing industrial action by healthcare staff. The proposed deal also makes provision for a number of long-standing demands of environmentalists, including the idea that a new Programme for Government would see a separate climate change act for Northern Ireland - the only part of the UK without such legislation.

"The British and Irish governments have published the text of a draft deal aimed at restoring power sharing. The Northern Ireland secretary has asked the assembly speaker to convene a sitting on Friday. The DUP said the deal is ""a basis upon which the assembly can be re-established"" while Sinn FÃ©in's executive will meet to consider it. Luke Sproule, Amy Stewart and Ali Gordon The Green Party, which has two assembly members at Stormont, said it is hopeful a deal can be done. Leader Clare Bailey said: ""I think that this deal provides a chance to build towards
delivery and accountability within the institutions. âOf course, the devil is in the detail and we will continue
to scrutinise the document in full in the hope that a two party agreement can
create sustainable government.â But Ms Bailey added that there was not enough in the deal on the environment or in terms of reforming the petition of concern.  Allow Twitter content?

John CampbellBBC News NI Economics and Business Editor The formulation Julian Smith is using is a significant financial package
but heâs not putting a specific figure on it. But - we can attempt to match money to some of what is in the
draft deal. Thereâs a commitment to tackle health waiting lists, the worst in
the UK. It would cost between Â£700m and Â£1bn to clear those lists. Then thereâs the health service dispute which has seen nurses
and other workers on strike, which would take another Â£50m. Thereâs a commitment to resolve a pay dispute with teachers that would require about Â£70m. Added to that is an additional education commitment to ensure schools have a sustainable core budget â in the past financial year schools combined exceeded their budget by Â£22m. Thereâs also that commitment to increase the number of police officers by about 800, requiring an additional Â£40m per year. The figures are just some of the headlines but there's a raft of other measures mentioned. The Irish government is also in the mix with Simon Coveney prepared to invest â¬110m (Â£93m) in infrastructure projects in NI over the next three years. They are also prepared to put money on the table for the new medical school in Magee. More from that statement by Conradh na Gaeilge on the Irish language provisions in the draft deal. CiarÃ¡n Mac Giolla BhÃ©in said it was ""undoubtedly a historic advancement for our community"" but also expressed concerns over some elements. He said: ""The role and remit of the commissioner being left to the sign-off of OFMDFM leaves us at the whim of a veto being used against core components of the legislation and drafting and delivery of services."" ""The use of any veto to limit, obstruct or frustrate delivery of services and rights would undoubtedly erode trust and could be potentially catastrophic for any incoming executive. ""Legal advice is being sought on several of the provisions, including the âofficial statusâ provision. The devil is not only in the detail of the legislation, but in the implementation of that legislation."" NI Secretary Julian Smith is ""holding the people of Northern Ireland to ransom"", the union Unison has said. It follows comments he made to BBC News NI that extra money for workers would be withheld in the absence of a deal. Health workers and nurses are currently on strike over pay and staffing levels in NI. Patricia McKeown, from Unison, told said the dispute over health workers' pay could be ""resolved immediately"". ""That's about holding the people to Northern Ireland at ransom,"" she said. ""It's about really infringing on their human rights, health workers and patients alike.""  Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Footage appears to show missile strike on Ukrainian plane in Iran Evidence suggests an Iranian missile brought down a Ukrainian passenger plane that crashed near Tehran, possibly in error, Western leaders say. Canada and the UK called for a full and thorough investigation into the crash, which killed all 176 people on board. Iran's civil aviation chief, however, said he was ""certain"" that the plane was not hit by a missile. The crash came just hours after Iran carried out missile strikes on two airbases housing US forces in Iraq. Iran is known to have Russian-made Tor missile defence systems US media have speculated that the timing of the crash suggests the plane may have been mistaken for a US warplane as Iran prepared for possible US retaliation for the strikes. Victims included 82 Iranians, 63 Canadians and 11 Ukrainians as well as nationals from Sweden, the UK, Afghanistan and Germany. CBS News quoted US intelligence sources as saying a satellite detected infrared ""blips"" of two missile launches, followed by another blip of an explosion. What we know about downed flight PS752 Plane crash victims 'were the best of us' Why were so many Canadians on the plane? Meanwhile, Newsweek quoted a Pentagon and senior US intelligence officials, as well as an Iraqi intelligence official, as saying they believed Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 was hit by a Russian-made Tor missile. Video obtained by the New York Times,externalappeared to show a missile streaking across the night sky over Tehran and then exploding on contact with a plane. About 10 seconds later a loud explosion is heard on the ground. The plane, ablaze, continues to fly. An investigation is continuing into what caused the crash US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he had ""suspicions"" about what happened to the plane. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Western countries to share their information about the crash. Amid tensions heightened by the US killing of top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani on 3 January, Iran initially said it would not hand over the recovered black box flight recorders to Boeing, the plane's manufacturer, or to the US. However, an Iranian official later told Reuters the US had been formally invited to take part in the investigation, and the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) confirmed it had assigned an investigator. Boeing said it would support the NTSB in the inquiry, and the Transportation Safety Board of Canada said it had also been invited to the accident site by Tehran. This video can not be played Mobile phone footage appears to show the plane in the moments before it came down Under global aviation rules Iran has the right to lead the investigation, but manufacturers are typically involved. Iranian TV pictures later in the day showed the crash site being bulldozed. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he had received intelligence from multiple sources indicating that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, adding that it was possible that this was unintentional. ""This reinforces the need for a thorough investigation,"" he said. ""Canadians have questions and they deserve answers."" But he said it was too early to apportion blame or draw any conclusions, and refused to go into detail about the evidence. Who were the victims of the crash? Tributes to three British nationals killed The Canadians on the flight were expecting to fly on to Toronto from Kyiv. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson echoed Mr Trudeau's words and saidBritain was working closely with Canada and other international partners affected by the crash. Speaking in Canada, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said British nationals were advised not to travel to Iran, ""given the body of information that UIA Flight 752 was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, and the heightened tensions"". Ukraine's president met the relatives of crew members on Thursday Newsweek quoted sources as saying that Iran's anti-aircraft systems were probably active following its attacks on the US airbases. Two Pentagon officials had assessed that the incident was accidental, Newsweek added. This video can not be played Asked about the cause of the plane crash, President Trump said: ""I have my suspicions"" Earlier on Thursday, Oleksiy Danylov, the secretary of Ukraine's security and defence council,said in a Facebook post (in Ukrainian),externalthat a Tor missile strike was one of four possible causes being considered: The others are: A mid-air collision with a drone or other flying object Engine destruction/explosion due to technical reasons An explosion inside the plane as a result of a terror attack Mr Danylov said Ukrainian investigators, who are already in Iran, would include experts who worked on the investigation intothe 2014 downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine. At a news conference on Friday, Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation (CAOI) chief Ali Abedzadeh repeated his view that a missile was not the cause of the crash. ""The thing that is clear to us and that we can say with certainty is that this plane was not hit by a missile,"" he told reporters. ""As I said last night, this plane for more than one and a half minutes was on fire and was in the air and the location shows that the pilot was attempting to return."" On Friday, government spokesman Ali Rabiei described the reports of a missile strike as ""psychological warfare"". A pattern of disturbing indications is emerging suggesting that Flight PS752 may well have been shot down by mistake by Iran's own air defences. While it is not unprecedented for air defence systems in conflict zones to shoot down airliners, this would be an extraordinary error. The aircraft had only just taken off from an international airport; it was a scheduled flight; and it should easily have been recognisable. However, precisely what the operators of the Russian-supplied, Soviet-era Tor - or SA-15/Gauntlet system as it is known by Nato - would have seen is unclear. All this is hugely embarrassing for the Iranian authorities and is only going to complicate the politics involved in getting to the bottom of this tragedy. Ukraine International Airlines flight PS752 to Kyiv had 167 passengers and nine Ukrainian crew on board. A team from Iran's Red Crescent searched the debris for victims There was good visibility when the plane went down near Iran's capital, according to the Flightradar24 aviation website. Officials from the airline said the crew were experienced. Iran's head of emergency operations said 147 of the victims were Iranian. That would suggest that 65 of the foreign nationals had dual nationalities. The Ukrainian airline gave a helpline number for further information about passengers:+38-044-581-50-19.

"China has said it hopes to eradicate poverty in 2020 A Chinese province has said just 17 people, out of its population of more than 80 million, are living in poverty. Jiangsu province said only a handful of people lived below its benchmark of 6,000 yuan a year ($863; Â£660) following a successful state campaign. But the figures were questioned online, with one person asking: ""I don't believe it. Are there no unemployed people in the province? No beggars?"" Eliminating poverty is one of the Chinese government's major ambitions. How China became the world's 'economic miracle' South-eastern Jiangsu is one of the country's wealthiest provinces, second only in economic output to Guangdong. Its latest data from the end of 2019 shows that in the past four years, 2.54 million people have been lifted out of poverty, as defined by the province. It ties in with the province's declared target of essentially eradicating poverty by 2020. The 17 still living below the poverty standard are all capable of working, according to authoritieswho spoke to Chinese media,external, although four ""have diseases"". Despite a slowdown, China's economy is still growingat around 6% a year. But even with the country getting much richer, the apparent staggering success of Jiangsu's anti-poverty campaign has been queried online. ""How could they be so accurate?"" was a typical comment on Weibo, China's social media platform. This video can not be played Do people in China's rural communities think poverty reduction can work? While China's economy has skyrocketed in recent decades, poverty has not disappeared - and inequality has grown. Stories about individual cases of extreme poverty continue to shock the country. In 2019, well-wishers donated almost a million yuan toa Chinese student in a south-western province who was taken to hospital after living on 2 yuan($0.30, Â£0.20) a day for five years. The story echoed that ofa young boy who in 2018 arrived at school with his hair full of frozen ice. Dubbed ""Little Wang"", his story also went viral, leading to international donations from people impressed by his resilience, and shocked at his poverty. Pictures of eight-year-old Little Wang were shared tens of thousands of times There's no one standard definition of poverty across all of China, as it differs from province to province. One widely-quoted national standard is 2,300 yuan ($331; Â£253) net income a year. Under that standard, there were around 30 million people living in poverty across the whole of China in 2017. But many provinces have raised their poverty benchmark - as in the case of Jiangsu, where it is at 6,000 yuan. The 6,000 yuan figure breaks down to around $2.40 a day - which is above theWorld Bank's international poverty line of $1.90.,external China's mega-dump already full - 25 years early Since opening up to the global economy in the 1990s, China has seen its poverty rates tumble, and the government hopes to eradicate extreme poverty in 2020. According to the country's National Bureau of Statistics, the average disposable income in 2018 was 28,228 yuan ($4,059; Â£3,106) per person. That breaks down to 39,251 yuan in urban and 14,617 yuan in rural households.

"US regulators are seeking to fine Boeing $5.4m (Â£4.14m) for ""knowingly"" installing faulty parts on 737 Max planes. The move comes after the release of internal messages that raised more questions about the jet's safety. In one of the communications, an employee said the plane was ""designed by clowns"". Boeing has been under scrutiny since the fatal crashes of two 737 Max planes, which killed 346 people. What went wrong inside Boeing's cockpit? Boeing 737 Max: The battle over blame Boeing to halt 737 Max production in January The fine announced by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday is not connected to the software system that investigators have implicated in those crashes. It concerns ""slat tracks"" that are located on the wings. The FAA said the company submitted the jets for FAA approval despite determining that the wing parts had failed a strength test. It also accused Boeing of failing to oversee its suppliers properly. The planemaker has the right to contest the penalty, which follows a $3.9m fine the FAA proposed against the US aerospace giant for similar reasons last month. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The announcement heightens the pressure on the company, which is now facing multiple investigations following the 737 Max crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Last month,the company fired chief executive Dennis Muilenburg. The firm said Friday it had denied him severance and that he had forfeited stock awards worth about $14.6m. As part of the investigations, Boeing has provided hundreds of messages to the FAA and Congress. It said it had released redacted versions this week as part of its commitment to transparency. ""These communications do not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable,"" Boeing said. In one exchange in April 2017, an unnamed employee wrote: ""This airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys."" Thedocuments,externalalso showed Boeing planning to push back against requirements that 737 Max pilots receive training on simulators, which would have led to higher costs for its customers, making its aircraft less attractive. ""I want to stress the importance of holding firm that there will not be any type of simulator training required to transition from NG to Max,"" Boeing's 737 chief technical pilot at the time, Mark Forkner, said in a March 2017 email. ""Boeing will not allow that to happen. We'll go face to face with any regulator who tries to make that a requirement."" On Tuesday this week, Boeing reversed its position byrecommending 737 Max simulator training,externalfor all pilots. These messages refer to Boeing employees telling lies, covering up problems and treating regulators with contempt. They reinforce the impression - already expressed vividly by whistleblowers and in Congressional hearings - that Boeing was a company that had lost its way, focused on maximising production and keeping costs down, rather than on safety. Will all this actually harm Boeing though? It's questionable. The company's reputation has already been savaged; it may be calculating that it now has little to lose by being transparent about past failures. But it is easy to see now why the relationship between Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration has deteriorated so far - and why the recertification of the 737 Max has taken so long. Staff also appear to discuss problems with the simulators. In February 2018, a Boeing worker asked a colleague: ""Would you put your family on a Max simulator-trained aircraft? I wouldn't."" ""No,"" came the reply. Boeing has said it is redesigning the automated control system thought to have been the primary cause of the crashes. But 737 Max planes have been grounded worldwide since March and with no sign from regulators that the aircraft will be re-approved for flight anytime soon,the firm has been forced to halt production of the planes. On Friday, the economic costs started to be felt as Spirit Aerosystems, a major Boeing supplier, said it would cut 2,800 jobs at a plant in Kansas, and expected smaller layoffs at some of its other factories. ""Spirit is taking this action because of the 737 MAX production suspension and ongoing uncertainty regarding the timing of when production will resume and the level of production when it does resume,"" the company said in a statement, which noted that Boeing has hundreds of 737 planes in storage. 29 October 2018:A 737 Max 8 operated by Lion Air crashes after leaving Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board 31 January 2019:Boeing reports an order of 5,011 Max planes from 79 customers 10 March 2019:A 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashes, killing all 157 people on board 14 March 2019:Boeing grounds entire 737 Max aircraft fleet The FAA said of the emails that safety problems had been addressed. However, the regulator added: ""The tone and content of some of the language contained in the documents is disappointing.""

"Tanaiste Simon Coveney and Secretary of State Julian Smith addressing the media at Stormont The British and Irish governments havepublished the text of a draft deal aimed at restoring power sharing in Northern Ireland.,external Secretary of State Julian Smith and TÃ¡naiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney made the announcement at a press conference at Stormont on Thursday evening. The move came three years to the day since devolution collapsed in Northern Ireland. If agreed, the deal, entitled New Decade, New Approach, will see the assembly reconvene on Friday. Mr Smith, who has written to the assembly speaker asking him to convene a sitting on Friday, said the deal will transform public services and restore public confidence in devolved government. This video can not be played The British and Irish governments have published the text of a draft deal aimed at restoring Stormont He asked all parties to support it, saying: ""Now is decision time, there is something in this deal for everyone."" Three years of political deadlock at Stormont 'Now is the moment' to restore devolution The secretary of state said accepting the deal would also bring about the parties' commitment to immediately ending ongoing industrial action by healthcare staff. It includes pay parity, a new action plan on waiting times and delivering reforms on health and social care. The deal would bring about the parties' commitment to ending ongoing industrial action by healthcare staff Health workers across Northern Ireland have been staging industrial action in protest against pay and staffing levels which they say are ""unsafe"". Simon Coveney said the path that led to this point had taken longer than many people thought. He said it was ""based on the extensive discussions and collective work undertaken by the parties since May last year, following the awful murder of Lyra McKee"". Ms McKee was murdered by the New IRA in April last year.The journalist was shot in the head while observing riots in Londonderry. ""The British and Irish governments, as well as all the party leaders, were left in no doubt by the wave of applause and the very public demonstration in St Anne's Cathedral that we had been called out to get politics in Northern Ireland working again,"" he said. This video can not be played 'Her murder brought us back to these talks' He added: ""I want you all to hear the words of Lyra McKee herself, the words she wrote in a book and never lived to publish. She said 'Northern Ireland is a beautiful tragedy strangled by the chains of its past, it's a place full of darkness and mysteries, but it's also my home.'"" Mr Coveney urged politicians to ""step up and fully represent their citizens"", adding: ""Forget win or lose... this is a deal full of compromises."" ""There is no need, and no public patience, for more process and more discussions. It is time for political leadership and a collective commitment to making politics work for people,"" he said. Analysis by BBC News NI Economics Editor John Campbell If the deal is done, the UK government is promising a large cash injection to tackle acute funding problems in Northern Ireland's hospitals and schools. The financial annex in the draft deal does not mention any specific figures. But last year, the most senior official in the Department of Health said he would need somewhere between Â£700m and Â£1bn to tackle waiting lists, which are the worst in the UK. So health service managers will have an expectation that a sum of a least that size will be on the way. Two key sticking points in the Stormont talks were around an Irish Language Act and the petition of concern. The purpose ofpetition of concern is to protect one community from legislation that would favour another and a valid petition requires the signatures of 30 MLAs. Simon Coveney said NI politicians need to 'step up and fully represent their citizens' The draft deal says there is to be ""meaningful reform"" of the petition, which would be ""reduced and returned to its intended purpose"" and would ""only be used in the most exceptional circumstances and as a last resort, having used every other mechanism"". The proposed deal would also see legislation created for the appointment of both an Irish language commissioner and an Ulster Scots commissioner. It also makes provision for a number of long-standing demands of environmentalists, including the idea that a new Programme for Government would see a separate climate change act for Northern Ireland - the only part of the UK without such legislation. The proposed deal would see the assembly reconvene on Friday Up until now, Northern Ireland has been bound by and fed into targets set by wider UK legislation. It proposes an independent environmental protection agency to hold government to account and to ensure compliance with environmental targets. And there is a suggestion that theill-fated RHI scheme,which helped collapse Stormont, would be shut down and replaced with different incentives to decarbonise heat. Other commitments include: Setting out a new action plan on waiting times Creating 900 new nursing and midwifery undergraduate places Police numbers increased to 7,500 New transparency measures for ministers New rules for special advisers Office of Identity and Cultural Expression set up In a statement released after the press conference,DUP leader Arlene Foster said: ""On balance, we believe there is a basis upon which the Assembly and Executive can be re-established in a fair and balanced way."" DUP leader Arlene Foster said it was 'not a perfect deal' but that 'there will always need to be give and take' The statement added: ""This is not a perfect deal and there are elements within it which we recognise are the product of long negotiations and represent compromise outcomes. There will always need to be give and take."" Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald TD said her party was ""studying the text and will give it careful consideration"". ""The Sinn FÃ©in Ard Chomhairle will meet tomorrow to fully assess it,"" she added. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said the party would meet on Friday to discuss the proposed deal The Ulster Unionists said they would attend the sitting and consider the business put before them if the assembly is recalled on Friday. Its leader, Steve Aiken, said: ""We will consider this complex and far reaching document carefully and consult widely within our party before making any further comments.""

"Segway's S-Pod was offline at CES after a crash during a demonstration Segway's prototype wheelchair crashed during a demonstration at the CES tech show. The S-Pod - a self-balancing electric wheelchair - was being tested by a journalist at the time. The rider had accelerated the vehicle before accidently crashing into a wall. Its maximum speed is 24mph (38km/h). The company said no one was injured. The crash made the S-Pod unavailable for further demos, but analysts say the company should not face lasting damage. ""In no way is a [malfunction] a total loss. It is still a sign to the public that the company is close to the finished product,"" said Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. The S-Pod is designed to be driven in enclosed spaces such as airports, theme parks and work campuses. Segway's director of marketing Jeff Wu told the BBC the concept model did not have a safety belt, but that his company intended to add one. The Chinese firm did not say how much it had spent on the prototype, but companies often spend millions of dollars developing products to have them ready to exhibit at the annual Las Vegas expo. The S-Pod is expected to go on sale in early 2021. The demo model had received significant media attention for its design. It is inspired by the geospheres in the film Jurassic World. Many on social media have also compared the vehicle to the hover chairs in the animated Pixar film Wall-E. Segway's self-balancing electric chair was inspired by the movie Jurassic World Segway is best known for its electric scooters, which are controlled by riders moving forwards, backwards or to the side. However, the S-Pod is steered via a joystick on its armrest. The crash is the latest in a long history of mishaps at the tech show. ""One reason that companies increasingly release products at their own separate events is because they have [greater] control over the environment,""commented Mr Rubin. Even so, trade shows can be still a valuable way to show off new concepts to large audiences, especially for smaller brands, he added.

But Razer's concept computers caught the wrong eye and were stolen from the PC-maker's booth before the event ended. One of the models was later spotted for sale on a Chinese e-commerce site, although it is unclear whether this was a hoax. Future Motion alleged that its designs have been illegally copied by rival firm. In 2016, US Marshalsraided the CES boothof a Chinese hoverboard maker, Changzhou First International Trade Co. US-based rival Future Motion had accused the company of stealing its intellectual property. Acting on an order from a judge, the authorities confiscated several of the Asian firm's one-wheeled scooters. But the case was later dropped.

"US regulators are seeking to fine Boeing $5.4m (Â£4.14m) for ""knowingly"" installing faulty parts on 737 Max planes. The move comes after the release of internal messages that raised more questions about the jet's safety. In one of the communications, an employee said the plane was ""designed by clowns"". Boeing has been under scrutiny since the fatal crashes of two 737 Max planes, which killed 346 people. What went wrong inside Boeing's cockpit? Boeing 737 Max: The battle over blame Boeing to halt 737 Max production in January The fine announced by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Friday is not connected to the software system that investigators have implicated in those crashes. It concerns ""slat tracks"" that are located on the wings. The FAA said the company submitted the jets for FAA approval despite determining that the wing parts had failed a strength test. It also accused Boeing of failing to oversee its suppliers properly. The planemaker has the right to contest the penalty, which follows a $3.9m fine the FAA proposed against the US aerospace giant for similar reasons last month. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The announcement heightens the pressure on the company, which is now facing multiple investigations following the 737 Max crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Last month,the company fired chief executive Dennis Muilenburg. The firm said Friday it had denied him severance and that he had forfeited stock awards worth about $14.6m. As part of the investigations, Boeing has provided hundreds of messages to the FAA and Congress. It said it had released redacted versions this week as part of its commitment to transparency. ""These communications do not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable,"" Boeing said. In one exchange in April 2017, an unnamed employee wrote: ""This airplane is designed by clowns who in turn are supervised by monkeys."" Thedocuments,externalalso showed Boeing planning to push back against requirements that 737 Max pilots receive training on simulators, which would have led to higher costs for its customers, making its aircraft less attractive. ""I want to stress the importance of holding firm that there will not be any type of simulator training required to transition from NG to Max,"" Boeing's 737 chief technical pilot at the time, Mark Forkner, said in a March 2017 email. ""Boeing will not allow that to happen. We'll go face to face with any regulator who tries to make that a requirement."" On Tuesday this week, Boeing reversed its position byrecommending 737 Max simulator training,externalfor all pilots. These messages refer to Boeing employees telling lies, covering up problems and treating regulators with contempt. They reinforce the impression - already expressed vividly by whistleblowers and in Congressional hearings - that Boeing was a company that had lost its way, focused on maximising production and keeping costs down, rather than on safety. Will all this actually harm Boeing though? It's questionable. The company's reputation has already been savaged; it may be calculating that it now has little to lose by being transparent about past failures. But it is easy to see now why the relationship between Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration has deteriorated so far - and why the recertification of the 737 Max has taken so long. Staff also appear to discuss problems with the simulators. In February 2018, a Boeing worker asked a colleague: ""Would you put your family on a Max simulator-trained aircraft? I wouldn't."" ""No,"" came the reply. Boeing has said it is redesigning the automated control system thought to have been the primary cause of the crashes. But 737 Max planes have been grounded worldwide since March and with no sign from regulators that the aircraft will be re-approved for flight anytime soon,the firm has been forced to halt production of the planes. On Friday, the economic costs started to be felt as Spirit Aerosystems, a major Boeing supplier, said it would cut 2,800 jobs at a plant in Kansas, and expected smaller layoffs at some of its other factories. ""Spirit is taking this action because of the 737 MAX production suspension and ongoing uncertainty regarding the timing of when production will resume and the level of production when it does resume,"" the company said in a statement, which noted that Boeing has hundreds of 737 planes in storage. 29 October 2018:A 737 Max 8 operated by Lion Air crashes after leaving Indonesia, killing all 189 people on board 31 January 2019:Boeing reports an order of 5,011 Max planes from 79 customers 10 March 2019:A 737 Max 8 operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashes, killing all 157 people on board 14 March 2019:Boeing grounds entire 737 Max aircraft fleet The FAA said of the emails that safety problems had been addressed. However, the regulator added: ""The tone and content of some of the language contained in the documents is disappointing."" In the emails and instant messages, employees spoke of their frustration with the company's culture, complaining about the drive to find the cheapest suppliers and ""impossible schedules"". ""I don't know how to fix these things... it's systemic. It's culture.

"The fires have already devastated huge swathes of Victoria and NSW Gale force winds have fanned two of Australia's massive bushfires into a feared ""mega blaze"", with authorities warning of worse weather to come. It had been feared for days that fire would spill over the New South Wales-Victoria border in the Snowy Mountains. Forecasts are for more heat, strong winds and dry lightning. In South Australia, firefighters also battled infernos on Kangaroo Island. In parts of both states, residents were told to leave their homes. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people across Australia took part in climate change protests on Friday. In cities including Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, demonstrators turned out to press the government of Prime Minister Scott Morrison to make a quick transition away from fossil fuels. Australians took to the streets across the country to criticise government climate policy Across many parts of the country deadly forest fires that have raged for weeks are threatening to advance again as temperatures soar. The winds mean fires could spread quickly and unpredictably this weekend. The mega blaze south of the Snowy Mountains came after two fires at Dunns Road and East Ournie Creek joined up, following another massive fire merger nearby earlier in the week. An area totalling nearly 600,000 hectares (1.5m acres) - about four times the size of Greater London - is now ablaze. New South Wales (NSW) Rural Fire Service spokesman Anthony Clark said a ""finger"" of the East Ournie Creek blaze had collided with the fire at Dunns Road on Friday evening. Mr Clark said a number of small fires started by lightning strikes had merged and grown, the Sydney Morning Herald reports. ""It provides a challenge for firefighters as, when they merge, it increases the size and opens up more uncontained perimeter."" Fires in NSW have destroyed about 1,000 homes since the New Year and more than 150 bushfires are burning there. But the danger is equally great further south in Victoria. Victoria's Country Fire Authority issued several emergency warnings on Friday, telling people to evacuate before it became too dangerous. Firefighters clearing a road in Victoria Making the task harder for fire crews, aircraft were unable to operate overnight in the dark. The largest town on the island in South Australia was cut off by bushfires as the weather whipped up the most significant threat for almost a week.

"More than a quarter of young people referred to specialist mental health services in England are rejected for treatment, says a think tank study. The Education Policy Institute (EPI) says 133,000 were turned away last year, including people who had self-harmed or experienced abuse. The report warns of average waits of almost two months and a system struggling to cope with the demand. An NHS spokesman rejected the report as a ""flawed analysis"". ""The NHS is actually ahead of its target on ensuring as many children as possible receive mental health care - seeing an extra 53,000 children, teenagers and young adults last year, a 14% increase on the year before,"" said the NHS spokesman. The NHS accused the report of using misleading measurements - arguing that it was wrong to assume that young people not given treatment by NHS mental health services were ""left to fend for themselves"", rather than being directed to get support elsewhere. Improving child mental health is 'years off', say MPs Child mental health referrals up 26% 'Black hole' in youth mental health support The EPI report, based on Freedom of Information responses from mental health service providers in England, warned of ""patchy"" provision for children and young people and a system ""under great strain"". ""There is a vast treatment gap, meaning the needs of hundreds of thousands of young people in England are not being met,"" said report author Whitney Crenna-Jennings. The most common reason for the rejection of 26% of referrals to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) was because children's conditions were not suitable for treatment or they ""did not meet eligibility criteria"". But the report raises concerns about a lack of consistency and transparency about support available to young people with serious problems. The average waiting time of 56 days is an improvement on 2015, when it was 67 days. But the report warns of significant regional variations, with waits of more than 180 days in west London. David Laws, institute chairman and former education minister, said progress has been ""hugely disappointing"". ""Young people continue to be deprived of access to specialist mental health treatment, despite the government claiming significant investment in mental health services over the past five years,"" he said. ""This report confirms what schools know only too well - that thresholds for children's mental health services are often too high and waiting lists too long,"" said Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union. Vicki Nash of Mind, the mental health charity, said the report's findings were ""deeply concerning"". ""We know that particularly for young people, timely and appropriate help can prevent further issues in later life. Too often the NHS is failing to provide this,"" she said. The NHS says it is planning to increase spending on mental health services more quickly than the overall NHS budget, which it says will be ""worth at least Â£2.3bn a year by 2023-24"".

"China has said it hopes to eradicate poverty in 2020 A Chinese province has said just 17 people, out of its population of more than 80 million, are living in poverty. Jiangsu province said only a handful of people lived below its benchmark of 6,000 yuan a year ($863; Â£660) following a successful state campaign. But the figures were questioned online, with one person asking: ""I don't believe it. Are there no unemployed people in the province? No beggars?"" Eliminating poverty is one of the Chinese government's major ambitions. How China became the world's 'economic miracle' South-eastern Jiangsu is one of the country's wealthiest provinces, second only in economic output to Guangdong. Its latest data from the end of 2019 shows that in the past four years, 2.54 million people have been lifted out of poverty, as defined by the province. It ties in with the province's declared target of essentially eradicating poverty by 2020. The 17 still living below the poverty standard are all capable of working, according to authoritieswho spoke to Chinese media,external, although four ""have diseases"". Despite a slowdown, China's economy is still growingat around 6% a year.

One widely-quoted national standard is 2,300 yuan ($331; Â£253) net income a year. Under that standard, there were around 30 million people living in poverty across the whole of China in 2017. But many provinces have raised their poverty benchmark - as in the case of Jiangsu, where it is at 6,000 yuan.

"Segway's S-Pod was offline at CES after a crash during a demonstration Segway's prototype wheelchair crashed during a demonstration at the CES tech show. The S-Pod - a self-balancing electric wheelchair - was being tested by a journalist at the time. The rider had accelerated the vehicle before accidently crashing into a wall. Its maximum speed is 24mph (38km/h). The company said no one was injured. The crash made the S-Pod unavailable for further demos, but analysts say the company should not face lasting damage. ""In no way is a [malfunction] a total loss. It is still a sign to the public that the company is close to the finished product,"" said Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. The S-Pod is designed to be driven in enclosed spaces such as airports, theme parks and work campuses. Segway's director of marketing Jeff Wu told the BBC the concept model did not have a safety belt, but that his company intended to add one. The Chinese firm did not say how much it had spent on the prototype, but companies often spend millions of dollars developing products to have them ready to exhibit at the annual Las Vegas expo. The S-Pod is expected to go on sale in early 2021. The demo model had received significant media attention for its design. It is inspired by the geospheres in the film Jurassic World. Many on social media have also compared the vehicle to the hover chairs in the animated Pixar film Wall-E. Segway's self-balancing electric chair was inspired by the movie Jurassic World Segway is best known for its electric scooters, which are controlled by riders moving forwards, backwards or to the side. However, the S-Pod is steered via a joystick on its armrest. The crash is the latest in a long history of mishaps at the tech show. ""One reason that companies increasingly release products at their own separate events is because they have [greater] control over the environment,""commented Mr Rubin. Even so, trade shows can be still a valuable way to show off new concepts to large audiences, especially for smaller brands, he added.

Its artificial intelligence robotCloi repeatedly failedto respond to commands on stage. The presenter was left to awkwardly joke that Cloi ""doesn't like me"". Razer claims that its three-screened Project Valerie concept laptop is a world first Two unusual gaming laptops, each with three 4K screens, were among of the hits of 2017's CES. But Razer's concept computers caught the wrong eye and were stolen from the PC-maker's booth before the event ended. One of the models was later spotted for sale on a Chinese e-commerce site, although it is unclear whether this was a hoax. Future Motion alleged that its designs have been illegally copied by rival firm. In 2016, US Marshalsraided the CES boothof a Chinese hoverboard maker, Changzhou First International Trade Co. US-based rival Future Motion had accused the company of stealing its intellectual property. Acting on an order from a judge, the authorities confiscated several of the Asian firm's one-wheeled scooters. But the case was later dropped.

But in 2014, Samsung thought it wise to put him in front of the press to help call attention to its latest TVs. His appearance was certainly memorable, but for all the wrong reasons after he walked off stage mid-presentation because of a problem with the autocue. Bill Gates found himself in the middle of a technical glitch at CES in 2005. The Microsoft founder was presenting Windows Media Center with US comedian Conan O'Brien. Using a remote control he attempted to pull up a slideshow of photos, but nothing appeared after several clicks. ""Right now, nine people are being fired,"" Mr O'Brien joked.
