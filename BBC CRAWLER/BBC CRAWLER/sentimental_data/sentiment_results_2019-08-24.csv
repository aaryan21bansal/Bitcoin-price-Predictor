"Prince Andrew, left, has previously been criticised for his association with Jeffrey Epstein Prince Andrew has defended his former friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, saying ""at no stage"" did he ""see or suspect"" any criminal behaviour. Epstein, 66, took his own lifein a jail cell this month while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. In a statement, the Duke of York said he wanted to ""clarify the facts"" around his ""former association or friendship"" with the US financier. He said it was a ""mistake"" to meet Epstein after he left prison in 2010. ""During the time I knew him, I saw him infrequently and probably no more than only once or twice a year,"" the 59-year-old prince said. ""I have stayed in a number of his residences. At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction."" The duke - who said he first met Epstein in 1999 - added that he had ""tremendous sympathy"" for all those affected by Epstein's behaviour. ""His suicide has left many unanswered questions and I acknowledge and sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure."" Prince Andrew will be hoping that his statement establishes his version of events: that he saw Jeffrey Epstein ""infrequently"", that he never saw anything in the early years of their friendship to make him suspect Epstein was a paedophile and that he now accepts it was a ""mistake and an error"" to continue to meet him after his release from prison. Andrew is asserting that from 1999 - when he met Epstein - until 2008 when Epstein was convicted, he never suspected what kind of a man Epstein really was. That must be taken at face value. What is more difficult for him is the fact that he continued to meet Epstein and go to his private homes after Epstein was released from prison. By that stage nobody could have had any doubt about this man's deviant behaviour. Andrew expresses ""regret"" that the person he thought he knew was not ""the real person"". All in all, it must be somewhat unlikely that this statement will quell the questions about Andrew's good sense and judgement. Allegations against Epstein began to surface in 2005 when the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida he had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. The financier was accused of paying underage girls to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. A controversial secret plea deal saw him plead guilty to a lesser charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution. He received an 18-month prison sentence and was released on probation in 2010. Andrew 'appalled' by Epstein's sex abuse claims Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Prince Andrew was photographed with Epstein in New York's Central Park in late 2010 - after the tycoon was released from jail. Footage has also emerged reportedly showing the prince at Epstein's mansion in Manhattan in 2010. This video can not be played Footage appears to shows Prince Andrew inside Jeffrey Epstein's New York residence in 2010 In the statement, released on Saturday, the duke added: ""I have said previously that it was a mistake and an error to see him after his release in 2010 and I can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, given what we now know. ""This is a difficult time for everyone involved and I am at a loss to be able to understand or explain Mr Epstein's lifestyle. ""I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behaviour."" Prince Andrew and his mother, the Queen, travelled to church together earlier this month In July 2019 Epstein was charged in New York with further allegations of sex trafficking and conspiracy and was due to face trial next year. He pleaded not guilty to all the charges but if convicted, was facing up to 45 years in prison.  2006Epstein is charged with unlawful sex acts with a minor 2008Epstein gets an 18-month sentence following a plea deal 2010Prince Andrew is pictured with Epstein in New York 2015The duke is named in a US court case relating to Epstein The Queen's third childquit his role as a UK trade envoy in 2011after the fallout from the photos of him and Epstein in 2010. The duke had been appointed the UK's special representative for international trade and investment in 2001 after retiring from the Royal Navy. He worked for - but did not receive a salary from - the government body UK Trade & Investment (UKTI), which reports jointly to the Foreign Office and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said Saturday's statement was a response to speculation in the media following the publication of footage of the duke at Epstein's house in New York. ""I think that this is a consequence of the build-up of press exposure in the days since and, as he would see it, a need to get his story, his rebuttal, out in as forceful terms as he can,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Worldwide protests over Brazilian government inaction on Amazon fires The huge number of fires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest has coincided with a sharp drop in fines for environmental violations, BBC analysis has found. Official data from Brazil's environment agency shows fines from January to 23 August dropped almost a third compared with the same period last year. At the same time, the number of fires burning in Brazil has increased by 84% - the highest number since 2010. It is not known how many of these fires have been set deliberately, but critics have accused President Jair Bolsonaro's administration of ""green lighting"" the destruction of the rainforest through a culture of impunity. Mr Bolsonaro has sent in the military to help put out the fires after coming under pressure from the international community, saying he wanted to ""help protect"" the Amazon. The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It is known as the ""lungs of the world"" and is home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. Analysis by BBC Brasil shows the number of fines handed out by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama) for environmental violations has dropped significantly since Mr Bolsonaro took office on 1 January. This year saw the lowest number of fines handed out by the agency in a decade (in the period between January and August) Between 1 January and 23 August 2019, the total number of fines handed out was6,895 Ibama handed out9,771fines during the same period in 2018: a drop of29.4% The total number of fines relating to ""flora"" - which includes deforestation and burning - dropped from4,138to2,535over the same period And in the nine states that make up the Brazilian Amazon, the drop in fines relating to flora dropped from2,817to1,627 Neither Ibama nor the ministry of the environment answered the BBC's queries about the figures. MariangÃ©lica de Almeida, a professor of environmental law who has defended clients over unfair fines, suggested to BBC Brasil that the figures for previous years could have reflected a culture of over-fining, in order to meet goals. However, others have pointed the finger directly at Mr Bolsonaro, who has scorned environmental activists and declared his support for clearing areas of the Amazon for agriculture and mining. Elisabeth Uema, who retired from Ibama last year, said it was clear even before Mr Bolsonaro was elected that he did not like Ibama. During his campaign, he pledged to limit fines for damaging the rainforest and to weaken the influence of the environmental agency. Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered In graphics: How bad are the Amazon fires? What is the 'historic' EU-Mercosur trade deal? The message was further underlined in April when Mr Bolsonaro ordered an investigation into officials who burned tractors and trucks belonging to loggers who were allegedly involved in illegal activities in the Jamari National Forest. This was a long-held policy seen as a deterrent against illegal loggers. The agency's work, she said, had also been hampered by the fact that just eight of its 27 offices across the country now had a permanent head. This video can not be played Members of Brazil's indigenous Mura tribe vow to defend their land ""The usual inspections, which had been planned since 2018, are happening. But little beyond that,"" Ms Uema, now the executive secretary of Ascema Nacional, the body representing Ibama employees, told BBC Brasil. Critics of the Bolsonaro administration insist the drop in fines does not mean fewer crimes against the environment are being committed. Analysis by Luis Barrucho, BBC Brasil The decline in the number of environmental fines at a time when Brazil has seen a spike in deforestation does not seem a coincidence to many. During last year's presidential race, Mr Bolsonaro vowed to open up the Amazon for commercial activity. When he was sworn in, he stayed true to his word. This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change Many of his critics say that Mr Bolsonaro operates a double standard when it comes to addressing environmental crimes, most of which remain unpunished. After all, the president promised a tough stance on criminal activity. Now, in face of national and international pressure, Mr Bolsonaro appears to have changed his tone and finally adopted measures to battle the fires. But he still hasn't acknowledged the link between the fires and the increase in deforestation in Brazil this year. And in a televised address on Friday he reinforced his plans to bring ""economic dynamism"" to the Amazon. The question now is whether Mr Bolsonaro's recent moves in fighting the fires will be accompanied by a consistent change in his environmental policies. Environmental activists have drawn links between Mr Bolsonaro's attitudes towards the environment and the recent surge in the number of fires in the Amazon rainforest. Satellite data published by the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) has shownan increase of 85% this year in fires across Brazil,external, most of them in the Amazon region. Mr Bolsonaro initially brushed it off, arguing that it was the season of the ""queimada"", when farmers burn land to clear it before planting. The president has also previously questioneddata from Brazil's National Space Research Institute which showed an 88% increase in deforestationin June compared with the same month a year ago. Amazon: Lungs of the planet But Inpe has noted that the number of fires is not in line with those normally reported during the dry season. Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but they are also deliberately started in efforts to illegally deforest land for cattle ranching. Whether there will now be a spike in fines remains to be seen. On Friday,Mr Bolsonaro confirmed that he had authorised the armed forces to help fight the fires. ""I've learned as a military man to love the Amazon forest and I want to help protect it,"" he said. The decree itself was fairly vague in its wording, but specified that the military would be deployed to nature reserves, indigenous lands and border areas in the region. Brazil's defence minister said a helicopter and two airplanes had already been deployed to the Amazon to help identify fire outbreaks and to carry equipment and military personnel. This video can not be played One campaigner called the forest fires a ""vicious cycle"" The announcement came after the international community began to exert pressure on Mr Bolsonaro. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have called the fires an international crisis. France and Ireland have also said they will not ratify a large trade deal with South American nations and Finland's finance minister has called on the EU to consider banning Brazilian beef imports. Both Ms Merkel and Mr Macron said the issue must be discussed at this weekend's G7 summit in Biarritz, France. Additional reporting by BBC Brasil's AndrÃ© Shalders This article initially stated there was a record number of fires in Brazil this year.

Emergency services were called at 18:40 BST on Saturday to St Mary's Avenue South in Southall, where the man was pronounced dead, the Met Police said. A man in his 30s has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is in hospital under police guard being treated for minor injuries. According to a witness who gave the injured man first aid, he was stabbed after leaving a pub. A man in his 30s has been arrested on suspicion of murder Raj Grover, who lives near the victim, said he was getting ready to go to his own birthday party when the man knocked on his front door.

""I went downstairs and saw he was full of blood, and then I was running to pick up a towel. ""I put the towel on and I was pressing to stop the blood, then my wife came out, we called the ambulance and the police."" Mr Grover, who runs a local business, said the victim asked him to call his wife, who then arrived at the house. ""His wife, she mentioned he went to the pub, I don't know what happened in the pub just around the corner, he came back, was on his way back and somebody stabbed him twice, stabbed him two times with a knife on the stomach and on his side,"" he said.

"Katy Bourne is the police and crime commissioner for Sussex Harsher sentences for people who attack police officers ""would be very welcome"", the head of the national body for police bosses has said. Katy Bourne, the new chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), said anyone who hurts an officer should go to prison, ""no ifs, no buts"". She made the remarks after the death of PC Andrew Harper in the line of duty. It comes as all chief constableswere calledto a summit on officer safety. The urgent meeting - the first time the chief constables have ever come together outside of their usual quarterly meetings - will discuss how frontline policing can be made safer. Police chiefs call urgent talks on officer safety Should all frontline police officers use Tasers? Police force to arm all officers with Tasers Currently, people guilty of common assault against emergency services staff can be fined or sent to prison. Last year the maximum jail termwas doubled from six to 12 months. In her first interview since beginning her new role earlier this year, Mrs Bourne said: ""If you attack a police officer, you need to know you will go to prison."" Mrs Bourne - who also sits on the prime minister's recently formed National Policing Board - added: ""When we do catch people I think the sentencing needs to be reflective of the seriousness of the crime."" Over the last four years, the number of Sussex officers injured in attacks has risen by 16% to an average of three a day, she said. Mrs Bourne, who is the police and crime commissioner for Sussex Police, branded the increase in her ""relatively safe, peaceful"" county as ""unacceptable"". On Saturday, Martin Hewitt, the chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), called an urgent meeting for all chief constables, saying: ""If we can't protect our people, how can we protect the public?"" The summit, which will be held in early September, will see the top officers share lessons from the recent attacks on their frontline officers as part of a discussion ""to see if there is anything more we can do to tangibly improve their safety"", Mr Hewitt said. The Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, has also been asked to give its input. All frontline officers in one force have been offered Tasers after violence against emergency services Although Mr Hewitt said it was important not to have ""knee-jerk"" reactions to events, he added: ""Levels of violence are an increasing concern across the country and attacks on our officers have gone up,"" he said ina statement,external. ""It is the responsibility of each chief constable to do all they can to keep their officers as safe as possible,"" he added. Mrs Bourne also said she would ask Home Secretary Priti Patel to consider using Sussex Police's knife crime pilot prevention programme to help to tackle the issue across a wider area. Known as Reboot, the early youth intervention programme involves police, health professionals and charities joining forces to encourage children to develop interests and hobbies to help deter them from anti-social behaviour. Meanwhile, earlier this week, Northamptonshire Police announced it would be the first force in the countryto arm all of its frontline officers with Tasers. Days later it was joined by a second force, Durham Constabulary, which said every frontline officer who wanted one would undergo training to use the stun guns. Some studies have linked the increased use or presence of Tasers with an increase in hostility between police and the public. Ch Con Giles York - vice chair of the NPCC -told BBC Breakfast: ""There is always a balance to be struck around how we equip our officers and still maintain that British piece of policing that is policing by consent."" Earlier this month, a police officer was stabbed in Leyton, east London, and two officers in Merseyside were attacked in separate incidents.

"PC Andrew Harper was married just four weeks before he was killed while on duty A top police chief has urged the most senior officers in England, Scotland and Wales to come together to find ways to make frontline policing safer. Martin Hewitt, the chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), called an urgent meeting for all chief constables to discuss officer safety. ""If we can't protect our people, how can we protect the public?"" he said. It comes after recent violent attacks on officers and the death of PC Andrew Harper while investigating a burglary. The summit, which will be held in early September, will be the first time the chief constables have ever come together outside of their usual quarterly meetings. The top officers will share lessons from the recent attacks on their frontline officers as part of a discussion ""to see if there is anything more we can do to tangibly improve their safety"", Mr Hewitt said. The Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, has also been asked to give its input. All frontline officers in one force have been offered Tasers after violence against emergency services Although Mr Hewitt said it was important not to have ""knee-jerk"" reactions to events, he said: ""Levels of violence are an increasing concern across the country and attacks on our officers have gone up.""

"Katy Bourne is the police and crime commissioner for Sussex Harsher sentences for people who attack police officers ""would be very welcome"", the head of the national body for police bosses has said. Katy Bourne, the new chair of the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners (APCC), said anyone who hurts an officer should go to prison, ""no ifs, no buts"". She made the remarks after the death of PC Andrew Harper in the line of duty. It comes as all chief constableswere calledto a summit on officer safety. The urgent meeting - the first time the chief constables have ever come together outside of their usual quarterly meetings - will discuss how frontline policing can be made safer. Police chiefs call urgent talks on officer safety Should all frontline police officers use Tasers? Police force to arm all officers with Tasers Currently, people guilty of common assault against emergency services staff can be fined or sent to prison. Last year the maximum jail termwas doubled from six to 12 months. In her first interview since beginning her new role earlier this year, Mrs Bourne said: ""If you attack a police officer, you need to know you will go to prison."" Mrs Bourne - who also sits on the prime minister's recently formed National Policing Board - added: ""When we do catch people I think the sentencing needs to be reflective of the seriousness of the crime."" Over the last four years, the number of Sussex officers injured in attacks has risen by 16% to an average of three a day, she said. Mrs Bourne, who is the police and crime commissioner for Sussex Police, branded the increase in her ""relatively safe, peaceful"" county as ""unacceptable"". On Saturday, Martin Hewitt, the chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), called an urgent meeting for all chief constables, saying: ""If we can't protect our people, how can we protect the public?"" The summit, which will be held in early September, will see the top officers share lessons from the recent attacks on their frontline officers as part of a discussion ""to see if there is anything more we can do to tangibly improve their safety"", Mr Hewitt said.

""It is the responsibility of each chief constable to do all they can to keep their officers as safe as possible,"" he added. Mrs Bourne also said she would ask Home Secretary Priti Patel to consider using Sussex Police's knife crime pilot prevention programme to help to tackle the issue across a wider area. Known as Reboot, the early youth intervention programme involves police, health professionals and charities joining forces to encourage children to develop interests and hobbies to help deter them from anti-social behaviour. Meanwhile, earlier this week, Northamptonshire Police announced it would be the first force in the countryto arm all of its frontline officers with Tasers. Days later it was joined by a second force, Durham Constabulary, which said every frontline officer who wanted one would undergo training to use the stun guns.

"This video can not be played The G7 leaders and some of their spouses posed for a ""family photo"" after a day of talks President Trump has promised a ""very big trade deal"" with the UK, saying its departure from the EU will be like losing ""an anchor round the ankle"". Mr Trump was speaking after a breakfast meeting with Mr Johnson at the G7 summit in Biarritz in France. But Mr Johnson said the US must open up its markets if a post-Brexit trade deal is to be agreed. ""I don't think we sell a single joint of British lamb in the United States, we don't sell any beef,"" the PM said. Mr Johnson's breakfast meeting came before a day of discussions with other world leaders at the summit. The PM also met European Council President Donald Tusk, a day after the two men clashedover who would be held responsible for a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played President Trump said Boris Johnson was the ""right man"" to deliver Brexit Speaking to reporters after the working breakfast, Mr Trump said a deal with the UK would happen ""quickly"". ""We're going to do a very big trade deal, bigger than we've ever had with the UK,"" he said. ""And now at some point they won't have the obstacle, they won't have the anchor around their ankle, because that's what they have."" Mr Johnson told Mr Trump: ""Talking of the anchor, Donald, what we want is for our ships to take freight, say, from New York to Boston, which for the moment they're not able to do."" In a later interview with the BBC, Mr Johnson said agreeing any trade deals with the US within a year ""would be tight"". ""My own experience of the way Americans work, the size and complexity of the deal we want to do probably means we won't be able to do within a year. When asked if it could take five years, he replied: ""No, we'll do it faster than that. ""We need to do it fast, but to get the whole thing done from soup to nuts within a year is going to be a big ask."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson met with leaders at the annual G7 summit on Sunday Before his talks with the US President, Mr Johnson spoke about ""massive opportunities for the UK to prise open the American market"". As a member of the European Union, the UK cannot make its own trade deals with other countries - and the EU does not have a free trade deal with the US. The UK has already agreed 13 ""continuity"" deals with 38 countries that will apply post-Brexit. UK 'first in line' for US trade deal, says Trump adviser 'No chance of US deal' if Brexit hits Irish accord What trade deals has the UK done so far? Offering an example of an American trade restriction, Mr Johnson said: ""Melton Mowbray pork pies, which are sold in Thailand and in Iceland, are currently unable to enter the US market because of, I don't know, some sort of food and drug administration restriction."" He continued: ""UK bell peppers cannot get into the US market at all. ""Wine shipments are heavily restricted. If you want to export wine made in England to the US you have to go through a US distributor. ""There is a tax on British micro-breweries in the US that doesn't apply to US micro-breweries in the UK."" The government added that tariffs on some UK goods in the US can reach up to 28% for fashion, 15% for machinery and 35% for food and drink. Donald and Melania Trump arrived in France for the G7 summit on Saturday David Henig, the UK director of the European Centre For International Political Economy, said the US ""would be loathe"" to get rid of the barriers intended to protect US producers. He added: ""The US is quite protectionist - the US have never done a trade deal the likes of which Mr Johnson is describing. ""The question is whether the US is prepared to give the UK something and what we would have to give them in return. ""It is less clear what Trump wants in terms of trade altogether."" In June, Mr Trump made comments that theNHS ""was on the table"" in US-UK trade deal- but laterrowed back on his remarks. At the G7 summit Mr Johnson was asked if he had made it clear the NHS was not on the table. He replied: ""Not only have I made clear of that, the president has made that very, very clear. There is complete unanimity on that point."" Trade deals involve two or more countries agreeing a set of terms by which they buy and sell goods and services from each other. Deals are designed to increase trade by eliminating or reducing trade barriers. These barriers might include import or export taxes (tariffs), quotas, or differing regulations on things such as safety or labelling. Last month,President Trump saidtalks about a ""very substantial"" trade deal with the UK were already under way. He said a bilateral post-Brexit deal could lead to a ""three to four, five times"" increase in current trade - but provided no details about how that would be achieved. However, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said a UK-US trade dealwould not get through Congressif Brexit undermined the Good Friday Agreement. Ms Pelosi said the UK's exit from the EU could not be allowed to endanger the 1998 Irish peace deal, which the US helped facilitate. What is the Good Friday Agreement?

"This video can not be played Donald Tusk at the G7: I hope Boris Johnson will not want to go down in history as Mr No Deal European Council President Donald Tusk and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have clashed over who would be to blame in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Tusk said Mr Johnson risked being remembered as ""Mr No Deal"" - but the PM responded by saying it was Mr Tusk who would become ""Mr No-Deal Brexit"". The pair are due to meet for talks at the G7 summit in France on Sunday. Mr Tusk added the EU was ""willing to listen"" to the PM's ideas for Brexit - as long as they are ""realistic"". But speaking at his press conference in Biarritz, Mr Tusk said he would ""not co-operate on [a] no-deal"". Since becoming PM, Mr Johnson hassaid the UK will leave the EU on 31 October. Mr Johnson has repeatedly stated he would prefer to leave the EU with a deal, but insists the backstop - the insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - must be removed from the withdrawal agreement. ""I've made it absolutely clear I don't want no deal and that we've got to get rid of the backstop from the treaty and if Mr Tusk doesn't want to go down as Mr No-Deal Brexit I hope that point will be borne in mind too,"" he said. Earlier in the day, Mr Tusk had used the same moniker when talking about Mr Johnson. ""I still hope Prime Minister Johnson will not like to go down in history as Mr No Deal,"" he said. ""The EU has always been open to co-operation. One thing I will not co-operate on is a no deal. ""We are willing to listen to ideas that are operational, realistic and acceptable to all EU member states."" Analysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale When Boris Johnson met President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Angela Merkel this week, he got a relatively positive response. Both leaders indicated they were willing to listen to any ideas the prime minister may have to avoid a no-deal Brexit. But Mr Johnson's meeting with Donald Tusk at the G7 summit on Sunday may now prove more problematic. The spat between both men - both of them warning they could go down in history as Mr No Deal - shows that both sides are engaged in a blame game. Neither side wishes to be seen as the intransigent partner in a negotiation that leads to no deal. Mr Macron and Ms Merkel were implicit in this, while Mr Tusk was explicit, prompting an equally blunt response from Mr Johnson. It is, of course, still possible that some political space may be carved out to allow for a compromise at the last minute. But all the signs still point towards a no-deal Brexit at the end of October. The G7 summit - a get-together of most of the leaders of the world's largest economies - comes with just over two months until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU at the end of October. Mr Johnson wants to renegotiate the Irish backstop - a key Brexit sticking point - but the EU has consistently ruled this out. Speaking on Saturday, Mr Johnson said: ""We've made it very clear we won't be instituting any kind of checks or controls at the Northern Irish border. We don't think such controls are necessary. ""There are a large range of alternative arrangements - these we will be discussing in the coming weeks."" Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? What is the G7 and what does it do? Trump-Johnson relationship 'will be sensational' If implemented, the backstop - a last resort should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit - would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. At a news conference on Wednesday with Mr Johnson,German Chancellor Merkel suggestedan alternative to the backstop might be achievable, adding that the onus was on the UK. Boris Johnson met with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Presidential Palace this week But the next day French President Macronsaid the backstop was ""indispensable""to preserving political stability and the single market. After visiting his counterparts in Paris and Berlin this week, Mr Johnson said there was ""new mood music"", butreaching a new dealwould not be ""a cinch"". He has insisted the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, whether or not a new deal is reached. Mr Johnson will also meet with US President Donald Trump, who arrived in France around Saturday lunchtime. Asked if he would be telling Mr Trump not to escalatethe US-China trade war,Mr Johnson said: ""You bet."" He added one of his priorities for the summit was ""the state of global trade"".

"Ed Sheeran has been accused of being a ""clout chaser"" and a ""culture vulture"" by Wiley. In a series of tweets, the rapper joked about using a guitar and foot pedal and said: ""I'm sick of people using grime to look good for two minutes.""

"This video can not be played Footage appears to shows Prince Andrew inside Jeffrey Epstein's New York residence in 2010 Prince Andrew has given an unprecedented interview to the BBC about his relationship with US financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The friendship between the 59-year-old member of the Royal Family and Epstein has come under close scrutinysince the American killed himself in Augustwhile awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Prince Andrew said it was wrong of him to visit and stay at Epstein's house in 2010 after the financier's conviction but that he did not regret their entire friendship. He also categorically denied having sex with Virginia Roberts, who alleges she was forced to have sex with the prince when she was 17 years old. Here's what we know about the links between Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew said he first met Epstein, a wealthy hedge fund manager, in 1999 through Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's British girlfriend and a woman the prince said he had known since she was at university. That year was the first time the prince and the businessman were linked in press reports in the UK and US. Prince Andrew reportedly flew with Epstein on his private Gulfstream jet in February 1999,according to a log book seen by the Daily Mirror in 2015.,external The destination was said to have been Epstein's private island, Little St James in the US Virgin Islands. The Daily Mail also reported that 10 months earlier Epstein's logbook showed he had flown to the same location,externalto meet the prince's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson. The couple had divorced in 1996. Epstein and Ms Maxwell were among a star-studded guest list at a party hosted by the Queen in June 2000. The Dance of the Decades event, which saw more than 600 guests descend on Windsor Castle, marked four royal birthdays including Prince Andrew's 40th.  Prince Andrew, the Queen's third child, told the BBC that Epstein was there at his invitation, not the Royal Family's, but was to some extent Ms Maxwell's ""plus one"". Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend? Who was Jeffrey Epstein? The duke at the time appeared to be part of the social circle of Ms Maxwell,whom Epstein later described as his best friend.,external Prince Andrew was pictured accompanying Ms Maxwell - daughter of the late newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell - at private parties and celebrity functions both in the UK and in the US that year. They were photographed together at the wedding of the prince's former girlfriend, Aurelia Cecil, near Salisbury in Wiltshire in September 2000. The Duke of York and Ghislaine Maxwell leaving the wedding of his former girlfriend Aurelia Cecil in September 2000 The Duke of York and Ghislaine Maxwell were pictured at the event in Wiltshire Prince Andrew and Ms Maxwell were again photographed together at a Halloween party,externalthrown by model Heidi Klum in Manhattan. Ms Maxwell was pictured dressed in gold lame and wearing a blonde wig for the Hookers and Pimps-themed party. Just over a month later, in December 2000, the then 40-year-old prince threw Ms Maxwell a surprise birthday party at Sandringham, the Queen's estate in Norfolk, with Epstein among the guests. He described it in the BBC interview as a ""straightforward shooting weekend"". Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at Sandringham in December 2000 Ms Maxwell and Epstein were photographed on a pheasant shoot at the estate around that time. Prince Andrew and Ms Maxwell went on a number of trips together including to Florida and Thailand, according to an Evening Standard report from January 2001, which claimed Epstein had joined them on five such occasions over the previous 12 months. Prince Andrew told the BBC that he used to see Epstein a maximum of three times a year but confirmed he had been on his private plane, stayed at his private island, and stayed at his homes in Palm Beach, Florida and New York. Allegations against Jeffrey Epstein started surfacing in 2005 when the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida that Epstein had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. The financier was accused of paying girls under the age of 18 to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. However, a controversial secret plea deal in 2008 saw him plead guilty to a lesser charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution. He received an 18-month prison sentence and was released on probation after 13 months. In July 2019 he was charged in New York with further allegations of sex trafficking and conspiracy and was due to face trial next year. He pleaded not guilty to all the charges but was facing up to 45 years in prison if convicted. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? In July 2006, Jeffrey Epstein was invited toa masked ball at Windsor Castle to celebrate the 18th birthday of Princess Beatrice,external, Prince Andrew's elder daughter. The theme of the evening was 1888, and the 500 guests donned period costumes. The previous month,  Epstein was charged with one count of solicitation of prostitution. Prince Andrew said Epstein had been invited via Ms Maxwell but that he wasn't aware at the time the invitation was sent out ""what was going on in the United States"". He said Epstein never mentioned that he was under investigation. The duke was photographed with Epstein in New York's Central Park in December 2010 - after the tycoon had served his sentence. Prince Andrew said he had travelled across the Atlantic to end his friendship with Epstein and was having that conversation with him when they were photographed in the park. Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein in New York's Central Park in 2010 The prince told the BBC: ""I said, 'Look, because of what has happened, I don't think it is appropriate that we should remain in contact.'"" Prince Andrew said he attended a small dinner party while he was there but denied it was to celebrate Epstein's release. Footage released by the Mail on Sunday in August showed Prince Andrew inside the financier's Manhattan mansion around the same time. The prince told the BBC that he regretted staying at Epstein's house during the visit, saying he ""let the side down"" by doing so. Pressed on reports that many young girls were coming and going from the house at the time, he said: ""I never saw them."" Epstein's house was like a ""railway station"" with ""people coming in and out of that house all the time"", he added. Prince Andrew's connection to the convicted sex offender did attract criticism at the time. After several days of newspaper reports on the Epstein connection in spring of 2011, Prince Andrew was hit with a further blow when Sarah Ferguson admitted having accepted Â£15,000 from Epstein, to help pay off her debts. Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson in 2011 - she is said to have accepted Â£15,000 from Epstein that year The fallout saw him quit his role as a UK trade envoy in July 2011.Prince Andrew later acknowledged his friendship with Epstein had been a mistake. In 2015the duke was named in court papersas part of a US civil case against Epstein. Prince Andrew was not party to the proceedings but was identified when a motion was filed in the court, as part of the evidence. According to the Guardian,external, one of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts - now Virginia Giuffre - said she was ordered to give the prince ""whatever he required"". Prince Andrew with Virginia Roberts in early 2001, said to have been taken at the home of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is standing behind the pair Ms Giuffre claimed in court papers in Florida she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions - in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein - between 2001 and 2002, including when she was underage under Florida law. The details were later officially struck from the court records when a judge ruled they were unnecessary to the case, saying they were ""immaterial and impertinent"" to the ""central claim"". Separately, an allegation by a woman called Johanna Sjoberg that Prince Andrew touched her breast while they sat on a couch in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001 was contained in documents from a defamation case. These documents were made public when they were released by a judge in August 2019. Ms Giuffre had brought the defamation case against Ms Maxwell. She was alleged to have procured underage girls for Epstein and his friends, but she has always denied the allegations. Prince Andrew said he had ""no recollection"" of ever meeting Ms Giuffre. He said he was looking after his children on the day in March 2001 that she alleges they went to a nightclub in London and later had sex in Ms Maxwell's house in the Belgravia area. The prince said he had taken his daughter Beatrice to a Pizza Express restaurant in the town of Woking that afternoon for a party. He said he remembered it ""because going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do, a very unusual thing for me to do"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew: ""I would like to reiterate and reaffirm the statements that have been issued on my behalf by the palace"" Prince Andrew said he had no recollection of a photo being taken, reportedly by Jeffrey Epstein, of him and Virginia Giuffre together in Ms Maxwell's house where his arm is around her waist. ""Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken,"" he said, adding that ""hug[s] and public displays of affection are not something that I do"". Asked whether he had sex with her in a bedroom in that house, he said: ""I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened.""

"This video can not be played Footage appears to shows Prince Andrew inside Jeffrey Epstein's New York residence in 2010 Prince Andrew is appalled by sex abuse claims about his ex-friend Jeffrey Epstein, Buckingham Palace has said. It comes after theMail on Sunday,externalpublished footage that claimed to show the Duke of York inside the financier's Manhattan mansion in 2010 - two years after Epstein's first conviction. Epstein, 66, took his own life in a jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges in New York. He previously socialised with Prince Andrew and President Donald Trump. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? A Buckingham Palace statement said: ""The Duke of York has been appalled by the recent reports of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged crimes. ""His Royal Highness deplores the exploitation of any human being and the suggestion he would condone, participate in or encourage any such behaviour is abhorrent."" The short statement from the palace has all the right words: appalled, abhorrent, deplores. There is little doubt that the prince wants the world to know how much he is horrified by what his former friend Epstein is accused of. It was public knowledge that Prince Andrew had kept in contact with the billionaire sex offender after his 2008 conviction. The photo of the two men walking in Central Park in 2010 led to serious criticism of the prince's judgement. But to see him inside Epstein's house, as young women come and go, looking for all the world as if he was a happy house-guest, is a disturbing sight. And strong though the palace statement may be it, it fails to answer the central question. Just what was Prince Andrew doing visiting the house of a convicted paedophile? New York-born Epstein worked as a teacher before moving into finance. Prior to the criminal cases against him, he was best known for his wealth and high-profile connections. Epstein death ruled 'suicide by hanging' Prince Andrew 'groped' woman, court files allege He was often seen socialising with the rich and powerful, including former US President Bill Clinton. In a 2002 profile in New York Magazine,Mr Trump referred to Epstein as a ""terrific guy"",external. Donald Trump once called Epstein a ""terrific guy"" But he later said the pair fell out ""12 or 15 years ago"" and reiterated last month that he was ""not a fan of Jeffrey Epstein"". Reports of Epstein's wealth vary, with his Virgin Islands-based firm generating no public records. He was accused of paying girls under the age of 18 to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. Police arrested him last month after he landed in New Jersey on his private jet. Epstein pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and conspiracy charges and was being held without bail.

"Anne McClain is helped from a space capsule after returning from the ISS in June Nasa is reported to be investigating a claim that an astronaut accessed the bank account of her estranged spouse from the International Space Station, in what may be the first allegation of a crime committed in space. Anne McClain acknowledges accessing the account from the ISS but denies any wrongdoing, theNew York Times,externalreports. Her estranged spouse, Summer Worden, reportedly filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. Ms McClain has since returned to Earth. The astronaut told the New York Times through a lawyer that she was merely making sure that the family's finances were in order and there was enough money to pay bills and care for Ms Worden's son - who they had been raising together prior to the split. ""She strenuously denies that she did anything improper,"" said her lawyer, Rusty Hardin, adding that Ms McClain was ""totally co-operating"". In pictures: Astronauts train in underwater space station Nasa picks headquarters for Moon lander Ms McClain and Ms Worden, who is an Air Force intelligence officer, married in 2014 and Ms Worden filed for divorce in 2018. Investigators from Nasa's Office of Inspector General have contacted both over the allegation, the New York Times reported. Ms McClain graduated from the prestigious West Point military academy and flew more than 800 combat hours over Iraq as an Army pilot. She went on to qualify as a test pilot and was chosen to fly for Nasa in 2013. She spent six months aboard the ISS and had been due to feature in the first all-female spacewalk, but her role wascancelled at the last minute over what Nasa said was a problem with availability of correct suit sizes. There are five national or international space agencies involved in the ISS - from the US, Canada, Japan, Russia and several European countries - and a legal framework sets out that national law applies to any people and possessions in space. So if a Canadian national were to commit a crime in space, they would be subject to Canadian law, and a Russian citizen to Russian law. Space law also sets out provisions for extradition back on Earth, should a nation decide it wishes to prosecute a citizen of another nation for misconduct in space. As space tourism becomes a reality, so might the need to prosecute space crime, but for now the legal framework remains untested. Nasa officials told the New York Times that they were not aware of any crimes committed on the space station.

"The seal ring is thought to date to 1350 A retired man has found a 14th Century gold ring in his garage, nearly 40 years after he first discovered it. Tom Clark, 81, located the seal ring in a tin at his Buckinghamshire home among items which had come from his late mother's house. The Aylesbury metal detectorist had first discovered it on farmland between 1979 and 1982, but had not realised the significance of the find. It could now fetch up to Â£10,000 at auction.

"This video can not be played Footage appears to shows Prince Andrew inside Jeffrey Epstein's New York residence in 2010 Prince Andrew has given an unprecedented interview to the BBC about his relationship with US financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The friendship between the 59-year-old member of the Royal Family and Epstein has come under close scrutinysince the American killed himself in Augustwhile awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Prince Andrew said it was wrong of him to visit and stay at Epstein's house in 2010 after the financier's conviction but that he did not regret their entire friendship. He also categorically denied having sex with Virginia Roberts, who alleges she was forced to have sex with the prince when she was 17 years old. Here's what we know about the links between Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew said he first met Epstein, a wealthy hedge fund manager, in 1999 through Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's British girlfriend and a woman the prince said he had known since she was at university. That year was the first time the prince and the businessman were linked in press reports in the UK and US. Prince Andrew reportedly flew with Epstein on his private Gulfstream jet in February 1999,according to a log book seen by the Daily Mirror in 2015.,external The destination was said to have been Epstein's private island, Little St James in the US Virgin Islands. The Daily Mail also reported that 10 months earlier Epstein's logbook showed he had flown to the same location,externalto meet the prince's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson. The couple had divorced in 1996. Epstein and Ms Maxwell were among a star-studded guest list at a party hosted by the Queen in June 2000. The Dance of the Decades event, which saw more than 600 guests descend on Windsor Castle, marked four royal birthdays including Prince Andrew's 40th.  Prince Andrew, the Queen's third child, told the BBC that Epstein was there at his invitation, not the Royal Family's, but was to some extent Ms Maxwell's ""plus one"". Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend? Who was Jeffrey Epstein? The duke at the time appeared to be part of the social circle of Ms Maxwell,whom Epstein later described as his best friend.,external Prince Andrew was pictured accompanying Ms Maxwell - daughter of the late newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell - at private parties and celebrity functions both in the UK and in the US that year. They were photographed together at the wedding of the prince's former girlfriend, Aurelia Cecil, near Salisbury in Wiltshire in September 2000. The Duke of York and Ghislaine Maxwell leaving the wedding of his former girlfriend Aurelia Cecil in September 2000 The Duke of York and Ghislaine Maxwell were pictured at the event in Wiltshire Prince Andrew and Ms Maxwell were again photographed together at a Halloween party,externalthrown by model Heidi Klum in Manhattan. Ms Maxwell was pictured dressed in gold lame and wearing a blonde wig for the Hookers and Pimps-themed party. Just over a month later, in December 2000, the then 40-year-old prince threw Ms Maxwell a surprise birthday party at Sandringham, the Queen's estate in Norfolk, with Epstein among the guests. He described it in the BBC interview as a ""straightforward shooting weekend"". Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell at Sandringham in December 2000 Ms Maxwell and Epstein were photographed on a pheasant shoot at the estate around that time. Prince Andrew and Ms Maxwell went on a number of trips together including to Florida and Thailand, according to an Evening Standard report from January 2001, which claimed Epstein had joined them on five such occasions over the previous 12 months. Prince Andrew told the BBC that he used to see Epstein a maximum of three times a year but confirmed he had been on his private plane, stayed at his private island, and stayed at his homes in Palm Beach, Florida and New York. Allegations against Jeffrey Epstein started surfacing in 2005 when the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida that Epstein had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. The financier was accused of paying girls under the age of 18 to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. However, a controversial secret plea deal in 2008 saw him plead guilty to a lesser charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution. He received an 18-month prison sentence and was released on probation after 13 months. In July 2019 he was charged in New York with further allegations of sex trafficking and conspiracy and was due to face trial next year. He pleaded not guilty to all the charges but was facing up to 45 years in prison if convicted. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? In July 2006, Jeffrey Epstein was invited toa masked ball at Windsor Castle to celebrate the 18th birthday of Princess Beatrice,external, Prince Andrew's elder daughter. The theme of the evening was 1888, and the 500 guests donned period costumes. The previous month,  Epstein was charged with one count of solicitation of prostitution. Prince Andrew said Epstein had been invited via Ms Maxwell but that he wasn't aware at the time the invitation was sent out ""what was going on in the United States"". He said Epstein never mentioned that he was under investigation. The duke was photographed with Epstein in New York's Central Park in December 2010 - after the tycoon had served his sentence. Prince Andrew said he had travelled across the Atlantic to end his friendship with Epstein and was having that conversation with him when they were photographed in the park. Prince Andrew with Jeffrey Epstein in New York's Central Park in 2010 The prince told the BBC: ""I said, 'Look, because of what has happened, I don't think it is appropriate that we should remain in contact.'"" Prince Andrew said he attended a small dinner party while he was there but denied it was to celebrate Epstein's release. Footage released by the Mail on Sunday in August showed Prince Andrew inside the financier's Manhattan mansion around the same time. The prince told the BBC that he regretted staying at Epstein's house during the visit, saying he ""let the side down"" by doing so. Pressed on reports that many young girls were coming and going from the house at the time, he said: ""I never saw them."" Epstein's house was like a ""railway station"" with ""people coming in and out of that house all the time"", he added. Prince Andrew's connection to the convicted sex offender did attract criticism at the time. After several days of newspaper reports on the Epstein connection in spring of 2011, Prince Andrew was hit with a further blow when Sarah Ferguson admitted having accepted Â£15,000 from Epstein, to help pay off her debts. Prince Andrew's ex-wife Sarah Ferguson in 2011 - she is said to have accepted Â£15,000 from Epstein that year The fallout saw him quit his role as a UK trade envoy in July 2011.Prince Andrew later acknowledged his friendship with Epstein had been a mistake. In 2015the duke was named in court papersas part of a US civil case against Epstein. Prince Andrew was not party to the proceedings but was identified when a motion was filed in the court, as part of the evidence. According to the Guardian,external, one of Epstein's accusers, Virginia Roberts - now Virginia Giuffre - said she was ordered to give the prince ""whatever he required"". Prince Andrew with Virginia Roberts in early 2001, said to have been taken at the home of Ghislaine Maxwell, who is standing behind the pair Ms Giuffre claimed in court papers in Florida she was forced to have sex with the prince on three occasions - in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein - between 2001 and 2002, including when she was underage under Florida law. The details were later officially struck from the court records when a judge ruled they were unnecessary to the case, saying they were ""immaterial and impertinent"" to the ""central claim"". Separately, an allegation by a woman called Johanna Sjoberg that Prince Andrew touched her breast while they sat on a couch in Epstein's Manhattan apartment in 2001 was contained in documents from a defamation case. These documents were made public when they were released by a judge in August 2019. Ms Giuffre had brought the defamation case against Ms Maxwell. She was alleged to have procured underage girls for Epstein and his friends, but she has always denied the allegations. Prince Andrew said he had ""no recollection"" of ever meeting Ms Giuffre. He said he was looking after his children on the day in March 2001 that she alleges they went to a nightclub in London and later had sex in Ms Maxwell's house in the Belgravia area. The prince said he had taken his daughter Beatrice to a Pizza Express restaurant in the town of Woking that afternoon for a party. He said he remembered it ""because going to Pizza Express in Woking is an unusual thing for me to do, a very unusual thing for me to do"". This video can not be played Prince Andrew: ""I would like to reiterate and reaffirm the statements that have been issued on my behalf by the palace"" Prince Andrew said he had no recollection of a photo being taken, reportedly by Jeffrey Epstein, of him and Virginia Giuffre together in Ms Maxwell's house where his arm is around her waist. ""Nobody can prove whether or not that photograph has been doctored but I don't recollect that photograph ever being taken,"" he said, adding that ""hug[s] and public displays of affection are not something that I do"". Asked whether he had sex with her in a bedroom in that house, he said: ""I can absolutely categorically tell you it never happened."" Buckingham Palace has issued outright denials of all allegations against Prince Andrew.

"Prince Andrew, left, has previously been criticised for his association with Jeffrey Epstein Prince Andrew has defended his former friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, saying ""at no stage"" did he ""see or suspect"" any criminal behaviour. Epstein, 66, took his own lifein a jail cell this month while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. In a statement, the Duke of York said he wanted to ""clarify the facts"" around his ""former association or friendship"" with the US financier. He said it was a ""mistake"" to meet Epstein after he left prison in 2010. ""During the time I knew him, I saw him infrequently and probably no more than only once or twice a year,"" the 59-year-old prince said. ""I have stayed in a number of his residences. At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction."" The duke - who said he first met Epstein in 1999 - added that he had ""tremendous sympathy"" for all those affected by Epstein's behaviour. ""His suicide has left many unanswered questions and I acknowledge and sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure."" Prince Andrew will be hoping that his statement establishes his version of events: that he saw Jeffrey Epstein ""infrequently"", that he never saw anything in the early years of their friendship to make him suspect Epstein was a paedophile and that he now accepts it was a ""mistake and an error"" to continue to meet him after his release from prison. Andrew is asserting that from 1999 - when he met Epstein - until 2008 when Epstein was convicted, he never suspected what kind of a man Epstein really was. That must be taken at face value. What is more difficult for him is the fact that he continued to meet Epstein and go to his private homes after Epstein was released from prison. By that stage nobody could have had any doubt about this man's deviant behaviour. Andrew expresses ""regret"" that the person he thought he knew was not ""the real person"". All in all, it must be somewhat unlikely that this statement will quell the questions about Andrew's good sense and judgement. Allegations against Epstein began to surface in 2005 when the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida he had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. The financier was accused of paying underage girls to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005.

"The boss of British Airways-owner IAG has said a pay deal being offered to its pilots is ""fair"", adding that he is hopeful strikes can be averted this summer. British Airways will re-enter talks with the British Airline Pilots' Association (Balpa) on Friday. Members of Balpa have rejected an offer of an 11.5% wage rise over three years. But IAG boss Willie Walsh told the BBC: ""I think the pay deal that has been offered is a fair deal."" Earlier this week, BA lost a legal battle at the Court of Appeal to stop strike action after it filed an injunction. British Airways pilots set for summer strike British Airways faces record Â£183m fine for data breach The ruling cleared the way for Balpa members to walk out, potentially over the busy August period. Mr Walsh told the BBC's Today programme that he was hopeful a deal could be reached with union representatives. ""Clearly this is an issue for British Airways to deal with. Nobody wants the uncertainty that strike action delivers to the business,"" he said. ""We're working closely with the pilots union"". Representatives of British Airways and Balpa met on Thursday and Friday and both sides have agreed to resume talks next week, the union said on Friday evening. IAG chief executive Willie Walsh However, he indicated that the current pay offer - which has been accepted by unions Unite and GMB - was unlikely to change. ""British Airways has a responsibility to all of its employees in BA, I have a responsibility to all the employees right across the group, and I think the pay deal that has been offered is a fair deal."" In results published on Friday, IAG said BA would ""vigorously defend itself"" against a record Â£183m fine imposed by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) following a major data breach last year. BA was penalised after it emerged that users of its website were diverted to a fraudulent site where data from around 500,000 customers were harvested by hackers. However, IAG denied British Airways failed to comply with its obligations under General Data Protection Regulation and the UK Data Protection Act and would therefore use ""all available appeal routes"" against the ICO fine. For the first half of the year, IAG reported a 7.2% rise in sales to â¬12bn (Â£10.9bn) while pre-tax profits dropped to â¬1bn from â¬1.6bn. Shares in IAG rose 3.4% in early stock market trading.

"The seal ring is thought to date to 1350 A retired man has found a 14th Century gold ring in his garage, nearly 40 years after he first discovered it. Tom Clark, 81, located the seal ring in a tin at his Buckinghamshire home among items which had come from his late mother's house. The Aylesbury metal detectorist had first discovered it on farmland between 1979 and 1982, but had not realised the significance of the find. It could now fetch up to Â£10,000 at auction. The ring has an engraving of the god Mars holding a spear. It bears a Latin inscription and contains what is thought to be a semi-precious carved gem. Such rings would be used to leave a mark in wax to show that a document was legitimate and unopened. Tom Clark found the ring sometime between 1979 and 1982 Mr Clark said: ""I had completely forgotten about it. I found it... on farmland just outside Aylesbury. There's a big housing estate on the land now. ""At the time I'd only been metal detecting for 10 years and didn't realise the ring was anything special. It was all twisted and broken when I dug it up."" Mr Clark, a retired leather craftsman, said he had taken the ring, along with others, to a museum to be recorded but was told they were ""fairly modern"" so he had put them in a tin at his mother's house and forgotten about them.

The move is an apparent reversal from Mr Bolsonaro, who has been accused of emboldening miners and loggers. Other countries had threatened to target Brazil's economy if the nation did not act to stop the fires. France and Ireland have said they will not ratify a large trade deal with South American nations and Finland's finance minister has called on the EU to consider banning Brazilian beef imports. In a televised address to the nation on Friday, Mr Bolsonaro said forest fires ""exist in the whole world"" and ""cannot serve as a pretext for possible international sanctions"". Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered In graphics: How bad are the Amazon fires? What is the 'historic' EU-Mercosur trade deal? Many of the fires are thought to have been started deliberately, with suspicion falling on farmers who may benefit by having more available land. Mr Bolsonaro has scorned environmental activists and declared staunch support for the clearing of areas of the Amazon for agriculture and mining. Experts and campaigners say his administration has given a green light to rainforest destruction. Environmental groups held protests in cities across Brazil on Friday to demand action to combat the fires, and protesters gathered outside the Brazilian embassies around the world. This video can not be played Members of Brazil's indigenous Mura tribe vow to defend their land The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It is known as the ""lungs of the world"" and is home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. In his televised address, Mr Bolsonaro confirmed that he had authorised the armed forces to help fight the fires. ""I've learned as a military man to love the Amazon forest and I want to help protect it,"" he said. The decree itself was fairly vague in its wording, but specified that the military would be deployed to nature reserves, indigenous lands and border areas in the region. This video can not be played One campaigner called the forest fires a ""vicious cycle"" The deployment of soldiers would be left down to regional governors who can request ""preventive action... against environmental crimes"" and ask the army to ""survey and combat fire outbreaks"", it said. Defence Minister Fernando Azevedo e Silva said in a press conference on Saturday that 700 members of the armed forces would initially be sent to the Amazon region. Up to 28bn Brazilian reais ($6.8bn; Â£5.5bn) would be made available to put out the fires, he said. Mr Bolsonaro has faced deepening international criticism for his handling of the fires. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have called the fires an international crisis. Ms Merkel called it an ""acute emergency"" and Mr Macron tweeted: ""Our house is burning."" Both said the issue must be discussed at this weekend's G7 summit in Biarritz. Amazon: Lungs of the planet Speaking in Biarritz on Saturday, European Council President Donald Tusk said the EU ""stands by the EU-Mercosur agreement but it is hard to imagine a process of ratification as long as the Brazilian government allows for the destruction"" of the Amazon. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday: ""In the midst of the global climate crisis, we cannot afford more damage to a major source of oxygen and biodiversity. The Amazon must be protected."" US President Donald Trump said that he spoke to President Bolsonaro on Friday evening. ""I told him if the United States can help with the Amazon Rainforest fires, we stand ready to assist!"" Mr Trump tweeted. Brazil's president has hit back at criticism and accused leaders such as Mr Macron of meddling for ""political gain"". Earlier this week, he even suggested that non-governmental organisations had started fires in the rainforest - despite admitting he had no evidence for this claim. This video can not be played President Bolsonaro accuses NGOs of starting Amazon wildfires In his Friday television address, Mr Bolsonaro criticised those spreading ""baseless information"" about Brazil's commitment to preservation, insisting the country had ""modern legislation"" to protect most of its forest. ""We need to bear in mind that more than 20 million Brazilians live in that region,"" he said. ""We need to give opportunity for development. It's not only about protection."" He also described the wildfires as within an ""average"" range for the past 15 years. ""We are in a traditionally hot and dry season, with high winds, when every year we have wildfires,"" he said. ""In hotter years, wildfires are more common."" Satellite data published by the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) has shownan increase of 85% this year in fires across Brazil,external, most of them in the Amazon region. It is the highest number of fires since 2010. Mr Bolsonaro has brushed off the latest data, arguing that it was the season of the ""queimada"", when farmers burn land to clear it before planting. But Inpe has noted that the number of fires is not in line with those normally reported during the dry season. Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but they are also deliberately started in efforts to illegally deforest land for cattle ranching. Conservationists say Mr Bolsonaro has encouraged loggers and farmers to clear the land. During his campaign, he pledged to limit fines for damaging the rainforest and to weaken the influence of the environmental agency. US space agency Nasa said this month thatoverall fire activity across the Amazon basin this year had been close to the average,external.

"Prince Andrew, left, has previously been criticised for his association with Jeffrey Epstein Prince Andrew has defended his former friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, saying ""at no stage"" did he ""see or suspect"" any criminal behaviour. Epstein, 66, took his own lifein a jail cell this month while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. In a statement, the Duke of York said he wanted to ""clarify the facts"" around his ""former association or friendship"" with the US financier. He said it was a ""mistake"" to meet Epstein after he left prison in 2010. ""During the time I knew him, I saw him infrequently and probably no more than only once or twice a year,"" the 59-year-old prince said. ""I have stayed in a number of his residences. At no stage during the limited time I spent with him did I see, witness or suspect any behaviour of the sort that subsequently led to his arrest and conviction."" The duke - who said he first met Epstein in 1999 - added that he had ""tremendous sympathy"" for all those affected by Epstein's behaviour. ""His suicide has left many unanswered questions and I acknowledge and sympathise with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure."" Prince Andrew will be hoping that his statement establishes his version of events: that he saw Jeffrey Epstein ""infrequently"", that he never saw anything in the early years of their friendship to make him suspect Epstein was a paedophile and that he now accepts it was a ""mistake and an error"" to continue to meet him after his release from prison. Andrew is asserting that from 1999 - when he met Epstein - until 2008 when Epstein was convicted, he never suspected what kind of a man Epstein really was. That must be taken at face value. What is more difficult for him is the fact that he continued to meet Epstein and go to his private homes after Epstein was released from prison. By that stage nobody could have had any doubt about this man's deviant behaviour. Andrew expresses ""regret"" that the person he thought he knew was not ""the real person"". All in all, it must be somewhat unlikely that this statement will quell the questions about Andrew's good sense and judgement. Allegations against Epstein began to surface in 2005 when the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police in Florida he had molested their daughter at his Palm Beach home. The financier was accused of paying underage girls to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. A controversial secret plea deal saw him plead guilty to a lesser charge of soliciting a minor for prostitution. He received an 18-month prison sentence and was released on probation in 2010. Andrew 'appalled' by Epstein's sex abuse claims Prince Andrew's links to Jeffrey Epstein Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Prince Andrew was photographed with Epstein in New York's Central Park in late 2010 - after the tycoon was released from jail. Footage has also emerged reportedly showing the prince at Epstein's mansion in Manhattan in 2010. This video can not be played Footage appears to shows Prince Andrew inside Jeffrey Epstein's New York residence in 2010 In the statement, released on Saturday, the duke added: ""I have said previously that it was a mistake and an error to see him after his release in 2010 and I can only reiterate my regret that I was mistaken to think that what I thought I knew of him was evidently not the real person, given what we now know. ""This is a difficult time for everyone involved and I am at a loss to be able to understand or explain Mr Epstein's lifestyle. ""I deplore the exploitation of any human being and would not condone, participate in, or encourage any such behaviour."" Prince Andrew and his mother, the Queen, travelled to church together earlier this month In July 2019 Epstein was charged in New York with further allegations of sex trafficking and conspiracy and was due to face trial next year. He pleaded not guilty to all the charges but if convicted, was facing up to 45 years in prison.  2006Epstein is charged with unlawful sex acts with a minor 2008Epstein gets an 18-month sentence following a plea deal 2010Prince Andrew is pictured with Epstein in New York 2015The duke is named in a US court case relating to Epstein The Queen's third childquit his role as a UK trade envoy in 2011after the fallout from the photos of him and Epstein in 2010. The duke had been appointed the UK's special representative for international trade and investment in 2001 after retiring from the Royal Navy. He worked for - but did not receive a salary from - the government body UK Trade & Investment (UKTI), which reports jointly to the Foreign Office and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said Saturday's statement was a response to speculation in the media following the publication of footage of the duke at Epstein's house in New York. ""I think that this is a consequence of the build-up of press exposure in the days since and, as he would see it, a need to get his story, his rebuttal, out in as forceful terms as he can,"" he said.

"PC Andrew Harper was married just four weeks before he was killed while on duty A top police chief has urged the most senior officers in England, Scotland and Wales to come together to find ways to make frontline policing safer. Martin Hewitt, the chair of the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), called an urgent meeting for all chief constables to discuss officer safety. ""If we can't protect our people, how can we protect the public?"" he said. It comes after recent violent attacks on officers and the death of PC Andrew Harper while investigating a burglary. The summit, which will be held in early September, will be the first time the chief constables have ever come together outside of their usual quarterly meetings. The top officers will share lessons from the recent attacks on their frontline officers as part of a discussion ""to see if there is anything more we can do to tangibly improve their safety"", Mr Hewitt said. The Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, has also been asked to give its input. All frontline officers in one force have been offered Tasers after violence against emergency services Although Mr Hewitt said it was important not to have ""knee-jerk"" reactions to events, he said: ""Levels of violence are an increasing concern across the country and attacks on our officers have gone up."" ""It is the responsibility of each chief constable to do all they can to keep their officers as safe as possible,"" he added. Should all frontline police officers use Tasers? Police force to arm all officers with Tasers Man charged with murder of newlywed PC Harper Last week, Northamptonshire Police announced it plannedto arm all of its frontline officers with Tasers. Days later it was joined by Durham Constabulary, which said every frontline officer who wanted one would undergo training to use the stun guns. Earlier in the year,Kent Police announcedit was quadrupling the number of officers carrying Tasers to around 1,500. Some studies have linked the increased use or presence of Tasers with an increase in hostility between police and the public. Ch Con Giles York - vice chair of the NPCC -told BBC Breakfast: ""There is always a balance to be struck around how we equip our officers and still maintain that British piece of policing that is policing by consent.""

"A patient has died after developing a severe respiratory disease due to vaping in the first such death in the US, say health officials. It comes as experts investigate a mystery lung disease across the US that is linked to use of e-cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said there were 193 ""potential cases"" in 22 US states. Many of the cases involve vaping THC, the main active compound in cannabis, CDC experts said. The cases were reported over the course of two months between 28 June and 20 August. The person who died was ""hospitalized with unexplained illness after reported vaping or e-cigarette use"", Dr Jennifer Layden, the chief medical officer and state epidemiologist in Illinois, said. CDC director Robert Redfield said: ""We are saddened to hear of the first death related to the outbreak of severe lung disease in those who use e-cigarette or 'vaping' devices."" He added: ""This tragic death in Illinois reinforces the serious risks associated with e-cigarette products."" The cause of the mystery illness has not been identified, but all involve vaping in some form. ""In many cases, patients have acknowledged recent use of THC-containing product,"" the CDC's head of non-infectious diseases, Dr Ileana Arias, said. Those affected had symptoms including coughing, shortness of breath and fatigue as well as some cases of vomiting and diarrhoea. There is no evidence of an infectious disease - such as a virus or bacteria - being responsible. Why do lithium batteries explode? Exploding e-cigarette kills Texas man US man killed by exploding vape pen But there is much that remains a mystery. ""It isn't clear if these cases have a common cause or if they are different diseases with similar presentations,"" Dr Arias said. There have been 22 cases in the state of Illinois, with patients ranging from 17 to 38 years old. The 22 states affected are largely in the centre and north-east of the country, from Minnesota to North Carolina, though cases have also been reported in California, Texas, and New Mexico. Officials have ordered laboratory tests of vaping liquid samples in a bid to identify any harmful compounds. A ""black market"" is known to exist for THC-containing vape cartridges, which are sold legally through medical marijuana dispensaries in some states. Users in online communities have warned of the dangers of unregulated fake cartridges. No cause for the mystery illness has been identified - and the link to THC products is not clear yet either. Mitch Zeller of the US Food and Drug administration said it was important to understand that ""we find ourselves in the early stages of these investigations trying to piece together the facts."" This video can not be played Smoking v vaping: Watch lab test results He said the FDA was exploring whether the products were used as intended or being modified by adding something to them. The president of the American Vaping Association, Gregory Conley, said in a statement on Thursday that he was ""confident"" the illnesses were being caused by devices containing cannabis or other synthetic drugs, not nicotine. But Dr Brian King from the CDC's office on smoking and health warned against thinking of vaping as completely safe. ""We do know that e-cigarettes do not emit a harmless aerosol,"" he said. ""There's a variety of harmful ingredients identified, including things like ultrafine particulates, heavy metals like lead and cancer causing chemicals,"" he said, along with diacetyl - a flavouring used to give a ""buttery"" taste that has been linked to ""severe respiratory illness"". He also warned of the possibility that similar cases had been happening for a long time, but the connection between them had been missed. ""It's possible that the reported cases could have been occurring before this investigation was even initiated,"" he said. Dr King said it was possible ""we weren't necessarily capturing them, but now there's increased diligence in terms of the current investigation that we're better able to"".

"A worker at the UK consulate in Hong Kong has been released by mainland China after being held at the border, Chinese police in Shenzhen have said. Simon Cheng went missing on 8 August during a business trip to the city but has now returned to Hong Kong. China's foreign ministry said Mr Cheng had been detained for 15 days for violating public security laws. The UK has welcomed his release. It comes as anti-government protests in Hong Kong enter their third month. The large-scale demonstrations were sparked by a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong to send criminal suspects to China for trial. The police said Mr Cheng had been released as scheduled and that his legal rights had been observed, according to a post on the Weibo social media platform. In a Facebook post, the Cheng family said: ""Simon has returned to Hong Kong; thank you everyone for your support."" It asked for Mr Cheng to be allowed time to recover before any interviews would be allowed. The UK's Foreign Office said: ""We welcome the release of Simon Cheng and are delighted that he can be reunited with his family. We will continue to provide support to them."" Mr Cheng, 28, is a trade and investment officer,externalat the Scottish Development International section of the consulate, reports local outlet HKFP. The report says Mr Cheng studied in Taiwan and the UK before returning to Hong Kong. Mr Cheng travelled to a business event in Shenzhen on 8 August via the Lo Wu crossing. His girlfriend said he planned to travel home by train the same day but did not return. In messages to his girlfriend, he wrote that he was passing through the border, adding ""pray for me"".

There have been more tense moments during the latest protests on Saturday Bricks were thrown at one police station and officers fired tear gas in response. Protesters also reportedly pulled down a ""smart lamppost"", devices that monitor traffic and air quality but which some believe also violate privacy. Hundreds of pro-government supporters have picketed the Kowloon Tong HQ of public broadcaster RTHK, alleging it is biased,the South China Morning Post reported,external. The protests were sparked by a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong to send criminal suspects to China for trial.

"The seal ring is thought to date to 1350 A retired man has found a 14th Century gold ring in his garage, nearly 40 years after he first discovered it. Tom Clark, 81, located the seal ring in a tin at his Buckinghamshire home among items which had come from his late mother's house. The Aylesbury metal detectorist had first discovered it on farmland between 1979 and 1982, but had not realised the significance of the find. It could now fetch up to Â£10,000 at auction. The ring has an engraving of the god Mars holding a spear. It bears a Latin inscription and contains what is thought to be a semi-precious carved gem. Such rings would be used to leave a mark in wax to show that a document was legitimate and unopened. Tom Clark found the ring sometime between 1979 and 1982 Mr Clark said: ""I had completely forgotten about it. I found it... on farmland just outside Aylesbury. There's a big housing estate on the land now. ""At the time I'd only been metal detecting for 10 years and didn't realise the ring was anything special. It was all twisted and broken when I dug it up."" Mr Clark, a retired leather craftsman, said he had taken the ring, along with others, to a museum to be recorded but was told they were ""fairly modern"" so he had put them in a tin at his mother's house and forgotten about them. Mark Becher, historica expert at Hansons auctioneers, said: ""The ring bears a Latin inscription - NVNCIE.VERA.TEGO - which may translate as 'I hide the true message'. ""This could relate to the role of a seal ring in securing correspondence.""

"Complaints about school funding shortages in England are expected to be addressed soon by the government. There are suggestions that about Â£4bn in extra funding, as a one-off, one-year cash injection, could be announced as early as next week. In his Tory leadership campaign, Boris Johnson promised to reverse cuts in school funding. Heads' and teachers' organisations have been warning of a worsening budget crisis for schools. After making spending promises for the NHS and policing, the prime minister is next expected to turn his attention to improving funding for schools and colleges. Putting more money into cash-strapped schools is likely to be seen as a popular grassroots measure ahead of a possible autumn general election. This could still be delayed by Brexit wrangling, but there is an expectation that the government is imminently preparing to grasp the nettle on school budget shortages. School funding top priority for Gavin Williamson Heads warn of Â£5.7bn school funding gap Â£3.8bn needed to reverse school cuts Schools need multi-billion cash injection, say MPs There has been a long-running campaign by school leaders protesting about inadequate funding. This was backed by analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that suggestedschools had suffered budget reductions of 8%since 2010. The Department for Education had rejected such accusations - saying that schools were receiving record levels of funding. But teachers' unions and head teachers' campaign groups have maintained a constant challenge - writing directly to millions of parents about the financial difficulties facing schools. It's a problem that has dogged the government's efforts to look effective in education. Further protests by head teachers are expected in the autumn term - and school leaders will want to check the detail of any promises. Will this really be extra money? Will it be available for this year? Head teachers staged a funding protest in Westminster Will it be targeted at the lowest-funded areas and financial pressure points such as special needs and sixth forms? Will it do more than keep pace with rising costs? Will it be separate from a spending boost for further-education colleges? There have been various claims about the size of the funding gap - from about Â£4bn-Â£6bn to a forecast that it will grow to Â£12.6bn in the next few years. The government will hope that the funding announcement will be enough to draw the sting from protests - as a short-term holding offer, until a longer-term, multi-year approach might be negotiated in the future. Much of the groundwork for a funding announcement would already have been in place - as plans for a cash injection were under way in the final days of Theresa May's premiership. The new education secretary, Gavin Williamson, will get the chance to deliver the extra money that has been demanded by schools. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson faces school funding as a top priority The spending taps are now apparently open - and Boris Johnson's administration is understood to have been examining where extra funding would be most popular. Along with health and a more visible police presence, extra funding for schools has been seen as a measure with widespread public support. There are also said to be concerns about behaviour in schools - so there could be more focus on discipline, linked to wider concerns about youth violence and petty crime. There is also said to be support for more investment in vocational skills and training - and the further-education sector is anticipating its own significant increase in funding this autumn. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said: ""We would very much welcome any additional investment in education as this is desperately needed. ""It must be the start of a long-term phased uplift in funding to reverse education cuts and repair the damage that they have caused. ""We have worked with other education organisations to calculate that Â£12.6bn is needed by 2022-23 across early years, primary and secondary schools, 16-19 education and high needs.""

"The increases will affect about $550bn of Chinese imports President Donald Trump has hit back at China by announcing new higher tariffs on imports - escalating a mounting trade war between the two nations. In a series of tweets on Friday, Mr Trump announced an additional tariff increase of 5% on imports from China. The move came hours after the president hit out at Chinese plans to hit $75bn (Â£61bn) of US goods with duties. Mr Trump described their action as ""politically motivated"" and has accused them of ""taking advantage"" of the US. ""Sadly, past administrations have allowed China to get so far ahead of fair and balanced trade that it has become a great burden to the American taxpayer,"" Mr Trump tweeted. ""As president, I can no longer allow this to happen!"" Mr Trump has also said he had""hereby ordered""American companies to look for alternatives to China and suggested they make products in the US instead. 'We're all paying for this' The US-China trade war in charts Who loses out in the US-China trade war? Earlier, China unveiled plans to increase duties between 5% and 10% on more than 5,000 US products including agricultural goods, aircraft and crude oil. It will also re-impose a suspended 25% duty on US car imports. The new tariffs, set to affect about $75bn of US goods, will be imposed in two stages on 1 September and 15 December. In a series of Friday evening tweets, Mr Trump said the US would raise its tariffs on $250bn of Chinese imports from 25% to 30% starting on 1 October. He also said planned tariffs on $300bn of other Chinese goods will now be 15% instead of 10%. President Trump unveiled the 10% tariff plan on 1 August - blaming China for not following through on promises to buy more American agricultural products. Those tariffs, imposed on items like electronics and clothing, were expected to be introduced at the beginning of September but some have been delayed until mid-December to avoid hitting US Christmas shoppers. The latest developments in the trade war have sent global financial markets tumbling. This video can not be played Jay Powell or Xi Jinping: Which chairman is Trump's enemy? The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 620 points, or 2.4%, on Friday while London's FTSE 100 and the German DAX also turned negative.

"A patient has died after developing a severe respiratory disease due to vaping in the first such death in the US, say health officials. It comes as experts investigate a mystery lung disease across the US that is linked to use of e-cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said there were 193 ""potential cases"" in 22 US states. Many of the cases involve vaping THC, the main active compound in cannabis, CDC experts said. The cases were reported over the course of two months between 28 June and 20 August. The person who died was ""hospitalized with unexplained illness after reported vaping or e-cigarette use"", Dr Jennifer Layden, the chief medical officer and state epidemiologist in Illinois, said. CDC director Robert Redfield said: ""We are saddened to hear of the first death related to the outbreak of severe lung disease in those who use e-cigarette or 'vaping' devices."" He added: ""This tragic death in Illinois reinforces the serious risks associated with e-cigarette products."" The cause of the mystery illness has not been identified, but all involve vaping in some form. ""In many cases, patients have acknowledged recent use of THC-containing product,"" the CDC's head of non-infectious diseases, Dr Ileana Arias, said. Those affected had symptoms including coughing, shortness of breath and fatigue as well as some cases of vomiting and diarrhoea. There is no evidence of an infectious disease - such as a virus or bacteria - being responsible. Why do lithium batteries explode? Exploding e-cigarette kills Texas man US man killed by exploding vape pen But there is much that remains a mystery. ""It isn't clear if these cases have a common cause or if they are different diseases with similar presentations,"" Dr Arias said. There have been 22 cases in the state of Illinois, with patients ranging from 17 to 38 years old. The 22 states affected are largely in the centre and north-east of the country, from Minnesota to North Carolina, though cases have also been reported in California, Texas, and New Mexico. Officials have ordered laboratory tests of vaping liquid samples in a bid to identify any harmful compounds. A ""black market"" is known to exist for THC-containing vape cartridges, which are sold legally through medical marijuana dispensaries in some states. Users in online communities have warned of the dangers of unregulated fake cartridges. No cause for the mystery illness has been identified - and the link to THC products is not clear yet either. Mitch Zeller of the US Food and Drug administration said it was important to understand that ""we find ourselves in the early stages of these investigations trying to piece together the facts."" This video can not be played Smoking v vaping: Watch lab test results He said the FDA was exploring whether the products were used as intended or being modified by adding something to them. The president of the American Vaping Association, Gregory Conley, said in a statement on Thursday that he was ""confident"" the illnesses were being caused by devices containing cannabis or other synthetic drugs, not nicotine. But Dr Brian King from the CDC's office on smoking and health warned against thinking of vaping as completely safe. ""We do know that e-cigarettes do not emit a harmless aerosol,"" he said. ""There's a variety of harmful ingredients identified, including things like ultrafine particulates, heavy metals like lead and cancer causing chemicals,"" he said, along with diacetyl - a flavouring used to give a ""buttery"" taste that has been linked to ""severe respiratory illness"". He also warned of the possibility that similar cases had been happening for a long time, but the connection between them had been missed. ""It's possible that the reported cases could have been occurring before this investigation was even initiated,"" he said. Dr King said it was possible ""we weren't necessarily capturing them, but now there's increased diligence in terms of the current investigation that we're better able to"".

"This video can not be played Donald Tusk at the G7: I hope Boris Johnson will not want to go down in history as Mr No Deal European Council President Donald Tusk and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have clashed over who would be to blame in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Tusk said Mr Johnson risked being remembered as ""Mr No Deal"" - but the PM responded by saying it was Mr Tusk who would become ""Mr No-Deal Brexit"". The pair are due to meet for talks at the G7 summit in France on Sunday. Mr Tusk added the EU was ""willing to listen"" to the PM's ideas for Brexit - as long as they are ""realistic"". But speaking at his press conference in Biarritz, Mr Tusk said he would ""not co-operate on [a] no-deal"". Since becoming PM, Mr Johnson hassaid the UK will leave the EU on 31 October. Mr Johnson has repeatedly stated he would prefer to leave the EU with a deal, but insists the backstop - the insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland - must be removed from the withdrawal agreement. ""I've made it absolutely clear I don't want no deal and that we've got to get rid of the backstop from the treaty and if Mr Tusk doesn't want to go down as Mr No-Deal Brexit I hope that point will be borne in mind too,"" he said. Earlier in the day, Mr Tusk had used the same moniker when talking about Mr Johnson. ""I still hope Prime Minister Johnson will not like to go down in history as Mr No Deal,"" he said. ""The EU has always been open to co-operation. One thing I will not co-operate on is a no deal. ""We are willing to listen to ideas that are operational, realistic and acceptable to all EU member states."" Analysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale When Boris Johnson met President Emmanuel Macron and Chancellor Angela Merkel this week, he got a relatively positive response. Both leaders indicated they were willing to listen to any ideas the prime minister may have to avoid a no-deal Brexit. But Mr Johnson's meeting with Donald Tusk at the G7 summit on Sunday may now prove more problematic. The spat between both men - both of them warning they could go down in history as Mr No Deal - shows that both sides are engaged in a blame game. Neither side wishes to be seen as the intransigent partner in a negotiation that leads to no deal. Mr Macron and Ms Merkel were implicit in this, while Mr Tusk was explicit, prompting an equally blunt response from Mr Johnson. It is, of course, still possible that some political space may be carved out to allow for a compromise at the last minute. But all the signs still point towards a no-deal Brexit at the end of October. The G7 summit - a get-together of most of the leaders of the world's largest economies - comes with just over two months until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU at the end of October. Mr Johnson wants to renegotiate the Irish backstop - a key Brexit sticking point - but the EU has consistently ruled this out. Speaking on Saturday, Mr Johnson said: ""We've made it very clear we won't be instituting any kind of checks or controls at the Northern Irish border. We don't think such controls are necessary. ""There are a large range of alternative arrangements - these we will be discussing in the coming weeks."" Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? What is the G7 and what does it do? Trump-Johnson relationship 'will be sensational' If implemented, the backstop - a last resort should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit - would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. At a news conference on Wednesday with Mr Johnson,German Chancellor Merkel suggestedan alternative to the backstop might be achievable, adding that the onus was on the UK. Boris Johnson met with French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Presidential Palace this week But the next day French President Macronsaid the backstop was ""indispensable""to preserving political stability and the single market. After visiting his counterparts in Paris and Berlin this week, Mr Johnson said there was ""new mood music"", butreaching a new dealwould not be ""a cinch"". He has insisted the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, whether or not a new deal is reached. Mr Johnson will also meet with US President Donald Trump, who arrived in France around Saturday lunchtime. Asked if he would be telling Mr Trump not to escalatethe US-China trade war,Mr Johnson said: ""You bet."" He added one of his priorities for the summit was ""the state of global trade"".

"Mr Johnson will meet Mr Trump for one-on-one talks on Sunday The UK will not ""retreat"" from the international community as it leaves the EU, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister was speaking ahead of this weekend's G7 in France, his first international summit as leader. There Mr Johnson will discuss his plans for Brexit with European Council President Donald Tusk and hold trade talks with US President Donald Trump. On Friday, he and Mr Trump spoke by phone and discussed ""foreign policy issues and global trade"". The G7 meeting in Biarritz - a get together of most of the leaders of the world's largest economies - comes with just over two months until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 31 October. Mr Johnson will meet Mr Tusk on Sunday in their first face-to-face meeting and spell out his absolute commitment to getting the UK out of the EU by that date. Ahead of the summit he insisted the UK would be an ""energetic partner"" on the world stage after Brexit. Mr Johnson said: ""Some people question the democratic decision this country has made, fearing that we will retreat from the world. Some think Britain's best days are behind us. ""To those people I say: you are gravely mistaken."" His comments come after French President Emmanuel Macron suggested a post-Brexit trade deal with the US could see Britain as a ""junior partner"" in a position of ""historic vassalisation"". What is the G7 and what does it do? Trump-Johnson relationship 'will be sensational' Mr Trump, who hasconsistently praised Mr Johnson, has predicted a speedy US-UK trade deal after Brexit. But the British side is adamant it wants to secure the right deal rather than a quick agreement. In any future trade deal, the UK wants protections for the NHS and animal welfare standards, but also wants to cover issues such as opening up agricultural markets, services and public procurement. A UK government spokesman said: ""Of course we want to move quickly, but we want to get the right deal that works for both sides."" A No 10 spokesman said Mr Johnson and Mr Trump ""looked forward to speaking further"" during one-on-one talks on the sidelines of the summit on Sunday morning. Mr Johnson met with Mr Macron at the Elysee Presidential Palace this week The G7 summit follows a hectic week of diplomacy for Mr Johnson,who visited Paris and Berlinin an effort to persuade the EU to amend the withdrawal agreement it reached with his predecessor Theresa May. The prime minister wants to renegotiate the Irish backstop - a key Brexit sticking point which is part of the agreement and aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. The EU has consistently ruled this out. If implemented, the backstop would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market, should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit. Mr Johnson previously said that would mean ""signing away"" the UK's ""economic independence"". Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? And what is the backstop? At a news conference on Wednesday with Mr Johnson,German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested an alternative to the backstop might be achievable, adding that the onus was on the UKto find a workable plan. But the next day Mr Macron said it was""indispensable"" to preserving political stability and the single market. After visiting his counterparts, Mr Johnson said there was ""new mood music"", butreaching a new dealwould not be ""a cinch"". He has insisted the UK will leave the EU by the end of October, whether or not a new deal is reached. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the prime minister of putting the UK at ""the mercy"" of a US administration that ""threatens peace, prosperity and the future of our planet"". He also accused G7 governments of being key drivers of global inequality and called for them to do more to tackle climate change and reduce inequality. ""The UK should use its position in the G7, on the UN Security Council and the international financial institutions to promote policies to tackle the climate emergency and that are proven to reduce inequality and improve lives around the world, including universal healthcare, education and social security,"" he said. ""Instead, this weekend we'll see the ugly spectacle of our prime minister pursuing his Trump-first policy, putting us at the mercy of a US administration that threatens peace, prosperity and the future of our planet."" The G7 summit, which comprises the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, runs from Saturday to Monday. Issues on the agenda include the global economy, tackling inequality and responding to the challenges of the digital age and the rise of artificial intelligence.

"Seized elephant ivory tusks, pangolin scales and shark fins Conservationists say a key wildlife summit could be the ""last chance saloon"" for saving sharks and rays pushed to extinction by the shark fin trade. About 100 million sharks are estimated to be killed each year for their fins and meat. On Sunday, countries will discuss giving more species of sharks and rays protection under wildlife trade rules. These include mako sharks and the little-known ""rhino rays"". Wedgefish and guitarfish are collectively known as ""rhino rays"", because of their elongated snouts. They are now the most endangered marine fish group, according to a recent scientific assessment. ""With this new science just come out, fresh in everyone's minds a month ago, on these wedgefish and guitarfish, it's clearly last chance saloon for them,"" Luke Warwick of the Wildlife Conservation Society told BBC News. The giant guitarfish is listed as critically endangered on the IUCN red list The fins of wedgefish and guitarfish can be worth as much as a thousand dollars a kilogramme, he said, making them one of the most highly-valued species in the shark fin trade. Threatened shark served to UK diners 'Extinction risk' to sharks and rays Satellites used to protect rare sharks There are proposals to add a further 18 sharks and rays to Appendix II of The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Cites,external). If passed, this would mean countries would have to ensure that all continued trade was sustainable and legal. Parties are meeting in Geneva for a second week of discussions. Wedgefish: Their meat is sold locally or internationally traded for shark fin soup A group of 16 very unusual animals called wedgefish and guitarfish, together known as rhino rays They are assessed as the most threatened family of marine fish - all bar one is critically endangered Two of the wedgefish species may already have been driven to extinction by commercial fisheries Wedgefish have two large dorsal fins and a large tail lobe, prized for use in soup. A number of shark species were listed for the first time six years ago at the Cites meeting in Thailand.

"The increases will affect about $550bn of Chinese imports President Donald Trump has hit back at China by announcing new higher tariffs on imports - escalating a mounting trade war between the two nations. In a series of tweets on Friday, Mr Trump announced an additional tariff increase of 5% on imports from China. The move came hours after the president hit out at Chinese plans to hit $75bn (Â£61bn) of US goods with duties. Mr Trump described their action as ""politically motivated"" and has accused them of ""taking advantage"" of the US. ""Sadly, past administrations have allowed China to get so far ahead of fair and balanced trade that it has become a great burden to the American taxpayer,"" Mr Trump tweeted. ""As president, I can no longer allow this to happen!"" Mr Trump has also said he had""hereby ordered""American companies to look for alternatives to China and suggested they make products in the US instead. 'We're all paying for this' The US-China trade war in charts Who loses out in the US-China trade war? Earlier, China unveiled plans to increase duties between 5% and 10% on more than 5,000 US products including agricultural goods, aircraft and crude oil. It will also re-impose a suspended 25% duty on US car imports. The new tariffs, set to affect about $75bn of US goods, will be imposed in two stages on 1 September and 15 December. In a series of Friday evening tweets, Mr Trump said the US would raise its tariffs on $250bn of Chinese imports from 25% to 30% starting on 1 October. He also said planned tariffs on $300bn of other Chinese goods will now be 15% instead of 10%. President Trump unveiled the 10% tariff plan on 1 August - blaming China for not following through on promises to buy more American agricultural products. Those tariffs, imposed on items like electronics and clothing, were expected to be introduced at the beginning of September but some have been delayed until mid-December to avoid hitting US Christmas shoppers. The latest developments in the trade war have sent global financial markets tumbling. This video can not be played Jay Powell or Xi Jinping: Which chairman is Trump's enemy? The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 620 points, or 2.4%, on Friday while London's FTSE 100 and the German DAX also turned negative.

"Complaints about school funding shortages in England are expected to be addressed soon by the government. There are suggestions that about Â£4bn in extra funding, as a one-off, one-year cash injection, could be announced as early as next week. In his Tory leadership campaign, Boris Johnson promised to reverse cuts in school funding. Heads' and teachers' organisations have been warning of a worsening budget crisis for schools. After making spending promises for the NHS and policing, the prime minister is next expected to turn his attention to improving funding for schools and colleges. Putting more money into cash-strapped schools is likely to be seen as a popular grassroots measure ahead of a possible autumn general election. This could still be delayed by Brexit wrangling, but there is an expectation that the government is imminently preparing to grasp the nettle on school budget shortages. School funding top priority for Gavin Williamson Heads warn of Â£5.7bn school funding gap Â£3.8bn needed to reverse school cuts Schools need multi-billion cash injection, say MPs There has been a long-running campaign by school leaders protesting about inadequate funding. This was backed by analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that suggestedschools had suffered budget reductions of 8%since 2010. The Department for Education had rejected such accusations - saying that schools were receiving record levels of funding. But teachers' unions and head teachers' campaign groups have maintained a constant challenge - writing directly to millions of parents about the financial difficulties facing schools. It's a problem that has dogged the government's efforts to look effective in education. Further protests by head teachers are expected in the autumn term - and school leaders will want to check the detail of any promises. Will this really be extra money? Will it be available for this year? Head teachers staged a funding protest in Westminster Will it be targeted at the lowest-funded areas and financial pressure points such as special needs and sixth forms? Will it do more than keep pace with rising costs? Will it be separate from a spending boost for further-education colleges? There have been various claims about the size of the funding gap - from about Â£4bn-Â£6bn to a forecast that it will grow to Â£12.6bn in the next few years. The government will hope that the funding announcement will be enough to draw the sting from protests - as a short-term holding offer, until a longer-term, multi-year approach might be negotiated in the future. Much of the groundwork for a funding announcement would already have been in place - as plans for a cash injection were under way in the final days of Theresa May's premiership. The new education secretary, Gavin Williamson, will get the chance to deliver the extra money that has been demanded by schools. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson faces school funding as a top priority The spending taps are now apparently open - and Boris Johnson's administration is understood to have been examining where extra funding would be most popular. Along with health and a more visible police presence, extra funding for schools has been seen as a measure with widespread public support. There are also said to be concerns about behaviour in schools - so there could be more focus on discipline, linked to wider concerns about youth violence and petty crime. There is also said to be support for more investment in vocational skills and training - and the further-education sector is anticipating its own significant increase in funding this autumn. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said: ""We would very much welcome any additional investment in education as this is desperately needed. ""It must be the start of a long-term phased uplift in funding to reverse education cuts and repair the damage that they have caused. ""We have worked with other education organisations to calculate that Â£12.6bn is needed by 2022-23 across early years, primary and secondary schools, 16-19 education and high needs.""

"Inpe said it had detected more than 72,000 fires so far this year Swathes of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil are on fire. The sky in SÃ£o Paulo turned black due to smoke drifting from the fires 2,700 km (1,700 miles) away.Politicians and environmental activists are taking a stand against Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, blaming the fires on his policies. But it's a complex story, and online discussion of it has been riddled with misinformation, misleading photos and errors. We asked you to send us your questions on the Amazon fires, so we could fill in the gaps and clear up some common myths. We chose a sample of the many questions we received and where we didn't know the answer, we enrolled the experts. 1) Why are there fires? Is it Bolsonaro's men doing it to clear rainforest for mining/farming etc? - Alex Brazilian journalist Silio Boccanera argues that some fires at this time of year - the dry season in Brazil - are to be expected. But many of the fires burning through the Amazon are believed to have been started deliberately. President Bolsonaro has not condemned deforestation and supports clearing the Amazon for agriculture and mining. ""So it's a combination of natural phenomena with locals feeling comfortable enough to do it because the government has not made any effort to prevent it,"" Mr Boccanera says. Smoke rising through the rainforest He thinks that smaller groups of people are more responsible for starting the fires than big corporations selling beef and soy, which could run the risk of being boycotted. Although the big corporations are not innocent, they are better informed, he says. But smaller groups - who benefit from destroying areas of the forest for farming - have gone ahead because they have not been stopped by authorities, Mr Boccanera explains. Although deliberate fire-starting has always been a problem, it has never been seen to this extent. Mr Boccanera says perpetrators now know that if they are caught, they won't be punished. 2) The number of fires seems like a bad metric, because the size of fires varies. Is there year-on-year data on the total area affected? - Peter This is a fair point. On 20 August, Brazil's satellite agency said there had been an 84% increase in the number of fires compared with the same period in 2018. It's the highest number since 2010, but significantly less than in 2005 during the same period, when the number of fires was at its highest. This year, the satellite agency detected more than 74,000 fires in Brazil between January and 20 August. Most of those were in the Amazon, and the New York Times reports most of those fires were on land already cleared for agricultural use. But does this mean more land is being burned than ever before? After all, we could be looking at tens of thousands of tiny fires. The truth is we don't know yet, but the evidence points towards more land being consumed by fire. We don't have the full picture at the moment, partly because many fires are still burning. We asked Copernicus, the European Union's earth observation programme, and they said the best way to assess how destructive these fires are is to look at how much carbon dioxide is being released. So far this year, the equivalent of 228 megatonnes has been released, according to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. This is the highest level since 2010. At some point in the future, there should be more detailed satellite information about how much land had been burned, but that information isn't available yet. 3) What's being done to stop the fires? - Paul President Bolsonaro is coming under growing political pressure to end the burning of the Amazon -France's President Emmanuel Macron even threatened to scrap a huge trade dealbetween the European Union and South America as a result. But warnings by themselves don't put out fires, and a few days after the satellite data was revealed, Brazil's government stepped up its response. In graphics: How bad are the Amazon fires? Mr Bolsonaro has called in the armed forces, who have more resources to tackle the fires, including the use of helicopters and aeroplanes to drop water. However, journalist Silio Boccanera believes the attitude at the top of government needs to change. Before, people believed deforestation needed to be prevented.  But now ""people are burning without fear"", he says. 4) The coverage on this subject has only come to light recently because of the #PrayforAmazonas and #PrayforAmazonia hashtag. Why have you not reported it? - Jake We and other news outlets published several reports this summer about the extent of deforestation in the Amazon -here's one report we wrote on 2 July,another from 20 Julyandanother from 2 August. But the extent of the fires has only recently become clear. It was not even being reported very widely in Brazil. The first real sign vast burning was taking place came when a daytime blackout, caused by smoke from the Amazon, hit Sao Paulo on Monday, 19 August. We first publishedan article a day later, justa few hours after our colleagues at BBC Brasil, and we've kept updating it ever since. This video can not be played Worldwide protests over Brazilian government inaction on Amazon fires The #PrayforAmazonas hashtag was first used in the early hours of Wednesday, UK time. This, and others such as #prayforrondonia have become trending topics around the world. 5) Is this a natural, healthy way the forest self-clears for new growth? - Lucy As Lucy suggests, there is a case to be made that some fire-adapted forests benefit from fires - they can help clear the forest and allow trees space to grow stronger. But this is not the situation right now in the Amazon, says Yadvinder Malhi, Professor of Ecosystem Science at the University of Oxford. ""These are fires that we are concerned about,"" he says. The humid forests of the Amazon have no adaptation to fire and suffer immense damage. Almost all fires in humid forests are started by people. He believes the driving force behind the fire is human rather than natural. While statistics show that 2016 also saw a significant number of fires in the Amazon, this was considered a ""drought year""- when there is naturally less rain so the forest is drier and therefore more fire-prone. But 2019 has not been a drought year. Professor Malhi says there is such a large number of fires because people have lit them. 6) How quickly does the Amazon rainforest regenerate after a fire? - Emily ""The forest takes around 20-40 years if it's allowed to regenerate,"" says Prof Malhi. But any fires that are currently burning will leave the surviving trees more vulnerable to drought and repeated fires. 'Football pitch' of Amazon forest lost every minute Prof Malhi is worried that if the Amazon is hit by fires every few years large parts of it will shift to a degraded shrubby state. ""Once you've had multiple fires there's the chance of permanent damage,"" he says. 7) If this current trend were to continue at its present rate, how long would the Amazon rainforest area survive? - Christopher ""We are at an early stage where we can still do lots to save the forest,"" says Prof Malhi. About 80% of the Amazon is still intact. But he says that climate change and deforestation are a dangerous combination. A reduction in rainfall would create dry conditions for fires to spread. If 30-40% of the Amazon was cleared, then there would be a danger of changing the forest's entire climate, he says. In the years before 2005, Brazil had an extremely high rate of deforestation. Photos from 2003 showing aggressive deforestation in Brazil ""If Brazil were to return to that, it would take around 50-60 years to deforest 40% of the Amazon,"" Prof Malhi says. ""But in eastern and southern Amazonia it would take only 20-30 years to reach that threshold."" 8) What percentage of oxygen does the Amazon supply? - Tom Our colleagues from BBC Reality Check spent a whole day getting to the bottom of this. Many claim on social media that the Amazon produces about 20% of the world's oxygen. It's widely quoted - by campaign groups and well-known figures, including Emmanuel Macron and footballer Cristiano Ronaldo. But academics say this is a very common misconception, and that the figure is less than 10%. Oxygen is released by plants during the process of photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide and water are converted into energy in the form of carbohydrates using sunlight. A large proportion of the world's oxygen is produced by plankton, explains Professor Malhi. He says of the oxygen produced by land-based plants, about 16% comes from the Amazon. But this isn't the whole story. In the long run, the Amazon absorbs about the same amount of oxygen as it produces, effectively making the total produced net zero. Professor Jon Lloyd from Imperial College London says although the Amazon produces a lot of oxygen during the day through photosynthesis, it absorbs about half of it back through the process of respiration to grow. Further oxygen is used up by the forest's soil, animals and microbes. The fires are also emitting carbon monoxide- a gas released when wood is burned and does not have much access to oxygen. 9) Will the smoke from these fires have an effect on global weather in future months? - David Prof Malhi says the immediate effect of the fires will be on the climate of South America. Reduced rain fall is likely, leading to a more intensive dry season. ""The carbon emission could contribute to global warming,"" he adds, but the longer term global impact is ""more difficult to pin down"". In the long-term, scientists have told the BBC the fires could make the Paris climate target more difficult to achieve. The global treaty aims to limit average temperature rise to well below two degrees Celsius to avoid dangerous climate change. 10) How are these fires affecting the indigenous people? - Samantha In just one week in mid-August, 68 fires were registered in indigenous territories and conservation areas, the majority in the Amazon, according to Jonathan Mozower from Survival International,which campaigns for indigenous rights,external. ""It's hard to overstate the importance of these forests for indigenous peoples,"" he says. ""They depend on them for food, medicines, clothing and a sense of identity and belonging. But the incentives to steal these resources are high and ""sadly it's not a question of one or two rogue actors"", Mr Mazower says. He says this could be the ""worst moment for the indigenous people of the Amazon"" since the military dictatorship, which ended in the 1980s. This video can not be played Members of Brazil's indigenous Mura tribe vow to defend their land This article initially stated there was a record number of fires in Brazil this year. After more satellite data was made accessible, it has been updated to reflect the fact the fires are instead the worst since 2010. Amazon fires: How bad have they got?

"Medical profession leaders have called for an urgent meeting with government officials to discuss ongoing shortages of hormone replacement therapy. Hundreds of thousands of women going through the menopause are on HRT either through tablets, patches or gels. Many have suffered ill effects because their HRT product is out of stock. A spokesperson from the Department of Health said it was working with suppliers to maintain the flow of medicines to patients. But one manufacturer has told the BBC supplies of its product range will not be fully restored until the middle of next year. UK faces HRT shortage for menopausal women Women share experiences of HRT shortage HRT is the most common treatment for menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats, and involves taking oestrogen to replace the decline in the body's own levels. Hundreds of women have been contacting the British Menopause Society each week asking why stocks of HRT are low and why they cannot get repeat prescriptions. Some trans women who take HRT are also affected by the shortages. The problems were first identified several months ago. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) said manufacturers must do much more to provide explanations, rather simply blaming supply problems. Karen Keyte from Somerset says that after taking HRT she was able to cope with the symptoms of the menopause. But after finding that she could not get her usual prescription, she felt low and tired and increasingly unwell as she struggled to find alternatives. ""The symptoms got worse and worse,"" she said. Karen Keyte said she struggled when she could not get her usual prescription ""Literally, I went back to the pharmacy with a new prescription to try and get that. ""I couldn't get that - so asked for another one. So I'm then on my third prescription and at that point the chemist next door to the doctors had the script and was able to fulfil it. ""But by that stage, I was feeling hot and feverish. You get just a general feeling of being unwell at the point"". Karen is now on an alternative treatment, but she is not convinced yet that it is effective. Like others, she is frustrated that a problem affecting so many women remains unresolved. A meeting between RCOG and the government has been agreed but the college says this must happen as a matter of urgency. It has also called on the Department of Health and Social Care to make a stronger intervention. Prof Lesley Regan, president of the RCOG, told the BBC: ""What we have got to do is try and work together as professionals with the Department of Health and get these companies to be accountable - give us an explanation. ""Firstly, of what the problem is, and most importantly of the timelines before they will be resolved."" Pharmaceutical company Janssen, which makes the Evorel range, said in a statement it was working closely with health authorities to provide advice for patients, but that supplies would be affected for some months. A spokesperson said: ""So far this year, demand for Evorel products in the UK has already exceeded that of the whole of 2018, depleting all surplus stock. ""As a result, we are unfortunately anticipating a complete interruption to supply across the product range from October 2019, although certain patches may stock out earlier than this date, due to challenges in maintaining our supply to meet this increased demand. ""We are working on a return to full supply by mid-2020."" Other companies, including Mylan, have seen supply interruptions. Demand has switched to alternatives where there are no shortages but this has put pressure on their stocks. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Our priority is to ensure patients continue to access safe and effective medicines. ""We are aware of ongoing supply issues with some HRT preparations due to manufacturing delays. ""Supplies of alternative HRT products are available and any patient affected should discuss alternatives with their doctor.""

"Anne McClain is helped from a space capsule after returning from the ISS in June Nasa is reported to be investigating a claim that an astronaut accessed the bank account of her estranged spouse from the International Space Station, in what may be the first allegation of a crime committed in space. Anne McClain acknowledges accessing the account from the ISS but denies any wrongdoing, theNew York Times,externalreports. Her estranged spouse, Summer Worden, reportedly filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. Ms McClain has since returned to Earth. The astronaut told the New York Times through a lawyer that she was merely making sure that the family's finances were in order and there was enough money to pay bills and care for Ms Worden's son - who they had been raising together prior to the split. ""She strenuously denies that she did anything improper,"" said her lawyer, Rusty Hardin, adding that Ms McClain was ""totally co-operating"". In pictures: Astronauts train in underwater space station Nasa picks headquarters for Moon lander Ms McClain and Ms Worden, who is an Air Force intelligence officer, married in 2014 and Ms Worden filed for divorce in 2018. Investigators from Nasa's Office of Inspector General have contacted both over the allegation, the New York Times reported. Ms McClain graduated from the prestigious West Point military academy and flew more than 800 combat hours over Iraq as an Army pilot. She went on to qualify as a test pilot and was chosen to fly for Nasa in 2013. She spent six months aboard the ISS and had been due to feature in the first all-female spacewalk, but her role wascancelled at the last minute over what Nasa said was a problem with availability of correct suit sizes. There are five national or international space agencies involved in the ISS - from the US, Canada, Japan, Russia and several European countries - and a legal framework sets out that national law applies to any people and possessions in space. So if a Canadian national were to commit a crime in space, they would be subject to Canadian law, and a Russian citizen to Russian law. Space law also sets out provisions for extradition back on Earth, should a nation decide it wishes to prosecute a citizen of another nation for misconduct in space. As space tourism becomes a reality, so might the need to prosecute space crime, but for now the legal framework remains untested. Nasa officials told the New York Times that they were not aware of any crimes committed on the space station.

"All six of Bury's scheduled fixtures this season have been suspended by the EFL Bury are waiting to hear if a last-ditch offer to buy the League One club will save them from being expelled from the English Football League. Owner Steve Dale told BBC Radio Manchester he had agreed a deal with analytics company C&N Sporting Risk, led by Henry Newman and Rory Campbell. The EFL said it had been notified of an offer being accepted by Dale. Bury had been given until 23:59 BST on Friday to prove their financial viability. Football Daily special: The day Bury survived? The EFL is now considering an extension to the deadline. ""We are currently in discussions with the potential purchaser and await information to allow the board to consider a request for an extension to Friday's deadline,"" said an EFL spokesperson. Bury needed to show they could pay off creditors and had funding to complete the season, or risk expulsion from the EFL. The EFL's previous update,issued at 17:00 BST on Friday, said ""limited progress"" had been made by Dale in either providing the evidence they required or finding a new owner, but it would ""keep working to find a resolution"".

"All six of Bury's scheduled fixtures this season have been suspended by the EFL Bury are waiting to hear if a last-ditch offer to buy the League One club will save them from being expelled from the English Football League. Owner Steve Dale told BBC Radio Manchester he had agreed a deal with analytics company C&N Sporting Risk, led by Henry Newman and Rory Campbell. The EFL said it had been notified of an offer being accepted by Dale. Bury had been given until 23:59 BST on Friday to prove their financial viability. Football Daily special: The day Bury survived? The EFL is now considering an extension to the deadline. ""We are currently in discussions with the potential purchaser and await information to allow the board to consider a request for an extension to Friday's deadline,"" said an EFL spokesperson. Bury needed to show they could pay off creditors and had funding to complete the season, or risk expulsion from the EFL. The EFL's previous update,issued at 17:00 BST on Friday, said ""limited progress"" had been made by Dale in either providing the evidence they required or finding a new owner, but it would ""keep working to find a resolution"".

"Leaders of the world's seven richest nations - including UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak - are gathering in Italy to decide what to do to about the ongoing conflict in Gaza and Ukraine. The G7 summit will also involve leaders from Africa and the Indo-Pacific region, and will discuss economic co-operation with developing countries. The G7 (Group of Seven) is an organisation of the world's seven largest so-called ""advanced"" economies, which dominate global trade and the international financial system. They are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the United States. Russia joined in 1998, creating the G8, but was excluded in 2014for its takeover of Crimea. China has never been a member, despite its large economy and having the world's second-largest population. Its relatively low level of wealth per person means it is not seen as an advanced economy in the way the G7 members are. Both these nations are in the G20 group of developed and developing nations. The EU is not a member of the G7, but attends the annual summits. Throughout the year, G7 ministers and officials hold meetings, form agreements and publish joint statements on global events. Italy has the G7 presidency in 2024. Italy's premier, Giorgia Meloni, is hosting the 2024 G7 summit The 2024 G7 summit will be held from 13 to 15 June in Apulia, in Italy. It will bethe first major international forum hosted by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni,since she took office in October 2022. As well as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Italy says it wants the summit to focus on Africa and migration, economic security, and international co-operation on artificial intelligence (AI). Between them, the G7 nations have already imposed on Russiathe biggest package of sanctions ever imposed on a large economy. They have blocked the country from international commerce and the global financial system. G7 and EU nations have also frozen about $325bn (Â£254bn) of Russian financial assets which were held in their territories, such as the foreign currency reserves of Russia's central bank. The G7 nations are nowworking on a schemeto take the interest those assets have earned and pass it to Ukraine in the form of a loan. This could amount to $50bn. On 3 June, G7 leadersall backed the plan put forward by US President Joe Biden to end the war in Gaza.,external He has proposed an immediate ceasefire by Israel and Hamas, the release of all hostages, an increase in aid for Gaza and a peace deal which guarantees Israel's security and the safety of Gazan residents. Italy says""the relationship with developing nations and emerging economies will be central"",externalto the G7 summit, and that it ""will work to build a co-operation model based on mutually beneficial partnerships"". It has invited leaders from 12 developing countries in Africa, South America and the Indo-Pacific region. Under thethe Mattei Plan,,externalItaly will give grants and loans worth 5.5bn euros (Â£4.6bn) to several African countries, to help develop their economies. The scheme would also position Italy as an energy hub, building gas and hydrogen pipelines between Africa and Europe. However, many commentatorssuspect it may be a cover,externalfor Italy to crack down on further migration from Africa. Italy is asking other nations to contribute financially to the scheme. As the G7's president in 2023, Japan pushed for the group to draw up a plan for international economic security. The G7 adopted ananti-coercion pact,,externaldesigned to stop countries such as China and Russia using their economic strength to impose their will on others. In December 2023,Italy pulled out of the Belt and Road Initiative- a scheme to expand China's ports and transport routes worldwide to boost trade. Ms Meloni said that joining had been ""a serious mistake"". The US has called the initiative ""debt-trap diplomacy"" on China's part. It is thought thatthe US is keen for G7 leaders to take further action on economic security,externalat the summit in Italy. The safety of AI was raised at the 2023 summit in Japan and resulted in theHiroshima AI Process,external, intended to promote ""safe, secure, and trustworthy AI worldwide"". However, this was only a collection of voluntary measures. The G7 summit may look at drawing up further international regulations for AI safety, building on theAI Act adopted by the EUand theUS president's executive order on AI. The G7 cannot pass laws. However, some of its past decisions have had global effects. For example, the G7 played a crucial role in setting up aglobal fund to fight malaria and Aids,externalin 2002. Ahead of the 2021 G7 summit in the UK, the group's finance ministersagreed to make multinational companies pay more tax. It has also provided financial aid to developing countries, and taken steps to tackle climate change.

"Complaints about school funding shortages in England are expected to be addressed soon by the government. There are suggestions that about Â£4bn in extra funding, as a one-off, one-year cash injection, could be announced as early as next week. In his Tory leadership campaign, Boris Johnson promised to reverse cuts in school funding. Heads' and teachers' organisations have been warning of a worsening budget crisis for schools. After making spending promises for the NHS and policing, the prime minister is next expected to turn his attention to improving funding for schools and colleges. Putting more money into cash-strapped schools is likely to be seen as a popular grassroots measure ahead of a possible autumn general election. This could still be delayed by Brexit wrangling, but there is an expectation that the government is imminently preparing to grasp the nettle on school budget shortages. School funding top priority for Gavin Williamson Heads warn of Â£5.7bn school funding gap Â£3.8bn needed to reverse school cuts Schools need multi-billion cash injection, say MPs There has been a long-running campaign by school leaders protesting about inadequate funding. This was backed by analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that suggestedschools had suffered budget reductions of 8%since 2010. The Department for Education had rejected such accusations - saying that schools were receiving record levels of funding. But teachers' unions and head teachers' campaign groups have maintained a constant challenge - writing directly to millions of parents about the financial difficulties facing schools. It's a problem that has dogged the government's efforts to look effective in education. Further protests by head teachers are expected in the autumn term - and school leaders will want to check the detail of any promises. Will this really be extra money? Will it be available for this year? Head teachers staged a funding protest in Westminster Will it be targeted at the lowest-funded areas and financial pressure points such as special needs and sixth forms? Will it do more than keep pace with rising costs? Will it be separate from a spending boost for further-education colleges? There have been various claims about the size of the funding gap - from about Â£4bn-Â£6bn to a forecast that it will grow to Â£12.6bn in the next few years. The government will hope that the funding announcement will be enough to draw the sting from protests - as a short-term holding offer, until a longer-term, multi-year approach might be negotiated in the future. Much of the groundwork for a funding announcement would already have been in place - as plans for a cash injection were under way in the final days of Theresa May's premiership. The new education secretary, Gavin Williamson, will get the chance to deliver the extra money that has been demanded by schools. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson faces school funding as a top priority The spending taps are now apparently open - and Boris Johnson's administration is understood to have been examining where extra funding would be most popular. Along with health and a more visible police presence, extra funding for schools has been seen as a measure with widespread public support. There are also said to be concerns about behaviour in schools - so there could be more focus on discipline, linked to wider concerns about youth violence and petty crime. There is also said to be support for more investment in vocational skills and training - and the further-education sector is anticipating its own significant increase in funding this autumn. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said: ""We would very much welcome any additional investment in education as this is desperately needed. ""It must be the start of a long-term phased uplift in funding to reverse education cuts and repair the damage that they have caused. ""We have worked with other education organisations to calculate that Â£12.6bn is needed by 2022-23 across early years, primary and secondary schools, 16-19 education and high needs.""

"Medical profession leaders have called for an urgent meeting with government officials to discuss ongoing shortages of hormone replacement therapy. Hundreds of thousands of women going through the menopause are on HRT either through tablets, patches or gels. Many have suffered ill effects because their HRT product is out of stock. A spokesperson from the Department of Health said it was working with suppliers to maintain the flow of medicines to patients. But one manufacturer has told the BBC supplies of its product range will not be fully restored until the middle of next year. UK faces HRT shortage for menopausal women Women share experiences of HRT shortage HRT is the most common treatment for menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats, and involves taking oestrogen to replace the decline in the body's own levels. Hundreds of women have been contacting the British Menopause Society each week asking why stocks of HRT are low and why they cannot get repeat prescriptions. Some trans women who take HRT are also affected by the shortages. The problems were first identified several months ago. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) said manufacturers must do much more to provide explanations, rather simply blaming supply problems. Karen Keyte from Somerset says that after taking HRT she was able to cope with the symptoms of the menopause. But after finding that she could not get her usual prescription, she felt low and tired and increasingly unwell as she struggled to find alternatives. ""The symptoms got worse and worse,"" she said. Karen Keyte said she struggled when she could not get her usual prescription ""Literally, I went back to the pharmacy with a new prescription to try and get that. ""I couldn't get that - so asked for another one. So I'm then on my third prescription and at that point the chemist next door to the doctors had the script and was able to fulfil it. ""But by that stage, I was feeling hot and feverish. You get just a general feeling of being unwell at the point"". Karen is now on an alternative treatment, but she is not convinced yet that it is effective. Like others, she is frustrated that a problem affecting so many women remains unresolved. A meeting between RCOG and the government has been agreed but the college says this must happen as a matter of urgency. It has also called on the Department of Health and Social Care to make a stronger intervention. Prof Lesley Regan, president of the RCOG, told the BBC: ""What we have got to do is try and work together as professionals with the Department of Health and get these companies to be accountable - give us an explanation. ""Firstly, of what the problem is, and most importantly of the timelines before they will be resolved."" Pharmaceutical company Janssen, which makes the Evorel range, said in a statement it was working closely with health authorities to provide advice for patients, but that supplies would be affected for some months. A spokesperson said: ""So far this year, demand for Evorel products in the UK has already exceeded that of the whole of 2018, depleting all surplus stock. ""As a result, we are unfortunately anticipating a complete interruption to supply across the product range from October 2019, although certain patches may stock out earlier than this date, due to challenges in maintaining our supply to meet this increased demand. ""We are working on a return to full supply by mid-2020."" Other companies, including Mylan, have seen supply interruptions. Demand has switched to alternatives where there are no shortages but this has put pressure on their stocks. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Our priority is to ensure patients continue to access safe and effective medicines. ""We are aware of ongoing supply issues with some HRT preparations due to manufacturing delays. ""Supplies of alternative HRT products are available and any patient affected should discuss alternatives with their doctor.""

"Carolyn Mercer had gender reassignment surgery after decades of feeling uncomfortable in a man's body On a dull autumn day in 1964, two NHS doctors strapped a 17-year-old boy into a wooden chair in a dark, windowless room and covered him in electrodes. During hours of so-called therapy, they repeatedly electrocuted him while showing him images of women's clothing. In a coffee shop in Soho, Carolyn Mercer, now 72, smiles as she looks at a photograph of the boy. ""That person has grown and developed,"" she said. ""But it's still me."" Carolyn - who prefers not to mention the male name she used to go by - remembers the first time she realised she was different. As a three-year-old boy playing in the backstreets of Preston, Lancashire, she persuaded her younger sister to switch clothes with her. The pair swapped their pre-school uniforms and Carolyn stood on the front step of her mother's shop, hoping people would see a little girl standing there. ""It was never about clothes... It was about something deep inside,"" Carolyn said. ""I was a boy, and I didn't want to be."" Carolyn Mercer (left) growing up in the 1950s, with her younger sister When Carolyn was born in 1947, society's attitude to gay and transgender people was far from accepting. England and Wales was still 20 years from legalising homosexual relationships - or using the word ""transgender"". As a little Lancashire lad in his sister's school skirt, Carolyn had no words to describe her feelings. But she now knows she was a trans girl withgender dysphoria,external- distressed because her biological sex did not match her gender identity. ""I went to sleep hoping someone would invent a brain transplant to put my brain in a more appropriate body,"" she said. Throughout boyhood, Carolyn's secret desire to live as a woman morphed into an all-consuming self-loathing. ""I knew what I wanted to be, and that dissonance and dysphoria [was] accentuated from the age of three onwards,"" Carolyn says ""That self-hatred was because I wanted something so absurd."" Carolyn said she felt ""dirty"" because society viewed transgender people as ""wrong"" and ""evil"". ""If it was wrong and it was evil, that must be because I am wrong, and I am evil,"" she mused. 'LGBT conversion therapy' to be banned 'I thought being straight would make me happy' Brunei to punish gay sex with death by stoning As Carolyn grew into a strongly-built teenager, she threw herself into trying to be ""good bloke"" - playing ""masculine"" sports like rugby and boxing. But she could not shake the deeply uncomfortable feeling of pretending to be someone she was not. Carolyn began to feel depressed and suicidal. She thought it ""would be easier"" for her friends and family if she died than if she told anybody how she felt. Then, aged 17, she shared her secret with a local vicar. He took her to see a doctor at a psychiatric hospital. ""Five or six"" sessions of aversion therapy at a hospital in Blackburn were arranged. ""I asked for that, I wanted to be cured,"" Carolyn said. Electric shock therapies of various kinds have been used in medicine since the 1930s (file image) Carolyn was strapped to a wooden chair in a dark room as doctors dipped electrodes in brine and attached them to her arm. They projected image after image of women's clothing on to the wall in front of her. As each photograph snapped into view, a current was passed through the electrodes to give her a painful electric shock. Carolyn vividly remembers the surging shock wrenching her hand painfully upwards as her arm remained pinned to the chair. Despite her tears of agony, the doctors pressed on. They were convinced that if she ""learned"" to associate thoughts about her gender with memories of pain, she would stop thinking she was a woman. After a few months of treatment, Carolyn opted out of more. But the trauma was so great, she went on to experience physical shaking and flashbacks for the next 40 years. In 2017 there were widespread protests in Sao Paulo, Brazil, after a judge overruled an old law forbidding ""cure"" therapy for LGBT+ people So-called ""gay-cure"" conversion therapies claim to help change someone's sexuality or gender identity. Methods include hypnosis, exorcisms and aversion treatments such as patients receiving electric shocks or vomit-inducing drugs. The therapies were available on the NHS until the 1970s. Both the NHS and the government said there was no record of how many people were treated or died as a result of the treatment. Various forms of conversion therapy continue to be carried out across the world on LGBT people despite scientific evidence it is harmful and ineffective. In 2018, a survey suggested 2% of the LGBT community in the UK had undergone conversion therapy - prompting the government topromise it would ban the treatment. Work is under way to see how a ban would be implemented. But the complex and deeply entrenched beliefs that fostered the spread of the therapy mean it will still be some time before it is brought to an end. For a while, Carolyn thought the therapy had worked. She led as ""manly"" a life as possible. By the age of 19, she had a wife and a baby daughter. She became a maths teacher and was promoted quickly, soon becoming one of the youngest head teachers in Lancashire. But her dysphoria had not been stifled. A 19-year-old Carolyn on her first day of teaching college, two years after having aversion therapy Her depression worsened as she was gripped by uncontrollable shaking whenever she thought about the treatment she had received. ""Did [the therapy] work in that it affected my body? Yes,"" Carolyn said. ""Did it work in affecting my mind? Only in terms of making me hate myself even more."" After years of struggling to cope with the all-consuming dysphoria, Carolyn eventually began taking hormones to develop breasts in the early 1990s. Homophobia, HIV and hoax calls: The history of a helpline The pilot who changed gender at 58 Advice: Gender dysphoria and transgender This was the beginning of a process described by many in the transgender community as ""transition"" or, as Carolyn prefers, to ""align my gender expression with my gender identity"". It's ""a bit of a mouthful"", she says, ""but it suits me"". Although her family had been ""incredible"", they did not actively support her decision. ""They actually liked the person they saw - a different person to the one that I was looking at,"" she said. At work, Carolyn bound her developing breasts to hide the effects of her treatment. But in 1994, a journalist learned she was taking hormones, and Carolyn's personal life was plastered across tabloids claiming it was in the ""public interest"" to report the secret of a high-profile head teacher. The episode forced Carolyn to rethink taking hormones. The following summer, she had her breasts surgically removed - an operation normally reserved for cancer patients. Once again, an impassable void had lodged itself between who Carolyn was, and who she wanted to be. But after several more difficult years - though with the support of her staff, students, friends and family - Carolyn, aged 55, retired early to finally undergo the surgery she had been dreaming of for decades. Carolyn's road trip in the US at the age of 67 was the first holiday she had been on where she felt she could enjoy herself ""Life is so, so much better. I don't have that dark secret hidden away all of the time."" Some members of the trans community say the person they were before surgery is dead. But for Carolyn, who has lived most of her life as that person, the little boy wearing his sister's pre-school uniform is very much alive. ""I'm still the same person with the same experiences,"" she said. She continues to struggle with being happy. Following conversion therapy, she became so used to burying her innermost desires that she finds it difficult to let herself be happy. ""You show me a menu in a restaurant and you say 'which would you prefer?', I don't know,"" she said. ""Some will find it sad, but it's something I've come to terms with... I don't have a light anymore, or emotion like that, because I suppressed it for so long."" If you are struggling with gender dysphoria,these organisationsmay be able to help.

"A patient has died after developing a severe respiratory disease due to vaping in the first such death in the US, say health officials. It comes as experts investigate a mystery lung disease across the US that is linked to use of e-cigarettes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said there were 193 ""potential cases"" in 22 US states. Many of the cases involve vaping THC, the main active compound in cannabis, CDC experts said. The cases were reported over the course of two months between 28 June and 20 August. The person who died was ""hospitalized with unexplained illness after reported vaping or e-cigarette use"", Dr Jennifer Layden, the chief medical officer and state epidemiologist in Illinois, said. CDC director Robert Redfield said: ""We are saddened to hear of the first death related to the outbreak of severe lung disease in those who use e-cigarette or 'vaping' devices."" He added: ""This tragic death in Illinois reinforces the serious risks associated with e-cigarette products."" The cause of the mystery illness has not been identified, but all involve vaping in some form. ""In many cases, patients have acknowledged recent use of THC-containing product,"" the CDC's head of non-infectious diseases, Dr Ileana Arias, said. Those affected had symptoms including coughing, shortness of breath and fatigue as well as some cases of vomiting and diarrhoea. There is no evidence of an infectious disease - such as a virus or bacteria - being responsible. Why do lithium batteries explode? Exploding e-cigarette kills Texas man US man killed by exploding vape pen But there is much that remains a mystery. ""It isn't clear if these cases have a common cause or if they are different diseases with similar presentations,"" Dr Arias said. There have been 22 cases in the state of Illinois, with patients ranging from 17 to 38 years old. The 22 states affected are largely in the centre and north-east of the country, from Minnesota to North Carolina, though cases have also been reported in California, Texas, and New Mexico. Officials have ordered laboratory tests of vaping liquid samples in a bid to identify any harmful compounds. A ""black market"" is known to exist for THC-containing vape cartridges, which are sold legally through medical marijuana dispensaries in some states. Users in online communities have warned of the dangers of unregulated fake cartridges. No cause for the mystery illness has been identified - and the link to THC products is not clear yet either. Mitch Zeller of the US Food and Drug administration said it was important to understand that ""we find ourselves in the early stages of these investigations trying to piece together the facts."" This video can not be played Smoking v vaping: Watch lab test results He said the FDA was exploring whether the products were used as intended or being modified by adding something to them. The president of the American Vaping Association, Gregory Conley, said in a statement on Thursday that he was ""confident"" the illnesses were being caused by devices containing cannabis or other synthetic drugs, not nicotine. But Dr Brian King from the CDC's office on smoking and health warned against thinking of vaping as completely safe. ""We do know that e-cigarettes do not emit a harmless aerosol,"" he said. ""There's a variety of harmful ingredients identified, including things like ultrafine particulates, heavy metals like lead and cancer causing chemicals,"" he said, along with diacetyl - a flavouring used to give a ""buttery"" taste that has been linked to ""severe respiratory illness"". He also warned of the possibility that similar cases had been happening for a long time, but the connection between them had been missed. ""It's possible that the reported cases could have been occurring before this investigation was even initiated,"" he said. Dr King said it was possible ""we weren't necessarily capturing them, but now there's increased diligence in terms of the current investigation that we're better able to"".

"Norrie Hunter has completed his first Ironman triathlon after recovering from life-saving heart surgery An Ayrshire man has gone from heart surgery to a long-distance triathlon in just 16 months. Norrie Hunter, from Symington, completed his first Ironman race after being inspired by a book about a cancer patient who took up the sport. He read the story while recovering from life-saving heart surgery at the Golden Jubilee National Hospital in Clydebank and started training six weeks later. He completed a 2.4 mile swim, a 112 mile bicycle ride and a 26.22 mile run. The 36-year-old found out he may have had a congenital heart condition while tending to his unwell mother. Mr Hunter said: ""My mum was on her deathbed and she said she believed there was a history of heart problems in the family and she wanted me to get checked out, so I promised her I would."" Then Norrie, a seasoned marathon runner, experienced breathing difficulties during a competition. Although he finished the race he decided he needed a check-up. Through this process he discovered that he had been born with a Bicuspid Aortic Valve (BAV) leading to an enlarged left ventricle. Norrie Hunter had heart surgery 16 months ago but is now competing successfully in Ironman triathlons A (BAV) is an inherited form of heart disease in which two of the leaflets of the aortic valve fuse during development in the womb resulting in a two-leaflet valve (bicuspid valve) instead of the normal three-leaflet valve (tricuspid). The condition is commonly not diagnosed until adulthood because the defective valve can function for years without causing any symptoms. He was booked into the Scottish Adult Congenital Cardiac Service (SACCS) at the Golden Jubilee hospital for heart surgery in March 2018. After just six weeks' recuperation, Norrie decided to start training again and downloaded a fitness app to get going. Just 16 months later Norrie was able to compete in his first Ironman. Norrie added: ""It was while recovering in my hospital bed that I was given a book called Operation Ironman. Norrie Hunter after the swimming part of his triathlon in Bolton ""Written by George Mahood, it describes the authors' journey from the discovery of a cancerous growth wrapped round his spine to competing, four months later, in the Ironman triathlon. It was inspiring. ""I feel like I've been given my life back. I'm not quite back to the strength that I was before the operation but I'm still running and I refuse to be defined by a scratch on my chest."" NHS Golden Jubilee nurse practitioner Jim Mearns said: ""I am delighted to hear about Norrie's achievements. Regaining his fitness and strength so quickly after heart surgery is not only testament to his own strength and determination, but also to the great skill of our own dedicated and caring staff. ""It's wonderful to hear that once our patients leave the NHS Golden Jubilee National Hospital, they continue to grow in strength.""

"A worker at the UK consulate in Hong Kong has been released by mainland China after being held at the border, Chinese police in Shenzhen have said. Simon Cheng went missing on 8 August during a business trip to the city but has now returned to Hong Kong. China's foreign ministry said Mr Cheng had been detained for 15 days for violating public security laws. The UK has welcomed his release. It comes as anti-government protests in Hong Kong enter their third month. The large-scale demonstrations were sparked by a now-suspended extradition bill that would have allowed Hong Kong to send criminal suspects to China for trial. The police said Mr Cheng had been released as scheduled and that his legal rights had been observed, according to a post on the Weibo social media platform. In a Facebook post, the Cheng family said: ""Simon has returned to Hong Kong; thank you everyone for your support."" It asked for Mr Cheng to be allowed time to recover before any interviews would be allowed. The UK's Foreign Office said: ""We welcome the release of Simon Cheng and are delighted that he can be reunited with his family. We will continue to provide support to them.""

They have entered their 12th straight weekend. A police-approved march has been taking place on Saturday in the industrial Kwun Tong area, attracting more than 1,000 people. There have been more tense moments during the latest protests on Saturday Bricks were thrown at one police station and officers fired tear gas in response. Protesters also reportedly pulled down a ""smart lamppost"", devices that monitor traffic and air quality but which some believe also violate privacy. Hundreds of pro-government supporters have picketed the Kowloon Tong HQ of public broadcaster RTHK, alleging it is biased,the South China Morning Post reported,external.
