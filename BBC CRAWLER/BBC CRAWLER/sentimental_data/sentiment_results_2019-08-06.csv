"This video can not be played Michael Gove says it is ""wrong"" of the EU to refuse to re-open talks Cabinet minister Michael Gove says the EU ""seem to be refusing to negotiate with the UK"" over a new Brexit deal. Mr Gove, who is responsible for no-deal planning, said he was ""deeply saddened"" that Brussels was, in his words, saying ""no, we don't want to talk"". It comes after the EU said UK demands to removethe Irish backstopfrom Theresa May's deal were unacceptable. Irish PM Leo Varadkar has reiteratedthat the withdrawal deal, including the backstop, cannot be renegotiated. The European Commission said it was willing to hold further talks, ""should the UK wish to clarify its position"". Meanwhile, a group of politicianshas started a legal actionaimed at preventing Boris Johnson shutting down Parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know 'Low take-up' of no-deal Brexit fund Is it too late to hold an election before Brexit? 'No deal can still be avoided' - Irish PM Theresa May's deal has been rejected three times by MPs and as things stand, the UK will leave the EU on 31 October whether it has agreed a new one or not. On Monday, EU negotiators told European diplomats there was currently no basis for ""meaningful discussions"" and talks were back where they were three years ago. A senior EU diplomat reportedly said a no-deal Brexit appeared to be the UK government's ""central scenario"". Addressing those suggestions, Mr Gove said: ""At the moment, it's the EU that seems to be saying they're not interested, they are simply saying 'no, we don't want to talk'. ""I think that's wrong and sad, it's not in Europe's interests"", he added. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab denied ministers were now aiming for a no-deal exit, insisting the UK would ""strain every sinew to get the changes we need"". Speaking to the BBC during a trip to Canada on Tuesday, he said the EU had so far shown ""no movement, no compromise, no flexibility"" over changing the agreement rejected by Parliament. ""Of course, if the EU don't move, if they're stubbornly intransigent, then we will leave on WTO [World Trade Organization] rules,"" he added. This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""We sought mandate for no-deal Brexit"" Monday's EU meeting followed discussion last week between the EU and the PM's European envoy, David Frost, where he reiterated Mr Johnson's stance that the backstop plan must be removed from Mrs May's deal. He also raised concerns about the UK's ""divorce bill"" and the proposed role of the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, after Brexit. Many opponents of Mrs May's deal cite concerns over the backstop - aninsurance policyto prevent a hard border returning on the island of Ireland - which if implemented, would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Speaking on Tuesday in Belfast, Mr Varadkar told reporters he did not accept that a no-deal Brexit was unavoidable, adding there were ""a number of ways"" in which it could be avoided. He said these options included ratifying Mrs May's deal, further extending the UK's EU membership, or the UK cancelling Brexit by revoking Article 50. Mr Varadkar said he had invited Mr Johnson to Dublin for talks on Brexit, and other issues, with ""no preconditions"". The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the EU was grappling with how to deal with a prime minister in Boris Johnson who was demanding things they were not prepared to give. He said the EU had not given up yet, and all eyes would be on the G7 summit in France at the end of August, which many believe could be the moment of truth - the point at which a no-deal Brexit may become inevitable. Earlier, Mr Johnson met his first foreign leader since entering Downing Street - Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas. Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas met Boris Johnson at No 10 The country's Foreign Minister, Urmas Reinsalu, said earlier that while the ""reality"" was the withdrawal agreement - including the backstop - had been jointly agreed by EU member states, there was still a need for continued dialogue in the coming weeks to avoid a no-deal Brexit. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme alternatives to the backstop could be discussed after the ratification of the withdrawal deal. Last week the governmentannounced an extra Â£2.1bn of fundingto prepare for a no-deal Brexit - doubling the amount of money it has set aside this year. The plans include more Border Force officers and upgrades to transport infrastructure at ports, as well as more money to tackle queues in Kent created by delays at the Channel. Mr Gove said the government's preparations for no deal had been stepped up and ""the days of drift that we have had in the past have ended"". He said the plan to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October was a ""firm deadline"", and ""we will be ready to leave come what may"". Not for the first time the Brexit process appears to be deadlocked. Both sides say they're willing to talk and both sides want to avoid leaving without a deal. But the UK and the EU are not negotiating because each has a position which the other says it can't accept. For the time being expect more tough talk from government ministers and similar from the EU. But sooner or later, if both sides really do want to avoid leaving without an agreement, someone or something will have to give. Come September when MPs return from their summer break there may be more attempts to prevent no deal, a move to force a general election - perhaps a subtle shift in the government's position. There's nothing like a deadline to focus minds and if this one sticks, things could begin to happen very fast. This summer stand-off can only last so long.

"Alana Cutland was studying natural sciences at Robinson College in Cambridge The body of a Cambridge University student who fell from a light aircraft in Madagascar has been found. Alana Cutland, 19, from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire, fell from the plane on 25 July. Local police chief Sinola Nomenjahary confirmed Ms Cutland's body had been found in a rural area on Tuesday. Ms Cutland was studying natural sciences at Robinson College and was on an internship on the African island at the time of her death. Earlier this week Colonel D'y La Paix Ralaivaonary said Ms Cutland had been frustrated and ""disappointed"" with her research project. He said within days of arriving she had seemed to conclude that the project would not be a success. Ms Cutland was on an internship in Madagascar when she died Ms Cutland had contacted her supervisor on her second day in Madagascar and at least twice more after that, the colonel said. Police previously said Ms Cutland fell to her death after opening a plane door, but the reason why she did so remains unclear. They ruled out a possible adverse reaction to anti-malaria medication she was taking, but have since said the theory is ""still on the table"". In a statement released through the Foreign Office last week, Ms Cutland's family said they were heartbroken at the death of ""a bright, independent young woman"". ""She was always so kind and supportive to her family and friends, which resulted in her having a very special connection with a wide network of people from all walks of her life, who we know will miss her dearly,"" her family said. Dr David Woodman, from Robinson College, said they were ""deeply shocked by the news of Alana's death"". ""In her two years here, she made a huge contribution to many different aspects of life in the college - she will be sorely missed by us all,"" he said.

"John McDonnell said it would be for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish people to decide on whether to hold another independence vote A future Labour government would not block a second Scottish independence referendum, according to shadow chancellor John McDonnell. In an interview at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, he said any decision about holding a vote would be up to the Scottish Parliament. His view contradicts that of Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard. Earlier this year, Mr Leonard said the party would refuse to grant Holyrood the power to hold another vote. Will Brexit break Britain, and would England care? Will indyref2 happen before May 2021? Sturgeon: Indyref2 'more essential than ever' Mr McDonnell's comments follow the publication of an opinion poll suggesting the majority of Scots could back independence. And on Monday Nicola Sturgeon told journalist Iain Dale there was a""growing urgency"" for Scotland to become independent ""sooner rather than later"". Mr McDonnell was also speaking to the LBC broadcaster when he was asked about the possibility of a second independence vote. ""It will be for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish people to decide that,"" the senior Labour MP said. ""They will take a view about whether they want another referendum. Nicola Sturgeon said by late next year or thebeginning of 2021."" He added: ""We would not block something like that. We would let the Scottish people decide. That's democracy. ""There are other views within the party but that's our view."" Richard Leonard is opposed to a second independence referendum Mr McDonnell's position appears to be in opposition to the leader of the Scottish Labour party. In March, Richard Leonard told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland that if Labour took power in Westminster the party would refuse to grant a Section 30 order. He added: ""What we said in the manifesto at the 2017 election was that there is no case for, and we would not support, a second independence referendum."" However, Mr McDonnell said: ""The Scottish Parliament will come to a considered view on that and they will submit that to the government and the English Parliament itself. ""If the Scottish people decide they want a referendum that's for them."" His comments were condemned by his party colleague Ian Murray, the MP for Edinburgh South. ""These are utterly irresponsible comments from John McDonnell that betray our party's values,"" he said. ""The Labour Party is an internationalist party founded on a vision of solidarity and we should never seek to appease nationalists, whether they be for Brexit or Scottish independence, who want to divide communities and people."" In a post on Twitter Nicola Sturgeon said the Shadow Chancellor's position was ""basic democracy"". She added that it made ""political sense"" as polls suggested 40% of Labour voters support independence. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Meanwhile, Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie described Mr McDonnell's comments as ""astonishingly irresponsible"". ""It's bad enough with Boris Johnson bungling on Brexit and independence but to have the Labour Party's chancellor piling in makes it a whole lot worse,"" he said. On Brexit, Mr McDonnell said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would ""never"" step down if other opposition parties demanded it to form a coalition of national unity. He said: ""It won't happen. I think we'd form a minority government, seek to implement our manifesto and we'd expect the other opposition parties and other MPs to vote for those policies and if they don't we'll go back to the country. ""If they want to vote against a real living wage, if they want to vote against Â£70bn worth of investment in Scottish infrastructure, if they want to vote against a green industrial revolution to tackle climate change then so be it, we'll go back to the people and then let them explain to the people why they wouldn't support those policies."" ""We want to change the world, we're not going be held back by other parties."" The senior Labour frontbencher said he was ""extremely worried"" about new Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He added: ""I think he's reckless and I think he's unstable and I will move heaven and Earth to stop a no-deal Brexit.""

"The latest series of Line of Duty was a ratings hit Watching programmes on a TV set is still the most popular way for UK audiences to watch television - but streaming is catching up. Traditional viewing - including catch-up within 28 days - still accounts for most TV watching, with an average of three hours and 12 minutes per day. But according toOfcom's latest Media Nations report,external, this marks a drop of 11 minutes since 2017. Average daily viewing of streaming services rose last year to 26 minutes. The number of UK households signed up to the most popular streaming platforms - Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Now TV and Disney Life - increased from 11.2m (39%) in 2018 to 13.3m (47%) in 2019. The total number of UK streaming subscriptions rose by a quarter in 2018 - from 15.6m to 19.1m - with many homes signing up to more than one service. The report found that two in five of UK adults now consider online video services to be their main way of watching TV and film. Despite traditional TV viewing declining, the five main public service broadcasters - BBC One, BBC Two, Channel 4, ITV/STV and Channel 5 - held their share of viewing, at 52%. Still Game most-watched Scottish show of 2018 But viewers now watch 50 minutes less traditional TV each day than in 2010 - and those in the younger age bracket (16 to 24) have halved the time they spend watching TV that way during the same period. This is the second Media Nations report to be published by Ofcom. Friends is still the most streamed show on paid-for services in the UK The first, which came out in 2018, found thatFriends topped a listof the UK's most popular shows on paid-for streaming services. It was the same again this year, with Friends at number one and accounting for around 2% of total streams. The US sitcom, which first aired in 1994, was added to Netflix early last year. Amazon's car show Grand Tour was the second most streamed, followed by You, The Good Place and Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which are all on Netflix. BBC One's Line of Duty is the most-watched programme overall this year so far with 12.1 million tuning in to the final episode. The channel's Bodyguard was the most-watched drama in 2018, with 14.3 million viewers for its final outing. Yih-Choung Teh, strategy and research group director at Ofcom, said: ""The way we watch TV is changing faster than ever before. In the space of seven years, streaming services have grown from nothing to reach nearly half of British homes. ""But traditional broadcasters still have a vital role to play, producing the kind of brilliant UK programmes that overseas tech giants struggle to match.

"The government has come up with new proposals for England and Wales to end the row with doctors over pensions. Doctors had started refusing to do overtime shifts because they were being landed with bills after changes to the amount that can be accrued tax-free. Just weeks after ruling out reviewing the rules, ministers now say they will. A consultation launched by Theresa May's government offering to introduce more pension flexibility is also being replaced by more radical solutions. The previous consultation was only published on 22 July. But it was reassessed following the appointment as prime minister of Boris Johnson, who had promised to address the issue during the Tory leadership contest. Thepensions row has been linked to a rise in waiting times for routine surgerycaused by medics refusing to work beyond their planned hours. The government said it would now be putting forward a plan to allow doctors complete flexibility when it comes to scaling down their pension contributions to avoid breaching the annual tax-free allowance. The allowance has been reduced from Â£255,000 a year in 2010-11 to Â£40,000 - and drops still further for the highest earners. This tends to affect those earning more than Â£110,000, around a third of senior doctors and GPs Previously the government had said it favoured a 50:50 option whereby public sector staff could forsake half the amount paid into their pension. But now ministers have said they will publish a consultation in the coming weeks which favours giving public sector staff the ability to reduce contributions to zero. It will also allow doctors to be given the contributions the employer would have made, meaning their pay packets could be boosted by thousands of pounds a year. Meanwhile, the Treasury has agreed to look at how public sector workers are taxed on their pensions to see if the rules can be relaxed. This will not involve reviewing the Â£40,000 threshold, but instead will focus on how that reduces to Â£10,000 as more is earned. Some doctors have reported being landed with huge unexpected tax bills. The plans will be set out in a consultation published during the summer with a view to introducing them from April. But to help relieve the problems immediately, the government is also promising to allow doctors to opt out from the pension scheme for this financial year. Again, guidance will be published in the coming weeks. The government hopes this will relieve the pressure on hospitals, which have reported waiting lists are lengthening because doctors are refusing extra shifts. It will be up to Scotland and Northern Ireland to decide whether to make similar changes, although the way pensions work in those parts of the UK is slightly different anyway. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""NHS doctors do extraordinary life-saving work every day - they should not have to worry about the tax impacts if they choose to go the extra mile by taking on additional work to help patients."" Dr Chaand Nagpaul, of the British Medical Association, said: ""We acknowledge this step forward by the government."" ""After tireless lobbying on the damaging effect that perverse and ill-thought out tax legislation is having on our NHS, its doctors and patients, it is good to see the government finally sitting up and taking notice and proposing action."" But Sara Gorton from the union Unison said: ""Introducing measures to help only a small proportion of the millions of active NHS scheme members looks alarmingly like the beginning of a 'clinicians-first' approach to pension strategy."" Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the pension changes had undermined the ability of the NHS to provide care to patients and ministers still need to do more to address existing staff shortages.

BBC Newsnight has learned that just 741 companies have applied for the grants. HMRC says it is doing ""everything we can to help businesses get ready for leaving the EU"". An estimated 240,000 UK businesses currently trade with the EU. Many of these would be expected to need training if the customs system changed. The government funding aims to support employee training and IT improvements to complete customs declarations, in a no-deal scenario. As the UK is in the EU single market and customs union - which help trade between EU members by eliminating checks and tariffs (taxes on imports) - these businesses currently face no customs barriers at all. But in a no-deal scenario, the UK would immediately leave the EU with no withdrawal agreement. And that would include leaving the single market and customs union, so the way in which companies trade with the EU would change. The application period for the grants closed in May 2019. Of the Â£8m, an HMRC employee told Newsnight, Â£3m earmarked specifically for training customs brokers had been completely allocated. They did not say how much of the remaining Â£5m had been allocated. British Chambers of Commerce director of policy Mike Spicer said: ""Such a low number of firms applying for grant-funding is concerning and signals the need for much greater levels of awareness among affected firms to ensure they are prepared. ""Ultimately this is another example of why avoiding a messy and disorderly exit in October is so important."" Nicole Sykes, head of EU Negotiations at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said the government had failed to adequately publicise the scheme. ""Many small firms would bite the government's hand off to access funds to support no-deal preparation,"" she said. ""But if information about those funds is buried in a corner of a website, then take-up is going to be low."" HMRC, however, says the scheme was widely promoted through social media, emails to stakeholders and articles in bulletins for customs agents. Gove: EU 'refusing to negotiate' on Brexit What is 'no-deal Brexit'? UK firms 'not even close to ready' for no deal In June, Newsnight revealedless than a third of relevant companieshad so far applied for an economic operator and registration identification (EORI) number from HMRC. This is the most basic official authorisation that companies would need to continue trading with the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson's new government is reported to be planning a Â£100m public information campaign to prepare the country for a no-deal outcome. During the Conservative leadership campaign, Mr Johnson said a no-deal Brexit would be ""vanishingly inexpensive, if we prepare"". When the grant scheme was unveiled, the then Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride, said: ""I'm really pleased we are investing Â£8m to support the sector and help them expand their capacity as we prepare to leave the EU."" In a statement, HMRC said: ""HMRC has been preparing energetically for Brexit every day since the referendum. ""We will continue to remind and support businesses to prepare to leave the EU on 31 October 2019.""

"It is one of the biggest challenges for the NHS in all parts of the UK - ensuring there are enough nurses, doctors and other health staff to cope with rising patient demand in future years. With intensifying recruitment problems across the service,an important report on the future NHS workforce in England,externalhas been keenly anticipated for weeks. But a widely-expected launch last week was postponed at the last minute. Then a press release shortly before midnight on Sunday gave a few hours' notice for anyone still awake that the report would be released at 06:00 BST on Monday morning, on a day dominated by the arrival of the US president and preparations for the D-Day commemorations. Some groups representing staff received no advance notice. Burying bad news? It looks like that, although confusion across Whitehall had a lot to do with it. There is a leadership and policy vacuum during the interregnum before the arrival of a new prime minister. It is understood the Treasury has strong views on the cost of a workforce expansion plan. NHS turns to Mumsnet to fill nurse vacancies NHS 'no chance of training enough staff' Staff shortages 'abusing good will of nurses' How many doctors and nurses come from abroad? Seemingly the report was going backwards and forwards and so was delayed for several weeks. References to the current 40,000 level of nurse vacancies increasing to nearly 70,000 were removed according to well-placed sources. So after all that, what is in the report, prepared under the leadership of Baroness Dido Harding, chair of NHS Improvement? Drawn up with Julian Hartley, chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust, and other experienced NHS leaders, it is an interim publication -  in the autumn there will be another report after public spending plans for the next few years have been set out by the Treasury. The report argues that ""the most urgent challenge is the current shortage of nurses"". The shortage of nurses is viewed as the most pressing issue It says that around 5,700 extra hospital and community placements for student nurses are needed to start this autumn. This is for the front-line on-site training which is part of the three-year degree course. While the tuition fees to the universities are paid by students, the NHS has to fund the placements. There have been wrangles in the past over whether this should be covered from front-line NHS budgets or other areas of public spending. It is not clear from the report whether the Treasury has agreed to fund these training costs. But the report also has some blunt conclusions about the consequences of scrapping the state-funded bursaries in England and making the training of nurses subject to tuition fees. The theory was that the policy would encourage universities to expand places for nursing degrees. But the report says ""in parts of the country, some university intakes have been reduced significantly over the past two years"". It goes on to point out that ""applications for nursing and midwifery courses have fallen since the education funding reforms, with a 31% decrease between 2016 and 2018 ... the 50% decrease in applicants for learning disability nursing since 2016 is particularly concerning"". Encouraging nurses who have left the profession to return is another part of the strategy. This will involve a new marketing campaign, including via parenting chatroom and website Mumsnet, aimed at inspiring nurses to return to practice. International recruitment of nurses and doctors will be boosted ""significantly"" with better co-ordination of moves to find overseas staff by individual hospitals and other trusts. Workforce planning will be devolved to local health systems. The commitment to recruiting an extra 5,000 GPs is restated, although the original target of the year 2020 has been replaced by ""as soon as possible"". There is a pledge to ""better value and retain"" current doctors and then a commitment to ""take further immediate action to boost GP numbers"", although it is not clear what this will consist of beyond trying to attract experienced doctors back to the NHS. For its part, the government is trying to tackle one barrier to the retention of doctors. Some higher-paid consultants have received unexpected tax bills because of complex rules designed to limit the amount of tax relief for pension savings. Others say working extra hours to help reduce waiting lists or cover rota gaps can be taxed as much as the pay on offer. Ministers say they will now consult on proposals to allow doctors to halve their pension contributions in exchange for halving their rate of pension growth - under current rules there is no flexibility over the rate at which a pension builds up. The British Medical Association said it was a step in the right direction - but wider long-term reforms to pensions were still required. This interim report talks of ""laying the foundations"". When NHS England's long-term plan was published with great fanfare in January, it was stressed that detailed plans to develop a workforce to deliver the strategy would follow. We now have an outline of some of those plans. Later in the year, once the chancellor has announced how much money there is for future staff training, we will finally get the full story - hopefully.

"The UK and the European Union have agreed to continue talks to try to reach a deal on their future relationship Even though ""major unresolved topics"" remain, both sides said it was important discussions continued. Failure to reach an agreement by 31 December would result in a no-deal Brexit. It would mean significant differences in the way we live and work. Prices could go upfor the goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU. That's because the UK and EU would trade onWorld Trade Organization (WTO) terms- the basic rules for countries without trade deals. The EU would impose taxes (known as tariffs) on goods coming from the UK. The average is about 2.8% for non-agricultural products, but 10% for cars and more than 35% for dairy products. That would put some industries under pressure. With the UK alsoimposing tariffs on some EU goods,external- they could become more expensive. But the price of some things imported from the rest of the world could fall because their tariffs are being cut. Food standardsfor UK exports could also be a problem. Without agreement that UK rules are acceptable in the EU, produce being sold by the UK could be stopped at the border, causing delays. Long queues for lorriesare possible because there would bemore border checks. The UK is delaying having full checks for goods arriving from the EU until 1 July. But it is feared EU lorry drivers might want to avoid the UK altogether if there are long delays. Less choice of foodis a danger, according to some supermarket chains, who have said fresh food will be particularly affected. They might try to fly replacements in from elsewhere, but that would increase costs. Northern Irelandhas been the subject of separate talks on howan agreement to avoid a hard border would work. An agreement has been reached 'in principle', but a free trade deal would make new arrangements easier. But across the UK it's not just trade that would be affected by no deal, as further details were expected in other areas. Fishinghas beenparticularly importantduring the trade talks. Without a deal, non-UK fishing boats would lose access to UK waters and vice versa. It is feared there could be confrontations if boats try to continue to fish where they have traditionally done so. There are also concerns UK fish exports to the EU would be badly hit by tariffs. Co-operation on security and data-sharingwould become much more difficult, causing problems for cross-border investigations. The UK would immediately lose access to databases of things like fingerprints, criminal records and wanted persons. There arebig questions about services. The UK has been waiting for a decision about whether the EU will recognise UK rules for financial services. Without that it will be more difficult for UK firms to operate in the EU. Some banks have already moved offices and staff to EU countries. The supply of medicines could be vulnerableto disruption at Channel ports, with particular worries about those with a short shelf life. There are plans in placeto ensure coronavirus vaccines reach the UK. Talks separate to the main trade deal were also being worked on. They cover areas including: Healthcare:The government is in talks for a healthcare arrangement thatwould replace EHIC, which helps people in need of treatment in EU countries. Education:It was also in talks about the possibility of continuing to participate inErasmus, which helps students study in other countries. Driving:Talks are still going on about whether UK nationalswill need International Driving Permitsfor short visits to EU countries. And the European Commission is understood to be considering whether green cards to prove people have valid insurance are required. Pensions:There has not yet been an agreement for peopleclaiming their UK state pensions in an EU countrythat would mean their pensions increase every year. If the UK gets to the end of the year without a trade deal with the EU, that does not mean there will never be one. It has been suggested all the problems it would cause would focus minds on reaching a deal as soon as possible. But there are those on both sides who say it could be many months into 2021 before talks were to resume in this scenario. Whether or not there is a trade deal, several things will change on 1 January. Fortrips to Europe, you'll have to make sure there is at least six months left on your passport and wait in a different queue at the border. Duty free shoppingwill return, but there will be limits on the amount of alcohol and tobacco you can bring into the UK from the EU without paying extra duty. The right to live and work in the EUwill no longer be automatic for UK nationals, unless they already live in an EU country by the end of 2020. A new immigration systemwill come into force in the UK, involvinga points-based systemfor people wanting to work. Trade with the EUfor UK companies will involve customs declarations, extra border checks, certificates, licences and special labelling for some types of foods, plants and live animals. Correction 8 December: A previous version of this story said UK nationals would not need International Driving Permits in EU countries from 1 January next year.

"This video can not be played MPs talk about the level of abuse and threats they receive both online and offline MPs have told the BBC about the threats and abuse they face, including being sent pictures of decapitated bodies, being surreptitiously filmed and having dog mess smeared on their door. SNP MP Dr Lisa Cameron said she had put in place extra security so her children could play safely in her garden. Conservative Scott Mann said someone threatened to nail bomb his office. The Commons Deputy Speaker said some MPs had told him they would not run for office again because of safety fears. The BBC carried out a survey of MPs in writing and by phone between May and July this year. Out of a total of 650, 172 responded. Of those, 139 said either they or their staff had faced abuse in the past year. More than 60% (108) of those who replied said they had been in contact with the police about threats in the last 12 months. Separate analysis carried out by academics at the University of Sheffield for BBC News looked at levels of abuse directed at MPs on Twitter. Key findings included: Levels of abuse fluctuate over time, with spikes driven by events - for example,the death of IS bride Shamima Begum's babyor key events in the Brexit negotiations Labour MP David Lammy has received the most abuse of any MP on Twitter so far this year On average, male MPs attract significantly more abuse than female ones Conservative MPs, on average, attract significantly more abuse than Labour ones Sexist abuse is the most prevalent, as compared with homophobia or racism MPs from across the House of Commons and with differing views on issues like Brexit told the BBC about threats they had experienced. Dr Cameron said as soon as she was elected in 2015 she started to receive death threats and pictures of decapitated bodies. On the advice of police, she cordoned off part of her garden so that her children had somewhere safe to play with increased security. ""It makes you wonder whether you've put your family inadvertently at risk as a result of your choices,"" she said. Earlier this year, she secured a four-year non-harassment order against a constituent who branded her a child abuser on Twitter. Intimidation of MPs 'worsening' Threats have got to stop, says Soubry Facebook and Twitter grilled over abuse of MPs Speaking about a nail bomb threat made to his office, Mr Mann told the BBC: ""In any other profession, an HR team would be in complete meltdown with some of this stuff."" Liberal Democrat Tom Brake said he had to have people removed from his constituency office. Another Conservative, Bob Blackman, whose constituency office was the target of arson, said he had enhanced security around his home because of attacks on his car. Others reported being surreptitiously filmed in the supermarket and having dog mess left on their door. The SNP's Lisa Cameron said she feared for her children's safety In May, 23-year-oldJack Renshaw was jailed for life for planning to murder Labour MP Rosie Cooper. The judge at the Old Bailey said the neo-Nazi had wanted to ""replicate"" the murder of MP Jo Cox, who was stabbed to death in June 2016. Many MPs told the BBC they expected to receive abuse but were concerned about its impact on their staff and family. ""I've had staff members resign because of the pressure of such threats,"" the Labour MP John Mann said. He said his wife and daughter had both been threatened with rape. ""The systems are not coherent, police coordination is not coherent. It should be one specialised unit who deals with it, not multiple police forces across the country,"" he added. Jack Renshaw was jailed for life earlier this year for planning to murder an MP In May, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dicktold a Commons committee threats to MPs were at ""unprecedented levels"", with the number of crimes reported more than doubling in 2018 - from 151 to 342. Met Police Commander Adrian Usher, who leads policing at the Palace of Westminster, called it a ""dramatic rise"" and said there was ""no doubt"" that since the middle of 2018 ""we have seen a more febrile atmosphere in political debate"". Lord Evans, who chairs of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said the survey demonstrated there was ""an urgent and serious problem with intimidation and abuse... and it's getting worse"". Although the police response had improved, he said, it was ""patchy"" and needed to be ""centrally co-ordinated as a national threat"". Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi said: ""When all they say is 'you're a traitor and you shouldn't have a British passport,' or 'you're an ISIS sympathiser and you should be sent back to whichever Muslim country so you can be raped and abused,' I do think that you can't then engage with these people."" She called on social media companies to spend more on monitoring as the University of Sheffield researchers said abuse appeared to be reaching new levels of intensity. The team from the Department of Computer Science studied the replies MPs received to their tweets in the first half of this year. They found the proportion of abusive replies increased significantly month on month, and by June, just under 4% of all replies were abusive in nature. ""We've not seen that kind of figure before,"" said Prof Kalina Bontcheva, who led the team. She added that the top 10 most targeted MPs received almost half of all abuse. David Lammy told BBC News: ""I will not compromise what I say in public life and let the bullies win. ""But it saddens me greatly that this is a growing stain on our national democracy. It needs to be challenged and it needs to be dealt with."" Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle said the BBC's findings were the ""tip of the iceberg"". He said complaints he received from MPs in his capacity as chair of the Consultative Panel on Parliament Security reached the same level in the first six weeks of 2019 as they used to see in a year. ""When MPs turn around to me and say 'I'm not going to stand again, I don't feel safe, I don't need this,' we're in danger of losing democracy in this country,"" he added.

"The project to build a new children's hospital in Edinburgh will cost a further Â£90m. A new Audit Scotland report shows that Â£80m has been spent on ""enabling and equipment works"" at the site - beyond the deal with consortium IHSL. A further Â£11.6m was given to IHSL to end a contract dispute over construction standards at the hospital. The extra costs mean the lifetime price tag of the new hospital could be more than Â£520m. NHS Lothian pulled the plug on the opening of the hospital in July andfears have been raised over its future. Theannual audit report for NHS Lothian,external- finished before the hospital's opening was indefinitely delayed - also reveals that the health board is facing a ""financial gap"" of Â£25.9m this year with a shortfall in excess of Â£80m projected by 2021/22, according to figures supplied by NHS Lothian. Health secretary Jeane Freeman has saidwork to establish the extent of problems with ventilation and drainage at the unused hospital is ""on track""and has ordered a number of inquiries into the situation. The Royal Hospital for Sick Children had been due to open in autumn 2017 But Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Monica Lennon said: ""The government has clearly known for some time about the serious issues around governance and problems with the progress of the contract for the new Sick Kids hospital Edinburgh. ""With the publication of today's report, it begs the questions of why the health secretary hasn't previously mentioned it and how the situation has been allowed to progress to this stage. ""Concerns raised by trade union officials that the new Edinburgh Sick Kids could be ripped down before it even opens are unthinkable, and a public inquiry must get under way."" Miles Briggs, the Scottish Conservatives health spokesman, said it was a ""jaw-dropping report which reinforces the SNP government's responsibility for the shambolic mess that has become the new Sick Kids hospital"". He added: ""Both the SNP and Lothian Health Board signed off the contract that led to the failed dispute resolution and another Â£11.6m cost to the taxpayer. ""Beyond the financial mismanagement, the health board must reassure the public that its significant concerns about public, patient and staff safety have been resolved. ""The fact is that the SNP has made a series of astonishingly-expensive mistakes and children are still being treated in a facility that is well past its sell by date."" The corridors of the new hospital will remain empty for some time The new children's hospital cost about Â£150m to build, but its full price tag over the next 25 years, including maintenance and facilities management fees, will be Â£432m. In 2017, a dispute between NHS Lothian and IHSL began over standards of construction in relation to drainage, heater batteries, and void fire detectors. The Audit Scotland report states that the health board felt ""the issues experienced were materially non-compliant with the original specifications"" but a planned legal challenge against the construction consortium was dropped in favour of paying IHSL Â£11.6m to settle the outstanding issues - a move approved by the Scottish government. NHS Lothian then took possession of the site from IHSL in February after it was signed off by an independent certifier and the monthlyrepayments - which would average about Â£1.4m a month - began in Februaryunder the Non-Profit Distributing (NPD) system, the Scottish government's version of controversial private financing models such as PFI. Last month, afull safety review into the delayed Sick Children's Hospitalwas ordered by the Scottish government. It also announced private consultants KPMG had been hired to establish the factors that led to the last-minute delay. Caroline Gardner, Auditor General for Scotland, said: ""We have continued to monitor events since the annual audit report was issued and will be taking a close interest in the NHS safety review's findings and KPMG's report on the governance of the project."" NHS Lothian's 2019/20 operational plan, drawn up before the latest delay to the new children's hospital, outlines a financial gap of Â£25.9m but projections for subsequent years predict a shortfall of more than three times as much. Audit Scotland points out that the gap is ""largely in line"" with the three previous years where the board has reached a break-even position, but it points out this was ""thanks to an increasing reliance on one-off savings"". The report concludes that ""at this stage, there are no clear plans to close the financial gap on a recurring basis"". Susan Goldsmith, finance director at NHS Lothian, said the board welcomed the report. ""It [the report] reviewed the settlement agreement between NHSL and IHSL and considered the project governance and value for money,"" she said. ""The report highlights that NHS Lothian provided evidence of detailed evaluation of the qualitative and quantitative options available to it before proceeding with the settlement. ""It also shows that the board sought technical advice and expertise throughout the project to ensure the safety of patients, staff and visitors remained the priority throughout.""

"The ruling said McDonald's had not proved genuine use of the ""Mc"" prefix as a burger or a restaurant name McDonald's has lost its exclusive claim to the ""Mc"" trademark on some of its food products within the EU after a dispute with an Irish fast food chain. Supermac's, which owns more than 100 fast food restaurants in Ireland, complained to the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO). The EUIPO ruled McDonald's had not proved genuine use of the ""Mc"" prefix on some of the products it trademarked. It isSupermac's second partial victory this year in the EU branding dispute. However, the EUIPO upheld McDonald's right to own the ""Mc"" trademark on chicken nuggets and some of its sandwich products. The ruling also stated that as both firms had succeeded in some parts of the case and failed on others, each party must pay its own costs. Supermac's was founded by Galway businessman Pat McDonagh in 1978 and is now the largest Irish-owned fast food restaurant firm in the Republic of Ireland. Pat McDonagh is the founder and managing director of Supermac's Mr McDonagh, who previously referred to his global fast food rival as ""McBully,"" said the latest ruling was a ""victory for small businesses"". ""The Mc is back,"" he declared in a company statement. ""McDonald's tried to argue that because they had some products that started with Mc, that the term Mc was so synonymous with them, that they had the right to own and trademark Mc,"" he added. ""We are delighted that the EUIPO found in our favour and that we can now say that we have rid Europe of the McDonald's self-styled monopoly of the term Mc."" However, a statement from McDonald's pointed out that the EUIPO ruling had reinforced its ownership of the Mc trademark on a selection of its fast food products. ""The EUIPO upheld McDonald's EU registration for the trademark ""Mc"" standing alone for certain core menu items which McDonald's uses in connection with its famous family of Mc-prefixed trademarks,"" the US firm's statement said. ""This decision does not impact McDonald's ability to use its Mc-prefixed trademarks or other trademarks throughout Europe and the world, and McDonald's will continue to enforce its rights."" Supermac's took the case after a branding dispute halted the Irish company's attempts to expand its restaurant chain into the UK and Europe. McDonald's had won an earlier battle over the similarity between the name Supermac's and the Big Mac. Supermac's then asked the EUIPO to rule on the issue and the Irish firm won a partial victory in January 2019. The Galway-based firm runs more than 100 fast food restaurants in Ireland At that time, the EUIPO ruled that McDonald's had not proved genuine use of the trademarked term ""Big Mac"" as a burger or restaurant name. The latest EUIPO ruling revokes McDonald's automatic trademark rights to the use of the term ""Mc"" on a long list of food products, drinks and restaurant services within the EU. However, the EU body upheld the US firm's right to own the ""Mc"" trademark on chicken nuggets and a range of its sandwich products including meat, fish, pork and chicken sandwiches. McDonald's had argued that due to its long and continuous use of the 'Mc' term, the trademark had become widely and exclusively associated with McDonald's by EU consumers. The US firm also pointed to several earlier decisions in its favour issued by courts and trade mark offices throughout Europe. But Supermac's argued that 'Mc' was a ""very common prefix for surnames throughout Ireland, the United Kingdom and elsewhere throughout the European Union"". It pointed out that there were a huge number of pubs, hotels, restaurants, and food products which contain the prefix 'Mc' as part of a surname. The Irish firm claimed that McDonald's had never used the prefix 'Mc' in a standalone sense, but only in combination with other words to brand their products. ""It is not a 'Mc' chicken sandwich, it is a 'McChicken' sandwich,"" the document states. The EUIPO agreed with Supermac's that there was no evidence of use of the contested trademark 'Mc' alone, but ""only accompanied by further elements"".

"This video can not be played MPs talk about the level of abuse and threats they receive both online and offline MPs have told the BBC about the threats and abuse they face, including being sent pictures of decapitated bodies, being surreptitiously filmed and having dog mess smeared on their door. SNP MP Dr Lisa Cameron said she had put in place extra security so her children could play safely in her garden. Conservative Scott Mann said someone threatened to nail bomb his office. The Commons Deputy Speaker said some MPs had told him they would not run for office again because of safety fears. The BBC carried out a survey of MPs in writing and by phone between May and July this year. Out of a total of 650, 172 responded. Of those, 139 said either they or their staff had faced abuse in the past year. More than 60% (108) of those who replied said they had been in contact with the police about threats in the last 12 months. Separate analysis carried out by academics at the University of Sheffield for BBC News looked at levels of abuse directed at MPs on Twitter. Key findings included: Levels of abuse fluctuate over time, with spikes driven by events - for example,the death of IS bride Shamima Begum's babyor key events in the Brexit negotiations Labour MP David Lammy has received the most abuse of any MP on Twitter so far this year On average, male MPs attract significantly more abuse than female ones Conservative MPs, on average, attract significantly more abuse than Labour ones Sexist abuse is the most prevalent, as compared with homophobia or racism MPs from across the House of Commons and with differing views on issues like Brexit told the BBC about threats they had experienced. Dr Cameron said as soon as she was elected in 2015 she started to receive death threats and pictures of decapitated bodies. On the advice of police, she cordoned off part of her garden so that her children had somewhere safe to play with increased security. ""It makes you wonder whether you've put your family inadvertently at risk as a result of your choices,"" she said. Earlier this year, she secured a four-year non-harassment order against a constituent who branded her a child abuser on Twitter. Intimidation of MPs 'worsening' Threats have got to stop, says Soubry Facebook and Twitter grilled over abuse of MPs Speaking about a nail bomb threat made to his office, Mr Mann told the BBC: ""In any other profession, an HR team would be in complete meltdown with some of this stuff."" Liberal Democrat Tom Brake said he had to have people removed from his constituency office. Another Conservative, Bob Blackman, whose constituency office was the target of arson, said he had enhanced security around his home because of attacks on his car. Others reported being surreptitiously filmed in the supermarket and having dog mess left on their door. The SNP's Lisa Cameron said she feared for her children's safety In May, 23-year-oldJack Renshaw was jailed for life for planning to murder Labour MP Rosie Cooper. The judge at the Old Bailey said the neo-Nazi had wanted to ""replicate"" the murder of MP Jo Cox, who was stabbed to death in June 2016. Many MPs told the BBC they expected to receive abuse but were concerned about its impact on their staff and family. ""I've had staff members resign because of the pressure of such threats,"" the Labour MP John Mann said. He said his wife and daughter had both been threatened with rape. ""The systems are not coherent, police coordination is not coherent. It should be one specialised unit who deals with it, not multiple police forces across the country,"" he added. Jack Renshaw was jailed for life earlier this year for planning to murder an MP In May, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dicktold a Commons committee threats to MPs were at ""unprecedented levels"", with the number of crimes reported more than doubling in 2018 - from 151 to 342. Met Police Commander Adrian Usher, who leads policing at the Palace of Westminster, called it a ""dramatic rise"" and said there was ""no doubt"" that since the middle of 2018 ""we have seen a more febrile atmosphere in political debate"". Lord Evans, who chairs of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said the survey demonstrated there was ""an urgent and serious problem with intimidation and abuse... and it's getting worse"". Although the police response had improved, he said, it was ""patchy"" and needed to be ""centrally co-ordinated as a national threat"". Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi said: ""When all they say is 'you're a traitor and you shouldn't have a British passport,' or 'you're an ISIS sympathiser and you should be sent back to whichever Muslim country so you can be raped and abused,' I do think that you can't then engage with these people."" She called on social media companies to spend more on monitoring as the University of Sheffield researchers said abuse appeared to be reaching new levels of intensity. The team from the Department of Computer Science studied the replies MPs received to their tweets in the first half of this year. They found the proportion of abusive replies increased significantly month on month, and by June, just under 4% of all replies were abusive in nature. ""We've not seen that kind of figure before,"" said Prof Kalina Bontcheva, who led the team. She added that the top 10 most targeted MPs received almost half of all abuse. David Lammy told BBC News: ""I will not compromise what I say in public life and let the bullies win. ""But it saddens me greatly that this is a growing stain on our national democracy. It needs to be challenged and it needs to be dealt with."" Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons Sir Lindsay Hoyle said the BBC's findings were the ""tip of the iceberg"". He said complaints he received from MPs in his capacity as chair of the Consultative Panel on Parliament Security reached the same level in the first six weeks of 2019 as they used to see in a year. ""When MPs turn around to me and say 'I'm not going to stand again, I don't feel safe, I don't need this,' we're in danger of losing democracy in this country,"" he added.

"An estimated 240,000 UK businesses trade with the EU Government funding to help UK companies cope with a possible no-deal Brexit customs system has had a ""concerningly low"" take-up, BBC News has learned. In December, the Treasury and Revenue & Customs unveiled an Â£8m training fund companies and trade intermediaries such as freight forwarders could apply to. BBC Newsnight has learned that just 741 companies have applied for the grants. HMRC says it is doing ""everything we can to help businesses get ready for leaving the EU"". An estimated 240,000 UK businesses currently trade with the EU. Many of these would be expected to need training if the customs system changed. The government funding aims to support employee training and IT improvements to complete customs declarations, in a no-deal scenario. As the UK is in the EU single market and customs union - which help trade between EU members by eliminating checks and tariffs (taxes on imports) - these businesses currently face no customs barriers at all. But in a no-deal scenario, the UK would immediately leave the EU with no withdrawal agreement. And that would include leaving the single market and customs union, so the way in which companies trade with the EU would change. The application period for the grants closed in May 2019. Of the Â£8m, an HMRC employee told Newsnight, Â£3m earmarked specifically for training customs brokers had been completely allocated. They did not say how much of the remaining Â£5m had been allocated. British Chambers of Commerce director of policy Mike Spicer said: ""Such a low number of firms applying for grant-funding is concerning and signals the need for much greater levels of awareness among affected firms to ensure they are prepared. ""Ultimately this is another example of why avoiding a messy and disorderly exit in October is so important."" Nicole Sykes, head of EU Negotiations at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), said the government had failed to adequately publicise the scheme. ""Many small firms would bite the government's hand off to access funds to support no-deal preparation,"" she said. ""But if information about those funds is buried in a corner of a website, then take-up is going to be low."" HMRC, however, says the scheme was widely promoted through social media, emails to stakeholders and articles in bulletins for customs agents. Gove: EU 'refusing to negotiate' on Brexit What is 'no-deal Brexit'? UK firms 'not even close to ready' for no deal In June, Newsnight revealedless than a third of relevant companieshad so far applied for an economic operator and registration identification (EORI) number from HMRC. This is the most basic official authorisation that companies would need to continue trading with the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson's new government is reported to be planning a Â£100m public information campaign to prepare the country for a no-deal outcome. During the Conservative leadership campaign, Mr Johnson said a no-deal Brexit would be ""vanishingly inexpensive, if we prepare"". When the grant scheme was unveiled, the then Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride, said: ""I'm really pleased we are investing Â£8m to support the sector and help them expand their capacity as we prepare to leave the EU."" In a statement, HMRC said: ""HMRC has been preparing energetically for Brexit every day since the referendum. ""We will continue to remind and support businesses to prepare to leave the EU on 31 October 2019.""

"Harland and Wolff has entered administration, with accountancy firm BDO formally appointed to oversee the Belfast shipyard. Having employed more than 30,000 at its peak, the move could now put 120 jobs at risk and spell the end of the iconic firm, best known for building the Titanic. Unions representing workers have called for the shipyard to be renationalised. They argue it would be cheaper for the government to keep the shipyard open. However, the government has said the crisis is ""ultimately a commercial issue"". Shipyard crisis 'a commercial issue' Council calls for support for Harland and Wolff Administrators appointed to Harland and Wolff The troubled history of Belfast's shipyard The Northern Ireland Office said NI Secretary Julian Smith ""understands the impact"" uncertainty over the shipyard will have for workers and their families. It said Mr Smith ""had made it clear that he will continue to do everything he can to secure the future of this historic site and ensure workers' interests are protected"". A spokesperson for BDO said: ""The team at BDO have engaged immediately with Harland and Wolff employees and other stakeholders to take all necessary steps to ensure they are supported throughout the administration process."" A week ago, workers took control of the site and established a rota to ensure their protest continued around the clock. On Monday, union sources said staff were given redundancy notices saying the business would cease trading in the evening. This video can not be played The history of the Belfast shipyard The workers, though, said they would continue their protest. ""These workers are saying 'we're staying in until we win'. This occupation will continue,"" said Susan Fitzgerald of trade union Unite. ""There's huge interest in this yard, but the real interest needs to be coming from Boris Johnson."" Speaking to BBC'sGood Morning Ulster, Michael Mulholland from GMB Union outlined a plan for the yard's survival. It involves administrators giving the workers and unions a period of time to find a buyer for the shipyard that will protect jobs. Asked if the proposal had a precedent, Mr Mulholland said: ""I'm not aware of any precedent but we are in dire times. ""If it needs a creative outlook, the trade unions are prepared to do that and we only hope that government and administrators will come along on that journey with us."" After the administration announcement, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster said she and the party's East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson had met GMB and Unite. She said they had a ""shared vision"" for the yard. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would have nationalised the shipyard and he accused the government of betraying the workers. Mr McDonnell, who visited Harland and Wolff staff in Belfast on Monday, said the shipyard has the potential for future work.

"Karen Millen is being sold by its current owner More than 1,000 jobs could be at risk after fashion firm Boohoo bought the online business of UK brands Karen Millen and Coast for Â£18.2m. Boohoo, an online-only retailer, said acquiring the website operations of the two brands ""would represent highly complementary additions"".

"Matt Hancock says he has changed his mind because ""the facts have changed"" Parliament can no longer block a no-deal Brexit, the health secretary has said. During his bid for the Tory leadership, Matt Hancocksaid no deal was ""not an available choice"",externalto the next PM, as MPs ""will never allow it to happen"". He told the BBC he had now changed his mind because they had a chance to block it in a series of votes last month, but failed to muster the numbers. Jeremy Corbyn said Labour would do all it could to stop no deal. But Downing Street insisted the UK would be leaving on 31 October ""whatever the circumstances"", whether a deal had been agreed with the EU or not. ""Politicians cannot choose which votes to respect. They promised to respect the referendum result and we must do,"" No 10 said. Asked whether Mr Johnson would respect the outcome of votes in Parliament - including a vote of no confidence in his government - the spokesman refused to be drawn, calling it a ""hypothetical"" question. MPs have repeatedly rejected the agreement Theresa May reached with Brussels, but have so far failed to coalesce around an alternative. In a no-deal scenario, the UK would immediately leave the EU with no agreement about the ""divorce"" process, overnight exiting the single market and customs union - arrangements designed to help facilitate trade. Opponents say it would damage the economy and lead to border posts between Northern Ireland and the Republic - but other politicians argue any disruption could be quickly overcome. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Extra Â£2.1bn for no-deal Brexit planning 10 ways a no-deal Brexit could affect you On 12 June, the Commons rejected a motion tabled by Jeremy Corbyn, which would have allowed MPs to take control of the parliamentary timetable in the autumn to stop no deal going through. Mr Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was that vote which prompted him to change his mind. ""I thought that would go through and in fact, the government won by 11,"" he said. ""I now don't think it can (stop no-deal). I thought that it could and the votes went differently to what I anticipated. When the facts change, sometimes even as a politician you have to change your mind."" Mr Hancock's comments echo a warning reportedly made by the prime minister's senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, that MPs have left it too late to stop no deal. But Dominic Grieve, one of the most prominent pro-European Conservative MPs,told the BBC Mr Cummings was a ""master of misinformation"", and there were a number of options still left for MPs wanting to block no deal. They include bringing down the government, via a vote of no confidence, and setting up a new government in its place, he said. If Mr Johnson loses a vote of no confidence and it becomes clear that another potential prime minister could command the confidence of the Commons, the convention is that he would be obliged to resign. However, Catherine Haddon, from the Institute for Government think tank, said this was ""untested territory"", adding: ""He could say: 'No, I'm staying as prime minister and we're having a general election.'"" The date of an election is set by royal proclamation on the advice of the prime minister, so he could choose a date after 31 October and press on with Brexit in the meantime. Speaking on a visit to Whaley Bridge to seeefforts being made to shore up a damaged dam,Mr Corbyn said Labour would ""do everything to stop no deal, including a no confidence vote at the appropriate, very early, time to do it"". He said Mr Johnson appeared to be ""trying to slip no deal through, slip past Parliament and slip past the British people"", and that was ""not acceptable"".

"This video can not be played 'Co-housing let people have something they couldn't otherwise afford' You may share a cup of sugar with your neighbours, or take a parcel for them. But what about cooking with them regularly or sharing your garden? Co-housing is where private homes cluster around communal facilities such as a kitchen, dining room or garden. It is popular in Denmark and Sweden, but accounts for less than 0.5% of Welsh homes. But this could soon change as Powys council and the Wales Co-Operative Centre have hired the country's first cohousing officer Rachael Marshall lives in a co-house in Llanidloes, Powys, called Dol-llys, with her two sons and nine other people. She said: ""I knew it had a huge amount of land which we all share as part of living there, so that was a big draw. ""Everybody who lives here is incredible and we get on so well... I can't imagine living without them now. ""Obviously people come and go but there's a sense of community here you don't always get living on an average street."" Five housing cost surprises explained Soaring second home ownership hits young people Billionaire buys New York apartment for $238m Co-houses are owned by cooperative groups, with members buying shares rather than individual properties, which they can then sell if they want to move on. Treasurer of Dol-llys's co-operative Phil Callaghan said: ""We're pretty much close to owner occupation. ""The difference is we are also a management company so we look after the insurance, the maintenance and take decisions on the building. ""In practice we all have our own front door and go about our private business as you would in any other situation. ""But at least once a month we have a meeting and we'll talk about what needs to be done and where we are with the finances."" Rachael Marshall lives in a co-house with her two sons and nine other people While co-housing can offer a practical alternative to private home ownership or social housing, for others it can be about living with like-minded people. Siobhan Riordan and Francesca Casini set up Silver Cohousing earlier this year, with the intention of building a sustainable community in Powys which will be about 50% women over 50. ""Most of us are single women without family we can rely on, so the best way to secure the kind of housing and care we want in the future was to form a housing co-operative,"" Ms Riordan said. ""That's the legal structure that enables us to buy land, to buy houses and to realise the vision that we have about how we want to live as a community that is sustainable."" Ms Casini added: ""To be in a community with like-hearted people who are similar age and with a similar ethos will be a treasure."" Mal Shears - who moved moved into Dol-llys with his wife Cath Boswell two years ago - said it ""doesn't work if you always want your own way"" According to research by the Wales Co-Operative Centre, people who live in community-led housing said they felt happier, less isolated and had learned new skills. Powys's new cohousing officer Allan Shepherd said: ""It's about changing mindsets and thinking how we might live in a different way. ""I live in a co-operative - I used to own my own house but I lived alone and I felt socially isolated. ""I've got a lot of wellbeing from living in a housing co-operative but people don't necessarily understand that these other types of housing are available."" Mal Shears moved into Dol-lys with his wife, Cath Boswell, two years ago. He said: ""You have to be able to negotiate with other people and provided you can do that there there are benefits that come with it."" Ms Boswell added: ""The whole is more than the sum of the parts. You have more space and a better quality of surroundings and life than living on your own."" Where can I afford to live?

"Boris Johnson is meeting Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas in Downing Street The government has rejected claims it is unwilling to negotiate with the EU and wants talks to fail to allow a no-deal Brexit. It comes after the EU said UK demands to remove the Irish backstop from Theresa May's deal were unacceptable. EU negotiators told European diplomats there was currently no basis for ""meaningful discussions"" and talks were back where they were three years ago. Downing Street said the EU needed to ""change its stance"". The European Commission said on Tuesday morning it was willing to hold talks in the coming weeks by phone or in person, ""should the UK wish to clarify its position in more detail"". A spokeswoman added the agreement negotiated by Mrs May - rejected three times by MPs - was the ""best possible deal"", and could not be re-opened. Many opponents of Mrs May's deal cite concerns over the backstop - aninsurance policyto prevent a hard border returning on the island of Ireland - which if implemented, would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also involve a temporary single customs territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. A No 10 spokesperson said: ""The prime minister wants to meet EU leaders and negotiate a new deal - one that abolishes the anti-democratic backstop. ""We will throw ourselves into the negotiations with the greatest energy and the spirit of friendship and we hope the EU will rethink its current refusal to make any changes to the withdrawal agreement."" New Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged to leave the EU by the deadline of 31 October, with or without a deal. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Extra Â£2.1bn for no-deal Brexit planning 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Is it too late to hold an election before Brexit? BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the meeting on Sunday between officials and diplomats was a debrief from discussions last week between the EU, UK Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and Mr Johnson's European envoy, David Frost. A senior EU diplomat told the meeting a no-deal Brexit appeared to be the UK government's ""central scenario"", according to theDaily Telegraph,externaland theGuardian,external. ""It was clear UK does not have another plan. No intention to negotiate, which would require a plan,"" the diplomat is reported to have said. Mr Frost reiterated the prime minister's stance that thebackstop elementof Mrs May's plan must be abolished, and stressed that Mr Johnson's new ministers were not bound by commitments made by the previous government. He also raised concerns about the UK's ""divorce bill"" and the proposed role of the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, after Brexit. Further talks between the two sides have not been ruled out, and Adam Fleming said the G7 summit in France at the end of August could be the moment of truth - the point at which a no-deal Brexit becomes inevitable. Meanwhile, Mr Johnson is meeting his first foreign leader since entering Downing Street - Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas. The country's Foreign Minister, Urmas Reinsalu, said earlier that while the ""reality"" was the withdrawal agreement - including the backstop - had been jointly agreed by EU member states, there was still a need for continued dialogue in the coming weeks to avoid a no-deal Brexit. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme alternatives to the backstop could be discussed after the ratification of the withdrawal deal. The EU is not optimistic about any agreement with the UK. The message they are getting from Boris Johnson's team is that the UK is not going to sign another deal unless it involves getting rid of the backstop. But the EU has been clear time and time again that it isn't going to do that - the backstop is an integral part of any withdrawal agreement and it has to stay. So the conclusion of officials is there is no reason to get back round the table at the moment, for the simple reason that they don't think they can meet the conditions Boris Johnson has set. There are a couple of months to try to eke something out from one of the sides - to see if somebody blinks and there is some room for negotiation either in Brussels or in London. But at the moment, many people think the direction of travel is heading towards a no-deal Brexit. The meeting followsan interview with Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who said he believed Parliament could no longer block the UK from leaving the EU without a deal. In a no-deal scenario, the UK would immediately leave the EU with no agreement about the ""divorce"" process, and would exit overnight from the single market and customs union. Opponents say a no-deal exit would damage the economy and lead to border posts between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Other politicians argue any disruption could be quickly overcome. Prominent pro-EU Conservative Dominic Grieve has insisted there are still a number of options available to MPs to block a no deal - including bringing down the government with a vote of no confidence. He told BBC Radio 5Live the idea that Mr Johnson might refuse to resign even if he lost such a vote and another PM secured the confidence of the Commons was ""breathtaking, stupid, infantile, and it won't work"". ""Quite frankly, I'm astonished to hear these suggestions coming out,"" he added. The foreign secretary is visiting Canada, the US and Mexico this week Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will begin a tour of North America on Tuesday as part of a bid to ""fire up"" the UK's trade relationships with countries outside the EU. Mr Raab said the foreign ministers he saw at a meeting of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Thailand last week expressed a ""consistent warmth"" for the UK and a ""desire to work more closely with us"". However, the former US treasury secretary, Larry Summers, said the UK was ""delusional"" if it believed it could secure a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Britain has no leverage, Britain is desperate... it needs an agreement very soon. When you have a desperate partner, that's when you strike the hardest bargain.""

"Scotland has replaced London as the fastest place for a seller to find a buyer for their home, figures suggest. In 2014, it took 36 days in London on average to secure a buyer, but this rose to 60 days by last year, according to property portal Rightmove. In contrast, the average time to secure a buyer fell from 66 days to 41 days over the same period in Scotland. The figures, compiled for the BBC, show that the market for flats has slowed amid debate over leasehold rules. Various surveys have shown that the property market has slowed in London and the South East of England in recent years, with prices falling particularly in London. House prices on average across the UK are still rising slightly, but there has been asignificant drop in London. The latest figures, based on Rightmove data, show that the time taken between initially marketing a home and an estate agent finding a buyer has been rising in the region, returning to the 60-day average in London last seen in 2011. ""Whilst it would be easy to link that with the Brexit vote, there are other factors at play, especially increasingly stretched buyer affordability,"" said Miles Shipside, Rightmove's housing market analyst. One of those factors is the increasing amount of time taken by the sellers of flats to find a buyer in England and Wales. Changes in taxation have led to a drop in the demand from buy-to-let investors, many of whom had built up a portfolio of apartments. Another theory is that the Bank of Mum and Dad has helped some first-time buyers to move straight into houses, instead of flats, with the added attraction of some outside space and their own front door. Thedebate over leaseholds, which are more common among flats, may also be significant. It may also explain the difference with Scotland, where so-called hidden costs are far less of an issue and where the time to find a buyer of any type of property has been falling. Kate Faulkner, housing analyst and managing director of Propertychecklists.co.uk, said that sellers needed to be well prepared if they wanted a swift sale of a flat. She suggested: Making sure sellers are clear with potential buyers about the time remaining on the lease, service charges and ground rent Ensuring paperwork preparations are made for the leasehold management pack, which can cost money and take time to complete Using solicitors who are well-versed in the rules and information needed when a leasehold property is sold. Sellers of older flats were also in competition with a host of new-build developments, which might include access to restaurants and gyms, she added. She suggested being realistic when setting a price, considering throwing the property open to offers over a certain price, and showing off the space available inside the flat. ""De-clutter and de-personalise as much as possible. Show off the space and give people a blank canvas to imagine living there,"" she said. Flats out of fashion with first-time buyers 'We've been caught in a leasehold trap' Letting fees ban: Renters confused after change in law Once a buyer has been secured, the legal process and the checks required by mortgage lenders have become stricter and taken longer since the financial crisis. Greater regulation has slowed these down for many people. As a result, Mr Shipside, of Rightmove, said that buyers looking for a property now might be over-optimistic if they expected to celebrate Christmas in their new home in England or Wales. ""This is most noticeable for those buying flats, where conveyancing times have increased from 100 days in 2011 to 123 days in 2018 in England and Wales,"" he said. ""That means those buyers who have an offer accepted on a flat this month may not complete until the end of the year, especially if they'll be getting a mortgage.""

"Victoria Smith died last July, before a tribunal overturned the decision to stop her benefit Benefit-assessment company Capita is going to court to try to reverse the ""reputational damage"" it says it suffered after a claimant died. Victoria Smith died months after her personal independence payments were stopped following a Capita assessment. The outsourcing company was ordered to pay Â£10,000 in damages over its handling of her disability claim. It was found to have made incorrect statements but wants the county court verdict set aside and the case reheard. The company conducts health assessments for personal independence payments (PIP), the main disability benefit, on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions. While the decision over whether someone receives the benefit is made by a DWP official, Capita's assessment of how a person's disability affects their life is a crucial part of the process. A Capita healthcare assistant came to assess Ms Smith in March 2018. The 33-year-old, from Market Drayton, in Shropshire, suffered from agoraphobia and fibromyalgia, which left her body in constant pain. Capita must pay damages to family of woman denied benefits Bereaved mum wins benefit case after daughter's death The Capita employee found Ms Smith did not score a single point in the test - and the DWP stopped her benefit. In February 2019, her mother, Susan Kemlo, told BBC News the decision had ""destroyed her"". ""When they took away her ability to look after herself, to have a way of life, she gave up,"" she said. Ms Smith died of a brain haemorrhage in July 2018 but doctors told the family her underlying conditions, particularly the fibromyalgia, had deteriorated as well. The week after her death, a social security tribunal decided she had been eligible for PIP. Furious with the conclusions the Capita employee had reached, Mrs Kemlo took legal action against the company for maladministration - in essence making inaccurate statements - and was awarded Â£10,000. ""I didn't do it for the money,"" said Mrs Kemlo. ""I did it for them to admit they were wrong, to get some justice for my daughter, because [it's] only ever been about justice for Victoria."" But Capita is now going to court later this month to try to set aside the judgement. At a hearing scheduled for Telford County Court, the company will argue it never had a chance to defend the case because of problems in its own internal mail system. In court papers, Capita ""acknowledges that it has not been able to explain the default and therefore cannot provide a good reason for it"" but says its failure to respond to the court was ""entirely innocent and inadvertent"". Capita also stands by its employee's assessment of Ms Smith, describing it as ""fit for purpose, accurate and medically justified"" and says the family's claim is therefore ""without merit"". If the court refuses to set aside the judgement, the company says, ""the prejudice to Capitaâ¦ is extremely significant"". ""Capita has been on the receiving end of significant negative press which suggests that it has been held liable following a successful claim by the claimant,"" it says. ""This causes significant reputational damage to Capita's business."" The court action by Capita has been condemned by Duncan Walker, a welfare rights adviser with Unite the Union, who has been supporting Mrs Kemlo since her daughter's death. ""In the tragic case of Victoria, this was just one more example of shocking maladministration by Capita at public expense. ""Every Pip case undertaken by Unite members in Stoke-on-Trent with the specific health care professional in Victoria's case has been overturned by the social security tribunals. ""It is an abuse of public funds and plainly wrong that such... reports are presented as fact and a shameful indictment of the government welfare reform ideology clearly persecuting disabled and vulnerable people."" said Mr Walker.

"Dame Barbara Windsor has met Boris Johnson several times, including when he appeared on EastEnders in 2009 Dame Barbara Windsor has called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ""sort out"" care for people who have dementia. The former EastEnders star, who has Alzheimer's, launched an open letter with her husband Scott Mitchell to coincide with their appointment as ambassadors for Alzheimer's Society. Ministers in England have been promising to publish plans on social care reforms since 2017. The government said Mr Johnson was ""committed to fixing"" the care system. Dementia: The greatest health challenge of our time Alzheimer's blood test 'one step closer' EastEnders stars run for Dame Barbara Barbara Windsor diagnosed with Alzheimer's Alzheimer's Society said since March 2017 people in the UK with dementia have spent more than one million unnecessary days in hospital ""despite being well enough to go home"" - at a cost to the NHS of more than Â£400m. Dame Barbara Windsor and her husband Scott Mitchell Dame Barbara, who turned 82 on Tuesday, urged others to join her in signing the open letter calling for a ""long-term funding solution to end the social care crisis"". ""[Me and my husband are] lucky to have amazing support but my heart goes out to the many, many people who are really struggling to get the care they so desperately need,"" Dame Barbara wrote. Mr Mitchell added: ""Seeing the true state of our social care system has shown me how people, who aren't as fortunate to be in the same position as myself and Barbara financially, are facing a constant battle to get what they need. I want to do everything I can to help them."" The open letter will be delivered to Downing Street in September, the charity said. Dame Barbara appeared in EastEnders until 2016 A spokesperson from the Department of Health and Social Care said it was working to make the UK the ""best country in the world"" in which to live with dementia. They added local authorities had been given nearly Â£4bn in extra funding for adult social care this year. ""The prime minister has been clear he is committed to fixing the social care system and will outline proposals as soon as possible,"" the spokesperson said. In England and Wales, one in eight death certificates cite dementia. Alzheimer's disease is the most common of the diseases that cause the condition. Globally about 50 million people are currently living with dementia - but cases are predicted to soar to 130 million by 2050 as populations age.

"The US has officially named China as a ""currency manipulator"", a statement which will intensify tensions between the world's two largest economies. The announcement by the US Treasury follows a sharp fall in the value of the Chinese yuan against the dollar. The drop caught markets off-guard as Beijing usually supports the currency. Last week, China pledged to retaliate after US President Donald Trump vowed to impose 10% tariffs on $300bn (Â£246.7bn) of Chinese imports. On Monday, the yuan passed the seven-per-dollar level for the first time since 2008, prompting Mr Trump to accuse China on Twitter of manipulating its currency. Why is China's currency falling? The US Treasury department defines currency manipulation as when countries deliberately influence the exchange rate between their currency and the US dollar to gain ""unfair competitive advantage in international trade"". A weaker yuan makes Chinese exports more competitive, or cheaper to buy with foreign currencies. On Monday, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said the slump in the yuan was driven by ""unilateralism and trade protectionism measures and the imposition of tariff increases on China"". The US government said,externalTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will now engage with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) ""to eliminate the unfair competitive advantage created by China's latest actions"".

The move is largely symbolic because the US is already engaged in trade discussions with China and has implemented tariffs on the country's imports. However, it fulfils a presidential campaign promise by Mr Trump who pledged to name China a currency manipulator on his first day in office. The decision rattled investors, with Wall Street's main stock market indexesrecording their worst trading day for 2019. Asia markets extended losses on Tuesday, with the Shanghai Composite down 1.3% in afternoon trading. By Michelle Fleury, New York Business Correspondent The move doesn't change much. Not legally speaking. But it is a big deal, accentuating just how fast things have gone south between the world's two largest economies. When the US Treasury labels a country a currency manipulator - as it has done here with China - the next step would normally be for negotiations to begin between the two countries. In this case, trade negotiations have already been going on for more than a year. The process also opens the path for America to introduce tariffs. Again, that's already happening as part of Mr Trump's 'America First' approach to trade. Under the designation, Mr Mnuchin is also expected to work with the IMF to address its concerns. It's not clear yet what that will yield. Still it's worth remembering that while the decision may not change much technically, it will have significant political ramifications. Nobody thinks this will increase the odds of a compromise by the Chinese side when it comes to trade. So don't be surprised if the prospect of a currency war further rattles investors' already frayed nerves. No country has officially been named a currency manipulator by the US since Bill Clinton's administration did so to China in 1994. In its announcement, the US Treasury said: ""China has a long history of facilitating an undervalued currency through protracted, large-scale intervention in the foreign exchange market. ""In recent days, China has taken concrete steps to devalue its currency, while maintaining substantial foreign exchange reserves despite active use of such tools in the past.""

"Harland and Wolff has entered administration, with accountancy firm BDO formally appointed to oversee the Belfast shipyard. Having employed more than 30,000 at its peak, the move could now put 120 jobs at risk and spell the end of the iconic firm, best known for building the Titanic. Unions representing workers have called for the shipyard to be renationalised. They argue it would be cheaper for the government to keep the shipyard open. However, the government has said the crisis is ""ultimately a commercial issue"". Shipyard crisis 'a commercial issue' Council calls for support for Harland and Wolff Administrators appointed to Harland and Wolff The troubled history of Belfast's shipyard The Northern Ireland Office said NI Secretary Julian Smith ""understands the impact"" uncertainty over the shipyard will have for workers and their families. It said Mr Smith ""had made it clear that he will continue to do everything he can to secure the future of this historic site and ensure workers' interests are protected"". A spokesperson for BDO said: ""The team at BDO have engaged immediately with Harland and Wolff employees and other stakeholders to take all necessary steps to ensure they are supported throughout the administration process."" A week ago, workers took control of the site and established a rota to ensure their protest continued around the clock. On Monday, union sources said staff were given redundancy notices saying the business would cease trading in the evening. This video can not be played The history of the Belfast shipyard The workers, though, said they would continue their protest. ""These workers are saying 'we're staying in until we win'. This occupation will continue,"" said Susan Fitzgerald of trade union Unite. ""There's huge interest in this yard, but the real interest needs to be coming from Boris Johnson."" Speaking to BBC'sGood Morning Ulster, Michael Mulholland from GMB Union outlined a plan for the yard's survival. It involves administrators giving the workers and unions a period of time to find a buyer for the shipyard that will protect jobs. Asked if the proposal had a precedent, Mr Mulholland said: ""I'm not aware of any precedent but we are in dire times. ""If it needs a creative outlook, the trade unions are prepared to do that and we only hope that government and administrators will come along on that journey with us."" After the administration announcement, Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster said she and the party's East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson had met GMB and Unite. She said they had a ""shared vision"" for the yard. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would have nationalised the shipyard and he accused the government of betraying the workers. Mr McDonnell, who visited Harland and Wolff staff in Belfast on Monday, said the shipyard has the potential for future work. Harland and Wolff's best known vessel is the Titanic, which was built at the yard between 1909 and 1911.

"Victoria Smith died last July, before a tribunal overturned the decision to stop her benefit Benefit-assessment company Capita is going to court to try to reverse the ""reputational damage"" it says it suffered after a claimant died. Victoria Smith died months after her personal independence payments were stopped following a Capita assessment. The outsourcing company was ordered to pay Â£10,000 in damages over its handling of her disability claim. It was found to have made incorrect statements but wants the county court verdict set aside and the case reheard. The company conducts health assessments for personal independence payments (PIP), the main disability benefit, on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions. While the decision over whether someone receives the benefit is made by a DWP official, Capita's assessment of how a person's disability affects their life is a crucial part of the process. A Capita healthcare assistant came to assess Ms Smith in March 2018. The 33-year-old, from Market Drayton, in Shropshire, suffered from agoraphobia and fibromyalgia, which left her body in constant pain. Capita must pay damages to family of woman denied benefits Bereaved mum wins benefit case after daughter's death The Capita employee found Ms Smith did not score a single point in the test - and the DWP stopped her benefit. In February 2019, her mother, Susan Kemlo, told BBC News the decision had ""destroyed her"". ""When they took away her ability to look after herself, to have a way of life, she gave up,"" she said. Ms Smith died of a brain haemorrhage in July 2018 but doctors told the family her underlying conditions, particularly the fibromyalgia, had deteriorated as well. The week after her death, a social security tribunal decided she had been eligible for PIP. Furious with the conclusions the Capita employee had reached, Mrs Kemlo took legal action against the company for maladministration - in essence making inaccurate statements - and was awarded Â£10,000. ""I didn't do it for the money,"" said Mrs Kemlo. ""I did it for them to admit they were wrong, to get some justice for my daughter, because [it's] only ever been about justice for Victoria.""
