"This video can not be played Goran Hansson says gender quotas will not be introduced to the Nobel Prize The head of the academy that awards the Nobel Prizes in science has said it will not introduce gender quotas. Goran Hansson, head of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, said they want people to win ""because they made the most important discovery"". Since its inception in 1901, 59 Nobel Prizes have gone to women. Maria Ressa was the only woman honoured this year. Marie Curie was the first woman to get the prize - and remains the only woman to get it twice. ""It's sad that there are so few women Nobel laureates and it reflects the unfair conditions in society, particularly in years past, but still existing. And there's so much more to do,"" Mr Hansson told the AFP news agency. ""We have decided we will not have quotas for gender or ethnicity,"" he said, adding that the decision was ""in line with the spirit of Alfred Nobel's last will"". Swedish industrialist and chemist Alfred Nobel founded the prizes in his will, written in 1895 - a year before his death. Philippine journalist Maria Ressa was the only woman to win a Nobel Prize this year ""In the end, we will give the prize to those who are found the most worthy, those who have made the most important contributions,"" he said.

""Keep in mind that only about 10% of the professors in natural sciences in western Europe or North America are women, and even lower if you go to East Asia,"" he said. However, the scientist said they would ""make sure that we have an increasing portion of women scientists being invited to nominate, and we will continue to make sure we have women on our committees - but we need help, and society needs to help here"".

"Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov jointly won the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize Journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov have won the Nobel Peace Prize for their fights to defend freedom of expression in the Philippines and Russia. The Nobel committee called the pair ""representatives of all journalists who stand up for this ideal"". They are known for investigations that have angered their countries' rulers, and have faced significant threats. Both spoke in defence of freedom of the press following their win. Ms Ressa, who co-founded the news site Rappler, was commended for using freedom of expression to ""expose abuse of power, use of violence and growing authoritarianism in her native country, the Philippines"". The Nobel committee said Mr Muratov, the co-founder and editor of independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, had for decades defended freedom of speech in Russia under increasingly challenging conditions. ""Free, independent and fact-based journalism serves to protect against abuse of power, lies and war propaganda,""the committee said in a statement.,external ""Without freedom of expression and freedom of the press, it will be difficult to successfully promote fraternity between nations, disarmament and a better world order to succeed in our time,"" it added. Award-winning journalist Ms Ressa wasconvicted last year of libelin a case seen as a test of Philippine press freedom. In a live broadcast by Rappler, she said she was ""in shock"". ""This shows that the Nobel Peace Prize committee realised that a world without facts means a world without truth and trust,"" she said. BBC journalists on Nobel Peace Prize winners Why do the Nobel prizes matter? Who is Philippine news boss Maria Ressa? Mr Muratov dedicated his prize to reporters at Novaya Gazeta who had been killed because of their work. The award came a day after the 15th anniversary ofthe killing of Anna Politkovskaya,external- one of the paper's top investigative reporters and a vocal critic of Russia's war in Chechnya, who was shot in a lift in her block of flats. ""I can't take all the credit. This is thanks to Novaya Gazeta and those who died while defending people's right to freedom of speech,"" he told Russian news agency Tass. The winners of the prestigious prize, worth 10m Swedish krona (Â£836,000; $1.1m), were chosen out of 329 candidates. Maria Ressa, 58, co-founded Rappler in 2012. The site now has 4.5 million followers on Facebook, and has become known for its intelligent analysis and hard-hitting investigations. It is one of the few Philippine media organisations to be openly critical of President Rodrigo Duterte and his policies. Rappler has published extensively on the populist president's deadly war on drugs, as well as taking a critical look at issues of misogyny, human rights violations and corruption. Ms Ressa has personally reported on the spread of government propaganda on social media. Ms Ressa has faced numerous legal cases, which she says are politically motivated. The government has maintained their legitimacy. In a statement, Rappler said it was ""honoured and astounded"" that its chief executive had been given the prize. ""It could not have come at a better time - a time when journalists and the truth are being attacked and undermined,"" it said. This video can not be played Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa: ""Journalism has never been as important as it is today"" Dmitry Muratov, 59, co-founded Novaya Gazeta in 1993 and has since worked as its editor. Novaya Gazeta is one of the few remaining newspapers in Russia to be highly critical of the ruling elite, particularly President Vladimir Putin. Published three times a week, it regularly runs investigations into alleged corruption and other malpractice in ruling circles, and highlights the plight of people it considers victims of official abuse. The newspaper has been subjected to threats and harassment, including over its reporting of human rights abuses in Chechnya. Ms Politkovskaya is one of six Novaya Gazeta journalists and contributors to have been killed in connection with their work since 2000. The Kremlin, which has frequently opposed the paper, congratulated Mr Muratov. ""He persistently works in accordance with his own ideals, he is devoted to them, he is talented, he is brave,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. However, allies ofjailed opposition figure Alexei NavalnyÂ criticised the Nobel committee's choice. ""Instead of pretentious and hypocritical speeches about 'freedom', they could protect a person who survived an assassination attempt and has been taken hostage by the murderers,"" Ruslan Shaveddinov tweeted. Alistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring Both Nobel laureates have been a thorn in the side of their respective governments for years. Maria Ressa and Rappler have faced concerted attacks from Rodrigo Duterte's government, and her conviction last year for ""cyber-libel"" was one of a string of cases ranging from defamation to tax avoidance. If Mr Duterte is trying to silence her, it hasn't worked. Rappler continues reporting on his administration, and this award will be a huge embarrassment. In her own words, Ms Ressa says: ""I've committed no crime but to speak truth to power."" And congratulations from the Russian government to Dmitry Muratov surely came through gritted teeth. He fully understands the risks that come with standing up to the state but he remains optimistic, saying of state crackdowns on opposition groups: ""It's impossible to kill dissent"". Ms Ressa and Mr Muratov are the 102nd winners of the prize. Last year's winner was the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP),which was awarded for its efforts to combat hunger and improve conditions for peace. Then US President Barack Obama took the prize in 2009 and other notable winners include child education activist Malala Yousafzai (shared 2014); the United Nations and its secretary-general at the time, Kofi Annan (shared 2001); and Mother Teresa (1979).

"Cyber-attacks which see hackers get inside computer networks and lock the owners out until they pay a ransom present ""the most immediate danger"" to UK businesses in cyber-space, the head of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned. Lindy Cameron said her agency, an arm of GCHQ, and the National Crime Agency had assessed that cyber-criminals based in Russia, and its neighbours, were responsible for the most of the ""devastating"" ransomware attacks against the UK. She said these types of attack posed a threat to everyone from major companies to local councils and schools. Speaking at the Chatham House Cyber 2021 conference, Ms Cameron warned that not enough organisations were prepared for the threat or tested their cyber-defences. Lindy Cameron has been chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre, the agency tasked with defending the UK in cyberspace, for just over a year Increasingly in recent cases, criminal gangs have also threatened to release some of the data they have access to publicly. Foreign Secretary issues warning on cyber-attacks Technology moves to the heart of UK security GCHQ chief warns of tech 'moment of reckoning' Hackney Borough Council was hit by one attack which led to significant disruption to services and IT systems going down for months. Ireland's Health Service Executive also suffered a significant attack this year, leading to months of disrupted appointments and services. Ransomware has risen up the agenda in recent months, particularly the United States wherean attack on the company Colonial Pipeline led to fuel shortages on the east coast. President Bidenwarned President Vladimir Putin about activity that came from gangs within Russia. A ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline in the US led to fuel shortages on the east coast of the country There had been some signs that Russian-linked activity dipped over the summer but cyber-security experts believe much of that may be to do with the hackers taking their summer holiday rather than any fundamental shift away from what has been a highly-lucrative business model. Ms Cameron said that ransomware would continue to be attractive while organisations remained vulnerable and were willing to pay. She said the government had been clear that paying ransoms simply emboldened criminal groups. As well as improving its defences, she also said the UK would aim to deliver a ""sustained, proactive"" campaign to disrupt those harming the UK, including ransomware gangs. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? This would include a range of techniques including the newly established National Cyber Force which can carry out offensive hacking operations. In a wide-ranging speech, Ms Cameron, who has served just over a year as head of the NCSC, said the pandemic continued to cast a shadow over cyber-security and was likely to do so for years to come. ""Malicious actors continue to try and access Covid related information, whether that is data on new variants or vaccine procurement plans,"" she said. ""Some groups may also seek to use this information to undermine public trust in government responses to the pandemic. And criminals are now regularly using Covid-themed attacks as a way of scamming the public."" She also made reference to the recent revelations about the Pegasus spyware sold by the company NSO Group, saying that the NCSC has raised a ""red flag"" about the growing commercial market for sophisticated products which can be used to hack into people's phones and carry out surveillance. Last week a UK court ruling found that NSO spyware had been used to hack into the phones of the ex-wife of Dubai's ruler. ""We need to avoid a marketplace for vulnerabilities and exploits developing that makes us all less safe,"" she said. She warned of the dangers of ""authoritarian states like China"" having the ability to influence the standards of new technology in a way that undermines the UK's security. She said the UK needed to be ""clear eyed"" and protect itself ""against Chinese practices that have an adverse effect on our own prosperity and security"".

"A deal to avert another carbon dioxide crisis in the food and drink industry has been extended until early 2022. US firm CF Industries, a key CO2 producer in the UK, has agreed to continue supplies of the gas. It said that should give the government and firms time to find other sources of CO2, used in fizzy drinks and for keeping food fresh, as well as to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter. Firms will now have to pay more for their CO2, but it is unclear how much. Last month, the government stepped in to subsidise one of the firm's plants after its shutdown due to high gas prices threatened food supplies. CF Industries suspended production at two sites - Cheshire and Billingham - which make 60% of the UK's commercial carbon dioxide. It reopened its Billingham plant in north-east Englandafter the government agreed to meet the costsof running it for three weeks. Billingham produces up to 750 tonnes of CO2 per day as a by-product of producing ammonia for fertiliser. CF Industries' plant at Ince in Cheshire remains closed with no date given for a reopening. The government said: ""CO2 suppliers have agreed to pay CF Fertilisers a price for the CO2 it produces that will enable it to continue operating while global gas prices remain high, drawing on support from industry and delivering value for money for the taxpayer."" The agreement meant industry could have confidence it would receive future CO2 supplies, without further taxpayer support, said the government. The British Meat Processors Association said the agreement provided ""some reassurance that supplies will be maintained"". ""However, industry has been given no detail on what the price will be or how it will be calculated going forward,"" a spokesperson added. ""We understand that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng took the decision to temporarily exempt parts of the CO2 industry from competition law to facilitate this agreement. What we need now is some detail and transparency around how the new pricing structure will work."" Why are gas prices so high? Minister asks Treasury to help firms over gas cost What's CO2 used for in food and drink? Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said the agreement was ""welcome news"". But he added: ""The increased cost of buying CO2 is yet another burden on the food and drink industry, which is already facing enormous stresses. ""This will, of course, add more pressure on prices for shoppers and diners."" By Ben King, business reporter It looks like there will be enough CO2 to keep Christmas beers bubbly - but after that, there are no guarantees. There's an ominous line in the CF Industries press release. They expect CO2 users to develop ""robust alternative sources"" between now and January. That won't be easily done. Lots of industrial processes produce CO2, but few produce a stream so pure and reliable that you'd want to dissolve it in your lemonade. Distributor Nippon Gases has warned that supply is tight across Europe, so imports will be hard to come by. The government says that the firms which need the CO2 from Billingham will be paying more for it - and whatever long-term solution does emerge, it's likely to be more expensive too. But the UK only needs about 600,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. At about Â£200 a tonne before the current crisis, that's about Â£120m, relatively small beer for industries that count their turnover in the billions. Compared to the other pressures those industries face - staff shortages, and higher costs for energy and shipping - more expensive CO2 is an extra cost they don't need, but it won't be their biggest headache. When CF shut its facilities after making fertiliser became uneconomic because of the rising price of wholesale gas, it cut off a vital source of CO2 for other sectors. Supermarkets began reporting limited stocks of some food items, while the pig industry warned that if slaughterhouses could not process animals, then farmers would have to cull their stocks. The US firm said it now expected the UK government and industrial gas customers to ""develop robust alternative sources of CO2 as part of a long-term solution for meeting demand in the country"". Last month, it emerged the British food industry would be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with CF Industries to restart production in the UK. Environment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from Â£200 per tonne to Â£1,000. Households, too, are being hit by higher energy bills, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use,seeing bills go up by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year on average. Several energy suppliers, unable to pass on wholesale prices to consumers on fixed deal, have gone out of business. Their customers have been switched to other suppliers, but will be put on variable contracts that will be higher than previous deals. Meanwhile, the business department has sent the Treasury a formal request for support for energy-intensive industries hit by high gas prices, the BBC understands. It came after talks between ministers and industry leaders earlier on Monday. A source said: ""Everyone in government understands the importance of this situation. ""We need to solve this quickly."" Details of the proposal from Mr Kwarteng have not been disclosed but are thought to focus on a temporary solution to high energy prices. On Sunday, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the situation was ""critical"" and said he was ""looking to find a solution"". Mr Kwarteng said there were Treasury talks about support measures to ease the impact on firms. However, a Treasury source later said the business secretary had been ""mistaken"". Sectors such as ceramics, paper and steel manufacturing have called for a price cap, though talks with government on Friday failed to reach a solution.

"The US had offered a $5m reward for information leading to Sami Jasim al-Jaburi's capture Iraq says it has captured the jihadist group Islamic State's financial chief in an operation outside its borders. Sami Jasim al-Jaburi was arrested in a ""complex external operation"" by the Iraqi National Intelligence Service, Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi tweeted, without specifying a location. He added that Mr Jasim, also known as Hajji Hamid, was a deputy leader of IS under the late Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The US had offered a $5m (Â£3.7m) reward,externalfor information leading to his capture. Its Rewards for Justice website alleged that he was ""instrumental in managing finances for [IS] terrorist operations"" and had supervised the group's ""revenue-generating operations from illicit sales of oil, gas, antiquities, and minerals"" after it seized large swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014. Iraqi officials are hailing the capture of Sami Jasim as a significant blow to IS. They say, cryptically, that he was captured in a foreign intelligence operation without immediately revealing where. The high-level IS operative is believed to have been not only in charge of the group's finances but also of its cross-border operations in Syria and Iraq where it continues to attack police and military bases. His value to the Iraqi security forces will be not so much his loss to IS - where he will be swiftly replaced - but in what information he yields to his captors about imminent attacks. Since the military defeat of IS and its self-declared caliphate it has reverted to being an insurgency, conducting hit-and-run attacks. It's estimated to have around 10,000 fighters at large in the Middle East. Further afield it remains a dangerous security threat in countries as far apart as Afghanistan and Mozambique. Iraq's Security Media Cell said the detainee was close to the new leader of IS, Amir Mohammed Said Abdul Rahman al-Mawla, who replaced Baghdadi afterhe killed himself during a US special forces raid on his hideout in Syria in 2019. Although Mr Kadhimi did not reveal where Mr Jasim had been captured, a senior Iraqi military source told AFP news agency it had happened in Turkey. There was no immediate response from Turkish authorities to the report. Earlier this year, the Iraqi government announced it had killed another alleged deputy IS leader, Jabir Salman Saleh al-Isawi, as well as the leader of IS in southern Iraq, Jabbar Ali Fayadh. This video can not be played Islamic State children in Syria face a lifetime in prison IS once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from eastern Iraq to western Syria and imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people. Despite the group's defeat on the battlefield in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria two years later, it is estimated that thousands of militants remain active in both countries.

"This video can not be played Consistency and the lack of publicity around Covid passes are some issues raised by people in Cardiff People in Wales now need an NHS Covid pass to be able to legally attend big events or nightclubs. They are compulsory for over-18s, and show people have either tested negative on a lateral flow test or are fully vaccinated against Covid. Wales' rugby game against New Zealand on 30 October will be one of the first mass events to require Covid passes. Some nightclub bosses said they felt ""singled out"" by the rules, but other people said they felt reassured. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the new scheme was ""vulnerable to abuse"" but the ""huge bulk of people"" will follow the new rules. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Covid pass breaches 'should not be police priority' Wales to introduce Covid passes from next month The Principality Stadium, with a capacity of almost 75,000, will be one of the first to host a mass event with Covid passes Asked if people could falsify their lateral flow tests, Mr Drakeford said: ""It is vulnerable to people who want to abuse the system but that's why the law is there."" ""I am quite sure the huge bulk of people will use the lateral flow test in the correct way,"" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain programme. He also rejected claims the new Covid pass was a financial burden for businesses, adding: ""Nightclubs already have to check people for their age. ""I don't think the cost issue is a very significant one here."" In its autumn and winter plan Mr Drakeford's government has not ruled out extending the scheme if further action is needed to tackle Covid rates. He suggested that could include using passes when going to care homes or visiting hospitals. ""If numbers in the community continue to rise... being able to show a Covid pass if you were going into a care home might be an extra defence,"" he said. Covid passes will be required in nightclubs in Wales, under the plans Welsh Education Minister Jeremy Miles toldBBC Politics Walesthat public services were expected to face ""significant pressure"" this winter, and the pass would cut transmission of the virus. The Senedd voted on the passes last Tuesday - a vote the Welsh government saidwill not be repeated, despite it passing by just one vote. Anyone who is over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, can get a pass. They are compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter: Nightclubs or similar venues Indoor no-seating events with more than 500 people Outdoor no-seating events with more than 4,000 people Any event with more than 10,000 people, including sport The Welsh government says any venue that can serve alcohol, is open between midnight and 0500, and where music is provided for dancing will need to check for passes. That means it could cover other venues not traditionally considered nightclubs which have a late licence. Venues can either apply the pass rules from when they open their doors, or when they open their dancefloor. Negative tests will be self-certified but the Welsh governmentplans to make it illegal to fake a negative test. Large events could also be allowed to check passes at random, rather than check every person who attends. The Welsh government says the passes can be downloaded to people's phones TheNHS Covid Pass,externalis available digitally but you need to register for anNHS login,externalvia the website. You need to upload a photo of your ID. That can be a passport, full UK driving licence or full European driving licence. This allows you to produce a Covid pass using a smart phone, computer or laptop. Your NHS Covid Pass includes a barcode. The expiry date refers to the barcode and will update automatically. It does not apply to your vaccination status. In Wales, you cannot get the pass via the NHS app, as this is only valid in England. Big sport games are some of the bigger events that will be affected by the rule change Wales is not the first nation to introduce such a pass. In France, people have had to prove they are fully vaccinated, have recently tested negative or recently recovered from Covid with a ""health pass"". That must be produced on entering cafes, restaurants or public transport. Scotland is the only other UK nation to use them afterthey were introduced on 1 October. Mike Murray will close Prestatyn's Bar 236 early rather than implement passes One nightclub and bar in Denbighshire has decided to close earlier in the evening rather than dealing with the ""complexity"" of implementing Covid passes. Mike Murray, manager of Bar 236 in Prestatyn, said the club used to stay open past midnight with live music and DJs, but would need extra staffing to police the system, and it was not worth it financially. ""We always weighed up the situation, following the government guidelines to make it a safe and comfortable environment to drink in. Since the hospitality industry re-opened, staff have erred on the side of caution when observing the rules, says Mike Murray of Bar 236 in Prestatyn ""We've even been keeping masks on and doing table service after the government advice changed because what's wrong with doing it a little longer to keep people comfortable?"" He added he received a lack of guidance from Welsh government as to ""what passes would look like or where we could get one from if people asked"". ""We want people to come in and let common sense prevail: If you're unwell, don't come to the bar."" Nightclub owner Guto Brychan said different rules could be a problem as students return from outside Wales The decision to introduce Covid passes has very much split opinion, which was evident in the Senedd vote. Guto Brychan, chief executive of Cardiff music venue Clwb Ifor Bach, said the timing made things difficult as students had just returned to university and it is ""the busiest time of year"". He said this was made more difficult because many students are from outside Wales and may not understand the law. Clubbers and businesses torn over Wales Covid pass Mr Brychan said: ""One of the main concerns as well is that the Covid pass isn't uniform across the whole of the hospitality industry. ""It seems to have been specifically designed to target places that supply dancing or culture, but I'd argue the high risk activity here is the consumption of alcohol, not dancing. ""There'll be plenty of venues open as late as ourselves that will have as many people in them but won't have the restrictions that we have in place."" Lidi Staffurth has been shielding during the pandemic and said the rules will make shielders feel more comfortable Lidi Staffurth is one of thousands of people who have been shielding during the pandemic due to a condition which makes them extremely vulnerable to Covid-19. She said Covid passes would help reassure people who might feel uncertain about attending large events, adding she felt she had her ""freedom back"". Ms Staffurth labelled it a ""brilliant idea"", not least because there are three young people in her family. ""If they're in large groups then we'll know they're around people who are double vaccinated, or at least free from Covid,"" she said. ""I think it's a fantastic idea and for a society at large it means people are looking after each other. ""I think some young people just don't care - they've had it with Covid, and I think we've all had it with Covid - but they live in their own little bubble and they don't really see beyond that bubble a lot. ""And that's fair enough, but it means with a Covid pass they're made to consider that."" David Chapman, executive director for UK Hospitality in Wales, called for ""tolerance"" from government, licencing authorities and the public as the passes were introduced. He toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastthere was some ""trepidation"" in the industry, particularly about alignment with England, as well as staff shortages. ""We've got staffing problems as people will know already and more labour intensive moves such as this actually makes it quite difficult for a business to juggle resources well at the moment,"" he said. He also called for the ""easiest possible trading conditions"" over Christmas, saying businesses had been told passes would stop ""stop at a certain point when society and the health service can cope"". Proof of vaccination has already been required for some large events Dr Mair Hopkin, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in Wales, said the risk of Covid will increase as the weather gets worse and people spend more time indoors. She said: ""They've introduced them in France and it seems to have been very acceptable to the French population, and also it seems to have coincided with a more rapid drop in their incidence rates. ""If that happens here then that would be a good thing."" Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said he would not ""expect perfection on day one"" as the system is introduced. He said: ""We do accept there may be problems in venues getting used to what they need to do."" Covid pass plans agreed in tight Senedd decision Where do I need to use a Covid passport?

"The business secretary has asked the Treasury to support industries hit by soaring energy costs, a source has told the BBC. Kwasi Kwarteng's formal request follows talks between ministers and industry leaders. The details have not been disclosed, but they are thought to focus on a temporary solution to high prices. Sectors such as steel manufacturing have called for a price cap amid fears for the survival of some factories. There are a number of reasons for a steep rise in gas prices over the past year - including the reopening of industry after Covid lockdowns. A source told the BBC that ""everyone in government understands the importance of this situation"". ""We need to solve this quickly,"" they added. Mr Kwarteng's proposal follows confusion over the weekend, whenhis claim to be in talks with the chancellorabout potential support was disputed by a Treasury source. On Monday, the prime minister's spokesman said Treasury officials were involved in talks with the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). ""As you would expect, ministers from BEIS are working across government, including with the Treasury, on this important issue, the challenges currently facing industry in light of global gas prices, and that will continue,"" he said. Darren Jones, Labour MP and chairman of the Commons BEIS committee, welcomed Mr Kwarteng's request for help and stressed the importance of finding short-term solutions. He said a one-off windfall tax on gas producers was worth considering, because they had ""made significant profits"" during recent price fluctuations. But he also said the UK should be focusing more and renewable energy sources and nuclear. ""Any subsidy from government should be on proviso that we bring forward, both from private and public sector, investment to move away from gas powered sources of energy to avoid these problems in the future,"" he added. Dr Richard Leese, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users' Group which represents manufacturers, welcomed Mr Kwarteng's ""urgency"" and said he hoped for an ""equally swift response"" from the Treasury. There have been bleak warnings about the potential impact of the spiralling energy price. One government source warned of factories closing forever, and thousands of job losses as a result. But despite that, ministers have struggled to maintain a united front over the past day. When the business secretary told the BBC he was in talks with the chancellor, a Treasury source said he was wrong. With the prime minister on holiday, it was left to his team to insist today that ministers were working across government to find solutions. Tonight we have some clarity - the business secretary has made formal proposals. A source said an urgent solution was needed. It's now up to the Treasury to decide whether to accept them. BBC political correspondent Adam Fleming said earlier that business minister Lee Rowley, rather than Mr Kwarteng, was due to lead Monday's meeting - and would lead another with steel bosses on Tuesday. Ministers also met industry leaders on Friday. Dave Dalton, chief executive of the British Glass trade body called for ""immediate action"" following that meeting. He said some members of his group might have to shut production permanently, although no firm had been forced to do so yet. Why are gas prices so high? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Adrian Curry, managing director of UK-based Encirc, one of the largest container glass plants in Europe, said industry was not asking for a bailout, but the situation for some companies was critical. ""We pay more for our energy than competitors in other countries,"" he told the BBC. He said his company would normally spend Â£40m a year on energy, but was now looking at bills up to Â£100m. There are many reasons, both in the UK and around the world. There's been a shortage of gas and energy in many countries as they emerged from lockdown and industry reopened. A cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, less gas is being stored than normal. On top of that, the UK has fewer gas storage facilities than some countries - meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. There's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas. And there is a suspicion that Russia, a major gas supplier, is restricting output - an accusation it denies - which, following the law of supply and demand, has fuelled price rises. This has helped push up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they've risen 250%. And prices have soared 70% since August alone. Read more here Trade group UK Steel told the BBC that Boris Johnson needed to take control before it was too late - although it described as ""really good news"" an announcement that the country's third largest steel maker, Liberty Steel, would restart operations at its plant in Rotherham this month. The Unite union also called on the prime minister to ""get a grip"" to avert job losses if companies had to shut production because they could not cope with the increased cost of energy. Downing Street has said Boris Johnson is continuing ""to address the current issues around fuel and supply chains"" while on holiday, afterLabour accused the governmentof having ""put its out of office on"" over the weekend. However, Conservative MP Mark Harper said the government should resist demands for financial support. Domestic energy consumers have a certain amount of protection from rising prices due to a price cap, which sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. However, the cap was increased on 1 October, meaning about 15 million households face a 12% rise in energy bills. Industry has no such cap, meaning they are open to the risk of an unlimited rise in prices. Already manufacturers and services are warning they will have to pass on their rising costs to consumers. And as energy costs are a big driver of inflation, few consumers and households will escape the consequences of the current crisis. Are you a business owner?

"Covid passes will be required in nightclubs in Wales, under the plans Mandatory Covid passes in nightclubs and large events will be introduced in Wales as planned on 11 October after Welsh ministers won a knife-edge Senedd vote. The measures were agreed with 28 politicians voting for and 27 voting against. It came despite politicians in the opposition uniting against the plans. The public will be expected to show evidence of being fully vaccinated or having a recent negative Covid test. Conservative Vale of Clwyd Member of the Senedd (MS) Gareth Davies did not take part in the vote, with the Tories citing ""technical difficulties"" for what happened. Nightclub industry representatives said it was a ""shambles"". If all opposition MSs had taken part the government would have lost in a tie, with the Tories, Lib Dems and Plaid opposed to the scheme. Health Minister Eluned Morgan told MSs not supporting the law ""will be an act of gross irresponsibility"", but Plaid Cymru had said it was open to exploitation. Protesters had gathered outside the Senedd's buildings on Tuesday evening, chanting ""shame on you"", following the result. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Covid pass breaches 'should not be police priority' Wales to introduce Covid passes from next month Ahead of the vote, Conservative MS Darren Millar could be heard telling Presiding Officer Elin Jones: ""I'm sorry we still have a member who is desperately trying to get into Zoom."" Ms Jones replied that she would still hold the vote: ""We have made every opportunity possible for that named member to get in, including sharing my personal phone."" Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies, who is ill, was also not present but Labour had agreed for one of their MSs not to vote in return. The Senedd is sitting in a hybrid format - with some MSs attending in person in the 60-person chamber and some joining via Zoom. The Welsh Conservatives said: ""A number of members across political groups experienced technical difficulties with the voting system this evening, which demonstrates why the hybrid Parliament in Wales must come to an end. ""We reaffirm our view that such significant votes should be held in person on the floor of the Senedd and Welsh Conservatives remain steadfastly opposed to the introduction of Covid passports."" However Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth in a tweet defended the hybrid system: ""Unless there's very good reason and/or with advance approval... I think you should be able to vote only from your offices at home/Senedd/constituency."" ""Not e.g. party conference,"" he added. Night Time Industries Association Wales, which represents 100 venues in Wales and is opposed to the plans, called for an ""urgent revote"". It said it was a ""democratic outrage that one MS who wanted to vote, and who would've voted against the proposals, could not, due to a mere technical error. This shambles will cause even more uncertainty for our businesses."" Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, later said in a statement: ""I gave every opportunity for the member to be present - including providing ICT support - but the member was unable to be contacted. ""For members to vote in the Senedd, they must be present, either in the chamber or on Zoom. ""It is a member's responsibility to give themselves sufficient time to secure their Zoom connection in time for voting, just as it is for any member travelling to the Senedd to vote."" People opposed to vaccine passports took part in a protest on the Senedd steps on Tuesday Hundreds gathered on the Senedd steps on Tuesday to protest against the measures. Following the decision protests moved to the front of Senedd office building TÅ· Hywel, and near the complex's car park exit, with security personnel and two armed police officers deployed on the other side of the barrier. Tory MS Sam Kurtz said he was ""stuck in my TÅ· Hywel office as protestors shout 'shame on you' and block us from leaving. To be fair, I'm as frustrated as them"". Plaid revealed in a Senedd debate on Tuesday afternoon that it would vote against the government. Rhun ap Iorwerth said the regulations proposed by the Welsh government had raised ""more questions than they provide answers"". ""There is insufficient evidence and little detail on how it will work in practice. In particular, the rapid test loophole, which represents a fudge on the part of the government, makes the system open to exploitation. ""We've asked many questions and haven't been given the assurances we've sought. And it's for that reason that we feel unable to support these regulations today."" Plaid called for ministers to withdraw the vote and said it would ""contribute to discussions on how something more robust could be brought forward, better evidenced, and with clarity on implication"". Welsh Lib Dem Jane Dodds said: ""Today's vote sets a dangerous precedent for bad law-making here in Wales and an unnecessary government overreach into our civil liberties without any evidence they will make us all safer."" During the debate on Tuesday Eluned Morgan said the Welsh government had not taken the decision to introduce such measures ""lightly"". ""We are taking these measures to support venues to stay open and enable events to continue taking place through a potentially very difficult and challenging autumn and winter,"" she said. The Welsh government is using a web-based system, rather than an app. Ms Morgan said she was currently aware that the Covid pass shows it is valid in England. ""This is unfortunate and reflects the fact that we share the infrastructure with the UK government."" She said the wording will change before it becomes mandatory, and promised an app which will include a pass would be available ""early in 2022"". Proof of vaccination has already been required for some large events Welsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said the implementation of Covid passes had been a ""complete disaster"" in Scotland. He said the use of them at the Labour Party conference in Brighton had also been ""plagued with problems"". He warned bringing in Covid passes in Wales risked turning the nation into a ""two-tiered society"" and ""undermines freedom of choice"". Mr George told the Senedd the Welsh government's own technical advisory cell had warned such a policy could ""backfire"". But the Welsh government hopes the passes will help prevent super-spreader events. Deputy chief medical officer Chris Jones said officials are ""keen to try to minimise the risk of these events while enabling them to continue so life can return to normal with some degree of protection"". Anyone who is over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, can get a pass. Under the Welsh government plan they would be compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter: Nightclubs Indoor no-seating events with more than 500 people Outdoor no-seating events with more than 4,000 people Any event with more than 10,000 people, including sport Users who want to show a negative test will have to self-certify their result - leading to concerns they could be faked. To prevent this, the Welsh governmentplans to make it illegal to fake a negative test. Large events could also be allowed to check passes at random, rather than check every person who attends.

"High energy prices are already causing problems for households in the UK and across Europe, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine is set to make the situation worse. So where does the UK get its gas from and how much could bills rise? EU countriesget about 40% of their gas directly from Russia. The UK gets less than 5% of its gas from Russia but its gas prices are affected by fluctuations in the global markets. While Russian oil and gas exports aren't directly affected by Western sanctions, the prospect of further action by the US and EU is hitting Russian trade and pushing up gas prices globally. Thesanctions already imposedby Western nations are designed to stop Russia's banks from doing business in several major economies and trade areas. Separately Germany hasblocked the progress of Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. Experts fear that Putin may decide to retaliate by reducing gas supplies to Europe. If this were to happen wholesale costs - (ie the cost suppliers face when buying to supply their customers) - would rocket and send prices higher everywhere, including the UK. The energy cap will increase in April and could rise again in the autumn Household energy costs have been kept in check bythe price cap,external, but average household bills are expected to rise by about Â£700 to about Â£2,000 in Aprilwhen the price cap is increased, and rise again in the autumn when the price cap is again revised. Energy bills could reach Â£3,000 as oil price soars The energy regulator Ofgem agreed to increase the cap after dozens of energy firms collapsed because they could not pass on the increased wholesale costs to their customers. As a result,more than four million customers have been switched to a different supplier in the last year, often on a higher tariff. Rising energy prices have already contributed to a big surge in the UK's cost of living,with inflation at 5.5% in the 12 months to January, the highest rate since March 1992. Four cheap ways to save energy at home this winter What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? How to save energy at home and help the planet About half of the UK's gas comes directly from the North Sea. The UK has been a big producer of gas since the mid-1960s, but the amount produced has fallen since 2000 while demand continues to rise. Another third of the UK's gas comes through pipelines from Norway. The rest come mainly as liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports in tankers from Qatar, the US and others. The small amount of Russian gas the UK buys also comes in LNG form. LNG supplies are particularly sensitive to global market prices, and are sold to whoever pays the most. The government says the UK's energy bill crisis is due to high global gas prices, not security of supply. However, that could change quite rapidly if Russian gas becomes scarce, as countries that depend heavily on Russian gas will have to compete for alternative supplies. The UK also has limited storage facilities, which means it is more affected by short-term price fluctuations in the wholesale gas market than some other European countries which can hold greater reserves. The government says it is ""not complacent"" about gas supplies. It does have the power to impose emergency measures, such as ordering big industrial customers to temporarily stop using gas. Even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the market was in crisis. Colder winters in 2021 put pressure on supplies and depleted gas reserves. Those reserves would normally have been replenished in summer months but output dropped as some producers used this time to for maintenance postponed during Covid lockdowns. Meanwhile, calm weather reduced the amount of electricity generated by wind power. As a result, wholesale gas prices more than quadrupled last year. The UK has been especially badly-hit as it is one of Europe's biggest users of natural gas - 85% of homes use gas central heating, while gas also generates a third of the UK's electricity. Correction 9 December 2024: This piece was corrected to remove a chart sourced to Gas Infrastructure Europe that did not fully reflect the situation with gas storage at the time, following a complaint to theBBC's Executive Complaints Unit.The data sourced to GIE does not report the full picture for the UK post Brexit.

"This video can not be played Shoppers have shared their views on vaccine passes in Wales Businesses and music lovers have said they feel ""torn"" after the introduction of Covid passes for nightclubs and large events in Wales. A knife-edge vote in the Senedd on Tuesday, with 28 politicians voting for and 27 against, will see the new rules brought in on 11 October. Critics said the pass would divide society and make it harder for businesses to recover lockdown losses. But others said the pass helped make people feel safer. Lucy Rees and Holly Hermann, both 19, from Llanelli, Carmarthenshire, said they had already downloaded their Covid passes to be allowed into a concert on Tuesday night. ""I think it's kind of good to be honest,"" said Ms Rees. ""We went to go to a concert last night, we had to have the Covid pass to get in, so it was better because you feel safer. ""I was really confused to begin with... but then it was easy."" What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Covid pass plans agreed in tight Senedd decision Katie Owen, 24, from Pontyclun, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said: ""I feel people should have the decision whether they want the vaccine or not. I've personally been double-vaxxed. I work in the music industry so I feel it's the right thing to do to make people feel safe. ""But I'm a bit torn, I feel some people are a bit scared and don't know enough about the vaccines."" But she said she would ""definitely"" be getting a pass. ""If you want to go to a club with your friends and they've got their vaccine passes and you haven't then you're going to be a bit stuck."" Lucy Rees and Holly Hermann have already downloaded their Covid passes Jonathon Dawes, 18, from Rhyl, Denbighshire, who is studying politics and economics at Kings College, London, said the introduction of the pass risked eroding people's freedoms. ""I've had my double jab, but when it comes to Covid passes I oppose vaccine passports and the reason I do so is not only do I think they're a massive impracticality for businesses up and down the country, but I think pursuing such an avenue is a very dangerous one because we're approaching a situation now where civil liberties are under threat."" Sylvia Majer, 21, from Cardiff, said: ""I think they are a good idea - they don't exclude anyone, or you can just do a test. Sylvia Majer says passes are a good idea to stop people who test positive from mixing She said the need for a pass meant it put ""more pressure on people testing positive not to mix and we want to keep the rates down"". ""There are issues with only using lateral flow tests because it is hard to police them, it's relying on the word of the person doing them if it is negative,"" she said. Business owner Skye Noman says her staff will all need passes so they can go to festivals and other events for work But some business owners said the introduction of the passes was unfair and would have repercussions for those trying to recover after the Covid lockdowns. Skye Noman, 21, from Cardiff, who set up her Oh My Shakes business during the first national lockdown in 2020, said she thought the Covid pass would be divisive. ""It's different for everybody isn't it, some people will want the vaccine and then get their passport, other people won't for personal reasons,"" she said. ""And then to only allow those in who have got the passport seems a bit, I wouldn't say discriminatory, but it's making two different sides. ""We will be attending festivals and events, so it will definitely affect us because I'm sure my staff will be attending these events and will all need the passports as well."" With Tuesday's vote causing controversy afterone Conservative Member of the Senedd said he was unable to vote remotely, there have been calls for another vote. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA), said his industry was ""devastated"" by the decision, particularly as it was so close. Vaccine passports in Wales: Are you for or against? He said business owners felt ""somewhat outraged"" at the circumstances. He called the decision ""unfair and undemocratic"" and said the NTIA had requested another vote. ""This is a fundamental vote and will impact so many businesses and so many livelihoods it cannot be taken lightly,"" he said. Michael Kill says the industry does not take safety lightly ""We're still a very fragile industry and for this to be put in place at a time of such fragility, given the fact we've got some issues around staff shortages, and trade at the moment is starting to top up the losses, the huge losses and the debt that have been built up over this period. ""You can understand why some of the operators amongst us are very concerned at this coming in. ""No one wants to compromise public health, but we also want to be treated fairly,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Kwasi Kwarteng: ""The energy price cap stays"" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has not committed to any additional government help for businesses struggling amid record gas prices. Some industries have warned firms could be forced to shut down operations. Mr Kwarteng said he was working closely with the chancellor over possible support for energy intensive sectors - but a Treasury source denied this. The business secretary said domestic customers would not see a change to the energy price cap this winter. Asked on BBC One's Andrew Marr programme whether there would be additional government help for energy-intensive companies, Mr Kwarteng described the situation as ""critical"" and said he was ""looking to find a solution"". When Andrew Marr suggested this sounded like a ""yes"" the business secretary said: ""No, it doesn't sound like yes at all. ""We already have existing support and we're looking to see whether that's sufficient to get us through this situation."" Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Speaking to Times Radio Mr Kwarteng, who met leaders from heavy industry on Friday, said he was not going to commit to ""any firm figure or subsidy"" for companies. Asked about whether the government would ensure factories would not have to close if they could not pay for gas he said it was a commercial decision and ""up to them"". He added: ""We are not in the business of bail-outs. What we are in the business of is ensuring security of supply and that is what I am focused on."" Wholesale gas prices have risen 250% since January. CEO of British Glass Dave Dalton, who was at Friday's meeting with Mr Kwarteng, said some of the confederation's ""significant"" members were ""teetering on the edge"". ""I think some companies are staring down the ability to survive, absolutely - ultimately that obviously cascades on to jobs and impacts on the consumer,"" he told the BBC. Gareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, said he was frustrated by the lack of action to support businesses. He told the BBC that without help in the next week or so, there would be ""significant and permanent damage to the UK steel sector"". Unite leader Sharon Graham said the country was ""contemplating factory shutdowns across viable manufacturing and businesses"" and that workers were ""worried sick"". Businesses have been shouting louder and louder for support through this period of soaring energy prices. This morning, the business secretary told the BBC he was listening to their concerns - but would not commit to any extra support. Those industries that use a lot of energy for manufacturing say that the time for working out a way forward has long gone. The director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, expressed his frustration, saying pauses in steel production will only increase. The government says the current situation emphasises the need for a revolution in how we generate energy, moving towards home-grown renewables. But that's little comfort for those businesses dependent on energy from fossil fuels now, competing with intense demand in a global market. On the Andrew Marr show, Mr Kwarteng denied asking for ""billions"" from the Treasury to subsidise energy-intensive businesses and said supply itself was ""not an issue"". A Treasury source said the business secretary had been ""mistaken"" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government ""needs to get a grip"" and called for ""urgent answers on who exactly is running the show"". ""The two key government departments responsible for the current cost of living crisis have spent this morning infighting about whether they were in talks with each other. What a farce,"" she said. She also accused the government of having ""put its out of office on"", referring to reports that the prime minister is on holiday in Spain. A number of Conservative MPs have called for the government to take action to support heavy industry. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on the UKgovernment to ""nurse"" businesses through the crisis, describing it as a ""perfect storm"". The domestic consumer energy price cap, which is reviewed every six months, sets the maximum level a supplier can charge a consumer on a standard tariff in England, Wales and Scotland. Mr Kwarteng told Marr that protecting consumers was his ""first and foremost objective"" and as such the price cap would stay at its current level until its next update which is due to in April. Some suppliers say the cap is just delaying an inevitable increase in consumer prices and should be reviewed more regularly. Energy regulator Ofgem has warned households will seefurther ""significant rises"" in the spring, when the cap is reviewed. Asked by Marr if he was sure the lights would stay on this winter, Mr Kwarteng said ""yes, I am"". Due to high gas prices household energy suppliers have been forced to sell gas for less than they can buy it due to the price cap, leading some to fail. Last month, nine domestic energy supply companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers and on to higher rates. Paul Richards, chief executive of Together Energy, which he said is currently making losses, said while he supported a price cap to protect customers, the current mechanism ""is not fit for industry, nor is it fit for customers"". He said it protected customers in the short term but somewhere between Â£1bn and Â£3bn in costs would be spread back across business and households as a result of suppliers going bust. The founder of OVO Energy Stephen Fitzpatrick told Marr that it has been ""too easy"" for companies to enter the energy market and that there will be more companies in difficulty. He said the market was a complicated one, and he thought some people had not understood the risks. A LOVE LETTER TO THE NORTH:The Hairy Bikers head to Cumbria and the Lake District!

"Scottish firms raised prices last month at the sharpest rate since at least 1999 in the face of severe inflationary pressures, according to a survey. The latest Royal Bank of Scotland purchasing managers' index (PMI) suggested companies were having to pass on the rising costs of materials, pay, logistics, Covid and Brexit. Cost burdens were reported to be rising at their quickest rate since 2008. RBS said firms raised average charges ""to a degree unseen"" in two decades. The survey was compiled by IHS Markit from a panel of about 500 manufacturers and service providers. On a positive note, the survey found manufacturing and service sector output rose for a seventh straight month. However, September saw the slowest rate of increase for five months, as a sustained upturn in services was slightly offset by a renewed fall in manufacturing output. For the sixth time in as many months, inflows of new work rose, with respondents linking the latest uplift with strong client demand, in part due to the relaxation of lockdown restrictions. Although still sharp overall, expansion eased to its slowest rate since April, as sustained growth at services firms was partially offset by a fresh decline in manufacturing order book volumes. The pace of expansion in new business across Scotland was broadly in line with the UK average. Meanwhile, the survey highlighted a sustained rise in Scottish private sector employment. Panellists linked the latest upturn in staffing levels to higher workloads. Furthermore, the rate of job creation accelerated to a four-month high and was sharp overall. Scotland also registered the third-quickest increase in employment across the 12 monitored UK areas in September, behind only London and Wales. RBS Scotland board chairman Malcolm Buchanan said Scotland's private sector ""remained on a growth footing"" in September but some momentum had been lost due to fresh reductions in both output and order book volumes at goods producers. He added: ""Although the latest data does indicate a slight slowdown in growth, the third quarter as a whole nonetheless saw to one of the quickest expansions of the private sector on record and it remains in a strong position as we enter the closing months of the year."" Colin Borland, director of devolved nations for the Federation of Small Businesses, said currently two-thirds of firms were reporting an increase in running costs compared with this time last year. He added: ""In businesses who have very little, if any, headroom, something has to give. If every ounce of fat has already been trimmed, if every efficiency has been maxed out, then unfortunately you are going to have to look at price rises."" There's lots to welcome about the latest data on the Scottish economy. The PMI tells us that there's been a sustained recovery out of the winter lockdown. July to September was one of the strongest quarters for economic growth that we've ever seen. The economy was reopening, and people were out spending. Growth was inevitable, although its strength in early summer surprised some forecasters. It was also a certainty that the pace would slow down. It could not be sustained. But what was less easy to forecast were the combined disruptions that have made price inflation one of the main concerns: Brexit making it uneconomic for some to continue trading across the North Sea, supply shortages, shipping costs and delays, the haulage driver shortage, wage inflation and an energy price boom. These have not worked their way through the system. Price inflation is now being forecast to rise sharply next spring, when the cap on domestic heating costs is due to be raised next, probably by hundreds of pounds for the average gas-heated home. Gas prices have come down off an exceptional peak, but remain well ahead of the start of this year. Oil prices are continuing to rise. With labour shortages, it seems likely that wage inflation has barely begun. The questions now are how long this is sustained, and will action be required by central banks to rein in price inflation?

"The drawing was found in bubble wrap and leaning against a wall in an attic A drawing by a great Italian artist of the 18th Century is to go under the hammer after it was found in a loft. The work by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo was uncovered at Weston Hall, near Towcester, Northamptonshire, ahead of the manor house being put up for sale. Henrietta Sitwell, whose family owned Weston for 300 years, said it was one of many ""exciting discoveries"". Auctioneers Dreweatts said it was ""probably the most important find"" at the house and could fetch Â£250,000. The auction of the hall's contents, calledWeston Hall and the Sitwells: A Family Legacy,external, takes place on 16 and 17 November at Donnington Priory in Berkshire. Ms Sitwell said her great-uncle, the writer Osbert Sitwell, bought the drawing in 1936, and no-one had known where it was until last year. ""As I peeled back the wrapping, I instantly recognised it as something special,"" she added. ""It was thrilling to think that such a captivating and important work of art by such a revered Old Master was just lying there gathering dust over the years."" Tiepolo (1696-1770) wasdescribed by the National Gallery,externalas ""the greatest Italian Rococo painter"" whose main subjects were Christian and mythical figures. The work features Punchinello, the hook-nosed, humpbacked clowns who were some of the stock characters taken from the Commedia dell' Arte - an early form of professional theatre. It has been given a ""conservative estimate"" of Â£150,000-Â£250,000, Dreweatts said. The sale also features clothing and jewellery that belonged to poet and writerEdith Sitwell.

"Cyber-attacks which see hackers get inside computer networks and lock the owners out until they pay a ransom present ""the most immediate danger"" to UK businesses in cyber-space, the head of the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) has warned. Lindy Cameron said her agency, an arm of GCHQ, and the National Crime Agency had assessed that cyber-criminals based in Russia, and its neighbours, were responsible for the most of the ""devastating"" ransomware attacks against the UK. She said these types of attack posed a threat to everyone from major companies to local councils and schools. Speaking at the Chatham House Cyber 2021 conference, Ms Cameron warned that not enough organisations were prepared for the threat or tested their cyber-defences. Lindy Cameron has been chief executive of the National Cyber Security Centre, the agency tasked with defending the UK in cyberspace, for just over a year Increasingly in recent cases, criminal gangs have also threatened to release some of the data they have access to publicly. Foreign Secretary issues warning on cyber-attacks Technology moves to the heart of UK security GCHQ chief warns of tech 'moment of reckoning' Hackney Borough Council was hit by one attack which led to significant disruption to services and IT systems going down for months. Ireland's Health Service Executive also suffered a significant attack this year, leading to months of disrupted appointments and services. Ransomware has risen up the agenda in recent months, particularly the United States wherean attack on the company Colonial Pipeline led to fuel shortages on the east coast. President Bidenwarned President Vladimir Putin about activity that came from gangs within Russia. A ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline in the US led to fuel shortages on the east coast of the country There had been some signs that Russian-linked activity dipped over the summer but cyber-security experts believe much of that may be to do with the hackers taking their summer holiday rather than any fundamental shift away from what has been a highly-lucrative business model. Ms Cameron said that ransomware would continue to be attractive while organisations remained vulnerable and were willing to pay. She said the government had been clear that paying ransoms simply emboldened criminal groups. As well as improving its defences, she also said the UK would aim to deliver a ""sustained, proactive"" campaign to disrupt those harming the UK, including ransomware gangs. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? This would include a range of techniques including the newly established National Cyber Force which can carry out offensive hacking operations. In a wide-ranging speech, Ms Cameron, who has served just over a year as head of the NCSC, said the pandemic continued to cast a shadow over cyber-security and was likely to do so for years to come. ""Malicious actors continue to try and access Covid related information, whether that is data on new variants or vaccine procurement plans,"" she said. ""Some groups may also seek to use this information to undermine public trust in government responses to the pandemic. And criminals are now regularly using Covid-themed attacks as a way of scamming the public."" She also made reference to the recent revelations about the Pegasus spyware sold by the company NSO Group, saying that the NCSC has raised a ""red flag"" about the growing commercial market for sophisticated products which can be used to hack into people's phones and carry out surveillance. Last week a UK court ruling found that NSO spyware had been used to hack into the phones of the ex-wife of Dubai's ruler. ""We need to avoid a marketplace for vulnerabilities and exploits developing that makes us all less safe,"" she said. She warned of the dangers of ""authoritarian states like China"" having the ability to influence the standards of new technology in a way that undermines the UK's security. She said the UK needed to be ""clear eyed"" and protect itself ""against Chinese practices that have an adverse effect on our own prosperity and security"".

"Asos has announced its chief executive is leaving with immediate effect as the online fashion giant warned that rising costs are set to hit its profits. Nick Beighton is stepping down after six years in the role and the day-to-day running of the firm will be taken over by Asos' finance chief. Asos also cautioned that next year's profits could fall by as much as 40%. The company had benefited from lower rates of people returning clothing during Covid-19 lockdowns. Asos said this had resulted in Â£67.3m of cost savings, but it said that the levels of returns were now normalising. Profits are also likely to be affected by increased freight costs, Brexit duty, outbound delivery costs and higher wages. While adjusted pre-tax profit rose 36% to Â£193.6m for the 12 months to 31 August, Asos now expects this figure to fall to between Â£110m and Â£140m next year. Asos's share price tumbled by 15% in early trading before regaining a little ground. Its share price is down 42% since the beginning of 2021. The warning of lower future profits overshadowed its results for the year to 31 August, which showed sales rose 22% to Â£3.9bn. Asos said it had attracted another 1.4 million customers over the past year as people turned to online shopping amid lockdowns. Throughout the period leisurewear became more popular, and this added to profits as it is less likely to be returned than more formal clothes. Asos said returns were already normalising, adding that the new customers it attracted in the last year were more likely to send clothes back. ""Asos has enjoyed a huge boost to trading over lockdowns, albeit for less-lucrative casual wear as its core demographic was stuck at home,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""A reluctance to leave the house meant return rates were lower, resulting in XL margins. However, the tailwinds are easing and the Asos bubble has burst."" Asos also set out changes at the top of the business to ""deliver next phase of global growth"". It said Mr Beighton ""and the board have agreed that now is the right time for him to step down"" as chief executive. A search for his replacement is under way but in the meantime chief financial officer Mat Dunn will oversee the day-to-day running of the business. Chief executive Nick Beighton is leaving Asos with immediate effect The company's chairman, Adam Crozier - who will also be leaving Asos shortly to become chairman of BT - said the firm had a new five-year strategy and Mr Beighton had not wanted to stay for at least half of that so it was better to make the change now. ""Asos's management and board have spent considerable time over recent months developing and validating a clear strategic plan to accelerate international growth, building on Asos's undoubted strength in the UK,"" he said. ""Key to that is ensuring that we have the right leadership in place for the next phase, and the changes we are announcing today are designed to ensure we deliver against our clear strategic intent."" Asos has been one of the big winners in this pandemic as people turned to online shopping during lockdowns. But it's facing the same supply chain problems as everyone else in retail including a host of increasing costs - from pay for warehouse workers to the shipping of containers of clothes from the far east, which is likely to put a huge dent in its profits for next year. Getting the right products at the right time is also challenging. And shoppers are now settling back into to old habits when it comes to returns. Younger online shoppers often order multiple products and send back those they don't want. But last year it saw fewer returns as its customers switched to less fitted items like leggings and hoodies. But those charges are now starting to normalise along with overall sales.  Asos has outlined ambitious plans for expansion over the next three years but that will be without its chief executive Nick Beighton who's leaving with immediate effect - a surprise announcement after 12 years with the business. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics said Mr Beighton's departure had come as ""huge surprise"" and Asos was ""losing someone that has been instrumental to its success over the last decade"". ""The share price has been under recent pressure reflecting the challenges of delivering stellar levels of growth in a more hostile environment and tough comparisons from last year. ""Supply chain disruptions, fierce competitor dynamics and an intense focus on sustainability have created a more challenging outlook for the business over the coming years and seemingly resulted in a big boardroom shakeup."" Mr Beighton, who has been with Asos for 12 years in total, said in a statement he had enjoyed ""every moment"" of his time at the firm. He said when he joined Asos had fewer than 200 people and sales of Â£220m, turnover was now almost Â£4bn selling to 26 million customers in 200 countries.

Profits are also likely to be affected by increased freight costs, Brexit duty, outbound delivery costs and higher wages. While adjusted pre-tax profit rose 36% to Â£193.6m for the 12 months to 31 August, Asos now expects this figure to fall to between Â£110m and Â£140m next year. Asos's share price tumbled by 15% in early trading before regaining a little ground. Its share price is down 42% since the beginning of 2021. The warning of lower future profits overshadowed its results for the year to 31 August, which showed sales rose 22% to Â£3.9bn. Asos said it had attracted another 1.4 million customers over the past year as people turned to online shopping amid lockdowns. Throughout the period leisurewear became more popular, and this added to profits as it is less likely to be returned than more formal clothes. Asos said returns were already normalising, adding that the new customers it attracted in the last year were more likely to send clothes back. ""Asos has enjoyed a huge boost to trading over lockdowns, albeit for less-lucrative casual wear as its core demographic was stuck at home,"" said Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""A reluctance to leave the house meant return rates were lower, resulting in XL margins. However, the tailwinds are easing and the Asos bubble has burst."" Asos also set out changes at the top of the business to ""deliver next phase of global growth"". It said Mr Beighton ""and the board have agreed that now is the right time for him to step down"" as chief executive. A search for his replacement is under way but in the meantime chief financial officer Mat Dunn will oversee the day-to-day running of the business. Chief executive Nick Beighton is leaving Asos with immediate effect The company's chairman, Adam Crozier - who will also be leaving Asos shortly to become chairman of BT - said the firm had a new five-year strategy and Mr Beighton had not wanted to stay for at least half of that so it was better to make the change now. ""Asos's management and board have spent considerable time over recent months developing and validating a clear strategic plan to accelerate international growth, building on Asos's undoubted strength in the UK,"" he said. ""Key to that is ensuring that we have the right leadership in place for the next phase, and the changes we are announcing today are designed to ensure we deliver against our clear strategic intent."" Asos has been one of the big winners in this pandemic as people turned to online shopping during lockdowns. But it's facing the same supply chain problems as everyone else in retail including a host of increasing costs - from pay for warehouse workers to the shipping of containers of clothes from the far east, which is likely to put a huge dent in its profits for next year. Getting the right products at the right time is also challenging. And shoppers are now settling back into to old habits when it comes to returns. Younger online shoppers often order multiple products and send back those they don't want. But last year it saw fewer returns as its customers switched to less fitted items like leggings and hoodies. But those charges are now starting to normalise along with overall sales.  Asos has outlined ambitious plans for expansion over the next three years but that will be without its chief executive Nick Beighton who's leaving with immediate effect - a surprise announcement after 12 years with the business. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics said Mr Beighton's departure had come as ""huge surprise"" and Asos was ""losing someone that has been instrumental to its success over the last decade"". ""The share price has been under recent pressure reflecting the challenges of delivering stellar levels of growth in a more hostile environment and tough comparisons from last year. ""Supply chain disruptions, fierce competitor dynamics and an intense focus on sustainability have created a more challenging outlook for the business over the coming years and seemingly resulted in a big boardroom shakeup."" Mr Beighton, who has been with Asos for 12 years in total, said in a statement he had enjoyed ""every moment"" of his time at the firm.

"The drawing was found in bubble wrap and leaning against a wall in an attic A drawing by a great Italian artist of the 18th Century is to go under the hammer after it was found in a loft. The work by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo was uncovered at Weston Hall, near Towcester, Northamptonshire, ahead of the manor house being put up for sale. Henrietta Sitwell, whose family owned Weston for 300 years, said it was one of many ""exciting discoveries"". Auctioneers Dreweatts said it was ""probably the most important find"" at the house and could fetch Â£250,000. The auction of the hall's contents, calledWeston Hall and the Sitwells: A Family Legacy,external, takes place on 16 and 17 November at Donnington Priory in Berkshire. Ms Sitwell said her great-uncle, the writer Osbert Sitwell, bought the drawing in 1936, and no-one had known where it was until last year. ""As I peeled back the wrapping, I instantly recognised it as something special,"" she added. ""It was thrilling to think that such a captivating and important work of art by such a revered Old Master was just lying there gathering dust over the years."" Tiepolo (1696-1770) wasdescribed by the National Gallery,externalas ""the greatest Italian Rococo painter"" whose main subjects were Christian and mythical figures. The work features Punchinello, the hook-nosed, humpbacked clowns who were some of the stock characters taken from the Commedia dell' Arte - an early form of professional theatre. It has been given a ""conservative estimate"" of Â£150,000-Â£250,000, Dreweatts said. The sale also features clothing and jewellery that belonged to poet and writerEdith Sitwell.

"Ireland's foreign minister has accused the UK of repeatedly dismissing EU proposals on the Northern Ireland Protocol before they are published. This is happening again this week but it is now ""more serious"", Simon Coveney has warned. The protocol isthe special Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, which the UK and EU agreed in 2019. Unionists argue it creates a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. They say it undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position as part of the UK. The EUwill bring forward proposals on Wednesday for reforming the protocol. The proposals will focus on easing practical problems with the movement of goods from Britain to Northern Ireland, rather than changing oversight arrangements. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson,who has threatened to pull his party out of Stormont over the protocol, said on Monday that this week was important. ""Let's see what people have to put on the table,"" he said. ""Let's see that intensive negotiation take place and then we'll make our judgements on the outcome against the tests that we have set and determine what action we should take."" What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Mr Coveney told RTÃ's Morning Ireland programme that the UK's dismissals were now ""more serious"", given the comprehensive compromise proposals the EU is bringing forward. ""Each time the EU comes forward with new ideas, new proposals to try to solve problems, they are dismissed before they are released and that is happening again this week,"" Mr Coveney said. Maros Å efÄoviÄ told an event in Dublin that he hoped talks would begin before the end of October He said dismissals were being seen across the EU as ""the same pattern, over and over again"" by the UK. At the weekend, Mr Coveneywarned UK demands on the Northern Ireland Protocol could cause ""a breakdown in relations"" with the EU. He made the comments after the UK reiterated that it wants the European Court of Justice (ECJ) removed from oversight of the deal. Mr Coveney said this was the creation of a new ""red line"" which the EU cannot move on. The European Commission said the ECJ's role in the protocol was ground that has been covered ""a million times"". Its chief spokesperson, Eric Mamer, told a briefing on Monday that the EU's position on this issue remained ""extremely clear"". He said it was looking for solutions to the practical issues that affect the daily lives of people. Mr Mamer said the commission wanted to be constructive and open, ""but in the framework of the agreement as it has been signed"". On Tuesday, the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost will give a speech in which he is expected to tell diplomats that removing the ECJ's role in dispute settlement is necessary to sustain the protocol. Lord Frost is due to give his speech on Tuesday He is due to say: ""Without new arrangements in this area the protocol will never have the support it needs to survive. ""The role of the ECJ in Northern Ireland and the consequent inability of the UK government to implement the very sensitive arrangements in the protocol in a reasonable way has created a deep imbalance in the way the protocol operates."" There are two schools of thought about how this latest negotiation is shaping up. The first is that Lord Frost's hard line on the ECJ is standard pre-negotiation tactics, aimed at grinding out another concession or two. After all the Brexit process has always delivered a deal, even at times when it seemed improbable. There is another view, hinted at by Simon Coveney, that maybe the UK doesn't want a deal unless it's total victory. Under that scenario the UK would go through the motions before triggering Article 16. It would use this to gut the protocol while calculating that the EU's ability to retaliate is limited or or at least would take a long time to amount to anything. We should find out which view is right by the end of this year. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said on Monday that his party had concerns around the jurisdiction of the ECJ. ""We do not believe they are fully independent when it comes to arbitrating on issues related to trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""We recognise why the government has that concern, but the government in the end, they are the negotiating party and they have to press these issues."" Boris Johnson says NI Protocol could work if it was 'fixed' What is Article 16 and what exactly does it say? However, the chief executive of Manufacturing NI, Stephen Kelly, said business needed clarity and certainty, not ""spats and ultimatums"". Responding to the UK's call to have the ECJ removed from oversight of the deal, Mr Kelly said that many businesses across Northern Ireland relied upon single market access enforced by the court to ensure their goods travelled freely and legally right across the EU. Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, called for greater clarity Former Ulster Unionist Party leader and UUP MLA Steve Aiken said there were concerns particularly around governance of the Northern Ireland Protocol. He said the implications of issues concerning the ECJ, which he said differentiates VAT and state aid rules and regulations, had not yet been seen. ""Those are real concerns for us,"" he told Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. Sinn FÃ©in assembly member Declan Kearney said ""we are seeing the goal posts shift once more"" in relation to the UK's negotiation strategy. ""This may well be a negotiation tactic. ""We are now approaching the point where hopefully all of these issues can be successfully covered off and that we can in fact see the difficulties with the protocol finally eliminated, and that David Frost is simply trying to up the ante and bring some more heat into the talks process that will follow publication of the European Union proposals."" SDLP assembly member Matthew O'Toole said from initial reports it appeared that the EU proposals would go ""further than most people in the UK government and even some in unionism and indeed in business were asking for earlier this year"". ""That is encouraging, there then needs to be a period of engagement between the UK and the EU to make those work,"" he told Radio Ulster's the Nolan Show. ""It is deeply disappointing, however, that the UK government has chosen to pick a fight already over proposals that have not yet been published and proposals that by all accounts are going to be substantial."" Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said the ""big issue"" was ""the destruction"" of Northern Ireland's links ""with GB and our supply chain"". ""The people in the Irish Republic wouldn't accept it if two thirds of their economy laws were made in London,"" he said. ""Northern Ireland shouldn't have to accept the fact that two thirds of the laws governing their economy are made in Brussels. That's the constitutional issue.""

"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

"Lord Frost led the UK's negotiations over Brexit The UK's Brexit minister has threatened to suspend parts of the deal with the EU if the bloc does not agree changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Lord Frost said the protocol - put in place to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland - was ""not working and needs to change"". He said he worried the UK's proposals would not be agreed by the EU. Lord Frost said triggering Article 16, which would suspend part of the deal, may end up as ""the only way"" forward. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? 'Good faith shown' by not triggering Article 16 PM says NI Protocol could work if it was 'fixed' Article 16 move would be tragic, Labour warns The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed by both sides as a way to protect the Good Friday Agreement by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. But Unionists have said the protocol damages trade with other parts of the UK by creating a border in the Irish Sea. Article 16 can be triggered by either the UK or EU to suspend elements of the Brexit deal on the condition that the protocol is causing ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to diversion of trade"". But critics say it would only be a temporary fix and not solve the long-term issues which the protocol has raised. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the government believed ""the conditions have been met"" to trigger Article 16. But while he said the government was willing to trigger it, they preferred the option of negotiating a ""sustainable"" agreement with the EU. ""The EU has got to come to the table in good faith,"" he added. ""They have got to work with us to get a solution that delivers."" An EU spokeswoman said they would not comment on Lord Frost's remarks, ""however lyrical or aggressive they may be"". But they said the bloc was ""working intensively to find practical solutions to some of the difficulties that people in Northern Ireland are experiencing"". Speaking at the Conservative Party conference, Lord Frost said the government ""knew [it was] taking a risk"" when it agreed to the protocol in the autumn of 2019, claiming his team were ""worried right from the start that the protocol would not take the strain if not handled sensitively"". But he said the arrangements were ""going to come apart even more quickly than we feared"", and support for the protocol had collapsed across Northern Ireland. ""We can still solve these problems,"" said Lord Frost, pointing to proposals he sent to the EU in July. ""We still await a formal response from the EU... but from what I hear, I worry that we will not get a response that enables the significant change we need,"" he added. ""So I urge the EU to be ambitious. There is no use tinkering around the edges. We need significant change."" Later, the minister told a fringe event at the conference that he expected to get a response to the UK's proposals within the next two weeks, adding: ""We need a short, intensive and good faith talks process to happen quite soon. We need to show we've tried everything."" And at another event, he referred to the negotiations, which, he indicated, could last ""three weeks or so"". The EU has sent its own proposals to the UK on changes the protocol, but Lord Frost did not mention them in his speech. Instead he said if the two sides did not come up with a solution, ""using the Article 16 safeguard mechanism to address the impact the protocol is having in Northern Ireland...may in the end be the only way to protect our country, our people, our trade and our territorial integrity, the peace process and the benefits to this great UK"". The threat to trigger Article 16 is not new. Lord Frost has made it a number of times. But a decision is fast approaching. It would not spell the end of the Northern Ireland Protocol. Article 16 only suspends limited aspects of the agreement, even though the UK government is looking for a much wider-ranging renegotiation of the deal it signed up to less than two years ago. As it stands, the future of Northern Ireland looks set to bedevil relations between the UK and the EU for some time. And Lord Frost's negotiating style is certainly brusque. A few years ago, in another job, he was singing the praises of the single market. Now, in this speech, the EU is ""heavy-handed"" and British membership was a ""long bad dream"". It's a challenging basis from which to launch the close partnership with its neighbours that the government says it wants. The leader of the DUP, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson,told an event at the Conservative conferencehe was ""confident"" the government was moving in the right direction and that action would be taken on the protocol. But the MP said he had made it clear ""the clock was ticking"" and the government must ""arrest the harm"" the protocol is doing to Northern Ireland and the economy. Labour's shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh, said: ""Lord Frost negotiated every single word of the deal he now discredits at every opportunity, and as this speech proves, their approach is inflaming tensions while solving nothing.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson said he believes the Northern Ireland Protocol could ""in principle work"" if it was ""fixed"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he believes the Northern Ireland Protocol could ""in principle work"" if it was ""fixed"". But he also did not rule out triggering Article 16 if the EU failed to come up with plans to deal with current issues. Mr Johnson's comments came in an interview with BBC News NI. He also talked aboutthe government's controversial legacy proposals, which seek to end all Troubles-related prosecutions before 1998. Mr Johnson insisted he did not want to ""deny"" anyone justice but felt it was time for Northern Ireland to ""move on"". The prime minister said he wanted the EU to come to the table with serious proposals to fix the Northern Ireland Protocol. ""The fundamental problem for us is that it is very difficult to operate in an environment where the EU system can decide when and how many checks can be carried out across the Irish Sea,"" he said. ""Goods are being pointlessly interrupted, and it is crazy to have cancer drugs which you can't move from one part of the UK to another."" Post-Brexit goods checks are being carried out at Northern Ireland's ports as a result of the protocol The Northern Ireland Protocol is a post-Brexit trade arrangement, which was agreed by the UK and the EU in order to avoid the reintroduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland. Under the terms of the protocol, Northern Ireland must still apply EU single market rules at its ports, in order to avoid the need for checks along the Irish land border as goods enter the EU. In practice, this means some products moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland have been subject to new checks, which has angered many unionists who feel this is damaging trade, supply lines and Northern Ireland's position within the UK. What's the Northern Ireland Protocol? DUP snubs second north-south meeting in days Labour leader calls on PM to step in over Protocol However, the prime minister said it was possible for the protocol to function. ""The protocol could in principle work,"" he said. ""It has got enough leeway in the language for it to be applied in a common sense way without creating too many checks down the Irish Sea."" But he warned it will come down to ""fixing it or ditching it"". Asked if he planned to trigger Article 16 during next week's Conservative Party conference he said ""that depends on the response from the EU"". The prime minister was also questioned as to why he signed up to a deal which created a border down the Irish Sea. He denied that he was naÃ¯ve but said he had an ""optimistic view of human nature and thought they (EU) would want to respect the Belfast Good Friday Agreement"". He added the protocol was framed to operate ""free trade east to west just as much as north to south and that was very, very clear but unfortunately that is not the way it is being operated"". Mr Johnson also defended the government's legacy proposals, which if adopted would see an end to all Troubles-related prosecution prior to 1998. ""We are trying to find a way forward and draw a line under one of the most wretched and miserable periods in our recent history,"" he said. ""We need to find a way of allowing people to reach an understanding of what happened and allowing families to reach closure while at the same time drawing a line."" He added ""We don't want to deny anybody justice but what we do want is to heal, bring people together in a process of understanding of what happened but also to say to the people that it time for Northern Ireland to move on"" DUP snubs second north-south meeting in days What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

"A deal to avert another carbon dioxide crisis in the food and drink industry has been extended until early 2022. US firm CF Industries, a key CO2 producer in the UK, has agreed to continue supplies of the gas. It said that should give the government and firms time to find other sources of CO2, used in fizzy drinks and for keeping food fresh, as well as to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter. Firms will now have to pay more for their CO2, but it is unclear how much. Last month, the government stepped in to subsidise one of the firm's plants after its shutdown due to high gas prices threatened food supplies. CF Industries suspended production at two sites - Cheshire and Billingham - which make 60% of the UK's commercial carbon dioxide. It reopened its Billingham plant in north-east Englandafter the government agreed to meet the costsof running it for three weeks. Billingham produces up to 750 tonnes of CO2 per day as a by-product of producing ammonia for fertiliser. CF Industries' plant at Ince in Cheshire remains closed with no date given for a reopening. The government said: ""CO2 suppliers have agreed to pay CF Fertilisers a price for the CO2 it produces that will enable it to continue operating while global gas prices remain high, drawing on support from industry and delivering value for money for the taxpayer."" The agreement meant industry could have confidence it would receive future CO2 supplies, without further taxpayer support, said the government. The British Meat Processors Association said the agreement provided ""some reassurance that supplies will be maintained"". ""However, industry has been given no detail on what the price will be or how it will be calculated going forward,"" a spokesperson added. ""We understand that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng took the decision to temporarily exempt parts of the CO2 industry from competition law to facilitate this agreement. What we need now is some detail and transparency around how the new pricing structure will work."" Why are gas prices so high? Minister asks Treasury to help firms over gas cost What's CO2 used for in food and drink? Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said the agreement was ""welcome news"". But he added: ""The increased cost of buying CO2 is yet another burden on the food and drink industry, which is already facing enormous stresses. ""This will, of course, add more pressure on prices for shoppers and diners."" By Ben King, business reporter It looks like there will be enough CO2 to keep Christmas beers bubbly - but after that, there are no guarantees. There's an ominous line in the CF Industries press release. They expect CO2 users to develop ""robust alternative sources"" between now and January. That won't be easily done. Lots of industrial processes produce CO2, but few produce a stream so pure and reliable that you'd want to dissolve it in your lemonade. Distributor Nippon Gases has warned that supply is tight across Europe, so imports will be hard to come by. The government says that the firms which need the CO2 from Billingham will be paying more for it - and whatever long-term solution does emerge, it's likely to be more expensive too. But the UK only needs about 600,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. At about Â£200 a tonne before the current crisis, that's about Â£120m, relatively small beer for industries that count their turnover in the billions. Compared to the other pressures those industries face - staff shortages, and higher costs for energy and shipping - more expensive CO2 is an extra cost they don't need, but it won't be their biggest headache. When CF shut its facilities after making fertiliser became uneconomic because of the rising price of wholesale gas, it cut off a vital source of CO2 for other sectors. Supermarkets began reporting limited stocks of some food items, while the pig industry warned that if slaughterhouses could not process animals, then farmers would have to cull their stocks. The US firm said it now expected the UK government and industrial gas customers to ""develop robust alternative sources of CO2 as part of a long-term solution for meeting demand in the country"". Last month, it emerged the British food industry would be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with CF Industries to restart production in the UK. Environment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from Â£200 per tonne to Â£1,000. Households, too, are being hit by higher energy bills, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use,seeing bills go up by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year on average. Several energy suppliers, unable to pass on wholesale prices to consumers on fixed deal, have gone out of business. Their customers have been switched to other suppliers, but will be put on variable contracts that will be higher than previous deals. Meanwhile, the business department has sent the Treasury a formal request for support for energy-intensive industries hit by high gas prices, the BBC understands. It came after talks between ministers and industry leaders earlier on Monday. A source said: ""Everyone in government understands the importance of this situation. ""We need to solve this quickly."" Details of the proposal from Mr Kwarteng have not been disclosed but are thought to focus on a temporary solution to high energy prices. On Sunday, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the situation was ""critical"" and said he was ""looking to find a solution"". Mr Kwarteng said there were Treasury talks about support measures to ease the impact on firms. However, a Treasury source later said the business secretary had been ""mistaken"". Sectors such as ceramics, paper and steel manufacturing have called for a price cap, though talks with government on Friday failed to reach a solution.

"A County Down construction firm has closed resulting in about 100 job losses. JMC Mechanical and Construction is based in Waringstown, but has premises in Bleary and Lisburn as well. Its work includes providing maintenance services to the Housing Executive and other social housing providers. ThePortadown Times,externalreported workers were told on Monday afternoon by the firm's owner James McCully and an accountant. The family business was established in 2000. Speaking to BBC News NI, Sinn FÃ©in assembly member John O'Dowd said employees were ""called in and told they had no work"". ""They were told they weren't going to be paid for last week's work and there was also a question mark over redundancy,"" he added. ""My main concern is for the workers and their families. ""I already have a question in to the economy minister asking how his department are going to support and protect these workers and have already made contact with the liquidators."" Democratic Unionist Party MP for Upper Bann Carla Lockhart said it was devastating news for employees and their families. She said JMC was a longstanding and respected company that had ""obviously suffered greatly as a result of the pandemic"". SDLP assembly member Dolores Kelly said the news came as a ""huge shock"". ""I am heartened to hear that a number of employees have already secured jobs and hope the rest will soon, especially at a time when skilled tradespeople are in such high demand,"" she added. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Housing Executive said: ""We are sorry to hear that one of our contractors, JMC Ltd, has announced that it is entering liquidation. ""The company was the repairs contractor for our tenants in the Lisburn and Castlereagh area and was also the contractor for a number of improvement schemes across Lisburn and Castlereagh and the Belfast area.

"Sir Richard Sutton's wealth was valued at Â£301m in the 2020 Sunday Times Rich List A man has admitted killing one of the UK's richest men, Sir Richard Sutton. Thomas Schreiber denied murdering Sir Richard, 83, who was stabbed to death at his home near Gillingham, Dorset, in April, but admitted his manslaughter. He also entered a not guilty plea at Winchester Crown Court to the attempted murder of his mother Anne Schreiber, who was Sir Richard's partner. A murder trial is due to begin on 29 November. Schreiber, of Gillingham, Dorset, also pleaded guilty to driving a Range Rover dangerously on the A303, A4 and M3. The judge, Mr Justice Garnham, remanded him in custody. Police were called to an address in Higher Langham, near Gillingham, Dorset, at 19:30 BST on 7 April. They found Sir Richard, who owned a string of top hotels in London, and Ms Schreiber with serious injuries. Sir Richard was pronounced dead at the scene almost two hours later. An initial post-mortem examination indicated that the cause of death was stab wounds to his chest, police said previously. Ms Schreiber was airlifted to Southmead Hospital in Bristol. Sir Richard was listed at number 435 in the Sunday Times Rich List last year, with an estimated family fortune of Â£301 million - a rise of Â£83 million on the previous year. The guide said Sir Richard's company owned London hotels the Sheraton Grand Park Lane and the Athenaeum, plus three smaller venues. He had an extensive property and farming portfolio, including the 6,500-acre Benham Estate in west Berkshire and the Stainton Estate in Lincolnshire.

"Industries hit by soaring energy costs have made another appeal to the government for action. Talks with ministers will continue on Monday over a crisis that has sparked warnings about some factories. Sectors such as ceramics, paper and steel manufacturing have called for a price cap, though talks with government on Friday failed to reach a solution. The Treasury has denied being in detailed talks with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng about the crisis. Dave Dalton, chief executive of the British Glass trade body, called that ""very alarming"". He was part of Friday's talks with Mr Kwarteng, but told the BBC the meeting ""was very much an introductory one. We did not get to specifics"". Mr Dalton said he had hoped the government would have made progress over the weekend, but that appears not to have happened. ""We need immediate action,"" he said. He said some members of his group may have to shut production permanently, although no firm had been forced to do so yet. The nature of glass manufacturing means production cannot be just paused, he said. ""We have large furnaces that run 24/7. If you switched a furnace off, you basically destroy the infrastructure. ""It would have to be rebuilt at a cost of tens of millions of pounds,"" Mr Dalton said. Mr Dalton said firms had ""hedged"" by buying gas in advance at lower prices but in some cases those deals were now expiring leaving firms facing much higher costs. ""We have companies that can't cope in the immediate term. And we have other companies that have to feed back to their masters overseas who will make decisions on their investment in the UK. We need a much better way to planning our way through this problem,"" he said. Mr Kwarteng will not be involved directly at Monday's talks with industry representatives, according to BBC political correspondent Adam Fleming. Business minister Lee Rowley will lead the meeting with industry representatives later this afternoon, and is having another meeting with steel bosses on Tuesday. Why are gas prices so high? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Adrian Curry, managing director of UK-based Encirc, one of the largest container glass plants in Europe, said industry was not asking for a bailout, but the situation for some companies was critical. ""We pay more for our energy than competitors in other countries,"" he told the BBC. He said his company would normally spend Â£40m a year on energy, but was now looking at bills up to Â£100m. ""It's quite incredible,"" he said, adding that costs will have to be passed on to customers. And while there was not a threat to his company's survival, it was clear talking to others in industry that many companies are hurting. Some companies are considering stopping production to cut costs, and others ""are very close to the edge"". Domestic energy consumers have a certain amount of protection from rising prices due to a price cap, which sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. However, the cap was increased on 1 October, meaning about 15 million households face a 12% rise in energy bills. Industry has no such cap, meaning they are open to the risk of an unlimited rise in prices. Already manufacturers and services are warning they will have to pass on their rising costs to consumers. And as energy costs are a big driver of inflation, few consumers and households will escape the consequences of the current crisis. Trade group UK Steel told the BBC that Boris Johnson needed to take control before it was too late - although it described as ""really good news"" an announcement that the country's third largest steel maker, Liberty Steel, would restart operations at its plant in Rotherham later this month. The Unite union also called on the prime minister to ""get a grip"" to avert job losses if companies have to shut production because they cannot cope with the increased cost of energy. However, Conservative MP Mark Harper said the government should resist demands for financial support. There's no single reason, but a convergence of factors nationally and globally. There's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies as countries emerged from lockdown and industry re-opened. A cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, stored gas levels are much lower than normal. On top of that, the UK has comparatively fewer gas storage facilities than some countries, meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. There's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas. And there is a suspicion that major gas supplier Russia is restricting output (an accusation it denies) which, following the law of supply and demand, has fuelled price rises. This has helped push up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they've risen 250%. And prices have soared 70% since August alone. Read more here Ed Miliband MP, Labour's Shadow Business Secretary, said: ""Yet again we see that in the face of their failed energy policy, the government has nothing to offer businesses or consumers to help them with the crisis they are facing. ""For firms and families waiting to hear how the Business Secretary might help, there is a total absence of a plan and no extra help. ""The government is squabbling amongst itself, with the Treasury even denying they are talking to BEIS about providing help for large, energy intensive industries."" On Sunday, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the situation was ""critical"" and said he was ""looking to find a solution"". ""We already have existing support and we're looking to see whether that's sufficient to get us through this situation,"" he said. However, a Treasury source said the business secretary had been ""mistaken"" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Are you a business owner?

"In a letter to parents, the health and education secretaries have urged adults to persuade their children to get vaccinated Sajid Javid and Nadhim Zahawi say getting jabbed is ""one of the best things young people can do to protect themselves and those around them"" As of 04:00 BST, the UK's travel red list has been cut from 54 countries to seven It ends hotel quarantine rules for people arriving from South Africa, Mexico, Brazil and other countries Separately, fully vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK from 37 other countries will also have to comply with fewer rules An AstraZeneca antibody therapy can reduce the chances of high-risk people developing severe, life-threatening Covid, clinical trial results show In Wales, NHS Covid passes are now compulsory for entry to big events or nightclubs Edited by Hamish Mackay We're pausing our live coverage of the pandemic now, thanks for joining us. We'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a reminder of the day's top Covid stories:  Today's live page was written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner, George Bowden and Alexandra FouchÃ©. It was edited by Holly Wallis and Hamish Mackay. The number of Covid cases remains high in the UK, with the seven-day average now at 37,991 new cases per day. The number of daily deaths remains steady, with the seven-day average at 111 per day. Some 28 deaths have been reported today but the beginning of the week tends to see lower figures due to reporting lags over the weekend. There has been a fall in the number of patients admitted to hosptialis with coronavirus. The most recent data, which is from last week, shows there are 6,728 patients in hospital. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford has condemned anti-vaccine protesters who left people feeling ""targeted"". He was speaking after a 15-year-old girl said she felt intimidated by protesters at a mass vaccination centre on Saturday. Ipswich has the eighth-highest number of cases per 100,000 people in England The coronavirus infection rate for Ipswich has jumped up by 40% in a week, according to official figures. The Suffolk town has the eighth-highest number of cases per 100,000 people in England, and there were 880 new Covid cases in the week to 6 October. Hotspot areas were Belstead Hills, Stoke Park and Gipping and Chantry Park, and there were a high number of cases among school-aged children. Public Health Suffolk says it is taking the rise in cases ""seriously"". According to the figures, Ipswich's 40% rise is one of the biggest week-on-week increases seen in any area in England.

Free tests were made available earlier this year, partly as a way to control infections at a time when vaccines were not widely available. But they've also been used to enable unvaccinated people to access services, such as gyms, hairdressers, and eating indoors in restaurants. Some groups  will continue to get free tests in both countries - for example, those with symptoms, children and individuals with certain medical conditions who cannot get vaccinated. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Three more Russian regions have announced that Covid-19 vaccination will be
mandatory for much of the adult population, following a surge in
officially-reported cases and deaths. The Republic of Tatarstan, Maritime Territory and Jewish Autonomous District
are the latest in a growing list of Russian federal regions, including the
capital Moscow, to demand that workers from a variety of industries undergo
vaccination. Those working in healthcare, education, trade,
catering, public transport and social services will be required to have the
first component of the jab by mid-November and the second a month later,
regional health authorities have said. In recent weeks Russia has repeatedly set new
official records for daily deaths from the virus. The country's total death
toll from the virus likely exceeds
400,000, federal statistics board Rosstat said on Friday. Russia's vaccine rollout has been marred by
relatively low uptake with around 42 million people being fully vaccinated from a population of over 146 million, according
to government figures. Nonetheless, the Kremlin has distanced itself
from measures making vaccination compulsory, opposing the idea in principle but
allowing regions to implement them. Polls have shown that compulsory vaccination is not a popular prospect among
the public with 58% saying they were
against it in July, according to independent pollster Levada Centre. More than a third of fully vaccinated over-80s in England are likely to have received their Covid-19 booster jab, latest figures suggest. Of the nearly 2.7 million people aged 80 and over in England who have already received two doses of vaccine, around 923,000 are estimated to have had their booster dose - the equivalent of 34%. The figures, from NHS England, also show that 18% of double-jabbed people aged 75 to 79 are likely to have received a booster, along with 8% of those aged 70 to 74. In total, more than 2.4 million booster doses have now been delivered in England. England's chief nursing officer, Ruth May, says it is""fantastic"" that people are topping up their protection. Thailand hopes the relaxation of restrictions will boost tourism Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has announced that visitors to Thailand from 10 countries who have been fully
vaccinated against Covid will no longer have to quarantine when they enter the
country from 1 November. The UK is among the list of âlow-risk countriesâ, along with Germany, China, the US and Singapore. âWhen they land in Thailand, they [will] have to prove that they
are Covid-free by showing their RT-PCR test result from their previous
destination and they need to have another Covid test when they arrive in
Thailand,"" the PM said in a televised address. ""After that, they can freely travel anywhere, like other Thais.â A further 40,224 Covid cases have been recorded across the UK, up from 35,077 for the same day last week -according to the latest figures,external. Another 28 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have also been reported, five fewer than were reported last Monday. The daily coronavirus figures tend to be lower at the start of the week due to reporting lags over the weekend. A further 22,106 people received a first vaccine shot, while another 19,451 people were given a second dose on Sunday. We've got more on that joint letter from the sectaries of state for health and education encouraging parents of secondary school pupils to get them vaccinated. Their plea comes as the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show that around one in 15 children in school years 7 to 11 in England are estimated to have had Covid in the week to 2 October. The latest data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) suggests that just 9% of this cohort in England had been vaccinated by 3 October. In their letter, Zahawi and Javid ask for parents' ""support"" to encourage their children to test themselves for Covid-19 twice a week and to ""come forward"" for the jab to ensure face-to-face lessons can continue. School unions have backed the intervention, but Geoff Barton, of the Association of School and College Leaders, says there is frustration around delays to the rollout of jabs. ""The urgency of this programme is self-evident from the fact that the latest government statistics show that more than 200,000 pupils were out of school at the latest count because of coronavirus-related reasons,"" he says. ""Many schools are also experiencing teacher shortages because staff are contracting the virus."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, says: ""Unfortunately, one of the reasons for the slow deployment is that children are missing their chance for vaccination because they have caught Covid-19. ""If they are off sick they miss vaccination slots at school - and they cannot be jabbed while they are ill anyway - there is a 28-day waiting period before a child who has had Covid can then have the vaccine."" Whiteman is calling for other measures to be pursued - such as improved ventilation - to reduce illness and disruption and ""to speed up the vaccination rollout"". Ministers are urging parents to get their children vaccinated against Covid-19 amid concerns about the vaccination programme in secondary schools. Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi have writtena joint letter,externalthat tells the parents of children at secondary schools that ""vaccines are our best defence against Covid-19"" and that they ""help protect young people, and benefit those around them"". Three million pupils aged between 12 and 15 across the UK are eligible to receive a first Covid-19 jab as part of a rollout that began three weeks ago. Parental consent forms are required for children aged 12 to 15 to be vaccinated. You can read more about which children are being vaccinated and whyhere. Aleem MaqboolBBC News Leah Cushman US President Joe Biden has been urging US employers to issue ultimatums to their staff: get vaccinated, or lose your job. The president says he will soon bring in a mandate that requires all healthcare workers to have had the jab, and has urged states to do the same with teachers. In Concord, New Hampshire, it is striking to see some of those attending a large protest against vaccine mandates wearing hospital scrubs. Leah Cushman is prepared to lose her nursing job rather than get vaccinated. ""My beliefs are religious. I believe that my creator endowed me with an immune system that protects me, and if I get sick, that's an act of God. I would not take a medicine that affects the immune system,"" says Ms Cushman. She denies there is any conflict between these beliefs and the responsibilities of her job. Read more here. It is ""entirely unacceptable"" for anti-vaccine protesters to intimidate people outside Covid vaccination centres, the first minister of Wales has said. Mark Drakeford was speaking after a15-year-old girl and her mum were confronted by protesters in Cardiffwhile going for a jab on Saturday. He tells BBC News: ""People are entitled to protest. They are not entitled to do it in a way that causes other people to feel that they have been targeted or that has taken advantage of their vulnerabilities. ""When it comes to harassment you have to see it through the eyes of the person who is affected, not through the eyes of the person who is protesting. ""Even if it wasn't the intention to frighten people and make them feel that they had been targeted, that is what people felt and that is completely unacceptable."" As we've reported, there are warnings the UK faces an uncertain winter with the spread of coronavirus and flu combining to increase pressure on the health service. Health officials are urging people to get a flu vaccination before winter - with more than 40 million people to be offered the jab. People are at ""more significant risk of death and of serious illness if they are co-infected"" with both viruses, the head of the UK Health Protection Agency, Dr Jenny Harries,has said. So who can get a free flu jab? Find out morehere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has recorded no new cases in the last 24 hours, even
though there have been recent outbreaks in multiple regions, and a major public
holiday has just passed. Over the last couple of weeks, there have been recorded
cases in north-west Xinjiang, north-east Heilongjiang and south-east Fujian. It has been routine for regions to swiftly lock down
communities as soon as cases are detected. Transport links are suspended, and
citywide testing drives are carried out to identify any potential âsilent
carriersâ. This has helped prevent cases from becoming more
widespread. However, China will be on high alert for potential outbreaks in the
coming weeks, ashalf a billion tourist trips were made last week,external. The first week of October is Golden Week in China. It is
the second biggest travel period after the Lunar New Year, and tens of millions
of people travel per day for the holidays. Government media urged people to stay vigilant during this
time; however, most people in China have now been fully vaccinated. Last month,official media said that more than 1 billion people have received two vaccine doses in China,external,
more than 70% of the population. The country hopes to have fully vaccinated 80% of its 1.4bn
population by the end of the year. This is the local threshold that Chinese
officials have set for âherd immunityâ. Hywel GriffithBBC News' Wales Correspondent First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford says the use of Covid passes could be extended for visitors to enter care homes and hospitals, if the coronavirus situation deteriorates over the coming months. The new scheme, introduced from today, means people must show proof of full vaccination or a negative lateral flow result for entry to a nightclub or large event. The first minister says settings where people may be most vulnerable to Covid are also being considered. But Drakford insists that the new pass scheme will not be permanent and requirement to show a pass will be removed once the pandemic has eased. There are concerns about an increasing number of pregnant women needing intensive care treatment for Covid-19, says the chief scientific advisor to the Department of Health. Lucy Chappell, a professor in obstetrics at Kings College London, tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that one in three women who are hospitalised will need to have their baby delivered early. ""We understand pregnant women have been hesitant about taking the Covid-19 vaccine,"" she says. ""We know that pregnant women weren't included in the clinical trials but what we have seen this year is a really large increase in the data coming out, particularly from the US and from other countries such as Israel where there has been widespread uptake of Covid-19 vaccination in pregnancy. Such that all the royal colleges are very clear on the recommendation that it is safe and effective."" She says: ""Having seen the impact that Covid-19 is having in pregnant women we are really clear about our recommendation for vaccination."" There are no plans to set specific targets for when civil servants working in central government departments should return to their desks, Downing Street has confirmed. Briefing reporters this afternoon, the prime minister's official spokesman says: ""We are seeing a steady return of civil servants to in-office working. That's what we would expect not just in the civil service, but in the private sector as well, and that will continue."" Asked whether specific targets will be set, he replies: ""No plans for any targets, as you set out. ""The civil service is following the guidance to gradually increase the number of staff in the workplace."" He adds it is for individual departments to monitor how many civil servants return to the office. PM Boris Johnson used a party conference speech last week to urge people to return to offices after long periods working from home due to the pandemic. As we've been reporting, the UK's travel red list has been cut to just seven countries - meaning more people can arrive without the need to quarantine in a government-approved hotel. There are only seven places on the red list, with arrivals subject to the harshest restrictions:  Fully-vaccinated passengers travelling to the UKfrom any non-red list country,externalno longer have to take a Covid test before setting off. All travellers - except children under five years old - still have to book and pay for a PCR test two days after arrival. But the latest changes to the UK's rules does not mean there are not restrictions for UK travellers entering other countries - so, as ever, check before you book. Read all about the current UK travel ruleshere. Downing Street says accusations of intellectual property theft and cyberattacks are taken ""extremely seriously"", following reports that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine's design was used to create Russia's Sputnik V jab. The prime minister's official spokesman refuses to comment on the specific claims that ""security services"" sources have evidence that Russian intelligence agents stole the Oxford coronavirus vaccine design. But he says: ""We take any such accusations of intellectual property theft and cyberattacks extremely seriously, and we've called out attempts in the past. ""But as you would expect, I'm not going to comment on matters on the intelligence front."" Asked about reports that France had almost five million doses of the vaccine destined for the UK diverted, the spokesman says: ""It's thanks to the work of our vaccine programmes that we have a diverse and a strong supply of vaccinations, and we have throughout. ""That enabled us to move quickly through our programme, and it's one of the main reasons why we are one of the most open economies in Europe currently."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Of the nearly 2.7 million people aged 80 and over in England who have already received two doses of vaccine, around 923,000 are estimated to have had their booster dose - the equivalent of 34%. The figures, from NHS England, also show that 18% of double-jabbed people aged 75 to 79 are likely to have received a booster, along with 8% of those aged 70 to 74. In total, more than 2.4 million booster doses have now been delivered in England. England's chief nursing officer, Ruth May, says it is""fantastic"" that people are topping up their protection. Thailand hopes the relaxation of restrictions will boost tourism Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has announced that visitors to Thailand from 10 countries who have been fully
vaccinated against Covid will no longer have to quarantine when they enter the
country from 1 November. The UK is among the list of âlow-risk countriesâ, along with Germany, China, the US and Singapore. âWhen they land in Thailand, they [will] have to prove that they
are Covid-free by showing their RT-PCR test result from their previous
destination and they need to have another Covid test when they arrive in
Thailand,"" the PM said in a televised address. ""After that, they can freely travel anywhere, like other Thais.â A further 40,224 Covid cases have been recorded across the UK, up from 35,077 for the same day last week -according to the latest figures,external. Another 28 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have also been reported, five fewer than were reported last Monday. The daily coronavirus figures tend to be lower at the start of the week due to reporting lags over the weekend. A further 22,106 people received a first vaccine shot, while another 19,451 people were given a second dose on Sunday. We've got more on that joint letter from the sectaries of state for health and education encouraging parents of secondary school pupils to get them vaccinated. Their plea comes as the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show that around one in 15 children in school years 7 to 11 in England are estimated to have had Covid in the week to 2 October. The latest data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) suggests that just 9% of this cohort in England had been vaccinated by 3 October. In their letter, Zahawi and Javid ask for parents' ""support"" to encourage their children to test themselves for Covid-19 twice a week and to ""come forward"" for the jab to ensure face-to-face lessons can continue. School unions have backed the intervention, but Geoff Barton, of the Association of School and College Leaders, says there is frustration around delays to the rollout of jabs. ""The urgency of this programme is self-evident from the fact that the latest government statistics show that more than 200,000 pupils were out of school at the latest count because of coronavirus-related reasons,"" he says. ""Many schools are also experiencing teacher shortages because staff are contracting the virus."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, says: ""Unfortunately, one of the reasons for the slow deployment is that children are missing their chance for vaccination because they have caught Covid-19. ""If they are off sick they miss vaccination slots at school - and they cannot be jabbed while they are ill anyway - there is a 28-day waiting period before a child who has had Covid can then have the vaccine."" Whiteman is calling for other measures to be pursued - such as improved ventilation - to reduce illness and disruption and ""to speed up the vaccination rollout"". Ministers are urging parents to get their children vaccinated against Covid-19 amid concerns about the vaccination programme in secondary schools. Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi have writtena joint letter,externalthat tells the parents of children at secondary schools that ""vaccines are our best defence against Covid-19"" and that they ""help protect young people, and benefit those around them"". Three million pupils aged between 12 and 15 across the UK are eligible to receive a first Covid-19 jab as part of a rollout that began three weeks ago. Parental consent forms are required for children aged 12 to 15 to be vaccinated. You can read more about which children are being vaccinated and whyhere. Aleem MaqboolBBC News Leah Cushman US President Joe Biden has been urging US employers to issue ultimatums to their staff: get vaccinated, or lose your job. The president says he will soon bring in a mandate that requires all healthcare workers to have had the jab, and has urged states to do the same with teachers. In Concord, New Hampshire, it is striking to see some of those attending a large protest against vaccine mandates wearing hospital scrubs. Leah Cushman is prepared to lose her nursing job rather than get vaccinated. ""My beliefs are religious. I believe that my creator endowed me with an immune system that protects me, and if I get sick, that's an act of God. I would not take a medicine that affects the immune system,"" says Ms Cushman. She denies there is any conflict between these beliefs and the responsibilities of her job. Read more here. It is ""entirely unacceptable"" for anti-vaccine protesters to intimidate people outside Covid vaccination centres, the first minister of Wales has said. Mark Drakeford was speaking after a15-year-old girl and her mum were confronted by protesters in Cardiffwhile going for a jab on Saturday. He tells BBC News: ""People are entitled to protest. They are not entitled to do it in a way that causes other people to feel that they have been targeted or that has taken advantage of their vulnerabilities. ""When it comes to harassment you have to see it through the eyes of the person who is affected, not through the eyes of the person who is protesting. ""Even if it wasn't the intention to frighten people and make them feel that they had been targeted, that is what people felt and that is completely unacceptable."" As we've reported, there are warnings the UK faces an uncertain winter with the spread of coronavirus and flu combining to increase pressure on the health service. Health officials are urging people to get a flu vaccination before winter - with more than 40 million people to be offered the jab. People are at ""more significant risk of death and of serious illness if they are co-infected"" with both viruses, the head of the UK Health Protection Agency, Dr Jenny Harries,has said. So who can get a free flu jab? Find out morehere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has recorded no new cases in the last 24 hours, even
though there have been recent outbreaks in multiple regions, and a major public
holiday has just passed. Over the last couple of weeks, there have been recorded
cases in north-west Xinjiang, north-east Heilongjiang and south-east Fujian. It has been routine for regions to swiftly lock down
communities as soon as cases are detected. Transport links are suspended, and
citywide testing drives are carried out to identify any potential âsilent
carriersâ. This has helped prevent cases from becoming more
widespread. However, China will be on high alert for potential outbreaks in the
coming weeks, ashalf a billion tourist trips were made last week,external. The first week of October is Golden Week in China. It is
the second biggest travel period after the Lunar New Year, and tens of millions
of people travel per day for the holidays. Government media urged people to stay vigilant during this
time; however, most people in China have now been fully vaccinated. Last month,official media said that more than 1 billion people have received two vaccine doses in China,external,
more than 70% of the population. The country hopes to have fully vaccinated 80% of its 1.4bn
population by the end of the year. This is the local threshold that Chinese
officials have set for âherd immunityâ. Hywel GriffithBBC News' Wales Correspondent First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford says the use of Covid passes could be extended for visitors to enter care homes and hospitals, if the coronavirus situation deteriorates over the coming months. The new scheme, introduced from today, means people must show proof of full vaccination or a negative lateral flow result for entry to a nightclub or large event. The first minister says settings where people may be most vulnerable to Covid are also being considered. But Drakford insists that the new pass scheme will not be permanent and requirement to show a pass will be removed once the pandemic has eased. There are concerns about an increasing number of pregnant women needing intensive care treatment for Covid-19, says the chief scientific advisor to the Department of Health. Lucy Chappell, a professor in obstetrics at Kings College London, tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that one in three women who are hospitalised will need to have their baby delivered early. ""We understand pregnant women have been hesitant about taking the Covid-19 vaccine,"" she says. ""We know that pregnant women weren't included in the clinical trials but what we have seen this year is a really large increase in the data coming out, particularly from the US and from other countries such as Israel where there has been widespread uptake of Covid-19 vaccination in pregnancy. Such that all the royal colleges are very clear on the recommendation that it is safe and effective."" She says: ""Having seen the impact that Covid-19 is having in pregnant women we are really clear about our recommendation for vaccination."" There are no plans to set specific targets for when civil servants working in central government departments should return to their desks, Downing Street has confirmed. Briefing reporters this afternoon, the prime minister's official spokesman says: ""We are seeing a steady return of civil servants to in-office working. That's what we would expect not just in the civil service, but in the private sector as well, and that will continue."" Asked whether specific targets will be set, he replies: ""No plans for any targets, as you set out. ""The civil service is following the guidance to gradually increase the number of staff in the workplace."" He adds it is for individual departments to monitor how many civil servants return to the office. PM Boris Johnson used a party conference speech last week to urge people to return to offices after long periods working from home due to the pandemic. As we've been reporting, the UK's travel red list has been cut to just seven countries - meaning more people can arrive without the need to quarantine in a government-approved hotel. There are only seven places on the red list, with arrivals subject to the harshest restrictions:  Fully-vaccinated passengers travelling to the UKfrom any non-red list country,externalno longer have to take a Covid test before setting off. All travellers - except children under five years old - still have to book and pay for a PCR test two days after arrival. But the latest changes to the UK's rules does not mean there are not restrictions for UK travellers entering other countries - so, as ever, check before you book. Read all about the current UK travel ruleshere. Downing Street says accusations of intellectual property theft and cyberattacks are taken ""extremely seriously"", following reports that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine's design was used to create Russia's Sputnik V jab. The prime minister's official spokesman refuses to comment on the specific claims that ""security services"" sources have evidence that Russian intelligence agents stole the Oxford coronavirus vaccine design. But he says: ""We take any such accusations of intellectual property theft and cyberattacks extremely seriously, and we've called out attempts in the past. ""But as you would expect, I'm not going to comment on matters on the intelligence front."" Asked about reports that France had almost five million doses of the vaccine destined for the UK diverted, the spokesman says: ""It's thanks to the work of our vaccine programmes that we have a diverse and a strong supply of vaccinations, and we have throughout. ""That enabled us to move quickly through our programme, and it's one of the main reasons why we are one of the most open economies in Europe currently."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"The US had offered a $5m reward for information leading to Sami Jasim al-Jaburi's capture Iraq says it has captured the jihadist group Islamic State's financial chief in an operation outside its borders. Sami Jasim al-Jaburi was arrested in a ""complex external operation"" by the Iraqi National Intelligence Service, Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi tweeted, without specifying a location. He added that Mr Jasim, also known as Hajji Hamid, was a deputy leader of IS under the late Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The US had offered a $5m (Â£3.7m) reward,externalfor information leading to his capture. Its Rewards for Justice website alleged that he was ""instrumental in managing finances for [IS] terrorist operations"" and had supervised the group's ""revenue-generating operations from illicit sales of oil, gas, antiquities, and minerals"" after it seized large swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014. Iraqi officials are hailing the capture of Sami Jasim as a significant blow to IS. They say, cryptically, that he was captured in a foreign intelligence operation without immediately revealing where. The high-level IS operative is believed to have been not only in charge of the group's finances but also of its cross-border operations in Syria and Iraq where it continues to attack police and military bases. His value to the Iraqi security forces will be not so much his loss to IS - where he will be swiftly replaced - but in what information he yields to his captors about imminent attacks. Since the military defeat of IS and its self-declared caliphate it has reverted to being an insurgency, conducting hit-and-run attacks. It's estimated to have around 10,000 fighters at large in the Middle East. Further afield it remains a dangerous security threat in countries as far apart as Afghanistan and Mozambique. Iraq's Security Media Cell said the detainee was close to the new leader of IS, Amir Mohammed Said Abdul Rahman al-Mawla, who replaced Baghdadi afterhe killed himself during a US special forces raid on his hideout in Syria in 2019. Although Mr Kadhimi did not reveal where Mr Jasim had been captured, a senior Iraqi military source told AFP news agency it had happened in Turkey. There was no immediate response from Turkish authorities to the report. Earlier this year, the Iraqi government announced it had killed another alleged deputy IS leader, Jabir Salman Saleh al-Isawi, as well as the leader of IS in southern Iraq, Jabbar Ali Fayadh. This video can not be played Islamic State children in Syria face a lifetime in prison IS once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from eastern Iraq to western Syria and imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people.

We'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a reminder of the day's top Covid stories:  Today's live page was written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner, George Bowden and Alexandra FouchÃ©. It was edited by Holly Wallis and Hamish Mackay. The number of Covid cases remains high in the UK, with the seven-day average now at 37,991 new cases per day. The number of daily deaths remains steady, with the seven-day average at 111 per day. Some 28 deaths have been reported today but the beginning of the week tends to see lower figures due to reporting lags over the weekend. There has been a fall in the number of patients admitted to hosptialis with coronavirus. The most recent data, which is from last week, shows there are 6,728 patients in hospital. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford has condemned anti-vaccine protesters who left people feeling ""targeted"".

Ipswich has the eighth-highest number of cases per 100,000 people in England The coronavirus infection rate for Ipswich has jumped up by 40% in a week, according to official figures. The Suffolk town has the eighth-highest number of cases per 100,000 people in England, and there were 880 new Covid cases in the week to 6 October. Hotspot areas were Belstead Hills, Stoke Park and Gipping and Chantry Park, and there were a high number of cases among school-aged children.

Free tests were made available earlier this year, partly as a way to control infections at a time when vaccines were not widely available. But they've also been used to enable unvaccinated people to access services, such as gyms, hairdressers, and eating indoors in restaurants. Some groups  will continue to get free tests in both countries - for example, those with symptoms, children and individuals with certain medical conditions who cannot get vaccinated. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Three more Russian regions have announced that Covid-19 vaccination will be
mandatory for much of the adult population, following a surge in
officially-reported cases and deaths. The Republic of Tatarstan, Maritime Territory and Jewish Autonomous District
are the latest in a growing list of Russian federal regions, including the
capital Moscow, to demand that workers from a variety of industries undergo
vaccination. Those working in healthcare, education, trade,
catering, public transport and social services will be required to have the
first component of the jab by mid-November and the second a month later,
regional health authorities have said. In recent weeks Russia has repeatedly set new
official records for daily deaths from the virus. The country's total death
toll from the virus likely exceeds
400,000, federal statistics board Rosstat said on Friday. Russia's vaccine rollout has been marred by
relatively low uptake with around 42 million people being fully vaccinated from a population of over 146 million, according
to government figures. Nonetheless, the Kremlin has distanced itself
from measures making vaccination compulsory, opposing the idea in principle but
allowing regions to implement them. Polls have shown that compulsory vaccination is not a popular prospect among
the public with 58% saying they were
against it in July, according to independent pollster Levada Centre. More than a third of fully vaccinated over-80s in England are likely to have received their Covid-19 booster jab, latest figures suggest. Of the nearly 2.7 million people aged 80 and over in England who have already received two doses of vaccine, around 923,000 are estimated to have had their booster dose - the equivalent of 34%.

"Rosen spent two months in a medically induced coma after catching Covid-19 Michael Rosen has won the Centre for Literacy in Primary Education Poetry Award (CLiPPA) for his collection of poems about migration. On The Move saw Rosen reflect on his own past as part of a Polish-Jewish family growing up in London. The collection was published in 2020 and was illustrated by Quentin Blake. The chair of the judges, Allie Esiri, described the collection as ""a timely - and timeless - reminder of our kinship with our fellow humans"". The 75-year-old was announced as the winner at the Cheltenham Literature Festival on Monday. The victory comes after a punishing 18 months for Rosen, whobecame ill with Covid-19in March 2020 and spent two months in a medically induced coma. He was just beginning his recovery when On the Move was published last October. He described his experiences of being seriously ill in a book earlier this year, and will soon publish a picture book about learning to walk again. This video can not be played 'It was so serious that I don't know about it': Michael Rosen was put in a coma to fight Covid-19 On The Move includes poems about Rosen's ""missing"" relatives, who lost their lives in the Holocaust, and connects his experiences with migration around the world to argue that the human race is always on the move.

"Virginia Giuffre, then Victoria Roberts, was pictured with Prince Andrew in London in 2001 The Metropolitan Police will not take any further action against the Duke of York following a review prompted by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre. Ms Giuffre is suing Prince Andrew in the US for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. Prince Andrew has consistently denied Ms Giuffre's allegations. A source close to the duke told PA Media it had ""come as no surprise"" the Met had decided to drop its probe. They added: ""Despite pressure from the media and claims of new evidence, the Met have concluded that the claims are not sufficient to warrant any further investigation. ""The duke has always vigorously maintained his innocence and continues to do so."" In August, the Metsaid it would review its decisionnot to investigate allegations connected to Epstein. Ms Giuffre, 38, claims she was sexually assaulted by the prince at three locations - London, New York and on Epstein's private island in the Caribbean. Her case claims Prince Andrew engaged in sexual acts without Ms Giuffre's consent, including when she was 17. The Met also confirmed it had completed its review into allegations reported in June by broadcaster Channel 4 News that British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend, trafficked, groomed and abused women and girls in the UK. The force said it had ""reviewed information passed to us by a media organisation in June"" and decided that ""no further action will be taken"". In August 2019, US financier Epstein was found dead in his cell in New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center. Prince Andrew - seen walking with Jeffrey Epstein in Central Park in New York in 2010 - has faced scrutiny over his ties to the convicted sex offender The Met previously ruled out opening an investigation into Epstein, but in August Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said the force would review the decision. On Sunday, the Met said: ""As a matter of procedure, MPS officers reviewed a document released in August 2021 as part of a US civil action. This review has concluded and we are taking no further action."" The Met added that it will continue to liaise with other law enforcement agencies who are leading the investigation into matters associated with Epstein.

"The US had offered a $5m reward for information leading to Sami Jasim al-Jaburi's capture Iraq says it has captured the jihadist group Islamic State's financial chief in an operation outside its borders. Sami Jasim al-Jaburi was arrested in a ""complex external operation"" by the Iraqi National Intelligence Service, Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi tweeted, without specifying a location. He added that Mr Jasim, also known as Hajji Hamid, was a deputy leader of IS under the late Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The US had offered a $5m (Â£3.7m) reward,externalfor information leading to his capture. Its Rewards for Justice website alleged that he was ""instrumental in managing finances for [IS] terrorist operations"" and had supervised the group's ""revenue-generating operations from illicit sales of oil, gas, antiquities, and minerals"" after it seized large swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014. Iraqi officials are hailing the capture of Sami Jasim as a significant blow to IS. They say, cryptically, that he was captured in a foreign intelligence operation without immediately revealing where. The high-level IS operative is believed to have been not only in charge of the group's finances but also of its cross-border operations in Syria and Iraq where it continues to attack police and military bases. His value to the Iraqi security forces will be not so much his loss to IS - where he will be swiftly replaced - but in what information he yields to his captors about imminent attacks. Since the military defeat of IS and its self-declared caliphate it has reverted to being an insurgency, conducting hit-and-run attacks. It's estimated to have around 10,000 fighters at large in the Middle East. Further afield it remains a dangerous security threat in countries as far apart as Afghanistan and Mozambique. Iraq's Security Media Cell said the detainee was close to the new leader of IS, Amir Mohammed Said Abdul Rahman al-Mawla, who replaced Baghdadi afterhe killed himself during a US special forces raid on his hideout in Syria in 2019. Although Mr Kadhimi did not reveal where Mr Jasim had been captured, a senior Iraqi military source told AFP news agency it had happened in Turkey. There was no immediate response from Turkish authorities to the report. Earlier this year, the Iraqi government announced it had killed another alleged deputy IS leader, Jabir Salman Saleh al-Isawi, as well as the leader of IS in southern Iraq, Jabbar Ali Fayadh. This video can not be played Islamic State children in Syria face a lifetime in prison IS once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from eastern Iraq to western Syria and imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people. Despite the group's defeat on the battlefield in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria two years later, it is estimated that thousands of militants remain active in both countries.

"Professor Card said people initially didn't trust the results of his unconventional methods David Card, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens have been awarded this year's Nobel prize for economics for work that ""challenged conventional wisdom"". The trio shared the prize for pioneering work in the use of ""natural experiments"". Natural experiments use real-life situations to work out the impact of government decisions. Prof Card is best known for his study of the impact of minimum wage increases on employment in US states. His findings prompted researchers to review their opinion that such increases always lead to falls in employment. Economists cannot run lab experiments to test their theories, so have to rely on theoretical models and the examination of complex, real life situations. The winners' work had ""substantially improved our ability to answer key causal questions, which has been of great benefit to society,"" said Peter Fredriksson, chair of the Economic Sciences Prize Committee. Canadian-born Prof Card, who works at University of California, Berkeley, receives half of the 10 million Swedish crowns (Â£839,000) prize, while Israeli-American Joshua Angrist from MIT and Guido Imbens, a Dutch academic at Stanford University, share the other half. Their work solved methodological problems to show that precise conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments. Climate science breakthroughs win physics Nobel Journalists Ressa and Muratov win Nobel Peace Prize Chemistry Nobel awarded for mirror-image molecules Speaking to reporters, Prof Imbens said he was ""absolutely thrilled to hear the news, in particular... hearing that I got to share this with Joshua Angrist and David Card who are both very good friends of mine"". He added that Prof Angrist had been the best man at his wedding. ""I'm just thrilled to share the prize with both him and David."" Prof Card initially thought the news of the award was ""a joke"" played on him by an old high school friend, he told the BBC. His work on the minimum wage was conducted at Princeton in the 1980s in collaboration with Alan Krueger, who went on to become assistant secretary of the Treasury under President Obama. They surveyed restaurants in New Jersey before and after the introduction of a minimum wage in the state, an approach that was quite unusual at the time, Prof Card said. But he said their findings, that the minimum wage had not led to significant job losses, was not immediately accepted. ""People thought we were either cooking the books or had lost our minds or did something untoward or foolish,"" he said. However the methodology, of collecting and analysing real world data, opened people's eyes to a new way of analysing the economy, he said. His subsequent work has included the impact of immigration on domestic employment in the US and how company wage policies determine gender and ethnic pay gaps. UC Berkeley said Prof Card had ""challenged orthodoxy and dramatically shifted understanding of inequality and the social and economic forces that impact low-wage workers"". Taken together, the work by the three economists ""revolutionised empirical work"" in economics, the Nobel award committee said. Although not one of the original Nobel Prizes, the economics award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and is the last to be announced each year. The other Nobel prizes were established by Alfred Nobel's will in 1895. The economics prize, officially known as the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden's central bank) Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was created in 1968. Last year, the prize was won by Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson of Stanford University for their work on making auctions run more efficiently. They used game theory, which uses mathematics to study decision-making conflict, and strategy in social situation, to explore the behaviour of bidders, which in turn helped in developing formats for the sale of aircraft landing slots, radio spectrums, and emissions trading. In 2019, it was awarded to Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer, for their work on the causes and remedies of poverty. Why do the Nobel prizes matter?

"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade: Emissions It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - agreenhouse gas which causes climate change. This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Coal For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after a late intervention by China and India. PM: Climate deal sounds death knell for coal power Evasive words and coal compromise, but deal shows progress Developing countries The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? Fossil fuel subsidies World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. How much is still spent supporting oil, coal and gas? A flurry of other announcements were made: The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China,pledged to cooperate more over the next decadein areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Cautious welcome for US-China climate agreement Why China's climate policy matters to us all Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests -promised to stop deforestationby 2030. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiativeshaven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. Ascheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030was agreed by more than 100 countries. Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tnagreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015Paris Agreement. Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reachnet zeroby mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you?

"A deal to avert another carbon dioxide crisis in the food and drink industry has been extended until early 2022. US firm CF Industries, a key CO2 producer in the UK, has agreed to continue supplies of the gas. It said that should give the government and firms time to find other sources of CO2, used in fizzy drinks and for keeping food fresh, as well as to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter. Firms will now have to pay more for their CO2, but it is unclear how much. Last month, the government stepped in to subsidise one of the firm's plants after its shutdown due to high gas prices threatened food supplies. CF Industries suspended production at two sites - Cheshire and Billingham - which make 60% of the UK's commercial carbon dioxide. It reopened its Billingham plant in north-east Englandafter the government agreed to meet the costsof running it for three weeks. Billingham produces up to 750 tonnes of CO2 per day as a by-product of producing ammonia for fertiliser. CF Industries' plant at Ince in Cheshire remains closed with no date given for a reopening. The government said: ""CO2 suppliers have agreed to pay CF Fertilisers a price for the CO2 it produces that will enable it to continue operating while global gas prices remain high, drawing on support from industry and delivering value for money for the taxpayer."" The agreement meant industry could have confidence it would receive future CO2 supplies, without further taxpayer support, said the government. The British Meat Processors Association said the agreement provided ""some reassurance that supplies will be maintained"". ""However, industry has been given no detail on what the price will be or how it will be calculated going forward,"" a spokesperson added. ""We understand that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng took the decision to temporarily exempt parts of the CO2 industry from competition law to facilitate this agreement. What we need now is some detail and transparency around how the new pricing structure will work."" Why are gas prices so high? Minister asks Treasury to help firms over gas cost What's CO2 used for in food and drink? Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said the agreement was ""welcome news"". But he added: ""The increased cost of buying CO2 is yet another burden on the food and drink industry, which is already facing enormous stresses. ""This will, of course, add more pressure on prices for shoppers and diners."" By Ben King, business reporter It looks like there will be enough CO2 to keep Christmas beers bubbly - but after that, there are no guarantees. There's an ominous line in the CF Industries press release. They expect CO2 users to develop ""robust alternative sources"" between now and January. That won't be easily done. Lots of industrial processes produce CO2, but few produce a stream so pure and reliable that you'd want to dissolve it in your lemonade. Distributor Nippon Gases has warned that supply is tight across Europe, so imports will be hard to come by. The government says that the firms which need the CO2 from Billingham will be paying more for it - and whatever long-term solution does emerge, it's likely to be more expensive too. But the UK only needs about 600,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. At about Â£200 a tonne before the current crisis, that's about Â£120m, relatively small beer for industries that count their turnover in the billions. Compared to the other pressures those industries face - staff shortages, and higher costs for energy and shipping - more expensive CO2 is an extra cost they don't need, but it won't be their biggest headache. When CF shut its facilities after making fertiliser became uneconomic because of the rising price of wholesale gas, it cut off a vital source of CO2 for other sectors. Supermarkets began reporting limited stocks of some food items, while the pig industry warned that if slaughterhouses could not process animals, then farmers would have to cull their stocks. The US firm said it now expected the UK government and industrial gas customers to ""develop robust alternative sources of CO2 as part of a long-term solution for meeting demand in the country"". Last month, it emerged the British food industry would be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with CF Industries to restart production in the UK. Environment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from Â£200 per tonne to Â£1,000. Households, too, are being hit by higher energy bills, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use,seeing bills go up by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year on average. Several energy suppliers, unable to pass on wholesale prices to consumers on fixed deal, have gone out of business. Their customers have been switched to other suppliers, but will be put on variable contracts that will be higher than previous deals. Meanwhile, the business department has sent the Treasury a formal request for support for energy-intensive industries hit by high gas prices, the BBC understands. It came after talks between ministers and industry leaders earlier on Monday. A source said: ""Everyone in government understands the importance of this situation. ""We need to solve this quickly."" Details of the proposal from Mr Kwarteng have not been disclosed but are thought to focus on a temporary solution to high energy prices. On Sunday, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the situation was ""critical"" and said he was ""looking to find a solution"". Mr Kwarteng said there were Treasury talks about support measures to ease the impact on firms. However, a Treasury source later said the business secretary had been ""mistaken"". Sectors such as ceramics, paper and steel manufacturing have called for a price cap, though talks with government on Friday failed to reach a solution.

"A deal to avert another carbon dioxide crisis in the food and drink industry has been extended until early 2022. US firm CF Industries, a key CO2 producer in the UK, has agreed to continue supplies of the gas. It said that should give the government and firms time to find other sources of CO2, used in fizzy drinks and for keeping food fresh, as well as to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter. Firms will now have to pay more for their CO2, but it is unclear how much. Last month, the government stepped in to subsidise one of the firm's plants after its shutdown due to high gas prices threatened food supplies. CF Industries suspended production at two sites - Cheshire and Billingham - which make 60% of the UK's commercial carbon dioxide. It reopened its Billingham plant in north-east Englandafter the government agreed to meet the costsof running it for three weeks. Billingham produces up to 750 tonnes of CO2 per day as a by-product of producing ammonia for fertiliser. CF Industries' plant at Ince in Cheshire remains closed with no date given for a reopening. The government said: ""CO2 suppliers have agreed to pay CF Fertilisers a price for the CO2 it produces that will enable it to continue operating while global gas prices remain high, drawing on support from industry and delivering value for money for the taxpayer."" The agreement meant industry could have confidence it would receive future CO2 supplies, without further taxpayer support, said the government. The British Meat Processors Association said the agreement provided ""some reassurance that supplies will be maintained"". ""However, industry has been given no detail on what the price will be or how it will be calculated going forward,"" a spokesperson added. ""We understand that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng took the decision to temporarily exempt parts of the CO2 industry from competition law to facilitate this agreement. What we need now is some detail and transparency around how the new pricing structure will work."" Why are gas prices so high? Minister asks Treasury to help firms over gas cost What's CO2 used for in food and drink? Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, said the agreement was ""welcome news"". But he added: ""The increased cost of buying CO2 is yet another burden on the food and drink industry, which is already facing enormous stresses. ""This will, of course, add more pressure on prices for shoppers and diners."" By Ben King, business reporter It looks like there will be enough CO2 to keep Christmas beers bubbly - but after that, there are no guarantees. There's an ominous line in the CF Industries press release. They expect CO2 users to develop ""robust alternative sources"" between now and January. That won't be easily done. Lots of industrial processes produce CO2, but few produce a stream so pure and reliable that you'd want to dissolve it in your lemonade. Distributor Nippon Gases has warned that supply is tight across Europe, so imports will be hard to come by. The government says that the firms which need the CO2 from Billingham will be paying more for it - and whatever long-term solution does emerge, it's likely to be more expensive too. But the UK only needs about 600,000 tonnes of CO2 a year. At about Â£200 a tonne before the current crisis, that's about Â£120m, relatively small beer for industries that count their turnover in the billions. Compared to the other pressures those industries face - staff shortages, and higher costs for energy and shipping - more expensive CO2 is an extra cost they don't need, but it won't be their biggest headache. When CF shut its facilities after making fertiliser became uneconomic because of the rising price of wholesale gas, it cut off a vital source of CO2 for other sectors. Supermarkets began reporting limited stocks of some food items, while the pig industry warned that if slaughterhouses could not process animals, then farmers would have to cull their stocks. The US firm said it now expected the UK government and industrial gas customers to ""develop robust alternative sources of CO2 as part of a long-term solution for meeting demand in the country"". Last month, it emerged the British food industry would be forced to pay five times more for carbon dioxide as part of a government deal with CF Industries to restart production in the UK. Environment Secretary George Eustice said carbon dioxide prices would rise from Â£200 per tonne to Â£1,000. Households, too, are being hit by higher energy bills, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use,seeing bills go up by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year on average. Several energy suppliers, unable to pass on wholesale prices to consumers on fixed deal, have gone out of business. Their customers have been switched to other suppliers, but will be put on variable contracts that will be higher than previous deals. Meanwhile, the business department has sent the Treasury a formal request for support for energy-intensive industries hit by high gas prices, the BBC understands. It came after talks between ministers and industry leaders earlier on Monday. A source said: ""Everyone in government understands the importance of this situation. ""We need to solve this quickly."" Details of the proposal from Mr Kwarteng have not been disclosed but are thought to focus on a temporary solution to high energy prices.

"Industries hit by soaring energy costs have made another appeal to the government for action. Talks with ministers will continue on Monday over a crisis that has sparked warnings about some factories. Sectors such as ceramics, paper and steel manufacturing have called for a price cap, though talks with government on Friday failed to reach a solution. The Treasury has denied being in detailed talks with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng about the crisis. Dave Dalton, chief executive of the British Glass trade body, called that ""very alarming"". He was part of Friday's talks with Mr Kwarteng, but told the BBC the meeting ""was very much an introductory one. We did not get to specifics"". Mr Dalton said he had hoped the government would have made progress over the weekend, but that appears not to have happened. ""We need immediate action,"" he said. He said some members of his group may have to shut production permanently, although no firm had been forced to do so yet. The nature of glass manufacturing means production cannot be just paused, he said. ""We have large furnaces that run 24/7. If you switched a furnace off, you basically destroy the infrastructure. ""It would have to be rebuilt at a cost of tens of millions of pounds,"" Mr Dalton said. Mr Dalton said firms had ""hedged"" by buying gas in advance at lower prices but in some cases those deals were now expiring leaving firms facing much higher costs. ""We have companies that can't cope in the immediate term. And we have other companies that have to feed back to their masters overseas who will make decisions on their investment in the UK. We need a much better way to planning our way through this problem,"" he said. Mr Kwarteng will not be involved directly at Monday's talks with industry representatives, according to BBC political correspondent Adam Fleming. Business minister Lee Rowley will lead the meeting with industry representatives later this afternoon, and is having another meeting with steel bosses on Tuesday. Why are gas prices so high? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Adrian Curry, managing director of UK-based Encirc, one of the largest container glass plants in Europe, said industry was not asking for a bailout, but the situation for some companies was critical. ""We pay more for our energy than competitors in other countries,"" he told the BBC. He said his company would normally spend Â£40m a year on energy, but was now looking at bills up to Â£100m. ""It's quite incredible,"" he said, adding that costs will have to be passed on to customers. And while there was not a threat to his company's survival, it was clear talking to others in industry that many companies are hurting. Some companies are considering stopping production to cut costs, and others ""are very close to the edge"". Domestic energy consumers have a certain amount of protection from rising prices due to a price cap, which sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. However, the cap was increased on 1 October, meaning about 15 million households face a 12% rise in energy bills. Industry has no such cap, meaning they are open to the risk of an unlimited rise in prices. Already manufacturers and services are warning they will have to pass on their rising costs to consumers. And as energy costs are a big driver of inflation, few consumers and households will escape the consequences of the current crisis. Trade group UK Steel told the BBC that Boris Johnson needed to take control before it was too late - although it described as ""really good news"" an announcement that the country's third largest steel maker, Liberty Steel, would restart operations at its plant in Rotherham later this month. The Unite union also called on the prime minister to ""get a grip"" to avert job losses if companies have to shut production because they cannot cope with the increased cost of energy. However, Conservative MP Mark Harper said the government should resist demands for financial support. There's no single reason, but a convergence of factors nationally and globally. There's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies as countries emerged from lockdown and industry re-opened. A cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, stored gas levels are much lower than normal. On top of that, the UK has comparatively fewer gas storage facilities than some countries, meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. There's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas. And there is a suspicion that major gas supplier Russia is restricting output (an accusation it denies) which, following the law of supply and demand, has fuelled price rises. This has helped push up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they've risen 250%. And prices have soared 70% since August alone. Read more here Ed Miliband MP, Labour's Shadow Business Secretary, said: ""Yet again we see that in the face of their failed energy policy, the government has nothing to offer businesses or consumers to help them with the crisis they are facing. ""For firms and families waiting to hear how the Business Secretary might help, there is a total absence of a plan and no extra help. ""The government is squabbling amongst itself, with the Treasury even denying they are talking to BEIS about providing help for large, energy intensive industries."" On Sunday, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the situation was ""critical"" and said he was ""looking to find a solution"". ""We already have existing support and we're looking to see whether that's sufficient to get us through this situation,"" he said. However, a Treasury source said the business secretary had been ""mistaken"" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Are you a business owner?

"At least 750 allegations of sexual misconduct were made against serving police officers across Britain over five years, new figures show. Data was obtained from 31 police forces in England, Wales and Scotland under the Freedom of Information Act. Forces were asked how many complaints of sexual assault were made against police officers between 2016 and 2020. The End Violence Against Women Coalition said few officers faced ""any meaningful consequences"". A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""The police must raise the bar and, at a time where they are in the spotlight, they must ensure their actions are beyond reproach. ""This includes being transparent when officers have fallen below the standards the public expect of them, and being clear on the forces' response."" Data, obtained by PA Media's Radar service, shows that most complaints, where gender was recorded, were against male officers. Allegations could be historical, and the responses did not indicate whether any of the officers were on duty at the time. At least 34 cases resulted in a dismissal. There are 43 police forces in England and Wales, plus Police Scotland, and others including the British Transport Police. How a police officer planned Sarah Everard's murder Confidence in police 'eroded' says new force chief PM urges public to trust police after Everard case The End Violence Against Women Coalition, which includes groups such as Rape Crisis, Refuge and Women's Aid, said ""widespread institutional failings"" needed to be addressed. Deputy director Denzi Ugur said: ""We need to see a radical overhaul of how the police respond to violence against women - especially within their own ranks. ""This means greater accountability and urgent, co-ordinated and strategic action to address violence against women."" The figures come after Home Secretary Priti Patel announcedan inquiry will be launched into ""systemic failures""that allowed Wayne Couzens to continue to be a police officer. Couzens, an officer with the Metropolitan Police,was given a whole-life sentencelast month for the kidnap, rape and murder of Sarah Everard. Meanwhile, Baroness Louise Casey of Blackstockwill lead an independent reviewinto the Met's culture and standards, examining the force's vetting, recruitment and training procedures. Between 2016 and 2020, the Met - the UK's largest police force - recorded 530 allegations of sexual offences against serving officers and staff members, according to different FoI data, with 47 claims resulting in a dismissal. Surrey Police recorded 36 allegations of sexual misconduct against its officers over the same period. The Independent Office for Police Conduct, which oversees the police complaints system, said it was down to forces to ""stamp out"" any abuse of police powers. A spokesperson said: ""Each case reported represents a serious betrayal of the trust and confidence that individuals should have in the police. It is behaviour which can never be justified or condoned."" A LOVE LETTER TO THE NORTH:The Hairy Bikers head to Cumbria and the Lake District!

"Professor Card said people initially didn't trust the results of his unconventional methods David Card, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens have been awarded this year's Nobel prize for economics for work that ""challenged conventional wisdom"". The trio shared the prize for pioneering work in the use of ""natural experiments"". Natural experiments use real-life situations to work out the impact of government decisions. Prof Card is best known for his study of the impact of minimum wage increases on employment in US states. His findings prompted researchers to review their opinion that such increases always lead to falls in employment. Economists cannot run lab experiments to test their theories, so have to rely on theoretical models and the examination of complex, real life situations. The winners' work had ""substantially improved our ability to answer key causal questions, which has been of great benefit to society,"" said Peter Fredriksson, chair of the Economic Sciences Prize Committee. Canadian-born Prof Card, who works at University of California, Berkeley, receives half of the 10 million Swedish crowns (Â£839,000) prize, while Israeli-American Joshua Angrist from MIT and Guido Imbens, a Dutch academic at Stanford University, share the other half. Their work solved methodological problems to show that precise conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments. Climate science breakthroughs win physics Nobel Journalists Ressa and Muratov win Nobel Peace Prize Chemistry Nobel awarded for mirror-image molecules Speaking to reporters, Prof Imbens said he was ""absolutely thrilled to hear the news, in particular... hearing that I got to share this with Joshua Angrist and David Card who are both very good friends of mine"". He added that Prof Angrist had been the best man at his wedding. ""I'm just thrilled to share the prize with both him and David."" Prof Card initially thought the news of the award was ""a joke"" played on him by an old high school friend, he told the BBC. His work on the minimum wage was conducted at Princeton in the 1980s in collaboration with Alan Krueger, who went on to become assistant secretary of the Treasury under President Obama. They surveyed restaurants in New Jersey before and after the introduction of a minimum wage in the state, an approach that was quite unusual at the time, Prof Card said. But he said their findings, that the minimum wage had not led to significant job losses, was not immediately accepted. ""People thought we were either cooking the books or had lost our minds or did something untoward or foolish,"" he said. However the methodology, of collecting and analysing real world data, opened people's eyes to a new way of analysing the economy, he said. His subsequent work has included the impact of immigration on domestic employment in the US and how company wage policies determine gender and ethnic pay gaps. UC Berkeley said Prof Card had ""challenged orthodoxy and dramatically shifted understanding of inequality and the social and economic forces that impact low-wage workers"". Taken together, the work by the three economists ""revolutionised empirical work"" in economics, the Nobel award committee said. Although not one of the original Nobel Prizes, the economics award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and is the last to be announced each year. The other Nobel prizes were established by Alfred Nobel's will in 1895. The economics prize, officially known as the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden's central bank) Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel, was created in 1968. Last year, the prize was won by Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson of Stanford University for their work on making auctions run more efficiently. They used game theory, which uses mathematics to study decision-making conflict, and strategy in social situation, to explore the behaviour of bidders, which in turn helped in developing formats for the sale of aircraft landing slots, radio spectrums, and emissions trading. In 2019, it was awarded to Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer, for their work on the causes and remedies of poverty. Why do the Nobel prizes matter?

"This video can not be played Midnight rush for shops and pubs as Sydney reopens Australia's largest city, Sydney, has emerged from Covid lockdown after almost four months, with locals celebrating a range of new freedoms. People queued for pubs and shops that opened at midnight on Monday. Many others have been enjoying anticipated reunions with relatives and friends. Household visits and travel had been banned beyond a 5km (3.1 mile) zone. Sydney exited lockdown after New South Wales state reached a 70% double-dose vaccination target for over-16s. Most restrictions have now been eased for fully vaccinated people. People can now share meals together at reopened cafes and restaurants, and visit gyms, libraries and pools. There were long queues for barbers and nail salons on Monday. The Lord Gladstone Hotel, an inner city pub, was doing a roaring lunch trade after months of limited trading and takeaway-only options. ""We're stoked to be back, we're having the best Monday in months, even before Covid,"" Pat Blake, the pub's licensee, told the BBC. ""People are just ready to come back and sit down for a schooie [beer], see their friends, be somewhere there's always music playing,"" he said. ""The kitchen is pumping. I had forgotten about the pub smells. As soon as the fryers turned on it was really nostalgic."" Australia's most populous state has reached a 70% vaccination target for over-16s Queues formed for many reopened businesses on Monday More restrictions will ease when 80% of over-16s are fully vaccinated. Currently, over 90% have received a first dose. ""It's been a difficult 100 days,"" state Premier Dominic Perrottet said on Monday. ""But the efforts that people have made right across the state, to go out and get vaccinated, has enabled this great day."" Mr Perrottet warned that NSW was bracing for a surge in Covid cases, but said the healthcare system had been preparing for weeks. ""We'll see hospitalisations increaseâ¦ but we need to learn to live alongside the virus,"" he said. The state has not yet imposed a system to check vaccination status, leaving it up to individual businesses. Sydney's lockdown began in late June after a Delta variant outbreak took hold, leading to more than 50,000 infections and 439 deaths. How Delta burst Australia's Covid bubble Australia sends in army to enforce Sydney lockdown Covid crisis causes fury in Aboriginal communities It spread to Melbourne and Canberra, prompting them to go into lockdown, as well as to New Zealand. Canberra is due to exit lockdown on Friday, while Melbourne is predicted to reopen in late October. The NSW government is ramping up support for businesses to recover quickly Australia had previously adhered to a Covid elimination strategy, and this remains the objective in some states. But the rapid spread of the Delta variant forced a greater focus on vaccination effortsso Australia could switch to ""living with the virus"". Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have remained virus-free after shutting their borders to infected states. Authorities have flagged that Australians living abroad could travel back into Sydney next month, as the nation's borders reopen.

"The UK has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Net zero means a country takes as much of these planet-warming gases - such as carbon dioxide - out of the atmosphere as it puts in. The UK has been relatively successful in cutting its emissions so far. But the government's independent advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), have expressed concerns that the UKcould miss its future targets, owing to ""worryingly slow"" recent progress. And in May 2024 theHigh Court ruledfor the second time in two years that the government would have to redraft its net zero strategy because its existing plan did not provide enough detail about how future targets could be met. What progress is being made? Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing? Since 1990, the UK's carbon emissions from electricity supply havefallen by more than three-quarters.,external This is due to a decline in using fossil fuels - in particular coal - for electricity. In 2023, about 47% of electricity was generated by renewables, such as wind and solar,according to provisional data,external. That is up from 7% in 2010. The government pledged thatall of the UK's electricity would come from low carbon sourcesby 2035. It plans toincrease offshore wind capacity five-fold,externalby 2030,increase solar power capacity five-fold,externalby 2035, andexpand nuclear power,external. However, reports by theCCC,external, theNational Audit Office,externaland across-party group of MPs,externalhave warned that the UK risks missing its 2035 target without clearer planning and much faster action. Where does the UK get its energy and electricity? Despite the push for renewable energy, the government announced in July 2023 that it was granting100 oil and gas production licencesfor the North Sea. The government says it wants to reduce the UK's reliance on imported energy such as gas from ""hostile states"". But the CCC says investing in renewables would be a better way to reduce reliance on imports andbring bills downfor consumers. It says the expansion of fossil fuel production ""is not in line with net zero,external"". North Sea oil and gas claims fact-checked Buildings account forabout 17% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions,external, mainly due to burning fossil fuels for heating. The government has committed to installing 600,000 electricheat pumpsa year by 2028 to replace gas boilers, but this target is ""significantly off track"",the CCC says,external. In 2023, the Prime Ministerincreased grantsto Â£7,500 to help homeowners in England and Wales install a heat pump. This has led to asurge in applications.,external However, he also said around a fifth of homes would never be required to switch from a fossil fuel boiler. This makes net zero by 2050 ""considerably harder to achieve"", the CCC warned. The UK has some of theleast energy-efficient homes,externalin Europe. Insulation is one of the most effective ways to reduce emissions from housing, by reducing the energy needed for heating. The government has introduced theGreat British Insulation Scheme,externalto help insulate around 300,000 of the poorest-performing homes. But in September 2023, the government cancelled regulations that would have required landlords to improve the energy efficiency of private rented homes. Transport (not including aviation and shipping)accounted for just under a quarter,externalof UK emissions in 2022, making it the largest emitting sector. The government hasdelayed its banon the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035, a move which has divided the car industry. But it has set quotas for the percentage of a manufacturer's sales that have to bezero emission, increasing year-on-year to 80% by 2030. This has been welcomed by the CCC. Electric car sales have been faring relatively well,according to the CCC,external. In 2023,16.5% of new car sales were battery electric vehicles,external- up from less than 2% in 2019. Thegovernment wants 300,000 publicly-accessible charging points,externalfor electric cars by 2030, in addition to those in private homes or workplaces. The number of public charging points had increased tomore than 60,000,externalby the end of April 2024 - up by 45% from the previous year- but these are not evenly distributed across the UK. Nearly half of allnew bus registrations,externalwere zero-emission in 2023. The government has committed further funding forregional electric bus schemes,external, but is yet to confirm when it will end the sale of diesel buses. The government aims to remove all diesel-only trains by 2040, butthe CCC argues,externalit needs a clearer plan to achieve this. Overall,the CCC says,externalthere has been ""little progress"" switching to lower carbon modes of travel, such as public transport. Flyingmakes up,externalabout 7% of overall UK emissions, andshipping about,external3%. The UK hasa strategy,externalfor delivering net zero aviation by 2050. It has been criticised forrelying too muchon technologies such as cleaner fuels and zero emissions aircraft that are unlikely to be widely available anytime soon. As a result,the CCC says,externalthat the government should be looking at how to manage demand rather than allowing it to grow - for example addressing private jet use and providing lower cost rail travel. In April 2024 the government announceda target for 10% of jet fuel to come from ""sustainable sources"",externalby 2030. Progress has also been slow to establish a strategy to decarbonise shipping,the CCC says,external. Agriculture and the way land is usedproduce 11%,externalof the UK's greenhouse gas emissions. The government released its food strategy in June 2022, but theCCC said,externalit failed to deliver action to drive down emissions from agriculture at the required scale or pace. It has also been criticised fornot doing moreto encourage a switch to a more sustainable diet - eating more plant-based food, for example. Meat consumption in the UKhas been fallingthough - down 17% in the decade to 2019. In February 2023, the governmentreleased details,externalof its long-awaited environmental land management schemes for England, replacing the EU common agricultural policy. The schemes mean farmers can apply for public money to support activities that benefit the environment. What's your diet's carbon footprint? Trees and peatlandsplay important roles,externalin removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. UKforest cover,externalis 13%,among the lowest,externalin Europe. The government has atarget to plant,external30,000 hectares of trees a year by 2025. However, annual UK tree planting hasnot risen above,external15,000 hectares since 2001. TheUK forestry body has warnedthat there is ""zero chance"" of the UK meeting its target. It is estimated thatonly around 20% of UK peatlands are in a near-natural state,external, including only 1.3% in England. These damaged peatlandsare responsible for around 5%of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, whereas healthy peatlands would take up CO2. The government aims to restore around 29,000 hectares of peatland a year across England, Scotland and Wales by 2025. But current levels areless than half this,external, leaving the target ""significantly off track"", the CCC says. Hydrogen is a low-carbon fuel that could be used for transport, heating, power generation or energy storage. Thegovernment considers,externalhydrogen to be a critical part of future energy security and decarbonisation. Itwants to have,externala 10GW hydrogen production capacity by 2030. The industry is very much in its infancy, andthe government admits,externalit will need ""rapid and significant scale-up"" in the coming years. It has announced aseries of projects and incentives for investment,external. The government has promised a decision on the role of hydrogen in heating in 2026, buthad to cancel a proposed trialbecause the main source of hydrogen supply was not ready. The government sees technologies to capture the CO2 produced by power stations and industrial processes as a key part of its net zero strategy. It aims to capture and storebetween 20 and 30 million tonnes of CO2 a year,externalby 2030. In March 2023, the Chancellor pledged Â£20bn in investment in carbon capture over the next 20 years, andseveral projects have been announced,externalaround the UK. But the technology is still emerging, is expensive, and can only capture a portion of emissions. What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change? Industrial emissionsrepresent about 14%,externalof the UK's total. The government aims to cut emissions from manufacturing by about two thirds by 2035. It hasa scheme to cap the amount of emissions,externalallowed by individual sectors each year, reducing that amount over time. But the scheme risks companies shifting production to other countries.

"This video can not be played Consistency and the lack of publicity around Covid passes are some issues raised by people in Cardiff People in Wales now need an NHS Covid pass to be able to legally attend big events or nightclubs. They are compulsory for over-18s, and show people have either tested negative on a lateral flow test or are fully vaccinated against Covid. Wales' rugby game against New Zealand on 30 October will be one of the first mass events to require Covid passes. Some nightclub bosses said they felt ""singled out"" by the rules, but other people said they felt reassured. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the new scheme was ""vulnerable to abuse"" but the ""huge bulk of people"" will follow the new rules. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Covid pass breaches 'should not be police priority' Wales to introduce Covid passes from next month The Principality Stadium, with a capacity of almost 75,000, will be one of the first to host a mass event with Covid passes Asked if people could falsify their lateral flow tests, Mr Drakeford said: ""It is vulnerable to people who want to abuse the system but that's why the law is there."" ""I am quite sure the huge bulk of people will use the lateral flow test in the correct way,"" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain programme. He also rejected claims the new Covid pass was a financial burden for businesses, adding: ""Nightclubs already have to check people for their age. ""I don't think the cost issue is a very significant one here."" In its autumn and winter plan Mr Drakeford's government has not ruled out extending the scheme if further action is needed to tackle Covid rates. He suggested that could include using passes when going to care homes or visiting hospitals. ""If numbers in the community continue to rise... being able to show a Covid pass if you were going into a care home might be an extra defence,"" he said. Covid passes will be required in nightclubs in Wales, under the plans Welsh Education Minister Jeremy Miles toldBBC Politics Walesthat public services were expected to face ""significant pressure"" this winter, and the pass would cut transmission of the virus. The Senedd voted on the passes last Tuesday - a vote the Welsh government saidwill not be repeated, despite it passing by just one vote. Anyone who is over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, can get a pass. They are compulsory for anyone over 18 to enter: Nightclubs or similar venues Indoor no-seating events with more than 500 people Outdoor no-seating events with more than 4,000 people Any event with more than 10,000 people, including sport The Welsh government says any venue that can serve alcohol, is open between midnight and 0500, and where music is provided for dancing will need to check for passes. That means it could cover other venues not traditionally considered nightclubs which have a late licence. Venues can either apply the pass rules from when they open their doors, or when they open their dancefloor. Negative tests will be self-certified but the Welsh governmentplans to make it illegal to fake a negative test. Large events could also be allowed to check passes at random, rather than check every person who attends. The Welsh government says the passes can be downloaded to people's phones TheNHS Covid Pass,externalis available digitally but you need to register for anNHS login,externalvia the website. You need to upload a photo of your ID. That can be a passport, full UK driving licence or full European driving licence. This allows you to produce a Covid pass using a smart phone, computer or laptop. Your NHS Covid Pass includes a barcode. The expiry date refers to the barcode and will update automatically. It does not apply to your vaccination status. In Wales, you cannot get the pass via the NHS app, as this is only valid in England. Big sport games are some of the bigger events that will be affected by the rule change Wales is not the first nation to introduce such a pass. In France, people have had to prove they are fully vaccinated, have recently tested negative or recently recovered from Covid with a ""health pass"". That must be produced on entering cafes, restaurants or public transport. Scotland is the only other UK nation to use them afterthey were introduced on 1 October. Mike Murray will close Prestatyn's Bar 236 early rather than implement passes One nightclub and bar in Denbighshire has decided to close earlier in the evening rather than dealing with the ""complexity"" of implementing Covid passes. Mike Murray, manager of Bar 236 in Prestatyn, said the club used to stay open past midnight with live music and DJs, but would need extra staffing to police the system, and it was not worth it financially. ""We always weighed up the situation, following the government guidelines to make it a safe and comfortable environment to drink in. Since the hospitality industry re-opened, staff have erred on the side of caution when observing the rules, says Mike Murray of Bar 236 in Prestatyn ""We've even been keeping masks on and doing table service after the government advice changed because what's wrong with doing it a little longer to keep people comfortable?"" He added he received a lack of guidance from Welsh government as to ""what passes would look like or where we could get one from if people asked"". ""We want people to come in and let common sense prevail: If you're unwell, don't come to the bar."" Nightclub owner Guto Brychan said different rules could be a problem as students return from outside Wales The decision to introduce Covid passes has very much split opinion, which was evident in the Senedd vote. Guto Brychan, chief executive of Cardiff music venue Clwb Ifor Bach, said the timing made things difficult as students had just returned to university and it is ""the busiest time of year"". He said this was made more difficult because many students are from outside Wales and may not understand the law. Clubbers and businesses torn over Wales Covid pass Mr Brychan said: ""One of the main concerns as well is that the Covid pass isn't uniform across the whole of the hospitality industry. ""It seems to have been specifically designed to target places that supply dancing or culture, but I'd argue the high risk activity here is the consumption of alcohol, not dancing. ""There'll be plenty of venues open as late as ourselves that will have as many people in them but won't have the restrictions that we have in place."" Lidi Staffurth has been shielding during the pandemic and said the rules will make shielders feel more comfortable Lidi Staffurth is one of thousands of people who have been shielding during the pandemic due to a condition which makes them extremely vulnerable to Covid-19. She said Covid passes would help reassure people who might feel uncertain about attending large events, adding she felt she had her ""freedom back"". Ms Staffurth labelled it a ""brilliant idea"", not least because there are three young people in her family. ""If they're in large groups then we'll know they're around people who are double vaccinated, or at least free from Covid,"" she said. ""I think it's a fantastic idea and for a society at large it means people are looking after each other. ""I think some young people just don't care - they've had it with Covid, and I think we've all had it with Covid - but they live in their own little bubble and they don't really see beyond that bubble a lot. ""And that's fair enough, but it means with a Covid pass they're made to consider that."" David Chapman, executive director for UK Hospitality in Wales, called for ""tolerance"" from government, licencing authorities and the public as the passes were introduced. He toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfastthere was some ""trepidation"" in the industry, particularly about alignment with England, as well as staff shortages. ""We've got staffing problems as people will know already and more labour intensive moves such as this actually makes it quite difficult for a business to juggle resources well at the moment,"" he said. He also called for the ""easiest possible trading conditions"" over Christmas, saying businesses had been told passes would stop ""stop at a certain point when society and the health service can cope"". Proof of vaccination has already been required for some large events Dr Mair Hopkin, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners in Wales, said the risk of Covid will increase as the weather gets worse and people spend more time indoors. She said: ""They've introduced them in France and it seems to have been very acceptable to the French population, and also it seems to have coincided with a more rapid drop in their incidence rates. ""If that happens here then that would be a good thing."" Economy Minister Vaughan Gething said he would not ""expect perfection on day one"" as the system is introduced. He said: ""We do accept there may be problems in venues getting used to what they need to do."" Covid pass plans agreed in tight Senedd decision Where do I need to use a Covid passport?

"Industries hit by soaring energy costs have made another appeal to the government for action. Talks with ministers will continue on Monday over a crisis that has sparked warnings about some factories. Sectors such as ceramics, paper and steel manufacturing have called for a price cap, though talks with government on Friday failed to reach a solution. The Treasury has denied being in detailed talks with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng about the crisis. Dave Dalton, chief executive of the British Glass trade body, called that ""very alarming"". He was part of Friday's talks with Mr Kwarteng, but told the BBC the meeting ""was very much an introductory one. We did not get to specifics"". Mr Dalton said he had hoped the government would have made progress over the weekend, but that appears not to have happened. ""We need immediate action,"" he said. He said some members of his group may have to shut production permanently, although no firm had been forced to do so yet. The nature of glass manufacturing means production cannot be just paused, he said. ""We have large furnaces that run 24/7. If you switched a furnace off, you basically destroy the infrastructure. ""It would have to be rebuilt at a cost of tens of millions of pounds,"" Mr Dalton said. Mr Dalton said firms had ""hedged"" by buying gas in advance at lower prices but in some cases those deals were now expiring leaving firms facing much higher costs. ""We have companies that can't cope in the immediate term. And we have other companies that have to feed back to their masters overseas who will make decisions on their investment in the UK. We need a much better way to planning our way through this problem,"" he said. Mr Kwarteng will not be involved directly at Monday's talks with industry representatives, according to BBC political correspondent Adam Fleming. Business minister Lee Rowley will lead the meeting with industry representatives later this afternoon, and is having another meeting with steel bosses on Tuesday. Why are gas prices so high? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Adrian Curry, managing director of UK-based Encirc, one of the largest container glass plants in Europe, said industry was not asking for a bailout, but the situation for some companies was critical. ""We pay more for our energy than competitors in other countries,"" he told the BBC. He said his company would normally spend Â£40m a year on energy, but was now looking at bills up to Â£100m. ""It's quite incredible,"" he said, adding that costs will have to be passed on to customers. And while there was not a threat to his company's survival, it was clear talking to others in industry that many companies are hurting. Some companies are considering stopping production to cut costs, and others ""are very close to the edge"". Domestic energy consumers have a certain amount of protection from rising prices due to a price cap, which sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. However, the cap was increased on 1 October, meaning about 15 million households face a 12% rise in energy bills. Industry has no such cap, meaning they are open to the risk of an unlimited rise in prices. Already manufacturers and services are warning they will have to pass on their rising costs to consumers. And as energy costs are a big driver of inflation, few consumers and households will escape the consequences of the current crisis. Trade group UK Steel told the BBC that Boris Johnson needed to take control before it was too late - although it described as ""really good news"" an announcement that the country's third largest steel maker, Liberty Steel, would restart operations at its plant in Rotherham later this month. The Unite union also called on the prime minister to ""get a grip"" to avert job losses if companies have to shut production because they cannot cope with the increased cost of energy. However, Conservative MP Mark Harper said the government should resist demands for financial support. There's no single reason, but a convergence of factors nationally and globally. There's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies as countries emerged from lockdown and industry re-opened. A cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, stored gas levels are much lower than normal. On top of that, the UK has comparatively fewer gas storage facilities than some countries, meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. There's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas. And there is a suspicion that major gas supplier Russia is restricting output (an accusation it denies) which, following the law of supply and demand, has fuelled price rises. This has helped push up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they've risen 250%. And prices have soared 70% since August alone. Read more here Ed Miliband MP, Labour's Shadow Business Secretary, said: ""Yet again we see that in the face of their failed energy policy, the government has nothing to offer businesses or consumers to help them with the crisis they are facing. ""For firms and families waiting to hear how the Business Secretary might help, there is a total absence of a plan and no extra help. ""The government is squabbling amongst itself, with the Treasury even denying they are talking to BEIS about providing help for large, energy intensive industries."" On Sunday, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the situation was ""critical"" and said he was ""looking to find a solution"". ""We already have existing support and we're looking to see whether that's sufficient to get us through this situation,"" he said. However, a Treasury source said the business secretary had been ""mistaken"" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Are you a business owner?

"This video can not be played Prince Charles: My Aston Martin runs on wine and cheese The Prince of Wales has told the BBC he understands why campaigners from organisations like Extinction Rebellion take to the streets to demand action on climate change. Inthe interview at his home in Balmoral,Prince Charles said action such as blocking roads ""isn't helpful"". But he said he totally understood the ""frustration"" climate campaigners felt. And he warned of a ""catastrophic"" impact if more ambitious action isn't taken on climate change. Speaking in the gardens of his houseâ¯on the Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire, the prince said it had taken too long for the world to wake up to the risks of climate change.â¯ And he worried that world leaders would ""just talk"" when they meet in Glasgow in November for a crucial UN climate conference.â¯ ""The problem is to get action on the ground,"" he said. Watch full interview on BBC iPlayer: Prince Charles and his battle for our planet What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? Asked if he sympathised with Greta Thunberg, the climate campaigner who has also criticised leaders for failing to act, he said:â¯""Of course I do, yes. ""All these young people feel nothing is ever happening so of course they're going to get frustrated.â¯ I totally understand because nobody would listen and they see their future being totally destroyed."" The prince also said he understood why groups such as Extinction Rebellion were taking their protests to the streets. ""But it isn't helpful, I don't think, to do it in a way that alienates people.â¯ ""So I totally understand the frustration, the difficulty is how do you direct that frustration in a way that is more constructive rather than destructive."" When asked if the UK government wasâ¯doing enough to combat climate change, the prince replied:â¯â¯""I couldn't possibly comment."" The interview took place inâ¯Prince George's Wood, an arboretum the Prince of Walesâ¯hasâ¯createdâ¯in the gardens ofâ¯Birkhall on the Balmoral estate. He planted the first treeâ¯when Prince George,â¯his oldestâ¯grandchild, was born andâ¯he said the project had become ""an old man's obsession"".â¯ Prince George's Wood is designed to showcase autumn colours Prince Charlesâ¯was frank about the shortcomings of businesses to take action on climate.â¯â¯â¯ Heâ¯has long argued engaging business leaders in tackling climate change would be crucial in limiting global temperature rises.â¯â¯ This has been a key strand of his campaigning over the years, most recently through his Sustainable Markets Initiative.â¯â¯â¯ The prince said that, while governments can bring billions of dollars to the effort, the private sector has the potential to mobilise trillions of dollars.â¯â¯ But he told the BBC he feared many business executives still didn't give environmental issues the priority they deserved.â¯â¯â¯ Many of the young people they employ really mind about environment issues but, he said, ""they haven't quite got to the top to make a fundamental difference"". Heâ¯said the Glasgow climate conference was ""a last chance saloon"" and said it would be ""a disaster"" if the world did not come together to tackle climate change.â¯ ""I mean it'll be catastrophic. It is already beginning to be catastrophic because nothing in nature can survive the stress that is created by these extremes of weather,"" he said.â¯ Challenged about his own efforts to reduce his carbon footprint, Prince Charles said he had switched the heating of Birkhall to biomass boilers, using woodâ¯chipsâ¯from trees felled in theâ¯estate'sâ¯forest.â¯â¯â¯ He has installed solar panels at Clarence House, his London residence, and on the farm buildings of his Gloucestershire home, Highgrove.â¯â¯â¯ He said he hadâ¯installed heat pumps at some of his propertiesâ¯andâ¯a hydroelectric turbine in the river that runs besideâ¯Birkhall.â¯ He was also challenged on his long-standing love of cars, and asked if he was ""a bit of a Jeremy Clarkson, a bit of a petrol-head?"" ""Well, yes"", the prince acknowledged: ""But that was before we knew what the problems were.""â¯â¯ He said he hadâ¯converted his favourite vehicle, an Aston Martin he has owned for 51 years, to run on what he described as ""surplus English white wine and whey from the cheese process"". His Aston Martin has been modified to run on a fuel called E85 - made up of 85% bioethanol and 15% unleaded petrol. Bioethanol can be derived from different sources - including in the case of the prince's car - surplus wine and alcohol extracted from fermented whey. The blue DB6 Mk2 Volante was given to the Prince of Wales for his 21st birthday He said most of the vehicles used on his estates were now electric but ""it can't all be done with electric vehicles"", and that hydrogen technology would needâ¯to be part of the mix as transportation was decarbonised.â¯â¯â¯ Top of the list of the concerns he had about electric vehicles was price, ""they are not cheap"", he said.â¯ He was also worried about how the materials for batteries would be sourced and how they would be recycled.â¯â¯â¯ ""At the moment there is a huge amount of waste which is really worrying,"" he said.â¯ The prince acknowledged how difficult it was for most people to reduce their carbon footprint.â¯ He said he had changed his diet to reduce his impact on the environment and urgedâ¯others to do the same.â¯â¯â¯ He now doesn't eat meat and fishâ¯onâ¯two days each week and doesn't eat any dairy products on another day.â¯â¯â¯ ""If more people did that it would reduce a lot of the pressure on the environment,"" heâ¯said.â¯â¯â¯ Trees were a great way to capture carbon and improve the urban environment, he said, suggesting avenues of trees might be planted to commemorate those who hadâ¯died in the coronavirus pandemic.â¯â¯ The prince recognised that low carbon travel remains a big challenge.â¯ He said he hoped flying would become easier and more sustainable when newâ¯bio-fuels,â¯using carbon captured from the air with sustainably sourced hydrogen, become available.â¯ But he believedâ¯systemic changeâ¯was necessary to bring about the transformation of transportation and other industries that wouldâ¯be required to drive down emissions.â¯ ""No one person can solve the problem,"" heâ¯said. ""It's a pinprick.""â¯ This video can not be played Greta Thunberg mocked the ''empty words and promises'' of world leaders as ""blah, blah, blah"" â¯The prince said the keyâ¯would be making theâ¯environmentally friendly options cheaper for everyone.â¯â¯ ""We still have fossil fuel subsidies, why?"" he asked.â¯â¯â¯ He described as ""crazy"" the fact there were still subsidies for what he called ""insaneâ¯agro-industrial approaches to farming which are a disaster in many ways, cause huge damage and contribute enormously to emissions"". He said there were similar ""perverse"" subsidies for the fishing industry which he said causedâ¯""mammoth damage"" through trawling.â¯ The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade: Emissions It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - agreenhouse gas which causes climate change. This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Coal For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after a late intervention by China and India. PM: Climate deal sounds death knell for coal power Evasive words and coal compromise, but deal shows progress Developing countries The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? Fossil fuel subsidies World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. How much is still spent supporting oil, coal and gas? A flurry of other announcements were made: The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China,pledged to cooperate more over the next decadein areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Cautious welcome for US-China climate agreement Why China's climate policy matters to us all Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests -promised to stop deforestationby 2030. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiativeshaven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. Ascheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030was agreed by more than 100 countries. Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tnagreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015Paris Agreement. Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reachnet zeroby mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you?

"This video can not be played Kwasi Kwarteng: ""The energy price cap stays"" Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has not committed to any additional government help for businesses struggling amid record gas prices. Some industries have warned firms could be forced to shut down operations. Mr Kwarteng said he was working closely with the chancellor over possible support for energy intensive sectors - but a Treasury source denied this. The business secretary said domestic customers would not see a change to the energy price cap this winter. Asked on BBC One's Andrew Marr programme whether there would be additional government help for energy-intensive companies, Mr Kwarteng described the situation as ""critical"" and said he was ""looking to find a solution"". When Andrew Marr suggested this sounded like a ""yes"" the business secretary said: ""No, it doesn't sound like yes at all. ""We already have existing support and we're looking to see whether that's sufficient to get us through this situation."" Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Speaking to Times Radio Mr Kwarteng, who met leaders from heavy industry on Friday, said he was not going to commit to ""any firm figure or subsidy"" for companies. Asked about whether the government would ensure factories would not have to close if they could not pay for gas he said it was a commercial decision and ""up to them"". He added: ""We are not in the business of bail-outs. What we are in the business of is ensuring security of supply and that is what I am focused on."" Wholesale gas prices have risen 250% since January. CEO of British Glass Dave Dalton, who was at Friday's meeting with Mr Kwarteng, said some of the confederation's ""significant"" members were ""teetering on the edge"". ""I think some companies are staring down the ability to survive, absolutely - ultimately that obviously cascades on to jobs and impacts on the consumer,"" he told the BBC. Gareth Stace, director general of UK Steel, said he was frustrated by the lack of action to support businesses. He told the BBC that without help in the next week or so, there would be ""significant and permanent damage to the UK steel sector"". Unite leader Sharon Graham said the country was ""contemplating factory shutdowns across viable manufacturing and businesses"" and that workers were ""worried sick"". Businesses have been shouting louder and louder for support through this period of soaring energy prices. This morning, the business secretary told the BBC he was listening to their concerns - but would not commit to any extra support. Those industries that use a lot of energy for manufacturing say that the time for working out a way forward has long gone. The director general of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, expressed his frustration, saying pauses in steel production will only increase. The government says the current situation emphasises the need for a revolution in how we generate energy, moving towards home-grown renewables. But that's little comfort for those businesses dependent on energy from fossil fuels now, competing with intense demand in a global market. On the Andrew Marr show, Mr Kwarteng denied asking for ""billions"" from the Treasury to subsidise energy-intensive businesses and said supply itself was ""not an issue"". A Treasury source said the business secretary had been ""mistaken"" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the government ""needs to get a grip"" and called for ""urgent answers on who exactly is running the show"". ""The two key government departments responsible for the current cost of living crisis have spent this morning infighting about whether they were in talks with each other. What a farce,"" she said. She also accused the government of having ""put its out of office on"", referring to reports that the prime minister is on holiday in Spain. A number of Conservative MPs have called for the government to take action to support heavy industry. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford called on the UKgovernment to ""nurse"" businesses through the crisis, describing it as a ""perfect storm"". The domestic consumer energy price cap, which is reviewed every six months, sets the maximum level a supplier can charge a consumer on a standard tariff in England, Wales and Scotland. Mr Kwarteng told Marr that protecting consumers was his ""first and foremost objective"" and as such the price cap would stay at its current level until its next update which is due to in April. Some suppliers say the cap is just delaying an inevitable increase in consumer prices and should be reviewed more regularly. Energy regulator Ofgem has warned households will seefurther ""significant rises"" in the spring, when the cap is reviewed. Asked by Marr if he was sure the lights would stay on this winter, Mr Kwarteng said ""yes, I am"". Due to high gas prices household energy suppliers have been forced to sell gas for less than they can buy it due to the price cap, leading some to fail. Last month, nine domestic energy supply companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers and on to higher rates. Paul Richards, chief executive of Together Energy, which he said is currently making losses, said while he supported a price cap to protect customers, the current mechanism ""is not fit for industry, nor is it fit for customers"". He said it protected customers in the short term but somewhere between Â£1bn and Â£3bn in costs would be spread back across business and households as a result of suppliers going bust. The founder of OVO Energy Stephen Fitzpatrick told Marr that it has been ""too easy"" for companies to enter the energy market and that there will be more companies in difficulty. He said the market was a complicated one, and he thought some people had not understood the risks. A LOVE LETTER TO THE NORTH:The Hairy Bikers head to Cumbria and the Lake District!

"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too.

"Industries hit by soaring energy costs have made another appeal to the government for action. Talks with ministers will continue on Monday over a crisis that has sparked warnings about some factories. Sectors such as ceramics, paper and steel manufacturing have called for a price cap, though talks with government on Friday failed to reach a solution. The Treasury has denied being in detailed talks with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng about the crisis. Dave Dalton, chief executive of the British Glass trade body, called that ""very alarming"". He was part of Friday's talks with Mr Kwarteng, but told the BBC the meeting ""was very much an introductory one. We did not get to specifics"". Mr Dalton said he had hoped the government would have made progress over the weekend, but that appears not to have happened. ""We need immediate action,"" he said. He said some members of his group may have to shut production permanently, although no firm had been forced to do so yet. The nature of glass manufacturing means production cannot be just paused, he said. ""We have large furnaces that run 24/7. If you switched a furnace off, you basically destroy the infrastructure. ""It would have to be rebuilt at a cost of tens of millions of pounds,"" Mr Dalton said. Mr Dalton said firms had ""hedged"" by buying gas in advance at lower prices but in some cases those deals were now expiring leaving firms facing much higher costs. ""We have companies that can't cope in the immediate term. And we have other companies that have to feed back to their masters overseas who will make decisions on their investment in the UK. We need a much better way to planning our way through this problem,"" he said. Mr Kwarteng will not be involved directly at Monday's talks with industry representatives, according to BBC political correspondent Adam Fleming. Business minister Lee Rowley will lead the meeting with industry representatives later this afternoon, and is having another meeting with steel bosses on Tuesday. Why are gas prices so high? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Adrian Curry, managing director of UK-based Encirc, one of the largest container glass plants in Europe, said industry was not asking for a bailout, but the situation for some companies was critical. ""We pay more for our energy than competitors in other countries,"" he told the BBC. He said his company would normally spend Â£40m a year on energy, but was now looking at bills up to Â£100m. ""It's quite incredible,"" he said, adding that costs will have to be passed on to customers. And while there was not a threat to his company's survival, it was clear talking to others in industry that many companies are hurting. Some companies are considering stopping production to cut costs, and others ""are very close to the edge"". Domestic energy consumers have a certain amount of protection from rising prices due to a price cap, which sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. However, the cap was increased on 1 October, meaning about 15 million households face a 12% rise in energy bills. Industry has no such cap, meaning they are open to the risk of an unlimited rise in prices. Already manufacturers and services are warning they will have to pass on their rising costs to consumers. And as energy costs are a big driver of inflation, few consumers and households will escape the consequences of the current crisis. Trade group UK Steel told the BBC that Boris Johnson needed to take control before it was too late - although it described as ""really good news"" an announcement that the country's third largest steel maker, Liberty Steel, would restart operations at its plant in Rotherham later this month. The Unite union also called on the prime minister to ""get a grip"" to avert job losses if companies have to shut production because they cannot cope with the increased cost of energy. However, Conservative MP Mark Harper said the government should resist demands for financial support. There's no single reason, but a convergence of factors nationally and globally. There's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies as countries emerged from lockdown and industry re-opened. A cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, stored gas levels are much lower than normal. On top of that, the UK has comparatively fewer gas storage facilities than some countries, meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. There's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas. And there is a suspicion that major gas supplier Russia is restricting output (an accusation it denies) which, following the law of supply and demand, has fuelled price rises. This has helped push up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they've risen 250%. And prices have soared 70% since August alone.

""For firms and families waiting to hear how the Business Secretary might help, there is a total absence of a plan and no extra help. ""The government is squabbling amongst itself, with the Treasury even denying they are talking to BEIS about providing help for large, energy intensive industries."" On Sunday, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the situation was ""critical"" and said he was ""looking to find a solution"". ""We already have existing support and we're looking to see whether that's sufficient to get us through this situation,"" he said. However, a Treasury source said the business secretary had been ""mistaken"" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Are you a business owner?

"In a letter to parents, the health and education secretaries have urged adults to persuade their children to get vaccinated Sajid Javid and Nadhim Zahawi say getting jabbed is ""one of the best things young people can do to protect themselves and those around them"" As of 04:00 BST, the UK's travel red list has been cut from 54 countries to seven It ends hotel quarantine rules for people arriving from South Africa, Mexico, Brazil and other countries Separately, fully vaccinated travellers arriving in the UK from 37 other countries will also have to comply with fewer rules An AstraZeneca antibody therapy can reduce the chances of high-risk people developing severe, life-threatening Covid, clinical trial results show In Wales, NHS Covid passes are now compulsory for entry to big events or nightclubs Edited by Hamish Mackay We're pausing our live coverage of the pandemic now, thanks for joining us. We'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a reminder of the day's top Covid stories:  Today's live page was written by Jennifer Meierhans, Doug Faulkner, George Bowden and Alexandra FouchÃ©. It was edited by Holly Wallis and Hamish Mackay. The number of Covid cases remains high in the UK, with the seven-day average now at 37,991 new cases per day. The number of daily deaths remains steady, with the seven-day average at 111 per day. Some 28 deaths have been reported today but the beginning of the week tends to see lower figures due to reporting lags over the weekend. There has been a fall in the number of patients admitted to hosptialis with coronavirus. The most recent data, which is from last week, shows there are 6,728 patients in hospital. This video can not be played As we reported earlier, First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford has condemned anti-vaccine protesters who left people feeling ""targeted"". He was speaking after a 15-year-old girl said she felt intimidated by protesters at a mass vaccination centre on Saturday. Ipswich has the eighth-highest number of cases per 100,000 people in England The coronavirus infection rate for Ipswich has jumped up by 40% in a week, according to official figures. The Suffolk town has the eighth-highest number of cases per 100,000 people in England, and there were 880 new Covid cases in the week to 6 October. Hotspot areas were Belstead Hills, Stoke Park and Gipping and Chantry Park, and there were a high number of cases among school-aged children. Public Health Suffolk says it is taking the rise in cases ""seriously"". According to the figures, Ipswich's 40% rise is one of the biggest week-on-week increases seen in any area in England.

Free tests were made available earlier this year, partly as a way to control infections at a time when vaccines were not widely available. But they've also been used to enable unvaccinated people to access services, such as gyms, hairdressers, and eating indoors in restaurants. Some groups  will continue to get free tests in both countries - for example, those with symptoms, children and individuals with certain medical conditions who cannot get vaccinated. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Three more Russian regions have announced that Covid-19 vaccination will be
mandatory for much of the adult population, following a surge in
officially-reported cases and deaths. The Republic of Tatarstan, Maritime Territory and Jewish Autonomous District
are the latest in a growing list of Russian federal regions, including the
capital Moscow, to demand that workers from a variety of industries undergo
vaccination. Those working in healthcare, education, trade,
catering, public transport and social services will be required to have the
first component of the jab by mid-November and the second a month later,
regional health authorities have said. In recent weeks Russia has repeatedly set new
official records for daily deaths from the virus. The country's total death
toll from the virus likely exceeds
400,000, federal statistics board Rosstat said on Friday. Russia's vaccine rollout has been marred by
relatively low uptake with around 42 million people being fully vaccinated from a population of over 146 million, according
to government figures. Nonetheless, the Kremlin has distanced itself
from measures making vaccination compulsory, opposing the idea in principle but
allowing regions to implement them. Polls have shown that compulsory vaccination is not a popular prospect among
the public with 58% saying they were
against it in July, according to independent pollster Levada Centre. More than a third of fully vaccinated over-80s in England are likely to have received their Covid-19 booster jab, latest figures suggest. Of the nearly 2.7 million people aged 80 and over in England who have already received two doses of vaccine, around 923,000 are estimated to have had their booster dose - the equivalent of 34%. The figures, from NHS England, also show that 18% of double-jabbed people aged 75 to 79 are likely to have received a booster, along with 8% of those aged 70 to 74. In total, more than 2.4 million booster doses have now been delivered in England. England's chief nursing officer, Ruth May, says it is""fantastic"" that people are topping up their protection. Thailand hopes the relaxation of restrictions will boost tourism Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha has announced that visitors to Thailand from 10 countries who have been fully
vaccinated against Covid will no longer have to quarantine when they enter the
country from 1 November. The UK is among the list of âlow-risk countriesâ, along with Germany, China, the US and Singapore. âWhen they land in Thailand, they [will] have to prove that they
are Covid-free by showing their RT-PCR test result from their previous
destination and they need to have another Covid test when they arrive in
Thailand,"" the PM said in a televised address. ""After that, they can freely travel anywhere, like other Thais.â A further 40,224 Covid cases have been recorded across the UK, up from 35,077 for the same day last week -according to the latest figures,external. Another 28 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test have also been reported, five fewer than were reported last Monday. The daily coronavirus figures tend to be lower at the start of the week due to reporting lags over the weekend. A further 22,106 people received a first vaccine shot, while another 19,451 people were given a second dose on Sunday. We've got more on that joint letter from the sectaries of state for health and education encouraging parents of secondary school pupils to get them vaccinated. Their plea comes as the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show that around one in 15 children in school years 7 to 11 in England are estimated to have had Covid in the week to 2 October. The latest data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) suggests that just 9% of this cohort in England had been vaccinated by 3 October. In their letter, Zahawi and Javid ask for parents' ""support"" to encourage their children to test themselves for Covid-19 twice a week and to ""come forward"" for the jab to ensure face-to-face lessons can continue. School unions have backed the intervention, but Geoff Barton, of the Association of School and College Leaders, says there is frustration around delays to the rollout of jabs. ""The urgency of this programme is self-evident from the fact that the latest government statistics show that more than 200,000 pupils were out of school at the latest count because of coronavirus-related reasons,"" he says. ""Many schools are also experiencing teacher shortages because staff are contracting the virus."" Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, says: ""Unfortunately, one of the reasons for the slow deployment is that children are missing their chance for vaccination because they have caught Covid-19. ""If they are off sick they miss vaccination slots at school - and they cannot be jabbed while they are ill anyway - there is a 28-day waiting period before a child who has had Covid can then have the vaccine."" Whiteman is calling for other measures to be pursued - such as improved ventilation - to reduce illness and disruption and ""to speed up the vaccination rollout"". Ministers are urging parents to get their children vaccinated against Covid-19 amid concerns about the vaccination programme in secondary schools. Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi have writtena joint letter,externalthat tells the parents of children at secondary schools that ""vaccines are our best defence against Covid-19"" and that they ""help protect young people, and benefit those around them"". Three million pupils aged between 12 and 15 across the UK are eligible to receive a first Covid-19 jab as part of a rollout that began three weeks ago. Parental consent forms are required for children aged 12 to 15 to be vaccinated. You can read more about which children are being vaccinated and whyhere. Aleem MaqboolBBC News Leah Cushman US President Joe Biden has been urging US employers to issue ultimatums to their staff: get vaccinated, or lose your job. The president says he will soon bring in a mandate that requires all healthcare workers to have had the jab, and has urged states to do the same with teachers. In Concord, New Hampshire, it is striking to see some of those attending a large protest against vaccine mandates wearing hospital scrubs. Leah Cushman is prepared to lose her nursing job rather than get vaccinated. ""My beliefs are religious. I believe that my creator endowed me with an immune system that protects me, and if I get sick, that's an act of God. I would not take a medicine that affects the immune system,"" says Ms Cushman. She denies there is any conflict between these beliefs and the responsibilities of her job. Read more here. It is ""entirely unacceptable"" for anti-vaccine protesters to intimidate people outside Covid vaccination centres, the first minister of Wales has said. Mark Drakeford was speaking after a15-year-old girl and her mum were confronted by protesters in Cardiffwhile going for a jab on Saturday. He tells BBC News: ""People are entitled to protest. They are not entitled to do it in a way that causes other people to feel that they have been targeted or that has taken advantage of their vulnerabilities. ""When it comes to harassment you have to see it through the eyes of the person who is affected, not through the eyes of the person who is protesting. ""Even if it wasn't the intention to frighten people and make them feel that they had been targeted, that is what people felt and that is completely unacceptable."" As we've reported, there are warnings the UK faces an uncertain winter with the spread of coronavirus and flu combining to increase pressure on the health service. Health officials are urging people to get a flu vaccination before winter - with more than 40 million people to be offered the jab. People are at ""more significant risk of death and of serious illness if they are co-infected"" with both viruses, the head of the UK Health Protection Agency, Dr Jenny Harries,has said. So who can get a free flu jab? Find out morehere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China has recorded no new cases in the last 24 hours, even
though there have been recent outbreaks in multiple regions, and a major public
holiday has just passed. Over the last couple of weeks, there have been recorded
cases in north-west Xinjiang, north-east Heilongjiang and south-east Fujian. It has been routine for regions to swiftly lock down
communities as soon as cases are detected. Transport links are suspended, and
citywide testing drives are carried out to identify any potential âsilent
carriersâ. This has helped prevent cases from becoming more
widespread. However, China will be on high alert for potential outbreaks in the
coming weeks, ashalf a billion tourist trips were made last week,external. The first week of October is Golden Week in China. It is
the second biggest travel period after the Lunar New Year, and tens of millions
of people travel per day for the holidays. Government media urged people to stay vigilant during this
time; however, most people in China have now been fully vaccinated. Last month,official media said that more than 1 billion people have received two vaccine doses in China,external,
more than 70% of the population. The country hopes to have fully vaccinated 80% of its 1.4bn
population by the end of the year. This is the local threshold that Chinese
officials have set for âherd immunityâ. Hywel GriffithBBC News' Wales Correspondent First Minister of Wales Mark Drakeford says the use of Covid passes could be extended for visitors to enter care homes and hospitals, if the coronavirus situation deteriorates over the coming months. The new scheme, introduced from today, means people must show proof of full vaccination or a negative lateral flow result for entry to a nightclub or large event. The first minister says settings where people may be most vulnerable to Covid are also being considered. But Drakford insists that the new pass scheme will not be permanent and requirement to show a pass will be removed once the pandemic has eased. There are concerns about an increasing number of pregnant women needing intensive care treatment for Covid-19, says the chief scientific advisor to the Department of Health. Lucy Chappell, a professor in obstetrics at Kings College London, tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme that one in three women who are hospitalised will need to have their baby delivered early. ""We understand pregnant women have been hesitant about taking the Covid-19 vaccine,"" she says. ""We know that pregnant women weren't included in the clinical trials but what we have seen this year is a really large increase in the data coming out, particularly from the US and from other countries such as Israel where there has been widespread uptake of Covid-19 vaccination in pregnancy. Such that all the royal colleges are very clear on the recommendation that it is safe and effective."" She says: ""Having seen the impact that Covid-19 is having in pregnant women we are really clear about our recommendation for vaccination."" There are no plans to set specific targets for when civil servants working in central government departments should return to their desks, Downing Street has confirmed. Briefing reporters this afternoon, the prime minister's official spokesman says: ""We are seeing a steady return of civil servants to in-office working. That's what we would expect not just in the civil service, but in the private sector as well, and that will continue."" Asked whether specific targets will be set, he replies: ""No plans for any targets, as you set out. ""The civil service is following the guidance to gradually increase the number of staff in the workplace."" He adds it is for individual departments to monitor how many civil servants return to the office. PM Boris Johnson used a party conference speech last week to urge people to return to offices after long periods working from home due to the pandemic. As we've been reporting, the UK's travel red list has been cut to just seven countries - meaning more people can arrive without the need to quarantine in a government-approved hotel. There are only seven places on the red list, with arrivals subject to the harshest restrictions:  Fully-vaccinated passengers travelling to the UKfrom any non-red list country,externalno longer have to take a Covid test before setting off. All travellers - except children under five years old - still have to book and pay for a PCR test two days after arrival. But the latest changes to the UK's rules does not mean there are not restrictions for UK travellers entering other countries - so, as ever, check before you book. Read all about the current UK travel ruleshere. Downing Street says accusations of intellectual property theft and cyberattacks are taken ""extremely seriously"", following reports that the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine's design was used to create Russia's Sputnik V jab. The prime minister's official spokesman refuses to comment on the specific claims that ""security services"" sources have evidence that Russian intelligence agents stole the Oxford coronavirus vaccine design. But he says: ""We take any such accusations of intellectual property theft and cyberattacks extremely seriously, and we've called out attempts in the past. ""But as you would expect, I'm not going to comment on matters on the intelligence front."" Asked about reports that France had almost five million doses of the vaccine destined for the UK diverted, the spokesman says: ""It's thanks to the work of our vaccine programmes that we have a diverse and a strong supply of vaccinations, and we have throughout. ""That enabled us to move quickly through our programme, and it's one of the main reasons why we are one of the most open economies in Europe currently."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Midnight rush for shops and pubs as Sydney reopens Australia's largest city, Sydney, has emerged from Covid lockdown after almost four months, with locals celebrating a range of new freedoms. People queued for pubs and shops that opened at midnight on Monday. Many others have been enjoying anticipated reunions with relatives and friends. Household visits and travel had been banned beyond a 5km (3.1 mile) zone. Sydney exited lockdown after New South Wales state reached a 70% double-dose vaccination target for over-16s. Most restrictions have now been eased for fully vaccinated people. People can now share meals together at reopened cafes and restaurants, and visit gyms, libraries and pools. There were long queues for barbers and nail salons on Monday. The Lord Gladstone Hotel, an inner city pub, was doing a roaring lunch trade after months of limited trading and takeaway-only options. ""We're stoked to be back, we're having the best Monday in months, even before Covid,"" Pat Blake, the pub's licensee, told the BBC. ""People are just ready to come back and sit down for a schooie [beer], see their friends, be somewhere there's always music playing,"" he said. ""The kitchen is pumping. I had forgotten about the pub smells. As soon as the fryers turned on it was really nostalgic."" Australia's most populous state has reached a 70% vaccination target for over-16s Queues formed for many reopened businesses on Monday More restrictions will ease when 80% of over-16s are fully vaccinated. Currently, over 90% have received a first dose. ""It's been a difficult 100 days,"" state Premier Dominic Perrottet said on Monday. ""But the efforts that people have made right across the state, to go out and get vaccinated, has enabled this great day."" Mr Perrottet warned that NSW was bracing for a surge in Covid cases, but said the healthcare system had been preparing for weeks. ""We'll see hospitalisations increaseâ¦ but we need to learn to live alongside the virus,"" he said. The state has not yet imposed a system to check vaccination status, leaving it up to individual businesses. Sydney's lockdown began in late June after a Delta variant outbreak took hold, leading to more than 50,000 infections and 439 deaths. How Delta burst Australia's Covid bubble Australia sends in army to enforce Sydney lockdown Covid crisis causes fury in Aboriginal communities It spread to Melbourne and Canberra, prompting them to go into lockdown, as well as to New Zealand. Canberra is due to exit lockdown on Friday, while Melbourne is predicted to reopen in late October. The NSW government is ramping up support for businesses to recover quickly Australia had previously adhered to a Covid elimination strategy, and this remains the objective in some states. But the rapid spread of the Delta variant forced a greater focus on vaccination effortsso Australia could switch to ""living with the virus"". Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have remained virus-free after shutting their borders to infected states. Authorities have flagged that Australians living abroad could travel back into Sydney next month, as the nation's borders reopen.

"Industries hit by soaring energy costs have made another appeal to the government for action. Talks with ministers will continue on Monday over a crisis that has sparked warnings about some factories. Sectors such as ceramics, paper and steel manufacturing have called for a price cap, though talks with government on Friday failed to reach a solution. The Treasury has denied being in detailed talks with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng about the crisis. Dave Dalton, chief executive of the British Glass trade body, called that ""very alarming"". He was part of Friday's talks with Mr Kwarteng, but told the BBC the meeting ""was very much an introductory one. We did not get to specifics"". Mr Dalton said he had hoped the government would have made progress over the weekend, but that appears not to have happened. ""We need immediate action,"" he said. He said some members of his group may have to shut production permanently, although no firm had been forced to do so yet. The nature of glass manufacturing means production cannot be just paused, he said. ""We have large furnaces that run 24/7. If you switched a furnace off, you basically destroy the infrastructure. ""It would have to be rebuilt at a cost of tens of millions of pounds,"" Mr Dalton said. Mr Dalton said firms had ""hedged"" by buying gas in advance at lower prices but in some cases those deals were now expiring leaving firms facing much higher costs. ""We have companies that can't cope in the immediate term. And we have other companies that have to feed back to their masters overseas who will make decisions on their investment in the UK. We need a much better way to planning our way through this problem,"" he said. Mr Kwarteng will not be involved directly at Monday's talks with industry representatives, according to BBC political correspondent Adam Fleming. Business minister Lee Rowley will lead the meeting with industry representatives later this afternoon, and is having another meeting with steel bosses on Tuesday. Why are gas prices so high? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Adrian Curry, managing director of UK-based Encirc, one of the largest container glass plants in Europe, said industry was not asking for a bailout, but the situation for some companies was critical. ""We pay more for our energy than competitors in other countries,"" he told the BBC. He said his company would normally spend Â£40m a year on energy, but was now looking at bills up to Â£100m. ""It's quite incredible,"" he said, adding that costs will have to be passed on to customers. And while there was not a threat to his company's survival, it was clear talking to others in industry that many companies are hurting. Some companies are considering stopping production to cut costs, and others ""are very close to the edge"". Domestic energy consumers have a certain amount of protection from rising prices due to a price cap, which sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. However, the cap was increased on 1 October, meaning about 15 million households face a 12% rise in energy bills. Industry has no such cap, meaning they are open to the risk of an unlimited rise in prices. Already manufacturers and services are warning they will have to pass on their rising costs to consumers. And as energy costs are a big driver of inflation, few consumers and households will escape the consequences of the current crisis. Trade group UK Steel told the BBC that Boris Johnson needed to take control before it was too late - although it described as ""really good news"" an announcement that the country's third largest steel maker, Liberty Steel, would restart operations at its plant in Rotherham later this month. The Unite union also called on the prime minister to ""get a grip"" to avert job losses if companies have to shut production because they cannot cope with the increased cost of energy. However, Conservative MP Mark Harper said the government should resist demands for financial support. There's no single reason, but a convergence of factors nationally and globally. There's been a worldwide squeeze on gas and energy supplies as countries emerged from lockdown and industry re-opened. A cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, stored gas levels are much lower than normal. On top of that, the UK has comparatively fewer gas storage facilities than some countries, meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. There's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas. And there is a suspicion that major gas supplier Russia is restricting output (an accusation it denies) which, following the law of supply and demand, has fuelled price rises. This has helped push up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they've risen 250%. And prices have soared 70% since August alone.

""For firms and families waiting to hear how the Business Secretary might help, there is a total absence of a plan and no extra help. ""The government is squabbling amongst itself, with the Treasury even denying they are talking to BEIS about providing help for large, energy intensive industries."" On Sunday, Mr Kwarteng told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the situation was ""critical"" and said he was ""looking to find a solution"". ""We already have existing support and we're looking to see whether that's sufficient to get us through this situation,"" he said. However, a Treasury source said the business secretary had been ""mistaken"" to say that he had been working on possible support measures with the Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Are you a business owner?

"Scottish firms raised prices last month at the sharpest rate since at least 1999 in the face of severe inflationary pressures, according to a survey. The latest Royal Bank of Scotland purchasing managers' index (PMI) suggested companies were having to pass on the rising costs of materials, pay, logistics, Covid and Brexit. Cost burdens were reported to be rising at their quickest rate since 2008. RBS said firms raised average charges ""to a degree unseen"" in two decades. The survey was compiled by IHS Markit from a panel of about 500 manufacturers and service providers. On a positive note, the survey found manufacturing and service sector output rose for a seventh straight month. However, September saw the slowest rate of increase for five months, as a sustained upturn in services was slightly offset by a renewed fall in manufacturing output. For the sixth time in as many months, inflows of new work rose, with respondents linking the latest uplift with strong client demand, in part due to the relaxation of lockdown restrictions. Although still sharp overall, expansion eased to its slowest rate since April, as sustained growth at services firms was partially offset by a fresh decline in manufacturing order book volumes. The pace of expansion in new business across Scotland was broadly in line with the UK average. Meanwhile, the survey highlighted a sustained rise in Scottish private sector employment. Panellists linked the latest upturn in staffing levels to higher workloads. Furthermore, the rate of job creation accelerated to a four-month high and was sharp overall. Scotland also registered the third-quickest increase in employment across the 12 monitored UK areas in September, behind only London and Wales. RBS Scotland board chairman Malcolm Buchanan said Scotland's private sector ""remained on a growth footing"" in September but some momentum had been lost due to fresh reductions in both output and order book volumes at goods producers. He added: ""Although the latest data does indicate a slight slowdown in growth, the third quarter as a whole nonetheless saw to one of the quickest expansions of the private sector on record and it remains in a strong position as we enter the closing months of the year."" Colin Borland, director of devolved nations for the Federation of Small Businesses, said currently two-thirds of firms were reporting an increase in running costs compared with this time last year. He added: ""In businesses who have very little, if any, headroom, something has to give. If every ounce of fat has already been trimmed, if every efficiency has been maxed out, then unfortunately you are going to have to look at price rises."" There's lots to welcome about the latest data on the Scottish economy. The PMI tells us that there's been a sustained recovery out of the winter lockdown. July to September was one of the strongest quarters for economic growth that we've ever seen. The economy was reopening, and people were out spending. Growth was inevitable, although its strength in early summer surprised some forecasters. It was also a certainty that the pace would slow down. It could not be sustained. But what was less easy to forecast were the combined disruptions that have made price inflation one of the main concerns: Brexit making it uneconomic for some to continue trading across the North Sea, supply shortages, shipping costs and delays, the haulage driver shortage, wage inflation and an energy price boom. These have not worked their way through the system. Price inflation is now being forecast to rise sharply next spring, when the cap on domestic heating costs is due to be raised next, probably by hundreds of pounds for the average gas-heated home. Gas prices have come down off an exceptional peak, but remain well ahead of the start of this year. Oil prices are continuing to rise. With labour shortages, it seems likely that wage inflation has barely begun. The questions now are how long this is sustained, and will action be required by central banks to rein in price inflation?

"The survey found the latest rise in new business was led by the services sector Looser Covid restrictions helped boost Scottish private sector output to near record levels last month, according to a report. A regular RBS survey of purchasing managers found a steep rise in new business, with firms hiring more staff for the third month in a row. ""Improved client confidence"" was among other reasons cited for the upturn. The rate of output growth was slower than May's, but was still the second quickest since September 2013. The survey follows a separateRBS report on jobs, which found hiring activity at Scottish businesses continued to surge last month, amid easing Covid-19 restrictions and rising economic activity. RBS report: Starting pay up sharply as staff supply falls Phasing out of furlough scheme 'threatens jobs' The bank's latest PMI index - which measures combined manufacturing and service sector output - posted 58.4 in June, falling from May's survey record of 61.5. Any figure above 50 suggests economic expansion. The survey indicated that the latest increase in new business was broad-based and led by services, with goods producers seeing growth slow on the month. Meanwhile, input prices faced by private sector firms continued to soar during June, with the rate of inflation the fastest since February 2011. Panellists attributed greater costs to material shortages, price hikes at suppliers, Brexit and higher fuel and utilities prices. In response, Scottish private sector firms increased their average charges for the eighth month running. According to the survey, companies remained optimistic about activity over the coming year. That confidence was linked to looser lockdown restrictions and the subsequent reopening of some sectors, as well as ""surging inflows"" of new work and hopes of a strong economic recovery. RBS Scotland board chairman Malcolm Buchanan said the June data showed ""some signs of optimism"" for the Scottish firms. ""The rates of increase in both business activity and new work slowed only slightly from May's respective series records and remained marked,"" he said. ""Inflationary pressures are a key concern, however, as material shortages and greater fuel and utilities fees continued to put severe upward pressure on input costs and, subsequently, selling prices."" In a separate development, Scotland's public spending watchdog has warned of ""acute and unpredictable"" financial pressures that will require co-operation between Scottish and UK governments. Scotland's auditor general Stephen Boyle said in a blog on Friday that the response to Covid had made finances more complex than ever, and managing volatility would be difficult. He warned that the Â£4.6bn committed to Covid spending for this year was not guaranteed by the UK government and could be increased or reduced. Mr Boyle said there was a need for effective communication and co-operation between Downing Street and Holyrood. He added that acute and unpredictable financial pressures did not only come from the public health crisis, but from backlogs in the NHS and courts. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Starting salaries continued to rise sharply at Scottish firms last month as the supply of job candidates in some sectors fell away, a survey has found. The latest RBS Report on Jobs said recruiters noted candidate shortages for both permanent and temporary posts. The lack of supply was attributed by some respondents to ""a reluctance among candidates to switch roles due to Covid-19 related uncertainty"". Brexit and off-payroll working tax rules were also cited for the shortage. Phasing out of furlough scheme 'threatens jobs' Scotland's output falls by nearly 2% in first quarter For permanent positions, the rate of decline in supply was the fastest since March 2019, while firms signalled the steepest downturn in temp staff supply in the survey's history. The shortage came as hiring activity at Scottish businesses surged again last month, in line with easing Covid-19 restrictions and rising economic activity. An upturn in permanent placements was slower than in May but was still rapid overall, while temp billings growth also remained historically elevated. Panellists in the survey suggested the shortage of candidates for permanent roles had ""placed upwards pressure"" on pay, with the rate of increase among the steepest on record. Recruiters across Scotland also recorded a further increase in average hourly wages for short-term staff during June. Temp wages have now risen in all but one of the past nine months. Demand for permanent staff across Scotland rose sharply again during June, with the fastest rise since data collection began in January 2003. Across the monitored sectors, IT and computing registered the quickest increase in vacancies, followed by engineering and construction. Recruiters across Scotland also registered a further rise in the number of temporary vacancies during June. Blue collar posts saw the strongest rise in the number of temp vacancies, followed by IT and computing. RBS chief economist Sebastian Burnside said the June data pointed to a ""sustained rebound"" of the Scottish jobs market. Earlier this week, a Scottish Chambers of Commerce survey suggested Scottish businesses were seeing ""shoots of recovery"" for the first time in over a year as Covid-19 restrictions began to lift. Its latest quarterly economic indicator indicated more positive growth across all sectors, with firms reporting substantial rises in confidence and domestic sales. However, while companies were optimistic about sales revenue in the third quarter of this year, they are more cautious around investment and staff levels. They also expressed greater concern over inflation, as more consumers spend savings accumulated over the last 16 months. SCC president Tim Allan said: ""The success of the vaccine rollout has enabled the easing of restrictions and the gradual reopening of the economy, unleashing pent-up demand in the economy. ""This has allowed some sectors to rebound more quickly than others. ""However, the route to economic recovery will be a marathon, not a sprint."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Covid passes will be required in nightclubs in Wales, under the plans Mandatory Covid passes in nightclubs and large events will be introduced in Wales as planned on 11 October after Welsh ministers won a knife-edge Senedd vote. The measures were agreed with 28 politicians voting for and 27 voting against. It came despite politicians in the opposition uniting against the plans. The public will be expected to show evidence of being fully vaccinated or having a recent negative Covid test. Conservative Vale of Clwyd Member of the Senedd (MS) Gareth Davies did not take part in the vote, with the Tories citing ""technical difficulties"" for what happened. Nightclub industry representatives said it was a ""shambles"". If all opposition MSs had taken part the government would have lost in a tie, with the Tories, Lib Dems and Plaid opposed to the scheme. Health Minister Eluned Morgan told MSs not supporting the law ""will be an act of gross irresponsibility"", but Plaid Cymru had said it was open to exploitation. Protesters had gathered outside the Senedd's buildings on Tuesday evening, chanting ""shame on you"", following the result. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Covid pass breaches 'should not be police priority' Wales to introduce Covid passes from next month Ahead of the vote, Conservative MS Darren Millar could be heard telling Presiding Officer Elin Jones: ""I'm sorry we still have a member who is desperately trying to get into Zoom."" Ms Jones replied that she would still hold the vote: ""We have made every opportunity possible for that named member to get in, including sharing my personal phone."" Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies, who is ill, was also not present but Labour had agreed for one of their MSs not to vote in return. The Senedd is sitting in a hybrid format - with some MSs attending in person in the 60-person chamber and some joining via Zoom. The Welsh Conservatives said: ""A number of members across political groups experienced technical difficulties with the voting system this evening, which demonstrates why the hybrid Parliament in Wales must come to an end. ""We reaffirm our view that such significant votes should be held in person on the floor of the Senedd and Welsh Conservatives remain steadfastly opposed to the introduction of Covid passports."" However Plaid Cymru's Rhun ap Iorwerth in a tweet defended the hybrid system: ""Unless there's very good reason and/or with advance approval... I think you should be able to vote only from your offices at home/Senedd/constituency."" ""Not e.g. party conference,"" he added. Night Time Industries Association Wales, which represents 100 venues in Wales and is opposed to the plans, called for an ""urgent revote"". It said it was a ""democratic outrage that one MS who wanted to vote, and who would've voted against the proposals, could not, due to a mere technical error. This shambles will cause even more uncertainty for our businesses."" Presiding Officer, Elin Jones, later said in a statement: ""I gave every opportunity for the member to be present - including providing ICT support - but the member was unable to be contacted. ""For members to vote in the Senedd, they must be present, either in the chamber or on Zoom. ""It is a member's responsibility to give themselves sufficient time to secure their Zoom connection in time for voting, just as it is for any member travelling to the Senedd to vote."" People opposed to vaccine passports took part in a protest on the Senedd steps on Tuesday Hundreds gathered on the Senedd steps on Tuesday to protest against the measures. Following the decision protests moved to the front of Senedd office building TÅ· Hywel, and near the complex's car park exit, with security personnel and two armed police officers deployed on the other side of the barrier. Tory MS Sam Kurtz said he was ""stuck in my TÅ· Hywel office as protestors shout 'shame on you' and block us from leaving. To be fair, I'm as frustrated as them"". Plaid revealed in a Senedd debate on Tuesday afternoon that it would vote against the government. Rhun ap Iorwerth said the regulations proposed by the Welsh government had raised ""more questions than they provide answers"". ""There is insufficient evidence and little detail on how it will work in practice. In particular, the rapid test loophole, which represents a fudge on the part of the government, makes the system open to exploitation. ""We've asked many questions and haven't been given the assurances we've sought. And it's for that reason that we feel unable to support these regulations today."" Plaid called for ministers to withdraw the vote and said it would ""contribute to discussions on how something more robust could be brought forward, better evidenced, and with clarity on implication"". Welsh Lib Dem Jane Dodds said: ""Today's vote sets a dangerous precedent for bad law-making here in Wales and an unnecessary government overreach into our civil liberties without any evidence they will make us all safer."" During the debate on Tuesday Eluned Morgan said the Welsh government had not taken the decision to introduce such measures ""lightly"". ""We are taking these measures to support venues to stay open and enable events to continue taking place through a potentially very difficult and challenging autumn and winter,"" she said. The Welsh government is using a web-based system, rather than an app. Ms Morgan said she was currently aware that the Covid pass shows it is valid in England. ""This is unfortunate and reflects the fact that we share the infrastructure with the UK government."" She said the wording will change before it becomes mandatory, and promised an app which will include a pass would be available ""early in 2022"". Proof of vaccination has already been required for some large events Welsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said the implementation of Covid passes had been a ""complete disaster"" in Scotland. He said the use of them at the Labour Party conference in Brighton had also been ""plagued with problems"". He warned bringing in Covid passes in Wales risked turning the nation into a ""two-tiered society"" and ""undermines freedom of choice"". Mr George told the Senedd the Welsh government's own technical advisory cell had warned such a policy could ""backfire"". But the Welsh government hopes the passes will help prevent super-spreader events. Deputy chief medical officer Chris Jones said officials are ""keen to try to minimise the risk of these events while enabling them to continue so life can return to normal with some degree of protection"". Anyone who is over 16 and has been fully vaccinated in Wales or England, or has had a negative lateral flow test result within the past 48 hours, can get a pass.

To prevent this, the Welsh governmentplans to make it illegal to fake a negative test. Large events could also be allowed to check passes at random, rather than check every person who attends.

"This video can not be played Prince Charles: My Aston Martin runs on wine and cheese The Prince of Wales has told the BBC he understands why campaigners from organisations like Extinction Rebellion take to the streets to demand action on climate change. Inthe interview at his home in Balmoral,Prince Charles said action such as blocking roads ""isn't helpful"". But he said he totally understood the ""frustration"" climate campaigners felt. And he warned of a ""catastrophic"" impact if more ambitious action isn't taken on climate change. Speaking in the gardens of his houseâ¯on the Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire, the prince said it had taken too long for the world to wake up to the risks of climate change.â¯ And he worried that world leaders would ""just talk"" when they meet in Glasgow in November for a crucial UN climate conference.â¯ ""The problem is to get action on the ground,"" he said. Watch full interview on BBC iPlayer: Prince Charles and his battle for our planet What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? Asked if he sympathised with Greta Thunberg, the climate campaigner who has also criticised leaders for failing to act, he said:â¯""Of course I do, yes. ""All these young people feel nothing is ever happening so of course they're going to get frustrated.â¯ I totally understand because nobody would listen and they see their future being totally destroyed."" The prince also said he understood why groups such as Extinction Rebellion were taking their protests to the streets. ""But it isn't helpful, I don't think, to do it in a way that alienates people.â¯ ""So I totally understand the frustration, the difficulty is how do you direct that frustration in a way that is more constructive rather than destructive."" When asked if the UK government wasâ¯doing enough to combat climate change, the prince replied:â¯â¯""I couldn't possibly comment."" The interview took place inâ¯Prince George's Wood, an arboretum the Prince of Walesâ¯hasâ¯createdâ¯in the gardens ofâ¯Birkhall on the Balmoral estate. He planted the first treeâ¯when Prince George,â¯his oldestâ¯grandchild, was born andâ¯he said the project had become ""an old man's obsession"".â¯ Prince George's Wood is designed to showcase autumn colours Prince Charlesâ¯was frank about the shortcomings of businesses to take action on climate.â¯â¯â¯ Heâ¯has long argued engaging business leaders in tackling climate change would be crucial in limiting global temperature rises.â¯â¯ This has been a key strand of his campaigning over the years, most recently through his Sustainable Markets Initiative.â¯â¯â¯ The prince said that, while governments can bring billions of dollars to the effort, the private sector has the potential to mobilise trillions of dollars.â¯â¯ But he told the BBC he feared many business executives still didn't give environmental issues the priority they deserved.â¯â¯â¯ Many of the young people they employ really mind about environment issues but, he said, ""they haven't quite got to the top to make a fundamental difference"". Heâ¯said the Glasgow climate conference was ""a last chance saloon"" and said it would be ""a disaster"" if the world did not come together to tackle climate change.â¯ ""I mean it'll be catastrophic. It is already beginning to be catastrophic because nothing in nature can survive the stress that is created by these extremes of weather,"" he said.â¯ Challenged about his own efforts to reduce his carbon footprint, Prince Charles said he had switched the heating of Birkhall to biomass boilers, using woodâ¯chipsâ¯from trees felled in theâ¯estate'sâ¯forest.â¯â¯â¯ He has installed solar panels at Clarence House, his London residence, and on the farm buildings of his Gloucestershire home, Highgrove.â¯â¯â¯ He said he hadâ¯installed heat pumps at some of his propertiesâ¯andâ¯a hydroelectric turbine in the river that runs besideâ¯Birkhall.â¯ He was also challenged on his long-standing love of cars, and asked if he was ""a bit of a Jeremy Clarkson, a bit of a petrol-head?"" ""Well, yes"", the prince acknowledged: ""But that was before we knew what the problems were.""â¯â¯ He said he hadâ¯converted his favourite vehicle, an Aston Martin he has owned for 51 years, to run on what he described as ""surplus English white wine and whey from the cheese process"". His Aston Martin has been modified to run on a fuel called E85 - made up of 85% bioethanol and 15% unleaded petrol. Bioethanol can be derived from different sources - including in the case of the prince's car - surplus wine and alcohol extracted from fermented whey. The blue DB6 Mk2 Volante was given to the Prince of Wales for his 21st birthday He said most of the vehicles used on his estates were now electric but ""it can't all be done with electric vehicles"", and that hydrogen technology would needâ¯to be part of the mix as transportation was decarbonised.â¯â¯â¯ Top of the list of the concerns he had about electric vehicles was price, ""they are not cheap"", he said.â¯ He was also worried about how the materials for batteries would be sourced and how they would be recycled.â¯â¯â¯ ""At the moment there is a huge amount of waste which is really worrying,"" he said.â¯ The prince acknowledged how difficult it was for most people to reduce their carbon footprint.â¯ He said he had changed his diet to reduce his impact on the environment and urgedâ¯others to do the same.â¯â¯â¯ He now doesn't eat meat and fishâ¯onâ¯two days each week and doesn't eat any dairy products on another day.â¯â¯â¯ ""If more people did that it would reduce a lot of the pressure on the environment,"" heâ¯said.â¯â¯â¯ Trees were a great way to capture carbon and improve the urban environment, he said, suggesting avenues of trees might be planted to commemorate those who hadâ¯died in the coronavirus pandemic.â¯â¯ The prince recognised that low carbon travel remains a big challenge.â¯ He said he hoped flying would become easier and more sustainable when newâ¯bio-fuels,â¯using carbon captured from the air with sustainably sourced hydrogen, become available.â¯ But he believedâ¯systemic changeâ¯was necessary to bring about the transformation of transportation and other industries that wouldâ¯be required to drive down emissions.â¯ ""No one person can solve the problem,"" heâ¯said. ""It's a pinprick.""â¯ This video can not be played Greta Thunberg mocked the ''empty words and promises'' of world leaders as ""blah, blah, blah"" â¯The prince said the keyâ¯would be making theâ¯environmentally friendly options cheaper for everyone.â¯â¯ ""We still have fossil fuel subsidies, why?"" he asked.â¯â¯â¯ He described as ""crazy"" the fact there were still subsidies for what he called ""insaneâ¯agro-industrial approaches to farming which are a disaster in many ways, cause huge damage and contribute enormously to emissions"". He said there were similar ""perverse"" subsidies for the fishing industry which he said causedâ¯""mammoth damage"" through trawling.â¯ The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"Liberty Steel has secured a Â£50m cash injection which it says will safeguard 660 jobs at its plant in Rotherham. The deal is part of a wider restructure of GFG Alliance, Liberty's owner, which was forced to seek funding when its key lender, Greensill Capital, collapsed. GFG Alliance said the cash would allow the Rotherham plant to reopen this month after being closed since spring. Community, the steelworkers' union, said it was ""overdue"" but was ""an important step in the right direction"". Jeffrey Kabel, GFG's chief transformation officer, said: ""The injection of Â£50m of shareholder funds into Liberty Steel UK is an important step in our restructuring and transformation. ""It will help to create sustainable value, ensure that Liberty has the ability to raise and deploy capital quickly in the UK and enable our businesses to demonstrate their potential and agree long-term debt restructuring."" At the beginning of the year, Liberty Steel employed 3,000 steelworkers in the UK. But its future was thrown into doubt when Greensill collapsed in early March. GFG has been struggling to raise new financing since then, while the majority of its workers have been on furlough. In April, GFG approached the government for help, but the request was rejected by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. GFG, one of the UK's largest industrial groups, is owned by businessman Sanjeev Gupta. Kwarteng defends rejecting Liberty Steel bailout How metal tycoon Sanjeev Gupta built his empire A further 2,000 people work at other GFG steel sites in the UK. GFG said the cash injection would allow Liberty Steel (LSUK) to restart its electric arc furnace at Rotherham. ""Production ramp-up will commence in October 2021 with a plan to reach 50,000 tonnes per month as soon as possible,"" it added. ""The restart of operations will enable colleagues to return to work, setting the platform for LSUK's longer-term refinancing and delivery of its plan to expand Rotherham's capacity, creating a two million tonnes per annum green steel plant."" News of the move was welcomed by industry body UK Steel. A spokesperson said it was ""really good news for not only the company, but those many thousands of workers and their families, the communities where those jobs a located and of course the whole of the UK steel sector"". ""Our friends at Liberty Steel can now fire up those furnaces, make the steel that this economy needs and most importantly give some certainty to the well-paid and highly-skilled workforce."" But the spokesperson added: ""The last thing the sector needs now is for government to merely sit on its hands and risk an energy crisis becoming a steel industry crisis."" UK Steel called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to intervene on the industry's behalf ""before it is too late"". Roy Rickhuss, general secretary of Community, said the deal ""demonstrates that GFG can raise funds for the UK"". ""Huge challenges remain,"" Mr Rickhuss said. ""But the workforce is ready to get back to making the best steels money can buy and the Â£50m injection will enable us to restart steelmaking."" Meanwhile, plans are proceeding to sell off GFG's Speciality Steel business, which employs about 750 staff at plants in South Yorkshire. GFG said the cash lifeline would help Speciality Steel to ""establish a stable operating environment and create an attractive asset"". Further afield, GFG said it had also agreed a debt restructuring for Liberty's Australian division with Credit Suisse Asset Management. Greensill's heavy exposure to Mr Gupta's business had prompted Credit Suisse to freeze withdrawals from up to Â£10bn worth of funds held as security.

"Virginia Giuffre, then Victoria Roberts, was pictured with Prince Andrew in London in 2001 The Metropolitan Police will not take any further action against the Duke of York following a review prompted by Jeffrey Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre. Ms Giuffre is suing Prince Andrew in the US for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. Prince Andrew has consistently denied Ms Giuffre's allegations. A source close to the duke told PA Media it had ""come as no surprise"" the Met had decided to drop its probe. They added: ""Despite pressure from the media and claims of new evidence, the Met have concluded that the claims are not sufficient to warrant any further investigation. ""The duke has always vigorously maintained his innocence and continues to do so."" In August, the Metsaid it would review its decisionnot to investigate allegations connected to Epstein. Ms Giuffre, 38, claims she was sexually assaulted by the prince at three locations - London, New York and on Epstein's private island in the Caribbean. Her case claims Prince Andrew engaged in sexual acts without Ms Giuffre's consent, including when she was 17. The Met also confirmed it had completed its review into allegations reported in June by broadcaster Channel 4 News that British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former girlfriend, trafficked, groomed and abused women and girls in the UK. The force said it had ""reviewed information passed to us by a media organisation in June"" and decided that ""no further action will be taken"". In August 2019, US financier Epstein was found dead in his cell in New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center. Prince Andrew - seen walking with Jeffrey Epstein in Central Park in New York in 2010 - has faced scrutiny over his ties to the convicted sex offender The Met previously ruled out opening an investigation into Epstein, but in August Metropolitan Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said the force would review the decision. On Sunday, the Met said: ""As a matter of procedure, MPS officers reviewed a document released in August 2021 as part of a US civil action.
