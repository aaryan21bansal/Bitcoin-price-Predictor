"Joseph McCann, 33, is said to have links to Watford, Aylesbury and Ipswich A man wanted over the abduction and rape of two women in London has been linked to a third attack. Joseph McCann is wanted bydetectives investigating the abductionof two women in Chingford and Edgware on 25 April. Hertfordshire Constabulary said he was also linked to the rape of a 21-year-old in Watford on 21 April. Officers believe McCann, who is also wanted on recall to prison, could be using disguises. A Â£20,000 reward has been offered by the Metropolitan Police for information about his whereabouts that leads to his arrest and prosecution. The BBC has been told he was originally jailed in 2008 for aggravated burglary after admitting breaking into the home of an 85-year-old man on 27 December 2007. He was released on licence by the Parole Board in 2017 but had been recalled for breaching his licence. Joseph McCann is known to use false names, most recently Joel, the Met said During the attack in Watford, the victim was approached by a man holding a knife in Hagden Lane at about 03:30 BST. She was forced into a blue Ford Mondeo and driven around the town for six hours before being raped. The Hertfordshire force said the suspect had been identified after the attack was reported to them on 22 April. ""A significant amount of work was done to try and locate and arrest him, which proved unsuccessful,"" it said. Police previously released a CCTV image of the attacker The next victim was abducted the following Friday in Chingford, north London, at about 00:30, with the third targeted at 12:15 in Edgware. Both women, aged in their 20s, were raped before being driven to a hotel in Watford, where the suspect attempted to book a room but left when one was unavailable. They both then escaped following a struggle in Osborne Road at about 14:30. The Met said 33-year-old McCann, who has connections in Watford, Aylesbury and Ipswich, is known to use false names. Det Ch Insp Katherine Goodwin said: ""We would ask anyone with any information about McCann's whereabouts to contact us immediately. ""McCann is considered extremely dangerous and a risk to the public and we ask people not to approach him, but instead call 999."" McCann is described as white, with a muscular build, a bald head or shaved blond hair and a light-coloured short beard. He is said to have a distinctive tattoo of the name ""Bobbie"" on his stomach. A man, aged 33, has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to rape and released as inquiries continue.

"This video can not be played Passengers used emergency exit slides to escape Forty-one people died after a Russian plane made an emergency landing and burst into flames just after takeoff from Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. Dramatic video shows passengers using emergency exit slides to escape the burning Aeroflot aircraft. Survivors suggest the plane was struck by lightning, but Russia's national carrier said only that it returned to the airport for technical reasons. Two children are among the dead. The jet had 73 passengers and five crew. Initial reports suggested the plane had landed on fire, but sources quoted by Russian news agency Interfax said the jet caught fire after a very bumpy landing. The aircraft landed with full fuel tanks because the crew lost contact with air traffic controllers and decided it was too dangerous to dump fuel over Moscow, Interfax added. ""There are 37 survivors - 33 passengers and four members of the crew,"" said Yelena Markovskaya, an official involved in the investigation of the crash. A flight attendant was also reportedly killed in the incident. Five people are in hospital. One witness said it was a ""miracle"" anyone escaped. Black smoke billows from the burning plane on the tarmac at Sheremetyevo airport The plane had just taken off from Sheremetyevo airport when it caught fire Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has ordered a special committee to investigate the disaster.

"Donald Trump has said he will raise tariffs on $200bn (Â£152bn) of Chinese goods, because talks on a US-China trade deal are moving ""too slowly"". The US president tweeted that tariffs of 10% on certain goods would rise to 25% on Friday, and $325bn of untaxed goods could face 25% duties ""shortly"". ""The Trade Deal with China continues, but too slowly, as they attempt to renegotiate. No!"" he tweeted. The countries have seemed near to striking a trade deal in recent weeks.

Mr Trump delayed further tariff increases earlier in the year, citing progress in talks. The move increases pressure on China as Vice-Premier Liu He prepares to travel Washington this week to resume negotiations. That follows talks in April in Beijing that US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called ""productive"". US-China trade war in 300 words US and China agree to suspend new tariffs White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox News that the president's tweet was a warning. ""The president is, I think, issuing a warning here, that, you know, we bent over backwards earlier, we suspended the 25% tariff to 10 and then we've left it there. ""That may not be forever if the talks don't work out,"" he said. But Michael Pillsbury, an informal trade adviser to Trump, said he took the president's tweet ""at face value"". So far, the US has imposed tariffs on $250bn of Chinese goods, having accused the country of unfair trade practices. Beijing hit back with duties on $110bn of US goods, blaming the US for starting ""the largest trade war in economic history"". The US is the biggest export market for Chinese goods According to reports, in recent days US officials have become frustrated by China seeking to row back on earlier commitments made over a deal. It is understood that key sticking points include how to police any deal, and whether existing tariffs will be removed or stay in place. Tom Orlik, chief economist at Bloomberg Economics, said: ""It's possible talks are breaking down, with China offering insufficient concessions, and an increase in tariffs a genuine prospect. ""More likely, in our view, is that this renewed threat is an attempt to extract a few more minor concessions in the final days of talks."" Mr Trump's latest move will raise duties on more than 5,000 products made by Chinese producers, ranging from chemicals to textiles and consumer goods. The US president originally imposed a 10% tariff on these goods in September that was due to rise in January, but postponed this as negotiations advanced. ""The Tariffs paid to the USA have had little impact on product cost, mostly borne by China,"" he tweeted on Sunday. However, both US and international firms have said they are being harmed by the trade war. Fears about a further escalation caused a slump in world stock markets towards the end of last year. The IMF has warned a full-blown trade war wouldweaken the global economy.

"New voters have been credited for the Alliance Party's breakthrough in the Northern Ireland council elections. Deputy leader Stephen Farry said he believed ""the real growth across the centre ground"" was largely due to the emergence of a new vote. With all seats declared, Alliance saw a 65% rise in representation. Its number of seats rose from 32 to 53. Speaking to BBC NI's Sunday Politics programme, Mr Farry said the party would not ""sit back on our laurels"". ""Simply being at 11% and still the fifth party in size is not good enough. We have to really transform the landscape of Northern Ireland politics,"" he said. Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry Other smaller parties and independents also made significant gains in the council election. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in are still the two biggest parties but the DUP lost eight seats. Sinn FÃ©in kept all its seats but its first preferences fell slightly. In pictures: Northern Ireland election highlights Northern Ireland results so far Revolving council doors usher in new faces Alliance surge a striking development What do councils in NI do? The Ulster Unionists lost 13 councillors, the SDLP seven and the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) fell from 13 seats in the 2014 council elections to just six seats. The Green Party is still among the smaller parties, but it was a big winner this time round, doubling its representation from four seats to eight. People Before Profit also had a good election, rising from a single councillor in 2014, to five seats with gains in Belfast, and Derry City and Strabane. In terms of first preference votes, the DUP saw a marginal increase to 24.1%, but Sinn FÃ©in's share was 23.2%, a slight drop on its 2014 results. Alliance saw its share of the vote increase from 6.7% to 11.5%. A sister party of the Liberal Democrats in Great Britain, Alliance is Northern Ireland's main centrist cross-community party, seeking to attract support from both Protestants and Catholics. It won 10 seats in Belfast, an increase of two, where it will continue to hold the balance of power between unionists and nationalists. It also doubled its representation in Mid and East Antrim from three councillors to six, and for the first time in decades, it has representation in the north west with two seats on Derry City and Strabane District Council. ""Crucially, we've broken outside the Greater Belfast area for the first time in, I would say, 30 years,"" Alliance leader Naomi Long told the BBC. She said it had been a breakthrough election for her party and other cross-community candidates, with many voters choosing to reject the ""tribal politics"" of unionism and nationalism. This video can not be played Alliance leader Naomi Long explains why she thinks voters rewarded the party at the polls Sinn FÃ©in's results have been mixed. It won six out of seven seats in Blackmountain District Electoral Area (DEA), and for the first time, it has representation on Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council with two seats. However, the party lost five sitting councillors from Derry City and Strabane Council. The DUP also carved out some new territory, gaining two new seats in Belfast, andelecting its first ever openly gay candidate, Alison Bennington,in Antrim and Newtownabbey. But the party lost its leader on Belfast City Council, Lee Reynolds, after a low turnout in its east Belfast heartland. The Green Party had some notable successes with four seats in Belfast, where Ãine Groogan topped the poll in the Botanic DEA. Allow Twitter content?

Independents have also taken support from larger parties. In Newry, Mourne and Down, independent candidate Gavin Malone, a former council worker, topped the poll in the Newry District Electoral Area (DEA). The first-time candidate, who quit his 20-year career to run for election, got 2,296 first preferences, beating his nearest Sinn FÃ©in rival by more than 900 votes.

In the same DEA, former SDLP turned independent Dr Josephine Deehan polled 728 first preference votes, more than both of her SDLP rivals put together. The GP was elected in the eighth round.

In Belfast's Castle area, Alliance's Nuala McAlister topped the poll. Sinn FÃ©in's John Finucane was elected on the first count. He is the son of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane who was shot dead in front of his wife and three children in 1989. This video can not be played John Finucane says he wants to ""change Belfast for the positive"" The DUP made some gains in Belfast with Nicola Verner taking a seat in Court, from former TUV candidate Jolene Bunting. Ms Bunting, who had been involved in a number of controversies during her five-year tenure, ran as an independent this time but only polled 351 first preferences. In Derry and Strabane District Council, independent Gary Donnelly topped the poll in the Moor electoral area - where journalistLyra McKee was killed last month by dissident republicans. He had refused to condemn violent dissident republicanism but in the wake of her murder he called on the New IRA to desist from further attacks. Analysis: BBC NI political editor Mark Devenport: It has been a similar theme to day one, which is that of Alliance victories, they have the most to be pleased about as the result of this election. Clearly different voters vote for them for different reasons, but it may well reflect a disenchantment with the political paralysis up at Stormont. The DUP will be pleased that they have held their own and actually increased their vote slightly at the expense of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), which had a good election five years ago but has not been able to replicate that performance. I think Sinn FÃ©in will be disappointed, they missed a number of their targets and their vote has slid slightly. One interesting development tonight is that it looks like Fermanagh and Omagh District Council might slip into no overall control, rather than being a nationalist majority council. That is because there has been a wave of independents who won through there. Those independents may actually be nationalist in their outlooks but it is a sign of changing times both there and in Belfast where some of the smaller parties have also come through. Meanwhile, an independent candidate - who only stood for election after a Facebook post suggestion posted on 1 April garnered online support - has been elected to Antrim and Newtownabbey District council. Michael Stewart, who runs the Love Ballyclare Facebook page, said: ""I wasn't aware there would be this massive surge to independents, the Greens and Alliance. I didn't know I was part of anything."" He added: ""I am one of those people who voted for me, who've no interest in politics - they care about holes in their roads, no paper in their schools and that they can't get an appointment with their health centre."" It has been a long election for candidates, counters and commentators. In Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon District Council, Brian Pope of Alliance was elected following a marathon count that went on until 06:00 on Saturday morning.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details. This video can not be played 'We don't exclude members of the gay community' Unsurprisingly, the story that made headlines on Friday was the success of Alison Bennington, the DUP's first openly gay representative. Belfast East MP Gavin Robinson said it was a ""good news story"", despite assembly member Jim Wells claiming members were ""shocked by the decision"" to let her run. DUP leader Arlene Foster said she was delighted by Ms Bennington's electoral performance.

"This video can not be played Passengers used emergency exit slides to escape Forty-one people died after a Russian plane made an emergency landing and burst into flames just after takeoff from Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport. Dramatic video shows passengers using emergency exit slides to escape the burning Aeroflot aircraft. Survivors suggest the plane was struck by lightning, but Russia's national carrier said only that it returned to the airport for technical reasons. Two children are among the dead. The jet had 73 passengers and five crew. Initial reports suggested the plane had landed on fire, but sources quoted by Russian news agency Interfax said the jet caught fire after a very bumpy landing. The aircraft landed with full fuel tanks because the crew lost contact with air traffic controllers and decided it was too dangerous to dump fuel over Moscow, Interfax added. ""There are 37 survivors - 33 passengers and four members of the crew,"" said Yelena Markovskaya, an official involved in the investigation of the crash. A flight attendant was also reportedly killed in the incident. Five people are in hospital. One witness said it was a ""miracle"" anyone escaped. Black smoke billows from the burning plane on the tarmac at Sheremetyevo airport The plane had just taken off from Sheremetyevo airport when it caught fire Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has ordered a special committee to investigate the disaster.

The rear of the Aeroflot plane was completely burnt out One passenger who survived the crash, Petr Egorov, was quoted by the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily newspaper as saying that the flight ""had just taken off and the aircraft was hit by lightning"", adding: ""The landing was rough - I almost passed out from fear.""

"Universities using ""gagging orders"" to stop staff going public with claims of bullying or sexual misconduct is an ""outrage"", according to a minister. Chris Skidmore said using non-disclosure agreements in this way risks the reputation of UK higher education. It comes afterBBC figures showeduniversities spent about Â£87m on pay-offs with NDAs since 2017. NDAs are contracts between employers and companies which can stop staff or ex-staff making information public. In a speech at the London School of Economics this week, universities minister Mr Skidmore is expected to say universities are considered the ""bastions of free speech"" - but that there are reports that some of them have suppressed allegations of harassment, discrimination and sexual assault. UK universities in 'gagging order' row What are non-disclosure agreements? Are NDAs being abused? Known as ""confidentiality clauses"" in the legal profession, NDAs can be signed when staff are hired to protect trade secrets like inventions or ideas. But they can also be signed when employees and organisations resolve a dispute, and have been used to stop workers discussing allegations of misbehaviour in the workplace. Last month, dozens of academics told BBC News they were ""harassed"" out of their jobs and made to sign NDAs after making complaints. Mr Skidmore will say collective action is needed to stop the misuse of NDAs ""Non-disclosure agreements exist for many purposes - such as protecting valuable research findings should a staff member change jobs,"" Mr Skidmore will say on Tuesday. ""But in no circumstances should they be used by universities to 'gag' staff after experiencing poor behaviour in the workplace, including bullying, discrimination or sexual misconduct. ""Let me be clear that any use of this sort of agreement to silence people or hide details of unfair practices is an outrage and risks bringing the reputation of our world-leading higher education system into disrepute.

"Theresa May must resign or the Conservatives should force her out, after the party's heavy local election losses, Iain Duncan Smith has said. The former Tory leader called Mrs May a ""caretaker PM"" and described her attempts to reach a Brexit deal with Labour as ""absurd"". The party suffered its worst local election result in England since 1995. Other senior Conservatives have urged Tory MPs to compromise with Labour to ensure Brexit is delivered. Elections were held on Thursday for 248 English councils, six mayors, and all 11councils in Northern Ireland. No elections took place in Scotland or Wales. The Conservatives lost 1,334 councillors, while Labour failed to make expected gains, instead losing 82 seats. The Liberal Democrats benefited from Tory losses, gaining 703 seats, with the Greens and independents also making gains. Following the results, Mrs May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn both insisted they would push ahead with talks seeking cross-party agreement on leaving the EU. Mrs May said it was clear the public wanted ""to see the issue of Brexit resolved"". Smaller parties make gains in NI elections Tories lose more than 1,300 councillors Local elections: The main parties punished Election results in maps But Mr Duncan Smith, a leading Brexiteer, said many Conservatives would refuse to back any deal reached between the two parties. Mrs May must announce her departure ""very soon"", he said, and if she did not go, the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs would have to force her to do so. Speaking to the BBC, he said: ""As a result of the devastating election result, the PM has in effect become a caretaker. ""As such, she is not empowered to make any deal with the Labour Party which itself suffered a very similar result. Two discredited administrations making a discredited deal is not the answer to the electorate."" In December, Mrs May survived a vote of no-confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party, but in March she pledged to stand down if and when Parliament ratified her Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU.

The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but the deadline was pushed back to 31 October after Parliament was unable to agree a way forward. Ruth Davidson warned the parties would suffer the wrath of voters in the EU elections over Brexit In the wake of the Conservatives' local election losses, senior Tories have called for the party to compromise in order to reach an agreement with Labour to end the Brexit deadlock. Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson called for the negotiating teams of both parties - who are currently locked in talks - to ""get Brexit sorted, get a deal over the line and let Britain move on"". This video can not be played Theresa May on local election results: ""Simple message... just get on and deliver Brexit"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Conservative Party needed to listen to the election results and be ""in the mood for compromise"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the Conservatives might have to move towardsLabour's proposal of a permanent customs union- a move many Brexiteers in the party oppose - in order to solve the impasse in Westminster. Mrs May's government has previously ruled out remaining in a customs union after the UK leaves the EU, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy. Labour has said the EU may show flexibility over the issue and allow the UK ""a say"" in future trade deals. Mr Hancock suggested ""coming up with something in-between"", and called for ""an open dialogue in which we can make an agreement"". But Mr Duncan Smith said a customs union was ""the worst of all worlds because you lose your decision-making capacity"". Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was a ""glimmer of hope"" that a compromise between the Conservative and Labour ""core-voters"" could be reached. He added that while he supported the withdrawal deal reached between the EU and Mrs May, there might be things that could be done to make it ""more acceptable"" to Labour without compromising on the ""things that we think are essential"". But he also warned that a customs union would not be a ""long-term solution"". Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Hunt's remarks on a customs union provided ""yet more evidence"" that many in the cabinet believed the ""most important thing right now"" was the race to be Mrs May's successor. Labour's MP for Redcar, Anna Turley, also reacted to Mr Hunt's comments that a customs union was not a long-term solution,tweeting:,external""This is why we can't trust the Tories by doing a deal stitched up in Number 10 which they will seek to unravel under their next leader.""

"Research shows that only 24% of Scots buy from approved breeders More than Â£1m of tax has been recovered in Scotland as part of a crackdown on fraudsters selling puppies on the black market. A taskforce was set up by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in 2015 to flush out the undeclared income of rogue puppy breeders. Thepuppy trade in Scotland is reportedly worth Â£13m a year- with a large proportion illegally bred. The tax haul includes a Â£425,000 bill for a breeder in the west of Scotland. HMRC targets tax dodging puppy farmers Most illegally bred puppies are sold online through social media or small ad sites, with research showing only 24% of Scots buy from approved breeders. There has been a push to drive out the illegal trade due to welfare concerns as one in four puppies bought online die before their fifth birthday, and one in three get sick or die in the first year. Using a full range of civil and criminal enforcement powers, HMRC recovered a total of Â£5,393,035 in lost taxes across the UK from 257 separate cases since the formation of the taskforce four years ago, including more than Â£1m in Scotland. The Scottish SPCA said the illegal puppy trade was big business Several arrests have also been made as part of the taskforce's work across the UK. The head of the Scottish SPCA's special investigations unit, who cannot be named due to the undercover operations they take part in, said: ""Unfortunately, the puppy trade is big business, with thousands of dogs being brought into the country each year, particularly from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. ""It is a multi-million pound industry and many of these poor dogs are bred on large scale puppy farms with little to no regard for their welfare. ""It's a barbaric trade which commands huge profit from selling puppies. Often these puppies are kept in appalling conditions and this leads to injuries, health issues and behavioural problems."" Illegally traded puppies are often kept in appalling conditions HMRC officials uncovered fraudsters selling puppies on a mass scale for huge profit, and then failing to declare the sales. The agency said that in the west of Scotland, two unconnected puppy breeders were handed tax bills of Â£425,000 and Â£337,000 respectively, while a puppy dealer in the east of the country was forced to pay a tax demand in excess of Â£400,000 as part of the probe. Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride said: ""It is utterly appalling that anyone would want to treat puppies in such an inhumane way and on such a scale. ""It's also deeply unfair to all of the legitimate businesses who do pay the right tax and the total recovered by the taskforce is equivalent to the annual salaries for more than 200 newly-qualified teachers. ""We continue to work hard with other government agencies and our partners to tackle these traders.""

"Research shows that only 24% of Scots buy from approved breeders More than Â£1m of tax has been recovered in Scotland as part of a crackdown on fraudsters selling puppies on the black market. A taskforce was set up by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in 2015 to flush out the undeclared income of rogue puppy breeders. Thepuppy trade in Scotland is reportedly worth Â£13m a year- with a large proportion illegally bred. The tax haul includes a Â£425,000 bill for a breeder in the west of Scotland. HMRC targets tax dodging puppy farmers Most illegally bred puppies are sold online through social media or small ad sites, with research showing only 24% of Scots buy from approved breeders. There has been a push to drive out the illegal trade due to welfare concerns as one in four puppies bought online die before their fifth birthday, and one in three get sick or die in the first year. Using a full range of civil and criminal enforcement powers, HMRC recovered a total of Â£5,393,035 in lost taxes across the UK from 257 separate cases since the formation of the taskforce four years ago, including more than Â£1m in Scotland. The Scottish SPCA said the illegal puppy trade was big business Several arrests have also been made as part of the taskforce's work across the UK. The head of the Scottish SPCA's special investigations unit, who cannot be named due to the undercover operations they take part in, said: ""Unfortunately, the puppy trade is big business, with thousands of dogs being brought into the country each year, particularly from Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. ""It is a multi-million pound industry and many of these poor dogs are bred on large scale puppy farms with little to no regard for their welfare. ""It's a barbaric trade which commands huge profit from selling puppies. Often these puppies are kept in appalling conditions and this leads to injuries, health issues and behavioural problems."" Illegally traded puppies are often kept in appalling conditions HMRC officials uncovered fraudsters selling puppies on a mass scale for huge profit, and then failing to declare the sales. The agency said that in the west of Scotland, two unconnected puppy breeders were handed tax bills of Â£425,000 and Â£337,000 respectively, while a puppy dealer in the east of the country was forced to pay a tax demand in excess of Â£400,000 as part of the probe. Financial Secretary to the Treasury Mel Stride said: ""It is utterly appalling that anyone would want to treat puppies in such an inhumane way and on such a scale. ""It's also deeply unfair to all of the legitimate businesses who do pay the right tax and the total recovered by the taskforce is equivalent to the annual salaries for more than 200 newly-qualified teachers. ""We continue to work hard with other government agencies and our partners to tackle these traders.""

"HMRC officers have uncovered fraudsters selling puppies on a mass scale More than Â£5m in unpaid tax has been recovered from hundreds of dog breeders and traders selling puppies on the black market. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) launched an investigation in 2015 after animal welfare groups expressed concerns puppies were being reared on a mass scale and sold illicitly in the UK. It has recovered a total of Â£5,393,035 in lost taxes from 257 separate cases. Several arrests have also been made during the four-year investigation. Law proposed to ban puppy breeding farms for Wales Puppies smuggled through Northern Ireland rescued Puppy trade in Scotland reportedly worth Â£13m a year Among those HMRC said were targeted by its special taskforce weretwo unconnected puppy breeders in the West of Scotlandwho were handed tax bills of Â£425,000 and Â£337,000. A former Crufts judge breeding puppies in the Midlands was found to owe Â£185,000 in unpaid taxes, according to the government agency. A dealer in Northern Ireland was told to pay Â£185,000in tax while a Somerset breeder was given a Â£114,000 bill, and a puppy breeder in Swansea was handed a Â£110,000 tax bill, it said. Financial Secretary to the Treasury, Mel Stride, said: ""It is utterly appalling that anyone would want to treat puppies in such an inhumane way and on such a scale. ""It's also deeply unfair to all of the legitimate businesses who do pay the right tax, and the total recovered by the taskforce is equivalent to the annual salaries for more than 200 newly qualified teachers. ""We continue to work hard with other government agencies and our partners to tackle these traders."" HMRC is also involved in a multi-agency collaboration across the UK and Ireland called Operation Delphin, which is designed to tackle illegal puppy smuggling and its consequences. It is led by the Scottish SPCA and includes partners such as the RSPCA, Ulster SPCA, Dublin SPCA, Irish SPCA, HMRC, Border Force, and the police. Puppies rescued as a part of Operation Delphin As part of Operation Delphin's activities,the SSPCA said it had seized 27 puppies smuggled from Ireland at Cairnryan Port in Dumfries and Galloway. The RSPCA said it had intercepted 96 puppies being smuggled into the UK overnight through Holyhead Port in Wales, in a shipment it said was likely to have been worth ""many tens of thousands in murky profits"". Claire Lawson, from the RSCPA, said: ""Sadly, people are readily prepared to act illegally and compromise the welfare of defenceless animals to make profit. ""That's why the work of the HMRC taskforce in tackling dishonest dog breeding practices is so important. ""Puppy breeding can be big business, and those seeking to sacrifice their welfare to make more money need to know that this behaviour will not be tolerated, and they will punished.""

"Universities using ""gagging orders"" to stop staff going public with claims of bullying or sexual misconduct is an ""outrage"", according to a minister. Chris Skidmore said using non-disclosure agreements in this way risks the reputation of UK higher education. It comes afterBBC figures showeduniversities spent about Â£87m on pay-offs with NDAs since 2017. NDAs are contracts between employers and companies which can stop staff or ex-staff making information public. In a speech at the London School of Economics this week, universities minister Mr Skidmore is expected to say universities are considered the ""bastions of free speech"" - but that there are reports that some of them have suppressed allegations of harassment, discrimination and sexual assault. UK universities in 'gagging order' row What are non-disclosure agreements? Are NDAs being abused? Known as ""confidentiality clauses"" in the legal profession, NDAs can be signed when staff are hired to protect trade secrets like inventions or ideas. But they can also be signed when employees and organisations resolve a dispute, and have been used to stop workers discussing allegations of misbehaviour in the workplace. Last month, dozens of academics told BBC News they were ""harassed"" out of their jobs and made to sign NDAs after making complaints. Mr Skidmore will say collective action is needed to stop the misuse of NDAs ""Non-disclosure agreements exist for many purposes - such as protecting valuable research findings should a staff member change jobs,"" Mr Skidmore will say on Tuesday. ""But in no circumstances should they be used by universities to 'gag' staff after experiencing poor behaviour in the workplace, including bullying, discrimination or sexual misconduct. ""Let me be clear that any use of this sort of agreement to silence people or hide details of unfair practices is an outrage and risks bringing the reputation of our world-leading higher education system into disrepute. ""Universities need to wake up to this fact and the very real threat it poses to the reputation of the sector."" This video can not be played Anahid Kassabian felt bullied out of her job after she was diagnosed with cancer Mr Skidmore is expected to express his support for Universities UK - which represents universities. It has said using NDAs to stop victims speaking out will not be tolerated. BBC analysis last month showed 96 universities in the UK had spent Â£87m on around 4,000 settlements since 2017. Many universities said they were unable to disclose why the agreements were signed, so it is unclear how many relate to allegations of bullying, harassment or sexual misconduct. Claims of the misuse of NDAs by universities follow high-profile cases in the film and business worlds. UK universities in 'gagging order' row What are non-disclosure agreements?

"The brooch, which is about 800 years old, was found in a freshly ploughed field last year A man who unearthed a Â£145,000 Anglo-Saxon pendant has found more treasure dating back about 800 years. Tom Lucking's latest find saw him dig up a brooch dating back to between 1200 and 1300 in Wymondham, Norfolk in September. In 2014, the then student found a pendant in Winfarthing, Norfolk dating from circa AD630.

It's that satisfaction that comes from finding something that special.""

Alliance saw its share of the vote increase from 6.7% to 11.5%. A sister party of the Liberal Democrats in Great Britain, Alliance is Northern Ireland's main centrist cross-community party, seeking to attract support from both Protestants and Catholics.

In Belfast's Castle area, Alliance's Nuala McAlister topped the poll. Sinn FÃ©in's John Finucane was elected on the first count. He is the son of murdered solicitor Pat Finucane who was shot dead in front of his wife and three children in 1989. This video can not be played John Finucane says he wants to ""change Belfast for the positive"" The DUP made some gains in Belfast with Nicola Verner taking a seat in Court, from former TUV candidate Jolene Bunting. Ms Bunting, who had been involved in a number of controversies during her five-year tenure, ran as an independent this time but only polled 351 first preferences. In Derry and Strabane District Council, independent Gary Donnelly topped the poll in the Moor electoral area - where journalistLyra McKee was killed last month by dissident republicans. He had refused to condemn violent dissident republicanism but in the wake of her murder he called on the New IRA to desist from further attacks. Analysis: BBC NI political editor Mark Devenport: It has been a similar theme to day one, which is that of Alliance victories, they have the most to be pleased about as the result of this election. Clearly different voters vote for them for different reasons, but it may well reflect a disenchantment with the political paralysis up at Stormont. The DUP will be pleased that they have held their own and actually increased their vote slightly at the expense of the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV), which had a good election five years ago but has not been able to replicate that performance. I think Sinn FÃ©in will be disappointed, they missed a number of their targets and their vote has slid slightly. One interesting development tonight is that it looks like Fermanagh and Omagh District Council might slip into no overall control, rather than being a nationalist majority council. That is because there has been a wave of independents who won through there. Those independents may actually be nationalist in their outlooks but it is a sign of changing times both there and in Belfast where some of the smaller parties have also come through. Meanwhile, an independent candidate - who only stood for election after a Facebook post suggestion posted on 1 April garnered online support - has been elected to Antrim and Newtownabbey District council. Michael Stewart, who runs the Love Ballyclare Facebook page, said: ""I wasn't aware there would be this massive surge to independents, the Greens and Alliance. I didn't know I was part of anything."" He added: ""I am one of those people who voted for me, who've no interest in politics - they care about holes in their roads, no paper in their schools and that they can't get an appointment with their health centre."" It has been a long election for candidates, counters and commentators. In Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon District Council, Brian Pope of Alliance was elected following a marathon count that went on until 06:00 on Saturday morning.   By-elections can take place in some council wards even if that council is not scheduled for elections this year. Check your council website for details.

"New voters have been credited for the Alliance Party's breakthrough in the Northern Ireland council elections. Deputy leader Stephen Farry said he believed ""the real growth across the centre ground"" was largely due to the emergence of a new vote. With all seats declared, Alliance saw a 65% rise in representation. Its number of seats rose from 32 to 53. Speaking to BBC NI's Sunday Politics programme, Mr Farry said the party would not ""sit back on our laurels"". ""Simply being at 11% and still the fifth party in size is not good enough. We have to really transform the landscape of Northern Ireland politics,"" he said. Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry Other smaller parties and independents also made significant gains in the council election. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in are still the two biggest parties but the DUP lost eight seats. Sinn FÃ©in kept all its seats but its first preferences fell slightly. In pictures: Northern Ireland election highlights Northern Ireland results so far Revolving council doors usher in new faces Alliance surge a striking development What do councils in NI do? The Ulster Unionists lost 13 councillors, the SDLP seven and the Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) fell from 13 seats in the 2014 council elections to just six seats. The Green Party is still among the smaller parties, but it was a big winner this time round, doubling its representation from four seats to eight. People Before Profit also had a good election, rising from a single councillor in 2014, to five seats with gains in Belfast, and Derry City and Strabane. In terms of first preference votes, the DUP saw a marginal increase to 24.1%, but Sinn FÃ©in's share was 23.2%, a slight drop on its 2014 results. Alliance saw its share of the vote increase from 6.7% to 11.5%. A sister party of the Liberal Democrats in Great Britain, Alliance is Northern Ireland's main centrist cross-community party, seeking to attract support from both Protestants and Catholics. It won 10 seats in Belfast, an increase of two, where it will continue to hold the balance of power between unionists and nationalists. It also doubled its representation in Mid and East Antrim from three councillors to six, and for the first time in decades, it has representation in the north west with two seats on Derry City and Strabane District Council. ""Crucially, we've broken outside the Greater Belfast area for the first time in, I would say, 30 years,"" Alliance leader Naomi Long told the BBC. She said it had been a breakthrough election for her party and other cross-community candidates, with many voters choosing to reject the ""tribal politics"" of unionism and nationalism. This video can not be played Alliance leader Naomi Long explains why she thinks voters rewarded the party at the polls Sinn FÃ©in's results have been mixed. It won six out of seven seats in Blackmountain District Electoral Area (DEA), and for the first time, it has representation on Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council with two seats. However, the party lost five sitting councillors from Derry City and Strabane Council. The DUP also carved out some new territory, gaining two new seats in Belfast, andelecting its first ever openly gay candidate, Alison Bennington,in Antrim and Newtownabbey. But the party lost its leader on Belfast City Council, Lee Reynolds, after a low turnout in its east Belfast heartland. The Green Party had some notable successes with four seats in Belfast, where Ãine Groogan topped the poll in the Botanic DEA. Allow Twitter content?

"The leak from a National Security Council meeting about Chinese firm Huawei did not amount to a criminal offence, the Met Police has said. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was sackedfollowing an inquiry into the leaking of details from the council. Met Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said he was ""satisfied"" the Official Secrets Act had not been breached, so he would not investigate the leak. But Mr Williamson said a ""proper, full and impartial"" probe was now needed. The former minister - who has strenuously denied being responsible for the leak - described the government's inquiry into him as a ""shabby and discredited witch hunt"" . He said it had been ""badly mishandled"", both by Prime Minister Theresa May and the senior civil servant who led the investigation.

The newspaper also reported on warnings from within cabinet about possible risks to national security over any deal with the Chinese firm. The National Security Council is made up of senior cabinet ministers, all of whom have signed the Official Secrets Act. It holds confidential weekly meetings, chaired by the prime minister, where secret intelligence can be shared by GCHQ, MI6 and MI5. Police said it would not be appropriate for them to investigate the Huawei leak At a meeting with Mr Williamson on Wednesday evening, Mrs May told him she had information that suggested he was responsible for the unauthorised disclosure. In a letter confirming his dismissal, she said: ""No other credible version of events to explain this leak has been identified."" Disclosure of official information relating to security and intelligence by a ""Crown servant"" - including government ministers - can be illegal. For it to be an offence, the disclosure has to be damaging and done without lawful authority (ie not as part of the person's official duties). Being found guilty of this carries a sentence ranging from a fine to two years in prison. Read more: What is the Official Secrets Act? Mr Basu, who is Britain's top counter-terrorism police officer, said that what was disclosed ""did not contain information that would breach the Official Secrets Act"". He added: ""The leak did not cause damage to the public interest at a level at which it would be necessary to engage misconduct in a public office. ""It would be inappropriate to carry out a police investigation in these circumstances."" Mr Basu said the decision was informed by conversations with the Cabinet Office about the nature of the matters discussed at the meeting. He also took legal advice. Mr Williamson - who had been defence secretary since 2017 - responded to his sacking by saying he was ""confident"" that a ""thorough and formal inquiry"" would have ""vindicated"" his position.

"Theresa May must resign or the Conservatives should force her out, after the party's heavy local election losses, Iain Duncan Smith has said. The former Tory leader called Mrs May a ""caretaker PM"" and described her attempts to reach a Brexit deal with Labour as ""absurd"". The party suffered its worst local election result in England since 1995. Other senior Conservatives have urged Tory MPs to compromise with Labour to ensure Brexit is delivered. Elections were held on Thursday for 248 English councils, six mayors, and all 11councils in Northern Ireland. No elections took place in Scotland or Wales. The Conservatives lost 1,334 councillors, while Labour failed to make expected gains, instead losing 82 seats. The Liberal Democrats benefited from Tory losses, gaining 703 seats, with the Greens and independents also making gains. Following the results, Mrs May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn both insisted they would push ahead with talks seeking cross-party agreement on leaving the EU. Mrs May said it was clear the public wanted ""to see the issue of Brexit resolved"". Smaller parties make gains in NI elections Tories lose more than 1,300 councillors Local elections: The main parties punished Election results in maps But Mr Duncan Smith, a leading Brexiteer, said many Conservatives would refuse to back any deal reached between the two parties. Mrs May must announce her departure ""very soon"", he said, and if she did not go, the 1922 Committee of backbench MPs would have to force her to do so. Speaking to the BBC, he said: ""As a result of the devastating election result, the PM has in effect become a caretaker. ""As such, she is not empowered to make any deal with the Labour Party which itself suffered a very similar result. Two discredited administrations making a discredited deal is not the answer to the electorate."" In December, Mrs May survived a vote of no-confidence in her leadership of the Conservative Party, but in March she pledged to stand down if and when Parliament ratified her Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU.

The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but the deadline was pushed back to 31 October after Parliament was unable to agree a way forward. Ruth Davidson warned the parties would suffer the wrath of voters in the EU elections over Brexit In the wake of the Conservatives' local election losses, senior Tories have called for the party to compromise in order to reach an agreement with Labour to end the Brexit deadlock. Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson called for the negotiating teams of both parties - who are currently locked in talks - to ""get Brexit sorted, get a deal over the line and let Britain move on"". This video can not be played Theresa May on local election results: ""Simple message... just get on and deliver Brexit"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Conservative Party needed to listen to the election results and be ""in the mood for compromise"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the Conservatives might have to move towardsLabour's proposal of a permanent customs union- a move many Brexiteers in the party oppose - in order to solve the impasse in Westminster. Mrs May's government has previously ruled out remaining in a customs union after the UK leaves the EU, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy. Labour has said the EU may show flexibility over the issue and allow the UK ""a say"" in future trade deals. Mr Hancock suggested ""coming up with something in-between"", and called for ""an open dialogue in which we can make an agreement"". But Mr Duncan Smith said a customs union was ""the worst of all worlds because you lose your decision-making capacity"". Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was a ""glimmer of hope"" that a compromise between the Conservative and Labour ""core-voters"" could be reached. He added that while he supported the withdrawal deal reached between the EU and Mrs May, there might be things that could be done to make it ""more acceptable"" to Labour without compromising on the ""things that we think are essential"". But he also warned that a customs union would not be a ""long-term solution"". Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Hunt's remarks on a customs union provided ""yet more evidence"" that many in the cabinet believed the ""most important thing right now"" was the race to be Mrs May's successor. Labour's MP for Redcar, Anna Turley, also reacted to Mr Hunt's comments that a customs union was not a long-term solution,tweeting:,external""This is why we can't trust the Tories by doing a deal stitched up in Number 10 which they will seek to unravel under their next leader.""

"Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Prime Minister Theresa May, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock Senior Conservatives have called for the party to pull together after it suffered its worst results in English local elections since 1995. The Conservatives lost 1,334 councillors in Thursday's votes. Home Secretary Sajid Javid admitted voters had ""issues of trust"" over Brexit, and said the European elections would ""be even more challenging"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the party needed to listen to the results and be ""in the mood for compromise"". Both PM Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have insisted they will push ahead with seeking a cross-party agreement on Brexit, following the results. Live: Second day of counting in NI council elections Tories lose more than 1,300 councillors Local elections: The main parties punished Election results in maps Labour had been expected to make gains but lost 82 seats in the elections, while the Liberal Democrats - who have campaigned for a further vote on leaving the EU - were the main beneficiary of Tory losses, gaining 703 seats. The Greens and independents also made gains, as UKIP lost seats. Elections were held for 248 English councils, six mayors, and all 11 councils in Northern Ireland -where a second day of counting is continuing.No elections took place in Scotland or Wales. Vince Cable claimed Liberal success ""reflected the unpopularity of the government"" Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Hancock said ""the mood of the nation is, 'get on, deliver Brexit, and then move on'"". But he said the Tories might have to move towardsLabour's proposal of a permanent customs union- in order to solve the current impasse in Westminster over Brexit. The EU customs union means that once goods have cleared customs in one country and the commonly agreed tariffs (charges on imports) have been paid, they can be shipped to others in the union without further charges. A country does not have to be a member of the EU to be part of the customs union, but members cannot negotiate their own independent trade deals with countries from the rest of the world. Mrs May's government has previously ruled out remaining in a customs union after the UK leaves the EU, arguing it would prevent the UK from setting its own trade policy. Labour has suggested the EU may show flexibility over the issue and allow the UK ""a say"" in future trade deals. Mr Hancock suggested ""coming up with something in-between"", and called for ""an open dialogue in which we can make an agreement"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also said there was a ""glimmer of hope"" that a compromise between the Conservative and Labour ""core-voters"" could be reached. ""If we can find a solution that delivers the benefits of the customs union without signing up to the current arrangements, then I think there will be potential,"" he said. Justice Secretary David Gauke told BBC News that the local election results should be seen as a ""punishment"" to both the Conservatives and the Labour Party ""for failing to find a way through"" the Brexit conundrum. He added: ""We have to persevere with the talks with the Labour Party. I think that is the best opportunity to find a way through here."" The MP for Hertfordshire South West also rejected calls to oust Mrs May, saying: ""We should back the prime minister... so that we can bring the country together again - we can unite the Conservative Party and find a practical way through."" The UK was due to leave the EU on 29 March, but the deadline has been pushed back to 31 October. Mr Javid said this was a big factor in the Conservative Party losing control of 45 councils on Thursday - in its worst performance since John Major's party lost 2,000 councillors in 1995. In a rallying cry to Conservatives in Aberdeen, he said that ""a divided party cannot unite a divided nation"". The home secretary said the party risked losing voters' trust after ""not delivering on a promise at the heart of our last manifesto"". And, speaking about the European elections, due to take place on 23 May, he said: ""We shouldn't be surprised if people tick the protest box on the ballot paper."" Either search using your postcode or council name or click around the map to show local results.  Lisa Nandy, Labour MP for Wigan, also said the results reflected the public's frustration with the two main parties' ""perceived inability... to get our act together"". She told the Today programme there was ""no single magic bullet"" to solving Brexit, but ""the fact that people are not clear on what our policy is, is harming us in both Remain and Leave areas alike"". Ms Nandy said failing to leave the European Union would be a ""final breach of trust"" and her party must respect the referendum result. However, she said she believed the Brexit effect on the election results had been ""enormously overstated"" and many in towns like Wigan ""just didn't feel like Labour spoke for them"". This video can not be played Theresa May on local election results: ""Simple message... just get on and deliver Brexit"" The BBC projects that, if the local election results it analysed were replicated across Britain, both the Conservatives and Labour would get 28% of the total vote. Polling expert Prof Sir John Curtice said the days of the Conservatives and Labour dominating - as happened in the 2017 election when they won 80% of the vote between them - ""may be over"". He said it was only the second time in history that the two main parties' projected national share of the vote had fallen below 30%. The only other occasion was in 2013, when UKIP performed strongly in local elections.
