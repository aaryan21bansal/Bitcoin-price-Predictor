"Boris Johnson will unveil his long-term plans for social care and the NHS as early as Tuesday, amid rows over how to pay for multi-billion pound funding. The PM said he had a plan to reform social care when he took power in 2019 but has yet to announce the detail. Reports of an increase in National Insurance to cover the cost -which would break his commitment not to raise taxes- has angered Tory MPs. The NHS in England will getan extra Â£5.4bnover the next six months. The prime minister said the money would ""go straight to the front line"" to help ""bust the Covid backlogs"". Organisations representing the NHS have warnedservices may have to be cut unless NHS England receives an extra Â£10bn in fundingnext year. What would a National Insurance rise mean for me? The nine problems facing social care right now Social care shake-up plans expected this week Meetings to discuss the social care plan for England have been taking place between the PM, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid across the weekend, according to government sources. But while a deal is said to be ""close"", Laura Kuenssberg said it ""sounded like haggling was still going on"" over how to solve the funding issue. And she said a delay in reaching an agreement had ""created plenty of space for a backlash before the details have even emerged"". The rumoured increase in National Insurance - which has only been raised twice in the past 20 years - has particularly angered some Conservative MPs, with one cabinet minister telling the BBC: ""It is the wrong thing to do, and the wrong way to go about it"". Former minister and Tory MP Jake Berry also said it would not be a ""fair and equitable way"" to secure the money. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the rise would disproportionately affect working people ""on lower wages than many others in the country"", who would end up ""paying tax to support people to keep hold of their houses in other parts of the country where house prices may be much higher"".

NHS waiting list in England hits record 5.45 million Why workers face the bill for care revolution But it is widely accepted that major changes are needed to social care - which helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and medication - due an to ageing population and failures to address issues in the past. Defence Minister James Heappey said too many governments had ""ducked the opportunity"" to fix the system, leading to the ""social contract in the UK to be broken"". He told BBC Breakfast: ""The social contract is that whilst you are of working age, you pay your taxes to pay for those who aren't working in anticipation that when you yourself are retired, those who are of working age at that time will do the same for you. ""That social contract has become dangerously out of balance."" Mr Heappey would not confirm if National Insurance would be part of the government's proposals, but he said any plan would have pros and cons, and it was up to MPs to ""fiercely debate"" them when final detail is announced. Earlier this week,the government did not deny newspaper reportsthat it was considering increasing National Insurance contributions by at least 1% to improve social care and tackle the NHS backlog. National Insurance is paid by workers until they reach the state pension age and by employers. For someone on average earnings of Â£29,536 a year, a 1% increase in National Insurance would cost them Â£199.68 annually. Governments have only increased the tax twice since the 1990s - the Tory/Lib Dem coalition upped it in April 2011 (although it was announced by the previous Labour government) to improve public finances after the 2008 financial crash, and in 2003, Labour raised it to boost NHS spending. The last time the Conservatives increased National Insurance was in April 1994. But on all three occasions, the figure went up by 1%. Some Tories accept that a tax rise is needed - but say it should not be National Insurance because that could hit younger and lower income workers harder, while pensioners would not have to pay. However, during the last election, the Conservatives madea manifesto commitment,externalnot to raise National Insurance, income tax or VAT. Labour has voiced its opposition to an increase to National Insurance, with its leader, Sir Keir Starmer, ruling out his party's support. He told the Daily Mirror newspaper,external: ""We do need more investment in the NHS and social care but National Insurance, this way of doing it, simply hits low earners, it hits young people and it hits businesses. ""We don't agree that is the appropriate way to do it. Do we accept that we need more investment? Yes we do. Do we accept that NI is the right way to do it? No we don't. ""But we will look at what [the government puts] forward because after eleven years of neglect we do need a solution."" The SNP also called for the prime minister to ""go back to the drawing board"" over how to cover the cost. The party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, tweeted: ""This deeply regressive move would hammer young people, low paid workers and Scottish families by hundreds of pounds each year."" The social care system is devolved across the four nations, meaning governments need to develop separate solutions. In England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than Â£23,250 can get help from their council. There is no overall limit on costs, meaning thousands every year end up selling their homes to pay. Personal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it. Those in a home still have to contribute towards accommodation costs. The SNP said the UK government at Westminster should guarantee Scottish workers would not pay for an ""England-only policy"". Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland. For decades now there have been arguments over how we pay for the support needed as people live longer with more complex health conditions. Scotland made the decision twenty years ago to give families more help with the costs. Wales and Northern Ireland have tweaked their systems making them slightly more generous, but in England, all plans for change have so far become mired in political arguments over how we pay the bill. In the meantime the crisis in social care has deepened, leaving a system that is underfunded, has patchy quality, struggles to recruit enough staff and relies on the many people who fund their own care to subsidise the care of those who get council help. Anyone with more than Â£23,250 pays for all their care costs, which when it comes to residential care can run into thousands of pounds a month. This is as true for someone who bought their council house under the Tories right to buy scheme, as it is for someone who lives in a mansion. Also about half of local authority care spending is on younger adults with disabilities and their needs are unlikely to be addressed in these plans. The danger is that too much heat and noise over the funding mechanism will obscure meaningful discussion about what the vision should be for a care system of the future - because at its best it could help many more people live the lives they want for longer. In 2019/20, local authorities received 1.9 million requests for support, according to the Kings Fund - up by over 100,000 in five years While 1.4 million were from older people, 560,00 came from working age adults In total, 839,000 people received long-term care - 548,000 older people and 290,000 working-age adults But despite the rise in demand, the total expenditure on adult social care was only Â£99m more than in 2010/11, with council spending in England about 3% lower than in 2010 An ageing population also means growing demand, and Age UK estimates 1.5 million people in England don't get the help they need The fees local authorities pay for care - in a person's own home or a care home - vary hugely People who don't qualify for free care are often charged more, with no maximum limit on costs There are huge staff shortages - Age UK estimates there are about 45,000 vacancies Will the National Insurance cut leave me better off?

"The government's reversal of the 1.25p in the pound rise in National Insurance (NI) has come into effect. It means many people will keep more of their pay. NI went up by 1.25p in the pound in April and went back to its previous level on 6 November. For employees under pension age who earn less than Â£12,570 a year, the move will make no difference - because they don't pay NI. Above that income level, the amount saved increases as earnings do. So higher earners stand to benefit more than people on lower incomes - although higher earners will still contribute more tax overall. The majority of businesses will also see a reduction in their NI bills. Each business will save an average of Â£9,600 each in 2023-24,according to the government,external. National Insurance rise to be reversed in November NI is a tax paid by employees, employers and the self-employed: employees pay NI on their wages as well as income tax employers pay extra NI contributions for staff the self-employed pay NI on their profits NI contributes to the cost of benefits and the state pension. However, the government can borrow from the NI fund to help pay for other projects. NI raises a lot of money: Â£158bn last yearaccording to HMRC,external. Whether you receive the full state pensiondepends on your NI record,external. Why do we pay National Insurance? Since 6 April, workers and employers have been paying an extra 1.25p in the pound. The increase was part of the government's plan to fund the NHS and social care. It took the rate of NI to 13.25%. That meant the government went back on its 2019 election manifesto promise not to raise the tax. The NI increase was due to be replaced by a new Health and Social Care Levy - at a rate of 1.25% - in April 2023. But the government has now scrapped these plans, putting the NI rate back to 12%. That rate is paid by employees earning between Â£12,570 a year and just over Â£50,000 a year. Above that level, the rate has gone back down from 3.25% to 2.0%. The 1.25 percentage point increase in NI was supposed to raise Â£12bn a year. The government said the extra money would initially go towards easing pressure on the NHS. Some would then be moved into the social care system. This mainly helps older people and people with high care needs, with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication. The government has said that funding for health and social care services will be maintained at the same level as if the levy was in place. The funding for health and social care will now come from general taxation. A proportion of the NI increase was supposed to fund the social care system. The social care system is under pressure because of an ageing population and the effects of the pandemic. At the same time, it has also been hit by staff shortages and falling government spending. The government wants to ensure that people in England pay no more than Â£86,000 in care costs from October 2023 (not including accommodation and food). People with assets - such as a home, savings or investments - worth less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay for care out of those assets, but may still have to contribute from their income. Those with assets worth between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 may have their care costs subsidised. What could care changes cost you and your family? Social care: Nine challenges facing the system NI is a UK-wide tax. Although the government decided to increase it in order to fund health and social care in England, the tax increase was also expected to raise extra money that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could have chosen to spend on those services.

"This video can not be played Watch: Taliban fighters raise their flag in front of Panjshir's provincial governor's office The Taliban have declared victory over the province of Panjshir northeast of the capital Kabul, the final pocket of territory which has remained outside their rule. The group posted footage online of their fighters raising their flag there on Monday. Resistance fighters however said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" and ""continue to fight"". Their leader has called for a ""national uprising"" against the Taliban. In an audio recording posted on social media Ahmad Massoud, leader of the National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRF), blamed the international community for legitimising the Taliban and giving them military and political confidence. ""Wherever you are, inside or outside, I call on you to begin a national uprising for the dignity, freedom and prosperity of our country,"" he said. The Taliban took control of the rest of Afghanistan three weeks ago, seizing the capital Kabul on 15 August following the collapse of the Western-backed government. It comes nearly 20 years after US forces led an invasion to topple the Taliban. Panjshir, a rugged mountain valley, is home to between 150,000 and 200,000 people. It was a centre of resistance when Afghanistan was under Soviet occupation in the 1980s and during the Taliban's previous period of rule, between 1996 and 2001. ANALYSIS:What rise of Taliban means for Pakistan BACKGROUND:The story of Afghanistanâs 'undefeated' valley ON THE GROUND:In Kabul, Afghans adjust to a new, uncertain fate ""The Taliban haven't captured Panjshir,"" Ali Maisam, spokesman for the NRF, earlier told the BBC, saying he was ""rejecting Taliban claims"". A tweet from the group's Twitter handle also said: ""The struggle against the Taliban & their partners will continue until justice & freedom prevails."" But Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement that ""with this victory, our country is completely taken out of the quagmire of war"". The stunning Panjshir Valley is one of the smallest Afghan provinces, steeped in the biggest of legends. Its rugged mountain terrain - with its maze of valleys, crevices and caves - has been its greatest weapon in repelling invaders. The Soviet army never managed to conquer it in the 1980s; the Taliban didn't control it the first time round in the 1990s. So in this battle of opposing narratives, it's possible that the Taliban control the Panjshir's principal public arteries and areas, and a landscape known intimately only by its own inhabitants may now be sheltering the most defiant of resistance fighters. But the Taliban advance, however deep, is of great significance - both in symbolic and strategic terms. It's a sparkling jewel in the new Taliban crown as they embark on re-establishing their Islamic Emirate. But resistance leaders including Ahmad Massoud, son of the legendary commander, and Amrullah Saleh, the vehement Taliban critic, won't go quietly into the night. The National Resistance Front of Afghanistan (NRF) has been resisting Taliban rule Since taking power the Taliban have sought to portray themselves as more tolerant, but incidents of brutality and repression are still being reported in parts of Afghanistan. Although the group has promised to respect the rights of women, many fear a return to the way they were treated when the Taliban were previously in power. Women were forced to cover their faces outside, and suffered harsh punishments for minor transgressions. Witnesses have told the BBC thatTaliban militants shot and killed pregnant policewoman Banu Negaron Saturday. The Taliban told the BBC they had no involvement in Negar's death and are investigating the incident. There have also been several protests calling for respect for women's rights across Afghanistan. On Monday, a group of women demonstrating in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif told BBC Persian that Taliban fighters had threatened them. ""They swore at us and insulted us, and said that we should disperse quickly or else they would beat us to death,"" she said, adding that the militants had also threatened anyone who tried to film them. Women have taken part in protests demanding respect for their rights across Afghanistan Human rights groups have also documented revenge killings, detentions and persecution of religious minorities. The Taliban have said officially that they will not seek retribution against those who worked for the former government. As yet the Taliban have not announced the final make up of their new regime. Spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told reporters on Monday morning that all the important decisions have already been made, and that they are now working on the ""technical issues"". He also said an interim government would be announced first, allowing for changes later. Later on Monday, US President Joe Biden was asked by a reporter at the White House if he would recognise a Taliban government. ""That's a long way off,"" he said. Meanwhile, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken travelled to Qatar on Monday for talks with the government about the situation in Afghanistan, and to thank them for their part in helping the US evacuations from Kabul. More than 120,000 people were air-lifted from the Afghan capital in a US-led operation beforetheir forces fully withdrew from the countryon 31 August. A state department official travelling with Mr Blinken on Monday announced the US had helped evacuate four of its citizens over land - the first US citizens the government has helped leave the country since the withdrawal. The Taliban were aware of the evacuation, the official said, but no details were given about their identity or which country they crossed into from Afghanistan. US Republican congressman Ronny Jackson tweeted,externalafter the announcement that the four evacuees came from his district in Texas. Are you in Panjshir?

"Boris Johnson has vowed to end ""catastrophic costs"" for social care users in England ahead of setting out his long-awaited reform proposals. The prime minister will announce the plans to MPs, alongside money to help the tackle pressures on the NHS caused by the Covid pandemic. He is expected to breach election promises and raise National Insurance (NI) by about 1.25%. And the plan has prompted a backlash from some of his own Tory MPs. Cabinet ministers signed off the proposals at a meeting in No 10 earlier, with the PM's official spokesman saying: ""There was strong agreement that this is a long-standing issue, particularly on the social care side, which had been ducked for too long and which needed to be addressed."" Mr Johnson will set out the detail in a statement to the Commons at around 12:30 BST and will join the chancellor and Health Secretary Sajid Javid for a press conference at 16:00. But tweeting ahead of his appearance, he promised to set out how the government will ""support the NHS in the biggest catch-up programme in its history"" and announce ""a plan for social care to ensure that older people get the best possible care, without the fear or anxiety of catastrophic social care costs"". It is widely accepted that major changes are needed to the social care system, which helps older and working-age people with high care needs to carry out day-to-day tasks, such as washing, dressing, eating and medication. Labour said it agreed with the need of reform, but criticised the proposed rise in NI, saying it would unfairly target young people and lower earners. A 1.25% increase to NI would mean someone on a Â£30,000 salary would pay an additional Â£255 per year. But the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg understands that after late night talks, ministers agreed pensioners in work would also have to pay the new ""health and social care levy"" - despite people being exempt from NI payments after reaching state pension age. She also said the government might increase the amount of tax paid on income from share dividends to help cover the cost of the new plans. Do you have questions about this story?

Why workers face the bill for care revolution What would a National Insurance rise mean for me? Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the plans to ""deal with a broken social care system"" represented ""truly historic and ambitious reform"". ""One-in-seven people pay Â£100,000 or more for their social care, so in my view that nettle has to be grasped,"" he said. The BBC also understands Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to suspend the so-called ""triple lock"" on pensions -designed so rises in state pensions were not overtaken by the rising cost of living. The promise made by the Tories is that the state pension increases each year in line with the rising cost of living seen in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) measure of inflation, increasing average wages, or 2.5%, whichever is highest. On Monday, anextra Â£5.4bn over the next six monthswas announced to help the NHS in England tackle backlogs worsened by the pandemic. But it is thought Tuesday's announcement will also allocate cash for the long-term, to increase hospital capacity in England to 110% of its current level. Mr Johnson will tell MPs the NHS has been ""put under enormous strain by the pandemic"" and cannot be expected ""to recover alone"". He is also expected to say the government will not ""duck the tough decisions needed"" to help the service and fix England's ""broken"" social care system, again with longer term funding. But Laura Kuenssberg said the ""biggest unknown"" would be how much cash social care gets upfront, having been told support will be ""phased in"", while the NHS would be ""main beneficiary of the NI hike for the first three years"". Joyce Pinfield from the National Care Association said the sector was hoping there would be funding for the short and long term. She told the BBC: ""We do need something immediately... because most care providers are at breaking point."" The government is expected to announce an increase in National Insurance, likely of 1.25 percentage points, to raise billions of pounds to pay for helping the NHS catch up with lost time and treatment after the pandemic, and to help improve and pay for social care in England. I'm told the cash raised - potentially more than Â£12 billion - will be ring-fenced somehow, targeted initially at the health service itself then will switch to social care after three years. Expect also promises of changes to how the system works, including limiting the amount that families have to pay for care if need it. Read more from Laura Reports the prime minister will raise NI, a tax paid by workers and employers, to cover costs for the plans has received a terse response from Conservatives. The partymade a manifesto commitment,externalnot to raise NI, income tax or VAT during the 2019 general election. One cabinet minister has told the BBC a National Insurance hike was ""the wrong thing to do, and the wrong way to go about it"". Tory former chancellors Lord Hammond, Lord Clarke and Lord Lamont have all criticised the plan, while former Tory PM Sir John Major has called it ""regressive"". Just under half of social care expenditure helps working-age adults, according to the King's Fund Mr Johnson announced after taking office in 2019 that he had a ""clear plan"" to fix the ""crisis"" facing the sector. Reports suggested the overhaul will place a limit - or ""cap"" - on the lifetime contributions made by individuals, with the taxpayer funding costs on top of this. This would be a version of a plan suggested by Sir Andrew Dilnot, whoadvocated a Â£35,000 lifetime cap in 2011. It was put into law in 2014 under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition, but delayed and then eventually ditched under David Cameron. His successor, Theresa May, later suggested and then abandoned a form of the proposals in 2017. Former Labour health secretary and Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said an NI rise was ""flawed"" and ""unfair"" - and suggested ministers should instead ask all pensioners to make a contribution of 10% of their estate, topped up by rises in other taxes, such as capital gains tax. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he wanted ""to introduce the NHS principle to social care - everyone would be required to contribute, but everyone would benefit"". Mr Burnham said ""for the vast majority of people they'd have peace of mind at a lower cost"" and ""I don't see how you can do this without asking pensioners to make a contribution"". Meanwhile, Wayne Fitzgerald, Conservative leader of Peterborough City Council, has said he does not think people would mind a tax if they had confidence that it was going to be used for social care. Councils in England received 1.9 million requests for social care support during 2019/20, according to the NHS Requests have risen by more than 100,000 in five years 1.4 million of these were from older people - but 560,000 came from working-age adults Despite the rise in demand, total expenditure on adult social care was only Â£99m more than in 2010/11, with council spending in England about 3% lower than in 2010 An ageing population also means growing demand - Age UK estimates 1.5 million in England don't get the help they need There are no standard fees for social care elements in England - meaning people face a postcode lottery People who don't qualify for free care are often charged more, even within the same care homes, with no maximum limit There are huge staff shortages - the King's Fund think tank says average wages are lower than some retail staff and cleaners The social care system is devolved across the four UK nations, meaning governments need to develop separate solutions. In England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than Â£23,250 can get help from their council and there is no overall limit on costs. Personal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it. Those in a home still have to contribute towards accommodation costs. Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland. The SNP has called on the government to scrap any planned rise in National Insurance, saying it would ""unfairly penalise Scottish families by forcing them to pay the bill for the Westminster social care crisis in England"". The party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, added: ""If Boris Johnson breaks yet another manifesto pledge, the Tories will descend even further into irrelevance in Scotland.""

And today those words won't come."" The star was found dead in his New York apartment on Monday. US media quoted law enforcement sources as saying he died from a suspected drug overdose, but that has not been confirmed. Williams, who was nominated for three Emmys, had openly discussed his struggles with drugs over the years. In The Wire, he played Omar Little, a gay, streetwise robber of drug gangs. He was also known for playing gangster Albert ""Chalky"" White in the Prohibition period TV series Boardwalk Empire. Other TV credits included Lovecraft Country, The Night Of, Bessie and When They See Us. Peters, who played Lester Freamon in The Wire, said he ""didn't know whether to be sad or angry"" about the death of his co-star. ""I'm sad that Michael is no longer with us because there was a very promising personality that could have done so much more. I'm angry because I feel he's let us down by going back when he could have reached out,"" he told the Today programme. ""Once a person is on that path, maybe it is very difficult for them to get off. So we, as a society, have to pull our socks up so we can help people like this."" Spike Lee said: ""Whew lawd, dis is a tough day -1st we lose the great French actorJean Paul Belmondoand now my brother Michael K Williams. ""Our greats are leaving us left and right. God bless,"" he added alongside a photograph of himself with Williams at a basketball game. Other tributes from the world of entertainment came from the likes of his The Wire co-star Wendell Pierce. ""The depth of my love for this brother, can only be matched by the depth of my pain learning of his loss,""Pierce tweeted.,external ""A immensely talented man with the ability to give voice to the human condition portraying the lives of those whose humanity is seldom elevated until he sings their truth,"" Pierce added. Idris Elba, who played Stringer Bell in The Wire,simply posted a black square,externalwith the initials MKW. Sonja Sohn, who played Detective Kima Greggs,posted ""Always & Forever"" with a broken heart,external. Singer Mariah Carey shared a picture of herself with Williams, describing him as ""a beautiful soul, a beautiful person"". She added: ""I'll miss you always.

We have lost an enormous talent in Michael K Williams,"" tweeted Star Trek actor George Takei. Director James Gunn described Williams as one of the ""most gentle souls I've ever met"". In a statement, the HBO TV network, which aired 60 episodes of The Wire between 2002 and 2008, said: ""We are devastated to learn of the passing of Michael Kenneth Williams, a member of the HBO family for more than 20 years. ""While the world is aware of his immense talents as an artist, we knew Michael as a dear friend who was beloved by all who had the privilege to work with him. We send our deepest condolences to his family for this immeasurable loss."" Michael K Williams' complex portrayal of Omar Little, a gay, shotgun-toting robber of drug dealers, helped cement The Wire's game-changing depiction of life in the projects of Baltimore. Omar represented the duality of a black experience never before given such honest screen time. Nowhere was that better represented than his exchanges with Wendell Pierce's detective Bunk, a black schoolfriend who reminded him of the different paths life afforded them. Interviewed together years before Williams' death,external, Pierce said his co-star's performance gave voice and flesh to characters ""that most people would have never given the same humanity toâ¦ opening a window to a world of men that we pass by or don't know about"". Pierce described the scenes they shared as the ""greatest of my career"", performed by a man who contributed two of the ""most iconic characters in the history of American television"" in Omar Little and Chalky White, and no doubt could have given many more. Williams with co-star Tristan Wilds at a 2006 premiere for The Wire Born in 1966, Williams had a turbulent upbringing in Brooklyn, New York. Despite trying to avoid confrontation, he later said he ""had a way of always finding myself in trouble - like, big trouble, you know what I'm saying?"" He began his career as a dancer and performed with Madonna and George Michael before moving into acting with companies including the prestigious National Black Theatre Company. He got the distinctive scar on his forehead and right cheek after being slashed by a razor on his 25th birthday - but that inadvertently led to his first acting job after Tupac Shakur saw a photo of him and decided he looked ""thugged out enough"" to play his brother in the 1996 film Bullet. Ina BBC interview in 2018, Williams explained why The Wire was such a success. ""I think it has just stayed with people because it's still relevant now, because of the climate of what's going on in the United States. I think it's actually a little sad,"" he said. ""It was the first show I saw that was created as what I call 'edutainment'. It dived so honestly into what was wrong in our society, from the police department to our lawmakers to our school system, and the media. It represented what was happening in our community."" But in 2011,he told The Hollywood Reporter,externalhe was ""overwhelmed"" by the success of season one and went ""into an emotional tailspin"" during season two. ""I wasted a lot of money, I started drinking and drugging again, and, at the end of season two, I was forced to move back to my projects and slept on a mattress on the floor."" Speaking about his drug use while filming The Wire,he told news website NJ.com,externalin 2012: ""I was playing with fire. ""It was just a matter of time before I got caught and my business ended up on the cover of a tabloid or I went to jail - or worse.""

This video can not be played Dr Nighat Arif told BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker how to do a basic self-examination for breast cancer The most common sign of breast cancer is a lump or thickening in the breast - but there are other symptoms too. They include: Change in size or feel of the breast Changes in the skin of the breast, such as dimpling or redness Fluid leaking from the nipple, outside of pregnancy or breast feeding Change in position of the nipple These symptoms can be caused by other conditions, so it is important to get any lumps or changes checked by a doctor. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with women over 50 more at risk than the under-40s. But there are many other factors that can increase a person's risk, including a family history of cancer and being overweight. Many treatments are available for breast cancer and survival is generally good if the disease is detected early.

"Resistance fighters have gathered in Panjshir province, just north of Kabul The Taliban have swept through Afghanistan with remarkable speed. But as they sit in Kabul planning their new government, there remains a large thorn in their side: a small valley of anti-Taliban resistance just north-east of the capital, refusing to give up despite being entirely surrounded. Senior Taliban leader Amir Khan Motaqi has called on the residents of the Panjshir Valley to lay down their weapons, but there is little sign of them complying. Dozens of Taliban fighters are said to have been killed in skirmishes along its borders since 15 August, when Kabul fell, and fighting is continuing. So what exactly is happening in the Panjshir Valley - and should the Taliban be worried? The valley in eastern Afghanistan has become the home of the National Resistance Front (NRF),  a multi-ethnic group made up of militias and former Afghan security force members, reportedly numbering in the thousands. Photos released this week show what appears to be an organised, well-armed and well-trained group. Resistance fighters training in late August The NRF has been joined by former vice-president Amrullah Saleh, but its leader is Ahmad Massoud, whose father was known as the ""Lion of Panjshir"", and for good reason. Ahmad Shah Massoud not only held off the Soviet invasion in the 1980s, but went on to keep the Taliban out in the 1990s, only to be killed by assassins two days before 9/11. His son - a 32-year-old King's College London and Sandhurst Military Academy graduate - is now determined to do the same and keep the Taliban out. And he is not just looking for support at home - earlier this year he met France's President Emmanuel Macron, seemingly in a bid for international allies as the US withdrawal drew nearer. Ahmad Massoud, pictured in 2019, is the leader of the resistance In an interview with CNN, Massoud warned the militants had not changed - adding that he and his fighters believed ""that democracy, the rights, and freedom of all citizens regardless of race and gender should be preserved"". The militant group has been pushing the idea that the Taliban's ""Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan is home for all Afghans"". The Panjshir Valley's resistance - right on the doorstep of the capital - is a blow to this particular image of unity. On social media, hashtags voicing support for the resistance have begun to pop up. The Taliban and the NRF have been negotiating but, although both sides say they are keen to avoid war, there has been no settlement reached, and it seems talks have given way to open fighting. The Taliban say they have sent hundreds of fighters, but Panjshir is ready. According to news agency AFP, Taliban fighters who make it to the edges of the valley will be greeted by machine gun nests, mortars and surveillance posts fortified with sandbags. Both sides say they have inflicted casualties, but exact numbers are difficult to gauge. Claims by the Taliban that they have taken control of certain areas have also been dismissed by NRF. The Taliban are also reportedly trying to cut supply lines into the valley, potentially hoping to force the resistance to give up. Panjshir is one of Afghanistan's smallest provinces and is home to somewhere between 150,000 and 200,000 people, hidden behind mountain peaks that rise 9,800ft (3,000m) above the Panjshir River. In peaceful years, people flocked to the valley, drawn by the stunning views and the safety it offered. It is home to a range of people, with the largest group being ethnic Tajiks. The valley's residents have developed a reputation for bravery thanks to fighting off outsiders. The valley - which historically was known for its gems and mining - has benefited from investment in recent years. In the past two decades, hydroelectric dams and a wind farm have been built, as well as roads and a radio tower. Want to know more?

"Ministers have also agreed to remove table service rules indoors and outdoors A number of changes to Covid restrictions have been agreed by the Northern Ireland Executive. Under the new moves, the number of people allowed indoors at domestic settings will rise from 10 to 15. Ministers have also agreed to remove table service rules indoors and outdoors at pubs and restaurants. People will be allowed to play pool, darts and gaming machines while dancing will also be allowed at weddings and civil partnership receptions. The requirement to purchase tickets in advance for live performances will be removed, as will the need for audience members to have allocated seats. The changes are seen as ""limited moves"" and a ""stepping stone"" approach. They will take effect from 17:00 BST on Friday, 10 September. First Minister Paul Givan, of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said: ""Today we made good progress and we met for nearly four hours in the executive and considered the current information around health, the economy, impacts on families and the community. ""We were able to reach decisions on a number of areas."" Hospitality Ulster said the moves were ""incremental changes"" and that it was time to provide indicative dates and a framework of action to move out of the remaining restrictions. ""A major strategic decision needs to be taken by the executive to bring forward a detailed and specific roadmap to address the problems that are gathering on the horizon - if not now, when?"" the organisation's Colin Neill said. ""Hospitality businesses are left hanging while restrictions continue to place a halt on viable trading. We need the best chance we can get to recover."" However, Sinn FÃ©in Junior Minister Declan Kearney said there was still a very high and dangerous infection level in Northern Ireland. ""So the executive I think has taken a very proportionate and measured and incremental approach towards the easements we have adopted today,"" he said. ""I don't think we can underestimate the extent of the challenge we still face - a lot of pressure on our health workers, there's still a very high impact on the health service, high levels of hospital admissions and bed occupancy."" The executive will meet again on Thursday as it keeps the issue of Covid-19 in schools under review. The DUP has been pushing for the executive to agree a plan - complete with dates - to remove all restrictions. Last week's meeting was cancelled after Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neilltested positive for Covid-19. The legal requirement for social distancing outdoors no longer exists in Northern Ireland. However, indoor premises such as restaurants and workplaces are still required to comply with at least 1m (3ft). That rule has already been removed in the rest of the UK, but guidance remains that people should socially distance where possible, and in places like hospitals and schools, the rules differ again. Some hospitality businesses in Northern Ireland have urged the executive to scrap the requirement for social distancing, saying it continues to affect their trade. Nightclubs in Northern Ireland remain closed, and dancing is not permitted at indoor venues where music is played. What are Northern Ireland's Covid-19 rules now?

"Gilboa Prison is a high-security facility known as ""the Safe"" Israeli authorities have launched a manhunt after six Palestinian prisoners escaped from one of the country's most secure jails overnight. The men are believed to have dug a hole in the floor of their cell at Gilboa prison, then crawled through a cavity and tunnelled beneath the outer wall. Officials were alerted by farmers who noticed them running through fields. The fugitives include a former leader of the militant group Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade and five Islamic Jihad members. An Israel Prison Service official described the escape as ""a major security and intelligence failure"". Palestinian militant groups hailed it as ""heroic"". Allow Twitter content?

The alarm was raised at Gilboa Prison, a high-security facility in northern Israel known as ""The Safe"", when authorities received reports from local farmers about ""suspicious figures"" in nearby agricultural fields. When prison staff carried out a headcount at 04:00 (01:00 GMT), they found six inmates were missing. The Palestinians are believed to have made their way out of the cell that they shared by digging a hole in the floor of their bathroom. The Jerusalem Post reported thatthey had used a rusty spoon that they hid behind a poster,external. The hole in the cell's floor led to an existing cavity beneath the prison The hole led to a hollow space underneath the prison that was created during the facility's construction, when piles were sunk into the ground. An Israeli police commander described it as a ""structural flaw"". The inmates are believed to have moved through the space to reach the prison's outer wall, then duga tunnel that emerged in the middle of a dirt road just outside,external. The Shin Bet security service said it believed the prisoners had been in contact with people outside the prison using a smuggled mobile phone and that they had been picked up in a car. The tunnel emerged in a rural strip of land near the prison's walls The six fugitives include Zakaria Zubeidi, a former commander of the Palestinian militant group Al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigade in the West Bank city of Jenin, as well as five members of Islamic Jihad. Four of the Islamic Jihad members were serving life sentences after being convicted of planning or carrying out attacks that killed Israelis, while the fifth had been held without charge for two years under a so-called administrative detention order, according to Israeli media. Zubeidi was arrested by Israeli forces in 2019 on suspicion of involvement in a number of shooting attacks and is currently standing trial. Israeli border police and army troops involved in the manhunt have reportedly set up roadblocks to stop the men reaching the nearby occupied West Bank or Jordan, which is about 14km (nine miles) to the east of Gilboa prison. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett spoke to Public Security Minister Omer Bar-Lev and ""emphasised that this is a grave incident that requires an across-the-board effort by the security forces"" to find the fugitives. Islamic Jihad described the jailbreak as ""heroic"" and said it would ""shock the Israeli defence system"", while Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said it was a ""great victory"" that proves ""the will and determination of our brave soldiers inside the prisons of the enemy cannot be defeated"".

"It will be Stereophonics first gig in Wales since the Covid pandemic began Welsh rockers Stereophonics have announced a special festive return to Cardiff - with a headline Christmas show at the Principality Stadium. The four-piece will be joined by Sir Tom Jones and Catfish And The Bottlemen for the concert on 18 December. It will be their first gig in the capital since shows just before Wales went into the Covid lockdown in 2020. Stereophonics frontman Kelly Jones said he wanted to do ""something we can celebrate"". ""After almost two years of being locked down and families all having their own stories of stress and pressure and loss, I wanted to give something to the Welsh people to feel good about,"" said Jones. Live music back in the Land of Song Feeder kicks off return of gigs 18 months of hell for hospitality ""There's a welcome in the stadium for everyone, come raise a glass and make some memories."" The Cynon Valley band's last shows in Cardiff werethe final large events before Wales went into the first full national lockdown in March 2020. The Christmas appearance will mark Sir Tom's return to his south Wales home At the time, the Welsh government said the ""clear public health advice was that cancelling mass gatherings was not required"". But within days, all mass gatherings were banned, as the pandemic measures came into force. The new festive concert will take place with virtually all Covid restrictions lifted in Wales. American superstar Pink was the last major music event at the Principality Stadium in June 2019 However, organisers have already stressed measures will be in place to combat possible infections. All those attending the Christmas gig will have to provide proof of being double-vaccinated against Covid-19 or proof of a negative lateral flow test taken with 24 hours of the event. Facemasks will also be required while entering and moving around the stadium. The Stereophonics and Sir Tom Jones collaborated on 2000 hit Mama Told Me Not To Come The event will mark the south Wales return for 81-year-old Sir Tom, who has shared the stage with Stereophonics previously and they sang together on 2000 hit Mama Told Me Not to Come. ""I've been good friends with Stereophonics for over 20 years, and was delighted to be asked by Kelly to join them for a very special show in a very special place. I can't wait to be there to share a great night with you all,"" said Sir Tom. Tickets for the show will go on on sale on Friday.

"The UK fired up an old coal power plant on Monday to meet its electricity needs. Warm, still, autumn weather has meant wind farms have not generated as much power as normal, while soaring prices have made it too costly to rely on gas. As a result, National Grid ESO - which is responsible for balancing the UK's electricity supply - confirmed coal was providing 3% of national power. It said it asked EDF to fire up West Burton A, which had been on standby. On Tuesday, theuse of coal returned to 2.2%,externalof the UK's electricity generation. A National Grid ESO spokesman said there had been a three-day coal-free run in mid-August, but the country had relied on some coal power every day since then. Why is my energy bill going up and how can I save money? Second-to-last coal-fired power station to close Last year, coal contributed 1.6% of the country's electricity mix. That was down from 25% five years ago. Both the government and National Grid ESO have committed to phasing out coal power completely by 2024 to cut carbon emissions. However, coal is still used when it is better value than gas. A small temporary uptick in the use of coal should be kept in perspective, said Dave Jones, electricity analyst at Ember, a think tank promoting the shift away from fossil fuels. ""No-one thought we'd use zero coal this year,"" he said. ""We're going through a process where year-on-year you're relying on coal less and less. As long as you know you can make it to that fixed date, which is still three years away, it's OK. We're well on track for that journey, probably ahead of schedule."" But higher gas prices could help accelerate the shift from gas to renewables over the next few years, he added. The UK government has made commitments to reducing the use of gas for power generation, but has not set a fixed deadline. More coal has been burnt this summer in particular, due to soaring prices for natural gas. Across Europe, shortages and increased demand from Asia have seen the cost of gas increase to the highest level on record, according to Reuters. A cold start to the year meant countries across the continent dipped into their gas reserves, which would normally be replenished in the summer months when demand tends to be weaker. But the economic rebound, as countries reopen from Covid-19 lockdowns, meant higher-than-expected demand led to a shortage of gas. by Rebecca Wearn, Business Reporter Britain's use of coal power on a warm September day raises two big issues. The first, is that this jars with an environmental commitment to reduce fossil fuel use. The second, is the huge impact global gas prices have on our domestic energy. Over the coming months, those sky-high gas prices are expected to remain volatile. So, as well as forcing National Grid to make some tough choices about where we get our electricity from, it could also have a big knock-on on what we pay. The cap on regulated prices will be raised in October, adding Â£139 to the bills of 15 million households. But that could be just the start. Now would be a good time for consumers to check what they're paying - and shop around for the best deal - before the winter weather makes this issue more acute. ""In balancing the electricity system, we take actions in economical order and not on the basis of generation type,"" a National Grid spokesman said. ""Depending on system conditions, some power sources may be better at meeting a balancing requirement than others - so the most cost-effective solution to ensure safe, secure system operation will be sought."" The Nuclear Industry Association said the decision to fire up another coal power plant highlighted the urgent need to invest in new nuclear plants. ""Otherwise, we will continue to burn coal as a fall-back and fall well short of our net zero ambitions,"" said the trade body's chief executive, Tom Greatrex.

"The protocol prevents a hard border with Ireland but some products need to be checked as they arrive from GB The UK government has announced further delays to some Irish Sea border checks. The checks are a requirement of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a deal reached by the UK and EU in 2019. It means some products need to be checked as they arrive from GB but grace periods mean that not all the checks have been implemented. Some of these grace periods were due to expire at the end of September but the government has now indefinitely extended them. In a written statement, Brexit Minister Lord Frost said that the move was necessary to ""provide space for further potential discussions"" with the EU. The UK wants a fundamental renegotiation of the protocol but the EU has said that is not possible, although it is prepared to consider additional flexibilities. Lord Frost said it was a necessary move Lord Frost's statement said: ""The government will continue to operate the protocol on the current basis. ""This includes the grace periods and easements currently in force. Operational and other guidance will be updated to reflect this approach."" In a statement on Monday evening the European Commission said it noted Lord Frost's statement and continued to stress that ""the Withdrawal Agreement is an international agreement"". ""The Protocol is an integral part of the Withdrawal Agreement and the agreed solution between the UK and the EU to the problems caused by Brexit for the island of Ireland,"" it said. ""Both sides are legally bound to fulfil their obligations under the Agreement. ""Our focus remains on identifying long-term, flexible and practical solutions to address issues related to the practical implementation of the Protocol that citizens and businesses in Northern Ireland are experiencing."" The European Commission said it would not agree to a renegotiation of the Protocol. ""Our approach to the Protocol is based on the achievement of stability, certainty and predictability in line with the objectives of the Good Friday Agreement and in order to protect the Single Market,"" it added. Unionists say the protocol damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK The Northern Ireland Retail Consortium has said that there can be no more ""cliff-edge dates"" when it comes to the protocol. AodhÃ¡n Connolly, the organisation's director, said he hoped the UK government's decision ""will be taken in the spirit of joint working"" and that ""both sides must move"". ""This cannot be another can-kicking exercise. Northern Ireland is in a unique situation which requires a unique solution that is agreed by both the UK and EU,"" Mr Connolly said. In March, the UK unilaterally extended some grace periods. That met with a furious response from the EU, which said that by acting alone the UK was in clear breach of the protocol. The European Commissionbegan a legal action against the UK, which is still continuing. However in June, the UK formally requested an extension to the sausages grace period which was granted by the EU. The EU said it was being ""accommodating' and the UK described the move as ""sensible"". What next for the Northern Ireland Protocol? Cold mistrust if protocol swept away - Lord Frost The UK wants a ""standstill"" of all grace periods and legal actions as it attempts to persuade the EU to engage in a fundamental renegotiation of the protocol. The EU says it will be as flexible as possible within the terms of the protocol but will not renegotiate. Meanwhile the European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic is due to to visit Northern Ireland on Thursday and Friday. Mr Sefcovic, the EU's lead negotiator on the protocol, will meet political, business and civic leaders. He is also expected to hold a press conference on Friday.

"Jean-Paul Belmondo's battered face, laconic style and roguish smile captured the imagination of French 1960s youth. Belmondo, who has died at his Paris home aged 88, was the cool rebel of the new wave of French cinema typified in Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 film classic, A Bout de Souffle. His moody performance as a doomed thief and Humphrey Bogart fan struck a chord  and saw him dubbed the Gallic James Dean. Later, he forsook arts cinema to become a highly bankable commercial actor, as at home in comedy as in drama. Jean-Paul Belmondo was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris on 9 Apr  1933, the son of Paul Belmondo, a sculptor whose statues grace many a Parisian park. The intensely Bohemian atmosphere of his upbringing had a formative effect on him. He failed at school and became an amateur boxer. In his short-lived career, he won 15 of his 23 bouts before giving up to concentrate on acting. A Bout de Souffle was his first starring role His trademark bumpy nose, however, was a result of a fight in the school playground rather than the ring. After performing on stage in provincial theatres, his movie break came with the role of Laszlo in Marcel CarnÃ©'s 1958 film Les Tricheurs. On the strength of his forceful portrayal, he was given his first starring role in A Bout de Souffle. One critic described him as ""a bewitchingly ugly man."" His cult image carried him through several action films such as Les Distractions and La Novice. Determined not to be stereotyped, Belmondo also accepted more demanding roles such as the idealistic intellectual of Vittorio de Sica's La Ciociara in 1961, and as the young country priest in Philippe de Broca's swashbuckling Cartouche the following year. He also enjoyed comic roles, in Godard's Une Femme est une Femme, and, particularly, in De Broca's L'Homme de Rio, in which he played a suave, unflappable secret agent. By the mid-60s, he had switched completely to the commercial mainstream and formed his own production company, Cerito. He relished his role as an elder statesman of French cinema He even performed his own stunts in such films as Les Tribulations d'Un Chinois en Chine in 1965, though he gave this practice up after an accident in the 1985 film Hold-up. He brightened many an all-star cast in international productions such as Is Paris Burning? (1966), the James Bond spoof Casino Royale (1967) and with Alain Delon in the gangster movie Borsalino (1970), He moved away from action movies claiming that ""I don't want to be a flying grandpa of the French cinema."" In 1987 Belmondo returned to the stage for the first time for nearly 30 years and divided his work between theatre and film for the rest of his career. Two years later he won a Cesar, the French equivalent of an Oscar, for his performance in Itineraire d'un Enfant Gate. He branched out creatively as part of the ensemble in Varda's homage to international cinema Les Cent et une Nuits de Samon Cinema in 1995 and as the Jean Valjean figure in Claude Lelouche's  re-working of Les Miserables in the same year. Jean-Paul Belmondo was divorced from his first wife Elodie in 1965. His second marriage to Constantin also failed. He later had long relationships with actresses Ursula Andress and Laura Antonelli. Cinema audiences at home and abroad were drawn to his charm and seeming disregard for whatever absurdities were taking place on screen. He was chosen by Empire magazine as one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history.

"Ministers have also agreed to remove table service rules indoors and outdoors A number of changes to Covid restrictions have been agreed by the Northern Ireland Executive. Under the new moves, the number of people allowed indoors at domestic settings will rise from 10 to 15. Ministers have also agreed to remove table service rules indoors and outdoors at pubs and restaurants. People will be allowed to play pool, darts and gaming machines while dancing will also be allowed at weddings and civil partnership receptions. The requirement to purchase tickets in advance for live performances will be removed, as will the need for audience members to have allocated seats. The changes are seen as ""limited moves"" and a ""stepping stone"" approach. They will take effect from 17:00 BST on Friday, 10 September. First Minister Paul Givan, of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said: ""Today we made good progress and we met for nearly four hours in the executive and considered the current information around health, the economy, impacts on families and the community. ""We were able to reach decisions on a number of areas."" Hospitality Ulster said the moves were ""incremental changes"" and that it was time to provide indicative dates and a framework of action to move out of the remaining restrictions. ""A major strategic decision needs to be taken by the executive to bring forward a detailed and specific roadmap to address the problems that are gathering on the horizon - if not now, when?"" the organisation's Colin Neill said. ""Hospitality businesses are left hanging while restrictions continue to place a halt on viable trading. We need the best chance we can get to recover."" However, Sinn FÃ©in Junior Minister Declan Kearney said there was still a very high and dangerous infection level in Northern Ireland. ""So the executive I think has taken a very proportionate and measured and incremental approach towards the easements we have adopted today,"" he said. ""I don't think we can underestimate the extent of the challenge we still face - a lot of pressure on our health workers, there's still a very high impact on the health service, high levels of hospital admissions and bed occupancy."" The executive will meet again on Thursday as it keeps the issue of Covid-19 in schools under review. The DUP has been pushing for the executive to agree a plan - complete with dates - to remove all restrictions. Last week's meeting was cancelled after Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neilltested positive for Covid-19. The legal requirement for social distancing outdoors no longer exists in Northern Ireland. However, indoor premises such as restaurants and workplaces are still required to comply with at least 1m (3ft). That rule has already been removed in the rest of the UK, but guidance remains that people should socially distance where possible, and in places like hospitals and schools, the rules differ again. Some hospitality businesses in Northern Ireland have urged the executive to scrap the requirement for social distancing, saying it continues to affect their trade. Nightclubs in Northern Ireland remain closed, and dancing is not permitted at indoor venues where music is played. What are Northern Ireland's Covid-19 rules now?

"Almost 388,000 people have been waiting more than a year for an operation compared with 1,600 before the pandemic The NHS in England will get an extra Â£5.4bn over the next six months to respond to Covid-19 and tackle the backlog caused by the pandemic, the government has announced. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the money would go ""straight to the front line"" and provide treatments people were not getting quickly enough. More than 5 million people are waiting for NHS hospital treatment in England. The rest of the UK will get an extra Â£1bn in total, ministers said. The Â£5.4bn, which is for England only,  is broken down into: Â£2.8bn for Covid-19 costs including infection control measures Â£600m for day-to-day costs Â£478m to help hospitals free up beds by discharging patients quickly and safely with community support Â£1.5bn to help hospitals recover scheduled surgery, including Â£500m of capital funding The prime minister said: ""The NHS was there for us during the pandemic but treating Covid patients has created huge backlogs."" Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the way the health service dealt with ""one of the biggest challenges in its history"" had been ""phenomenal"". This video can not be played Health Secretary Sajid Javid says there will be Â£5.4bn extra for the NHS He said the extra Â£5.4bn in England was critical to ensure the health service had what it needed to manage the ongoing pandemic and help tackle waiting lists. But he warned waiting lists would get worse before they got better as people came forward for help, adding: ""I want to reassure you the NHS is open, and we are doing what we can to support the NHS to deliver routine operations and treatment to patients across the country."" The NHS is under sustained pressure as it grapples with a huge backlog of procedures put on hold due to Covid, with hundreds of thousands of people waiting more than a year. NHS waiting lists could hit 14m in England - report NHS waiting list in England hits record 5.45 million NHS backlog could reach 13 million, says Javid Staff shortages combined with infection-control measures that mean hospitals have fewer beds at their disposal have led to calls for a long-term funding settlement. Last month, Mr Javid predicted ""a huge increase in demand"" with patients who had stayed away during lockdown returning to the health service for overdue treatment. In a report in August, the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated up to 14 million people could be on waiting lists in England by next autumn. The cash boost once again illustrates just what impact Covid has had. The NHS has already had close to an extra Â£10bn this year on top of the Â£136bn it was due to get. Ministers hope this will help the NHS get through what promises to be a difficult winter. Not only are hospitals having to cope with Covid, there are signs that the normal winter viruses will return with a bang. Last winter there was very little flu, while other viruses such as RSV, which hospitalises thousands of young children every year, were kept largely at bay by lockdowns and social distancing. The result is that people's immunity to these viruses will have waned - or for the very young not had a chance to develop at all. There is also the need to tackle the growing backlog in non-emergency care, such as knee and hip operations. The waiting list is already at record levels and the NHS still has not been able to get back to pre-pandemic levels of treatment. It is why the extra money is being welcomed but some in the NHS are still wondering whether it will be enough. NHS chief executive Amanda Pritchard said the money provided welcome certainty for the NHS, which had ""pulled out all the stops"" to restore services, while caring for thousands of seriously ill Covid patients requiring hospital treatment during the toughest summer on record. ""This additional investment will enable the NHS to deliver more checks, scans and procedures as well as helping to deal with the ongoing costs and pressures of the pandemic as the NHS heads in to winter,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âWe can be proud of our armed forces, and everything they have achieved"". Boris Johnson has promised not to abandon UK allies left behind in Afghanistan after the Taliban's rapid takeover of the country. The prime minister said the UK would do ""everything possible"" to help Afghans who worked for British forces get out safely. He told MPs 311 such Afghans eligible for relocation to the UK had not been evacuated in time. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer blamed this on the PM's ""lack of leadership"". Everyone wrong on Afghanistan - UK military chief What's life like since the Taliban took over? Afghans who worked for UK can stay permanently Sir Keir added it was a ""national disgrace"" the government does not know precisely how many British nationals are left in Afghanistan. Updating MPs as they return from their summer recess, Mr Johnson said the government's obligation towards Afghans who helped the UK would ""live on"" after the withdrawal of British troops last week. He said the UK would exert ""economic and diplomatic pressure"" on the Taliban to provide them with safe routes out of the country. Also updating MPs, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had discussed organising safe passage through Qatar and Pakistan during meetings with their leaders last week. He also said he had discussed how the UK could help organise flights from Kabul airport, where international flights have been grounded since the withdrawal of US troops at the end of August. Domestic flights have resumed at Kabul airport - but international departures are yet to restart Mr Johnson confirmed that Afghans admitted to the UK under a separate refugee scheme will be allowed to stay indefinitely. He added that the government would shortly be writing to local authorities with details of funding for accommodation and school places. Sir Keir said that local councils hoping to host Afghan refugees were still ""in the dark"" over the financial support they would receive. Adocument seen by the BBC last weekurged the Treasury to confirm extra funding before councils make offers to house refugees. It said just under Â£400m has been allocated so far to help resettle those who had fled the country, but an extra Â£557m could be needed over the next three years. Around 15,000 people eligible to come to the UK were evacuated in the final two weeks before Kabul fell to the Taliban, including 8,000 Afghans who had worked alongside British forces. But the government has admitted itcannot be precise with how many others were left behind. The government has pledged to bring 20,000 refugees to the UK in the next five years, including 5,000 in the coming year. Mr Johnson told MPs that the scheme would include those who ""face a particular risk from the Taliban,"" such as those working to improve human rights, or because of their ""gender, or sexuality or religion"". Alongside Mr Johnson, Sir Keir praised the efforts of British personnel who took part in the evacuation efforts. But he said they had been let down by ""a lack of planning"" on the part of the government, and ministers had been ""missing in action"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""We have a PM incapable of international leadership just when we needed it most."" He said in his own constituency, Afghans who had helped the UK and were eligible for relocation who applied ""weeks ago"" weren't processed quickly enough to make it to the planes. He added it was a ""familiar and desperate story"" to many MPs, who had heard similar stories.

"Spurs have removed all single-use plastics from their stadium and carbon dioxide emissions are around 50% less than in a stadium built 10 years ago Fans will be urged to travel to the stadium via bicycle or public transport and eat only vegan food when Spurs host Chelsea in the Premier League on 19 September. It is part of a plan to make the game the world's first net zero carbon fixture at elite level. The clubs are working with broadcaster Sky to cut emissions around the match. Fans will also be urged to take positive steps to reduce their own carbon footprint. Both sets of players will arrive at the stadium on coaches powered by biofuel, and will be drinking water from more sustainable cartons rather than plastic bottles. Food kiosks inside the stadium will also be offering a large selection of plant-based food options so fans can make a more sustainable choice. Fans will be encouraged to cycle to the match rather than using motor vehicles - these West Brom fans were setting an example back in 2014 'Net zero' is achieved when direct emissions associated with the match (for example, fan and employee travel, energy use of the stadium, production of food and drink) are reduced as much as possible and the remainder is 'offset' through natural projects. These can include investing in organisations that plant trees or charities that help clean oceans, or by contributing to projects exploring more ways to produce renewable energy. Earlier in 2021, Tottenham were named the Premier League's greenest club after they topped a table measuring the sustainability of all 20 top-flight sides. They recently signed up to the United Nations' Sports for Climate Action framework, which gives sports organisations a set of targets to reach to make themselves more sustainable businesses. Chairman Daniel Levy said the club was delighted to be part of ""this ground-breaking initiative that will demonstrate the role our game can play in addressing the urgent issue of climate change"". The net zero fixture is being supported by the UK government, which hosts the COP26 UN climate change conference in Glasgow in November.

"The UK records another 41,192 coronavirus cases and 45 deaths with 28 days of a positive test Many students in England and Wales have been returning to school after their summer break and a year disrupted by Covid Most restrictions for students are lifted, with face masks requirements and isolation bubbles gone Pupils, staff and parents have been telling us how they feel about the return to the classroom London Underground records its busiest morning since the first lockdown in March 2020 There were 831,000 ""taps"" into the Tube network and 860,000 taps on London buses by 10:00 BST Restrictions on indoor events and mass gatherings ease in the Republic of Ireland - with live music and dancing now back on at weddings New Zealand - with the exception of Auckland - will move to lower Covid-19 restrictions from the end of tomorrow Edited by James Clarke Thanks for joining us for live updates on coronavirus throughout the day. Your updates were written by George Bowden and Jennifer Meierhans. This page was edited by James Clarke and Paul Gribben. Have a good evening and we will be back with more updates tomorrow. We are going to be bringing our live updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's coronavirus news We told you just over an hour ago that the UK has recorded another 41,192 coronavirus cases and 45 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Trends at the moment show the numbers of cases, deaths and people in hospital are all on the up, as you can see in these charts. As university students begin the new term with many Covid restrictions lifted, there should be more in-person face-to-face teaching - but things won't be entirely normal. The government wants all students to get vaccinated but won't exclude those who aren't from going to university. All universities are urging undergraduates to get jabbed and many have on-site vaccination centres. Students are likely to be askedto wear a face covering in crowded areassuch as libraries, and will be encouraged totake regular Covid tests,even if they don't have any symptoms. Many unis are planning to hold Freshers' Week events, including club nights, sports sessions and student society fairs, for the first time since 2019. But experts have warned any sessions where people from across the country mix could become""superspreader"" events. The band will be joined by Sir Tom Jones Welsh rockers Stereophonics have announced a headline Christmas show in Cardiff with Sir Tom Jones and Catfish And The Bottlemen. Stereophonics' last shows in the city werethe final large events before Wales went into the first full national lockdown in March 2020. At the time, the Welsh government said the ""clear public health advice was that cancelling mass gatherings was not required"". But within days, all mass gatherings were banned, as coronavirus restrictions came into force. All adults attending the Christmas gig will have to provide proof of being double-vaccinated against Covid-19 and facemasks will must be worn while entering and moving around the stadium. Frontman Kelly Jones says: ""After almost two years of being locked down and families all having their own stories of stress and pressure and loss,I wanted to give something to the Welsh people to feel good about."" Covid-19 has made many of us more nervous about spreading germs. Even as we return to workplaces, or get back to networking face-to-face, will the habit, or for some - the ritual - of handing over a paper business card become a thing of the past? And what technology could fill the gap? Read morehere. Katy, aged 16, has just started her A-level courses at the
Greensward Academy in Essex so she says itâs an important year for her. She says she is âfeeling a mixture of apprehension and
excitementâ but is happy for âa sense of normalityâ. Katy thinks the easing of safety measures in schools âshould
be okâ. She says: âI personally donât mind not wearing a mask as itâs
nice to see everyoneâs mouth and nose.â She hopes her studies wonât be interrupted by any more
lockdowns. Matt Western says there should be more air ventilation filters on campuses Shadow education minister Matt Western warns of the return of ""campus chaos"" as he asks about funding for air ventilation filters to cope with coronavirus. He says: ""Here we are in September with a certain sense of 'Groundhog Day' with campus chaos set to return caused by the actions or inaction of this government. ""In November last year Sage published a report showing Covid outbreaks could be reduced on campus through the provision of air ventilation filters. Whilst the Welsh Labour government has committed funding for these machines, the UK Government has not."" He asks: ""So why hasn't the UK Government provided funding to make our campuses safe?"" Education secretary Gavin Williamson replies: ""(Western) seems to have missed quite a significant point and a difference between this year and last year and of course we've had one of the most successful vaccine programmes rolled out anywhere in Europe where we were one of the first countries to be able to offer people not just one vaccine, but two and making sure that the adult population have it available. ""That is the big difference from this year to last year."" James has just started his final GCSE year All day we've been bringing you the views of pupils, teachers and parents on the return to school, which has been today for millions of students in England and Wales. James is starting his final year of GCSE studies at Greensward Academy in Essex. âWhile itâs good to be back in school, itâs
obviously quite nerve-wracking as Covid is still out there and the pressure of
GCSEs,â the 15-year-old says. âAt the end of the day, weâve already had nearly
18 months of disrupted learning and any more would be too stressful due to
exams.â James has already been vaccinated once as his mum is
immunosuppressed. He thinks it would be good for other young people to be
vaccinated to provide an extra layer of protection, although he says itâs best
for the experts to decide. How are pupils being kept Covid-safe? Care home staff are facing a lack of clarity from the government over itsmandatory vaccination policy, England's largest membership body for independent adult social care providers says. The government says from 11 November, all staff in registered care homes in England must be vaccinated against Covid-19 if they are to continue working, unless they are medically exempt. This means staff must get their first dose by 16 September - a week on Thursday. With less than a fortnight to go, Care England tells PA news agency there is no sign of promised guidance concerning those who are exempt. PA says it understands the guidance and consultation will be published shortly, ahead of 16 September. The Scottish public has been warned against the abuse of staff in businesses and on public transport enforcing mask-wearing policies. In an attempt to stop the spread of Covid-19, face coverings have continued to be mandatory in some indoor spaces and on public transport. But Scotland's Justice Secretary Keith Brown has warned against abuse, threats and even violence directed at staff trying to enforce the rules. He said such attacks were ""completely unacceptable"", as new rules to protect retail workers, in particular, came into force last month. It is not clear if attacks on staff have increased in recent weeks, prompting the justice secretary's intervention. ""I would like to thank the vast majority of people who continue to wear face coverings and urge people to please follow the rules and guidelines still in place,"" he said. Read the latest rules and guidance on face coveringshere. Karen Rees-Unwin runs a uniform exchange at the Big Local Hub
in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester She is also a mother to two children aged 10 and 14, and feels âquite confidentâ about pupils returning to school. âItâs important they return, not just from an education
perspective but they also need their social lives. ""They learn so much from each
other and I think the schools have had enough experience now and are sensible enough to keep them safe.â A total of 91,725,196 vaccinations have been given in the UK,according to the latest government data.,external That's 48,270,113 first doses and 43,455,083 second doses. It means 88.8% of people in the UK aged 16 and over have had one jab and 79.9% have had two jabs. The UK has recorded 41,192 new coronavirus cases,according to the daily figures from the government.,external A further 45 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have also been registered. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) has
announced that in two weeksâ time, high school students will be the first group
of people on the island to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The first
batch of Pfizer vaccines arrived in Taiwan last week, and the CECC has
confirmed that from 23 September, this vaccinewill be rolled out in schools,external.
No other vaccine is currently available to minors on the island, but Modernamay also soon become available to Taiwan teenagers,external. Taiwanâs Central News Agency says that senior high
school students will be first in line to receive Pfizer, and once they are all
vaccinated, the jab will be made available to junior high school students, i.e.
those as young as 12. TheTaiwan News Website says,externalthat
priority for Pfizer will then be given to âyoung people between the ages of 18
and 22â. Pfizer will be the fourth vaccine to arrive in
Taiwan. People over 18 can currently choose between Moderna, AstraZeneca or the
locally-developed Medigen vaccine. Pfizer was scheduled to arrive months
earlier, but Taiwanâs government has accused Beijing of blocking its arrival. Roughly
44% of Taiwanâs 23.5m population haveso far received one vaccine dose,external. Coronavirus ""will cast a long shadow over the NHS for many years to come"" and clearing the backlog could cost almost Â£17bn, an independent health charity says. The Health Foundation also warns better staffing levels will be needed, as well as investment to return to the 18-week waiting time standard. The organisation highlights two options for the UK Government - clearing the backlog over the course of this parliament, which it says will require boosting staffing levels and capacity, or tackling the waiting list over a longer period. Anita Charlesworth, the Health Foundation's director of research and Real Centre, says: ""Managing the costs of Covid could be as much as tackling the waiting list backlog. The government must resist the temptation to pick and mix funding for Covid and for the backlog - patients need both."" Last week, a joint report from NHS Providers and the NHS Confederation said the health service budget must increase by about Â£10bn next year and claimed anything less could see trusts forced to cut services. Copley Academy in Stalybridge has been staggering testing for students ahead of a return to the classroom. Years 8 and 9 are being tested today, with all students back in class tomorrow. Principal Ruth Craven says there are âanxious times ahead with the transmission rates as they are currentlyâ. She thinks school leaders need to be empowered to be able to adapt their
contingency plans quickly if there is a Covid outbreak in the future. ""Thatâs quite important for us, to make sure that weâre kept safe in
the school if the transmission rates do increase at such a pace.â  Europe's medicines regulator has said it is evaluating data on a booster dose for the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNTech. It would be
given six months after the second dose in people aged 16 years
and older, Reuters news agency reports. The European Medicines Agency says it will carry out a
speedy evaluation of the data, with an outcome expected ""within
the next few weeks"". It adds it is also assessing
data on the use of an additional dose of mRNA vaccines in people
with weak immune systems. Miles and Ella are two of the pupils heading back into class at Ringmer Primary and Nursery School in East Sussex today.  Ella, who is in Year Two, says she feels happy, ""because we donât have bubbles anymore
so we can play with whoever we want to"". And Miles, who is in Year Five, says: ""Iâm so glad to be back - over the moon - such a lovely feeling,
like youâre free and not having to listen to restrictions. ""And you are told you
are allowed to do this and that because things have changed and will hopefully
stay that way."" But he adds: ""I feel a bit anxious about what will happen if Covid comes back
again."" Boris Johnson will unveil his long-term plans for social care and the NHS as early as Tuesday, as the health service battles to sort a mounting backlog blamed on the pandemic. An extra Â£5.5bn for the NHS is also expected to be announced. A senior government figure says the money will help tackle the backlog following the Covid pandemic, as well as upcoming winter pressures, ahead of new funding beginning in April. Organisations representing the NHS have warnedservices may have to be cut unless NHS England receives an extra Â£10bn in fundingnext year.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âWe can be proud of our armed forces, and everything they have achieved"". Boris Johnson has promised not to abandon UK allies left behind in Afghanistan after the Taliban's rapid takeover of the country. The prime minister said the UK would do ""everything possible"" to help Afghans who worked for British forces get out safely. He told MPs 311 such Afghans eligible for relocation to the UK had not been evacuated in time. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer blamed this on the PM's ""lack of leadership"". Everyone wrong on Afghanistan - UK military chief What's life like since the Taliban took over? Afghans who worked for UK can stay permanently Sir Keir added it was a ""national disgrace"" the government does not know precisely how many British nationals are left in Afghanistan. Updating MPs as they return from their summer recess, Mr Johnson said the government's obligation towards Afghans who helped the UK would ""live on"" after the withdrawal of British troops last week. He said the UK would exert ""economic and diplomatic pressure"" on the Taliban to provide them with safe routes out of the country. Also updating MPs, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had discussed organising safe passage through Qatar and Pakistan during meetings with their leaders last week. He also said he had discussed how the UK could help organise flights from Kabul airport, where international flights have been grounded since the withdrawal of US troops at the end of August. Domestic flights have resumed at Kabul airport - but international departures are yet to restart Mr Johnson confirmed that Afghans admitted to the UK under a separate refugee scheme will be allowed to stay indefinitely. He added that the government would shortly be writing to local authorities with details of funding for accommodation and school places. Sir Keir said that local councils hoping to host Afghan refugees were still ""in the dark"" over the financial support they would receive. Adocument seen by the BBC last weekurged the Treasury to confirm extra funding before councils make offers to house refugees. It said just under Â£400m has been allocated so far to help resettle those who had fled the country, but an extra Â£557m could be needed over the next three years. Around 15,000 people eligible to come to the UK were evacuated in the final two weeks before Kabul fell to the Taliban, including 8,000 Afghans who had worked alongside British forces. But the government has admitted itcannot be precise with how many others were left behind. The government has pledged to bring 20,000 refugees to the UK in the next five years, including 5,000 in the coming year. Mr Johnson told MPs that the scheme would include those who ""face a particular risk from the Taliban,"" such as those working to improve human rights, or because of their ""gender, or sexuality or religion"". Alongside Mr Johnson, Sir Keir praised the efforts of British personnel who took part in the evacuation efforts. But he said they had been let down by ""a lack of planning"" on the part of the government, and ministers had been ""missing in action"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""We have a PM incapable of international leadership just when we needed it most."" He said in his own constituency, Afghans who had helped the UK and were eligible for relocation who applied ""weeks ago"" weren't processed quickly enough to make it to the planes. He added it was a ""familiar and desperate story"" to many MPs, who had heard similar stories. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said there was ""barely an MP"" who had not contacted the government on behalf of UK and Afghan nationals ""desperate to find safe passage away from the Taliban"". The prime minister said thousands of the MPs' emails had been answered, and ""every single one"" will receive a reply by the end of Monday.

"A street vendor in Herat, Afghanistan's third-largest city, which was seized by the Taliban earlier this month. What is life like for those left behind when the last foreign troops flew out of Afghanistan? Four people from cities and provinces around the country told the BBC they had lost basic freedoms and were struggling to survive. Some names have been changed to protect contributors' safety. Mazar-i-Sharif is a large city and major economic hubin the north of Afghanistan,close to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Once a government stronghold, it fell to the Taliban on14August. A view of a closed market in Mazar-i-Sharif, the provincial capital of Balkh province, Afghanistan Majib used to work in a restaurant. Now he's struggling to find food. In a video call from Mazar-i-Sharif, he pointed to the dirty floor of an abandoned building where a few blankets were piled - for now it is his new home. Majib arrived in the city just a few weeks ago, one of more than half a million Afghans displaced this year by the conflict between the Taliban and recently-ousted government forces. His father was killed by the Taliban more than 10 years ago, he said. A decade on and he's ""scared to go outside"" because ""they're beating people up every day"". Footage from Mazar-i-Sharif last week showed dozens of Afghans carrying suitcases and clutching plastic bags as they boarded buses to the capital, Kabul, in the hope of trying to leave. But in the past few days, since US forces departed, more people have been arriving from in Mazar-i-Sharif from Kabul, Majib said - trying to make their way to the border with Uzbekistan as a way out. Majib is also desperate to escape, but doesn't know if he will make it. ""The Taliban are here and they don't want people to leave the country,"" he said. LashkarGah, Helmand Province Helmand Province in the south, where British troops were stationed during the conflict, was seized by the Taliban on 13 August. The provincial capital Lashkar Gah saw some of the heaviest fighting in the weeks preceding. Women and children at a mobile clinic in Lashkar Gah in March 2021 Pinned to the noticeboard of Dr Viktor Urosevic's office are small plastic bags containing bullets. ""We call it our wall of shame,"" he said, as he removed one to hold up to the camera in a video interview. Most of them were large calibre rounds which he had removed from young patients, he said. Dr Urosevic works at a trauma hospital in Lashkar Gah. Now that the fighting has ended, the wards are no longer packed like they were just weeks ago. The bombs and bullets have stopped and the streets outside are calm. ""It's very strange, I've been here for a few years, but it's never been so quiet,"" he said. ""I'm seeing it as the silence before the storm, I hope I'm wrong, but let's see."" Many buildings were damaged or destroyed in bombings in Lashkar Gah and families who fled during the conflict have come back to find their homes in ruins, Dr Urosevic said. ""They're sleeping in front of the mosque, they're sleeping in the streets,"" he said. ""They don't have the funding to rebuild their homes so a lot of them have ended up being homeless or forced to stay with their relatives."" He said a lot of families in the area were living in poverty, struggling to get a meal during the day. With banks closed for many days, a lack of access to cash has exacerbated the problem. Many foreign aid workers who would be distributing this kind of aid left the country as the Taliban took charge. Dr Urosevic, from Serbia, is among those who decided to stay behind. ""We have a responsibility, we are the only trauma centre in the province,"" he said. ""People need food, they need money, they need medicines."" Badakhshan One of Afghanistan's poorest provinces, Badakhshan,in the northeast of the country, borders Tajikistan. The Taliban took control of its provincial capital on11August. Displaced people in Badakshan back in May 2018. People in the province have been uprooted for years by the conflict. Abdul is a doctor in Badakhshan. He was a student the last time the Taliban ran the country. ""The situation at that time was very bad and their behaviour is the same as they were in the past,"" he said. ""I don't see any changes."" Abdul sent the BBC several pictures from a hospital in the area which is now guarded by the Taliban. In one, an 18-month-old boy lies emaciated on a bed, as his mother begs for staff to save him. According to Abdul, she could not afford to feed him. ""Day by day, more children are becoming malnourished,"" he said. According to the UN, more than half of the children under five in Afghanistan are expected to be acutely malnourished in the next year. Poverty was already a reality for many in this province, but food and fuel prices have risen since the Taliban took charge and government employees have lost their jobs. Some are still waiting to be paid for the last few months. Abdul also fears for women's rights in the province. While female medical staff have been allowed to work, he said many other women weren't being allowed to continue with their jobs and were left wondering what lies ahead. Girls above Class 6 - above UK secondary school age - were no longer being allowed to go to school, Abdul said. ""People don't have any hope for their future,"" he said. ""There is no opportunity for people in Badakhshan."" Herat,aSilk Road city close to the border with Iran, was seen as one of Afghanistan's most liberal.The day after US troops left, hundreds of Taliban supporters filled the streets. Others stayed home in fear. A Taliban figher on patrol in Herat, which was seized by the group on 11 August. Gul had just come back from the market when he spoke to the BBC. ""All over the bazaar, the Taliban are standing with their guns,"" he said. ""You don't see many rich people or women and girls on the street now because they're all afraid of the Taliban."" Gul's wife Afsoon now can't leave the house without taking a male escort and she has to wear a burqua covering her face. ""The future for my daughter is unclear,"" she said. And Gul's sister, a doctor, was told to stay away from her clinic for a few weeks, he said, even after Taliban leaders told women in the medical profession they could return to work. Days later she was able to return alongside other women, Gul said. But many other women were still at home, he said, unsure if they can resume the careers they had worked for. Gul and his family are still hoping to leave Afghanistan. ""We will go anywhere,"" he said. ""America, Germany, France. Anywhere.""

"The protocol prevents a hard border with Ireland but some products need to be checked as they arrive from GB The UK government has announced further delays to some Irish Sea border checks. The checks are a requirement of the Northern Ireland Protocol, a deal reached by the UK and EU in 2019. It means some products need to be checked as they arrive from GB but grace periods mean that not all the checks have been implemented. Some of these grace periods were due to expire at the end of September but the government has now indefinitely extended them. In a written statement, Brexit Minister Lord Frost said that the move was necessary to ""provide space for further potential discussions"" with the EU. The UK wants a fundamental renegotiation of the protocol but the EU has said that is not possible, although it is prepared to consider additional flexibilities. Lord Frost said it was a necessary move Lord Frost's statement said: ""The government will continue to operate the protocol on the current basis. ""This includes the grace periods and easements currently in force. Operational and other guidance will be updated to reflect this approach."" In a statement on Monday evening the European Commission said it noted Lord Frost's statement and continued to stress that ""the Withdrawal Agreement is an international agreement"". ""The Protocol is an integral part of the Withdrawal Agreement and the agreed solution between the UK and the EU to the problems caused by Brexit for the island of Ireland,"" it said. ""Both sides are legally bound to fulfil their obligations under the Agreement. ""Our focus remains on identifying long-term, flexible and practical solutions to address issues related to the practical implementation of the Protocol that citizens and businesses in Northern Ireland are experiencing."" The European Commission said it would not agree to a renegotiation of the Protocol. ""Our approach to the Protocol is based on the achievement of stability, certainty and predictability in line with the objectives of the Good Friday Agreement and in order to protect the Single Market,"" it added. Unionists say the protocol damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK The Northern Ireland Retail Consortium has said that there can be no more ""cliff-edge dates"" when it comes to the protocol. AodhÃ¡n Connolly, the organisation's director, said he hoped the UK government's decision ""will be taken in the spirit of joint working"" and that ""both sides must move"". ""This cannot be another can-kicking exercise. Northern Ireland is in a unique situation which requires a unique solution that is agreed by both the UK and EU,"" Mr Connolly said. In March, the UK unilaterally extended some grace periods. That met with a furious response from the EU, which said that by acting alone the UK was in clear breach of the protocol. The European Commissionbegan a legal action against the UK, which is still continuing. However in June, the UK formally requested an extension to the sausages grace period which was granted by the EU. The EU said it was being ""accommodating' and the UK described the move as ""sensible"". What next for the Northern Ireland Protocol? Cold mistrust if protocol swept away - Lord Frost The UK wants a ""standstill"" of all grace periods and legal actions as it attempts to persuade the EU to engage in a fundamental renegotiation of the protocol. The EU says it will be as flexible as possible within the terms of the protocol but will not renegotiate.

"Jean-Paul Belmondo's battered face, laconic style and roguish smile captured the imagination of French 1960s youth. Belmondo, who has died at his Paris home aged 88, was the cool rebel of the new wave of French cinema typified in Jean-Luc Godard's 1960 film classic, A Bout de Souffle. His moody performance as a doomed thief and Humphrey Bogart fan struck a chord  and saw him dubbed the Gallic James Dean. Later, he forsook arts cinema to become a highly bankable commercial actor, as at home in comedy as in drama. Jean-Paul Belmondo was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris on 9 Apr  1933, the son of Paul Belmondo, a sculptor whose statues grace many a Parisian park. The intensely Bohemian atmosphere of his upbringing had a formative effect on him. He failed at school and became an amateur boxer. In his short-lived career, he won 15 of his 23 bouts before giving up to concentrate on acting. A Bout de Souffle was his first starring role His trademark bumpy nose, however, was a result of a fight in the school playground rather than the ring. After performing on stage in provincial theatres, his movie break came with the role of Laszlo in Marcel CarnÃ©'s 1958 film Les Tricheurs. On the strength of his forceful portrayal, he was given his first starring role in A Bout de Souffle. One critic described him as ""a bewitchingly ugly man."" His cult image carried him through several action films such as Les Distractions and La Novice. Determined not to be stereotyped, Belmondo also accepted more demanding roles such as the idealistic intellectual of Vittorio de Sica's La Ciociara in 1961, and as the young country priest in Philippe de Broca's swashbuckling Cartouche the following year. He also enjoyed comic roles, in Godard's Une Femme est une Femme, and, particularly, in De Broca's L'Homme de Rio, in which he played a suave, unflappable secret agent. By the mid-60s, he had switched completely to the commercial mainstream and formed his own production company, Cerito. He relished his role as an elder statesman of French cinema He even performed his own stunts in such films as Les Tribulations d'Un Chinois en Chine in 1965, though he gave this practice up after an accident in the 1985 film Hold-up. He brightened many an all-star cast in international productions such as Is Paris Burning? (1966), the James Bond spoof Casino Royale (1967) and with Alain Delon in the gangster movie Borsalino (1970), He moved away from action movies claiming that ""I don't want to be a flying grandpa of the French cinema."" In 1987 Belmondo returned to the stage for the first time for nearly 30 years and divided his work between theatre and film for the rest of his career. Two years later he won a Cesar, the French equivalent of an Oscar, for his performance in Itineraire d'un Enfant Gate. He branched out creatively as part of the ensemble in Varda's homage to international cinema Les Cent et une Nuits de Samon Cinema in 1995 and as the Jean Valjean figure in Claude Lelouche's  re-working of Les Miserables in the same year. Jean-Paul Belmondo was divorced from his first wife Elodie in 1965. His second marriage to Constantin also failed. He later had long relationships with actresses Ursula Andress and Laura Antonelli. Cinema audiences at home and abroad were drawn to his charm and seeming disregard for whatever absurdities were taking place on screen. He was chosen by Empire magazine as one of the 100 Sexiest Stars in film history.

"Anthony 'AJ' Elfalak was missing for four days when spotted by a helicopter A three-year-old boy who went missing in the Australian bush four days ago has been found safe after a search. Anthony ""AJ"" Elfalak was spotted by police helicopters on Monday, drinking water from a creek on his family's property in rural New South Wales. The little boy, who has autism and doesn't speak, had been last seen at the house on Friday. His family had feared that he had been abducted. But rescuers found AJ on a riverbank about 500m from his house on the vast property in Putty, in the state's north. In footage shared by New South Wales Police, rescuers can be heard saying ""I've got the boy"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Authorities said AJ had suffered a few scrapes to his lower legs and was found drenched in wet clothes, but was otherwise in good health. His father, Anthony Elfalak, called it a ""miracle"". More than 100 officers and volunteers spent days scouring the bush for his son. They had earlier passed over the area where he was ultimately found. ""He has been bitten by ants and he has fallen over but he is alive. He is alive,"" a jubilant Mr Elfalak told television crews. ""I know I was acting frantic, but no-one can understand what it's like going through what we went through. I feel incredible. ""My leg, my hips, my ankles, I can't walk. I have been in the bush for four days with no sleep. We didn't stop."" Local media showed scenes of family members cheering and rejoicing when they heard the good news. Prime Minister Scott Morrison also expressed relief,tweeting that he was ""glad to hear he's safe"".,external ""I can't imagine how traumatic this experience has been for AJ and his parents,"" he said. It's unclear why the boy had wandered off, his parents said. AJ had been playing with his brothers in the morning on Friday, and usually stuck close to his mother. Police seized a white vehicle on Sunday, in the belief that they were investigating a kidnapping case.

"The storage limit for eggs, sperm and embryos would be increased from 10 years to 55 years under government plans Storage limits for eggs, sperm and embryos will go up to 55 years under government plans that ministers say will give people greater choice over when to start a family. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the current limit of 10 years was ""severely restrictive."" Modern freezing techniques mean eggs can be stored indefinitely without deterioration, research from the Royal College of Obstetricians has suggested. The plans need parliamentary approval. The Department for Health said there would be extra conditions around third party donors and use of a person's frozen cells after they have died. Currently, when the 10 years is up, prospective parents must decide whether to undergo fertility treatment or have the cells destroyed, unless samples have been stored due to medical procedures, such as chemotherapy for cancer. Under the new system, they would be given the option to keep or dispose of the frozen cells or embryos at 10-year intervals. Women's frozen eggs 'should be stored for longer' Egg-freezing: What's the success rate? Egg freezing in your 40s 'not sensible' Mr Javid said: ""This new legislation will help turn off the ticking clock in the back of people's minds."" He added: ""By making these changes, we are going to take a huge step forwards - not just for giving people greater freedom over their fertility, but for equality too."" British Fertility Society chairman Dr Raj Mathur welcomed the plans. He said extending the time limit ""protects the ability of all our patients to make reproductive choices for themselves as individuals and couples."" Julia Chain, chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, said the earlier a woman froze her eggs the better the chance of a successful IVF pregnancy later. She said: ""This will give women a lot more choice and flexibility about when they can start having their families."" What is egg, sperm and embryo freezing? It is a way of preserving fertility by collecting eggs, sperm or embryos and storing them so it may be possible to have a baby at a later date. The process involves collecting around 15 eggs through IVF, cooling them quickly then storing them in tanks of liquid nitrogen. The eggs are then thawed when needed, and those that have survived intact will be injected with sperm. Sperm samples are usually divided between a number of containers called straws before freezing so they can be used in multiple treatments. Embryos are frozen during fertility treatment in case the first round is not successful or to try for a sibling.

They include: Change in size or feel of the breast Changes in the skin of the breast, such as dimpling or redness Fluid leaking from the nipple, outside of pregnancy or breast feeding Change in position of the nipple These symptoms can be caused by other conditions, so it is important to get any lumps or changes checked by a doctor. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with women over 50 more at risk than the under-40s. But there are many other factors that can increase a person's risk, including a family history of cancer and being overweight. Many treatments are available for breast cancer and survival is generally good if the disease is detected early.

"The storage limit for eggs, sperm and embryos would be increased from 10 years to 55 years under government plans Storage limits for eggs, sperm and embryos will go up to 55 years under government plans that ministers say will give people greater choice over when to start a family. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the current limit of 10 years was ""severely restrictive."" Modern freezing techniques mean eggs can be stored indefinitely without deterioration, research from the Royal College of Obstetricians has suggested. The plans need parliamentary approval. The Department for Health said there would be extra conditions around third party donors and use of a person's frozen cells after they have died. Currently, when the 10 years is up, prospective parents must decide whether to undergo fertility treatment or have the cells destroyed, unless samples have been stored due to medical procedures, such as chemotherapy for cancer. Under the new system, they would be given the option to keep or dispose of the frozen cells or embryos at 10-year intervals. Women's frozen eggs 'should be stored for longer' Egg-freezing: What's the success rate? Egg freezing in your 40s 'not sensible' Mr Javid said: ""This new legislation will help turn off the ticking clock in the back of people's minds."" He added: ""By making these changes, we are going to take a huge step forwards - not just for giving people greater freedom over their fertility, but for equality too."" British Fertility Society chairman Dr Raj Mathur welcomed the plans. He said extending the time limit ""protects the ability of all our patients to make reproductive choices for themselves as individuals and couples."" Julia Chain, chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, said the earlier a woman froze her eggs the better the chance of a successful IVF pregnancy later. She said: ""This will give women a lot more choice and flexibility about when they can start having their families."" What is egg, sperm and embryo freezing? It is a way of preserving fertility by collecting eggs, sperm or embryos and storing them so it may be possible to have a baby at a later date. The process involves collecting around 15 eggs through IVF, cooling them quickly then storing them in tanks of liquid nitrogen. The eggs are then thawed when needed, and those that have survived intact will be injected with sperm. Sperm samples are usually divided between a number of containers called straws before freezing so they can be used in multiple treatments. Embryos are frozen during fertility treatment in case the first round is not successful or to try for a sibling. They can be frozen when they're just a single cell, at the two to eight cell stage or later in their development. Source:HFEA,external Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"Ruth James hopes one day to be able to marry Hannah Burch in church Same-sex couples can now have their marriage blessed by the Church in Wales after a vote was held. However, the church will still not marry same-sex couples. Former Dean of St Albans, the Very Reverend Jeffrey John, supported the change but described it as a ""halfway house"" that did not go far enough. The Evangelical Fellowship opposed the move, saying it did not uphold the ""standard of Christian marriage between one man and one woman"". But Wales' bishops said it was a step on the way towards repentance of a history which has ""demonised and persecuted gay and lesbian people"". Individual clergy will be able to opt out of offering blessings to same-sex couples and some conservatives said the change would cause a split. The bill authorising a service of blessing was passed by all three orders of the church's governing body at a meeting in Newport. The bishops passed it unanimously, the clergy passed it by 28 to 12, with two abstentions, and the laity passed it by 49 to 10, with one abstention. The change is significant because a blessing, in theological terms, signifies God's approval. Bishop of St Asaph, Gregory Cameron, who introduced the bill, said he felt ""no sense of triumph"", but added that ""the Church in Wales has done the right thing under God for the LGBTQIA+ community"". Ruth Eleri James has both a personal and professional interest in the vote. As a woman in a same-sex relationship, she said she supported giving recognition to relationships like hers as a means of showing their validity in the wider community. She is also a trainee priest with the Church in Wales. The church will now bless same-sex couples, but will not grant them the right to marry Although unable to vote on the proposed change because of her junior status, she said she would back the bill all the way if she were able to, as has her partner Hannah, a lay member of the governing body. She said: ""It's so important to us because it will reflect the real love and welcome that we have personally experienced in our local churches, who we know long to be able to offer something to couples who are in same-sex relationships. ""But it's also important because this is a message to LGBTQ folk in society at large to say their relationships are loved and blessed by God, and that's a message that hasn't been given, certainly in my lifetime, and I long to be able to share that with people."" Ruth said she saw the contradiction expressed by other people in the LGBT community that the church would still not offer full marriage even as it blesses legal unions formed outside of its walls. ""Hannah and I feel strongly that God is asking us to be married one day and we will continue to hope and work and pray for the day when we can have what we call the sacrament of marriage in a church,"" she added. ""I do see the difficulty in not being able to have that and I do see the point of people who say this doesn't go far enough. But I think a step towards justice is a step in the right direction."" The Church in Wales has voted to allow blessings for gay couples However her feelings are not shared by all. Her fellow believer, Niki Stark Devlin, said lots of the LGBT community was ""very likely"" to avoid the blessings, calling the offer ""placatory"" and ""meaningless"". She added: ""It also will set back actual equal marriage back by a long way as many of the heterosexual community will now feel that they've 'made a gesture' and that should be sufficient. ""I can not see many wanting a 'blessing' if they can instead move to either Quakerism [her religion] or the United Reformed Church and have an actual marriage in the eyes of God."" Provision explored for same sex couples Same-sex blessings considered by Church in Wales 'When I joined the army it was illegal to be gay' Blessings will now be available after an official marriage or civil partnership at a register office, but it will be up to individual clergy to decide whether or not they wish to lead it. The bishops who proposed the bill said the church had forced gay people ""into fear, dishonesty and sometimes even hypocrisy, and which has precluded them from living public and honest lives of committed partnership"". Jeffrey John was made Dean of St Albans in 2004 But Dr John, originally from Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf, said there remained a big difference between the official stance of the church and the opinion of its congregation. ""Officially the church still says marriage is to be between a man and wife, but it is obvious that the views of church members have changed rapidly in recent years - especially after the government has legalised same-sex marriage,"" he said. ""The most important thing about the blessing service is its theological meaning. The blessing by the church defines a gay relationship as a gift from God rather than a sin."" Dr Johnaccused the church of homophobia in 2017 when he was rejectedfor the position of Bishop of Llandaff - a claim it rejected. He said he had been told appointing him would be difficult because he was in a civil partnership, although celibate, in line with Church of England teaching. The Church in Wales does not require gay clergy to be celibate. In 2003 he was nominated as Bishop of Reading but then asked to withdraw by the Archbishop of Canterbury. ""The Anglican Church in Scotland has already voted to go all the way - they marry gay couples without a difference,"" he said. ""In Wales, only a blessing will be available, so the inequality between gay couples and straight couples will remain."" In 2019, thechurch elected Cherry Vann, who was in a civil partnership, as Bishop of Monmouth. The Church of England does not currently recognise same-sex marriages, forbids clergy to bless same-sex unions and only allows celibate gay and lesbian clergy to minister. The Scottish Episcopal Church voted to allow gay couples to marry in church in 2017, making it the first major Christian church in the UK to allow same-sex marriages. According to the website of the Church of Scotland, it does not currently allow gay marriage. The first same-sex religious wedding in Northern Ireland took place in December after changes in the law were introduced by the Northern Ireland Office. The Reverend Josh Maynard, of Angle Peninsula Churches in Pembrokeshire, sits on the Church's governing body but was unable to attend the meeting. Were he able to attend, he would have voted against the proposals. ""I'm quite anxious about it,"" he said ahead of the decision. ""It is a significant vote for the Church in Wales, it will be the first major change in the teaching of the Church in Wales."" He feared it could lead to a split in the Church. ""It is a serious decision that will likely lead to fractures at best if not a complete split,"" he said. He worried there will be hurt on both sides ""whichever way it goes"". ""What's important is that those on both sides of the debate engage with and listen to what is being said."" He said voting against the proposals did not make people homophobic. ""If you are LGBT you are welcome in any of my churches,"" he said. The Evangelical Fellowship in the Church in Wales said it did not support the bill on the basis of a declaration it made in 2018. Made at its annual general meeting that year, it said: ""We acknowledge God's creation of humankind as male and female and the unchangeable standard of Christian marriage between one man and one woman as the proper place for sexual intimacy and the basis of the family. ""We repent of our failures to maintain this standard and call for a renewed commitment to lifelong fidelity in marriage and abstinence for those who are not married."" Reverend Enid Morgan compared changing attitudes to debates over ordaining women The Reverend Enid Morgan, one of the first women to be ordained as a priest in Wales, said the move would be a significant step for gay Christians. ""These are people who love each other and want God's blessing and the recognition of the church that their relationship is a valuable human relationship,"" she said. ""Everyone will not be happy, but people 20 years ago were unhappy to ordain women. People 20 years before that had terrible concerns about divorce.""

He added: ""By making these changes, we are going to take a huge step forwards - not just for giving people greater freedom over their fertility, but for equality too."" British Fertility Society chairman Dr Raj Mathur welcomed the plans. He said extending the time limit ""protects the ability of all our patients to make reproductive choices for themselves as individuals and couples."" Julia Chain, chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, said the earlier a woman froze her eggs the better the chance of a successful IVF pregnancy later. She said: ""This will give women a lot more choice and flexibility about when they can start having their families."" What is egg, sperm and embryo freezing? It is a way of preserving fertility by collecting eggs, sperm or embryos and storing them so it may be possible to have a baby at a later date. The process involves collecting around 15 eggs through IVF, cooling them quickly then storing them in tanks of liquid nitrogen. The eggs are then thawed when needed, and those that have survived intact will be injected with sperm. Sperm samples are usually divided between a number of containers called straws before freezing so they can be used in multiple treatments. Embryos are frozen during fertility treatment in case the first round is not successful or to try for a sibling. They can be frozen when they're just a single cell, at the two to eight cell stage or later in their development. Source:HFEA,external Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"The shortage of workers that is affecting supply chains across Britain could last for up to two years, according to the business body, the Confederation of British Industry. Industries from pig farming to fast food have said the lack of skilled staff is disrupting their business. The CBI said the shortages would harm the UK's economic recovery. It said the government should adopt a more flexible policy on immigration to tackle the problem. The disruption has already prompted firms, including McDonald's, Wetherspoons, Ikea and supermarket Iceland, to say they are falling short of some supplies. Some firms told the CBI they thought it would take two years for the shortages to be eliminated. ""The CBI hasâ¯heard from companiesâ¯actively cutting capacityâ¯because they can't meet demand,â¯likeâ¯the hoteliers limiting the number of bookable rooms because they don't have enough housekeeping staff and can't get linen laundered,"" said CBI director general Tony Danker. ""Meanwhile some restaurant owners have had to choose between lunchtime and evening services when trying to make the most of summer."" The problems have been blamed on the furlough scheme keeping some staff out of circulation, the pandemic more broadly, and EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit. Food production in the UK at risk, warns industry Driver shortage: 'I got a big pay rise overnight' How serious is the HGV driver shortage? The CBI said the list of ""shortage occupations"" which determines whether overseas workers are granted work visas should be widened to include HGV drivers and other areas where its members had identified shortages, including welders, butchers and bricklayers. ""The government promised an immigration system that would focus on the skills we need rather than unrestrained access to overseas labour,"" said Mr Danker. ""Yet here we have obvious and short-term skilled need but a system that can't seem to respond."" The CBI said members also cited shortages of fruit and flower pickers, food and meat processing operatives, livestock and arable workers, factory assembly workers, scaffolders, carpenters, chefs, cleaners and housekeepers. However the Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has previously rejected calls to loosen immigration rules, and suggested firms should hire and train UK workers to fill the gaps in road haulage. He said he wanted to see firms making long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce instead of relying on labour from abroad. Bricklayers are in short supply, the CBI says The CBI said it welcomed the government's plans to ""build a more innovative economy"" but that it would take time. It said the economy would need short-term ""fixes"" as well as long-term strategies to resolve the current supply problems, particularly in the run-up to Christmas. ""The government's ambition that the UK economy should become more high-skilled and productive is right. But implying that this can be achieved overnight is simply wrong. And a refusal to deploy temporary and targeted interventions to enable economic recovery is self-defeating. The end of the job retention, or furlough, scheme later this month, would bring more people back into the labour market, the CBI said. However, it added that this was unlikely to resolve the problems firms were experiencing because most of those on furlough already had jobs to return to, or were in narrowly-focused geographic areas, such as around airports. ""Furlough ending is not the panacea some people think will magically fill labour supply gaps,"" said Mr Danker.

"Boris Johnson will unveil his long-term plans for social care and the NHS as early as Tuesday, amid rows over how to pay for multi-billion pound funding. The PM said he had a plan to reform social care when he took power in 2019 but has yet to announce the detail. Reports of an increase in National Insurance to cover the cost -which would break his commitment not to raise taxes- has angered Tory MPs. The NHS in England will getan extra Â£5.4bnover the next six months. The prime minister said the money would ""go straight to the front line"" to help ""bust the Covid backlogs"". Organisations representing the NHS have warnedservices may have to be cut unless NHS England receives an extra Â£10bn in fundingnext year. What would a National Insurance rise mean for me? The nine problems facing social care right now Social care shake-up plans expected this week Meetings to discuss the social care plan for England have been taking place between the PM, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid across the weekend, according to government sources. But while a deal is said to be ""close"", Laura Kuenssberg said it ""sounded like haggling was still going on"" over how to solve the funding issue. And she said a delay in reaching an agreement had ""created plenty of space for a backlash before the details have even emerged"". The rumoured increase in National Insurance - which has only been raised twice in the past 20 years - has particularly angered some Conservative MPs, with one cabinet minister telling the BBC: ""It is the wrong thing to do, and the wrong way to go about it"". Former minister and Tory MP Jake Berry also said it would not be a ""fair and equitable way"" to secure the money. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the rise would disproportionately affect working people ""on lower wages than many others in the country"", who would end up ""paying tax to support people to keep hold of their houses in other parts of the country where house prices may be much higher"".

NHS waiting list in England hits record 5.45 million Why workers face the bill for care revolution But it is widely accepted that major changes are needed to social care - which helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and medication - due an to ageing population and failures to address issues in the past. Defence Minister James Heappey said too many governments had ""ducked the opportunity"" to fix the system, leading to the ""social contract in the UK to be broken"". He told BBC Breakfast: ""The social contract is that whilst you are of working age, you pay your taxes to pay for those who aren't working in anticipation that when you yourself are retired, those who are of working age at that time will do the same for you. ""That social contract has become dangerously out of balance."" Mr Heappey would not confirm if National Insurance would be part of the government's proposals, but he said any plan would have pros and cons, and it was up to MPs to ""fiercely debate"" them when final detail is announced. Earlier this week,the government did not deny newspaper reportsthat it was considering increasing National Insurance contributions by at least 1% to improve social care and tackle the NHS backlog. National Insurance is paid by workers until they reach the state pension age and by employers. For someone on average earnings of Â£29,536 a year, a 1% increase in National Insurance would cost them Â£199.68 annually. Governments have only increased the tax twice since the 1990s - the Tory/Lib Dem coalition upped it in April 2011 (although it was announced by the previous Labour government) to improve public finances after the 2008 financial crash, and in 2003, Labour raised it to boost NHS spending. The last time the Conservatives increased National Insurance was in April 1994. But on all three occasions, the figure went up by 1%. Some Tories accept that a tax rise is needed - but say it should not be National Insurance because that could hit younger and lower income workers harder, while pensioners would not have to pay. However, during the last election, the Conservatives madea manifesto commitment,externalnot to raise National Insurance, income tax or VAT. Labour has voiced its opposition to an increase to National Insurance, with its leader, Sir Keir Starmer, ruling out his party's support. He told the Daily Mirror newspaper,external: ""We do need more investment in the NHS and social care but National Insurance, this way of doing it, simply hits low earners, it hits young people and it hits businesses. ""We don't agree that is the appropriate way to do it. Do we accept that we need more investment? Yes we do. Do we accept that NI is the right way to do it? No we don't. ""But we will look at what [the government puts] forward because after eleven years of neglect we do need a solution."" The SNP also called for the prime minister to ""go back to the drawing board"" over how to cover the cost. The party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, tweeted: ""This deeply regressive move would hammer young people, low paid workers and Scottish families by hundreds of pounds each year."" The social care system is devolved across the four nations, meaning governments need to develop separate solutions. In England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than Â£23,250 can get help from their council. There is no overall limit on costs, meaning thousands every year end up selling their homes to pay. Personal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it. Those in a home still have to contribute towards accommodation costs. The SNP said the UK government at Westminster should guarantee Scottish workers would not pay for an ""England-only policy"". Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland. For decades now there have been arguments over how we pay for the support needed as people live longer with more complex health conditions. Scotland made the decision twenty years ago to give families more help with the costs. Wales and Northern Ireland have tweaked their systems making them slightly more generous, but in England, all plans for change have so far become mired in political arguments over how we pay the bill. In the meantime the crisis in social care has deepened, leaving a system that is underfunded, has patchy quality, struggles to recruit enough staff and relies on the many people who fund their own care to subsidise the care of those who get council help. Anyone with more than Â£23,250 pays for all their care costs, which when it comes to residential care can run into thousands of pounds a month. This is as true for someone who bought their council house under the Tories right to buy scheme, as it is for someone who lives in a mansion. Also about half of local authority care spending is on younger adults with disabilities and their needs are unlikely to be addressed in these plans. The danger is that too much heat and noise over the funding mechanism will obscure meaningful discussion about what the vision should be for a care system of the future - because at its best it could help many more people live the lives they want for longer. In 2019/20, local authorities received 1.9 million requests for support, according to the Kings Fund - up by over 100,000 in five years While 1.4 million were from older people, 560,00 came from working age adults In total, 839,000 people received long-term care - 548,000 older people and 290,000 working-age adults But despite the rise in demand, the total expenditure on adult social care was only Â£99m more than in 2010/11, with council spending in England about 3% lower than in 2010 An ageing population also means growing demand, and Age UK estimates 1.5 million people in England don't get the help they need The fees local authorities pay for care - in a person's own home or a care home - vary hugely People who don't qualify for free care are often charged more, with no maximum limit on costs There are huge staff shortages - Age UK estimates there are about 45,000 vacancies Will the National Insurance cut leave me better off?

Your updates were written by George Bowden and Jennifer Meierhans. This page was edited by James Clarke and Paul Gribben. Have a good evening and we will be back with more updates tomorrow. We are going to be bringing our live updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's coronavirus news We told you just over an hour ago that the UK has recorded another 41,192 coronavirus cases and 45 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Trends at the moment show the numbers of cases, deaths and people in hospital are all on the up, as you can see in these charts. As university students begin the new term with many Covid restrictions lifted, there should be more in-person face-to-face teaching - but things won't be entirely normal. The government wants all students to get vaccinated but won't exclude those who aren't from going to university. All universities are urging undergraduates to get jabbed and many have on-site vaccination centres. Students are likely to be askedto wear a face covering in crowded areassuch as libraries, and will be encouraged totake regular Covid tests,even if they don't have any symptoms. Many unis are planning to hold Freshers' Week events, including club nights, sports sessions and student society fairs, for the first time since 2019. But experts have warned any sessions where people from across the country mix could become""superspreader"" events. The band will be joined by Sir Tom Jones Welsh rockers Stereophonics have announced a headline Christmas show in Cardiff with Sir Tom Jones and Catfish And The Bottlemen. Stereophonics' last shows in the city werethe final large events before Wales went into the first full national lockdown in March 2020. At the time, the Welsh government said the ""clear public health advice was that cancelling mass gatherings was not required"". But within days, all mass gatherings were banned, as coronavirus restrictions came into force. All adults attending the Christmas gig will have to provide proof of being double-vaccinated against Covid-19 and facemasks will must be worn while entering and moving around the stadium. Frontman Kelly Jones says: ""After almost two years of being locked down and families all having their own stories of stress and pressure and loss,I wanted to give something to the Welsh people to feel good about."" Covid-19 has made many of us more nervous about spreading germs. Even as we return to workplaces, or get back to networking face-to-face, will the habit, or for some - the ritual - of handing over a paper business card become a thing of the past? And what technology could fill the gap? Read morehere. Katy, aged 16, has just started her A-level courses at the
Greensward Academy in Essex so she says itâs an important year for her. She says she is âfeeling a mixture of apprehension and
excitementâ but is happy for âa sense of normalityâ. Katy thinks the easing of safety measures in schools âshould
be okâ. She says: âI personally donât mind not wearing a mask as itâs
nice to see everyoneâs mouth and nose.â She hopes her studies wonât be interrupted by any more
lockdowns. Matt Western says there should be more air ventilation filters on campuses Shadow education minister Matt Western warns of the return of ""campus chaos"" as he asks about funding for air ventilation filters to cope with coronavirus. He says: ""Here we are in September with a certain sense of 'Groundhog Day' with campus chaos set to return caused by the actions or inaction of this government. ""In November last year Sage published a report showing Covid outbreaks could be reduced on campus through the provision of air ventilation filters. Whilst the Welsh Labour government has committed funding for these machines, the UK Government has not."" He asks: ""So why hasn't the UK Government provided funding to make our campuses safe?"" Education secretary Gavin Williamson replies: ""(Western) seems to have missed quite a significant point and a difference between this year and last year and of course we've had one of the most successful vaccine programmes rolled out anywhere in Europe where we were one of the first countries to be able to offer people not just one vaccine, but two and making sure that the adult population have it available. ""That is the big difference from this year to last year."" James has just started his final GCSE year All day we've been bringing you the views of pupils, teachers and parents on the return to school, which has been today for millions of students in England and Wales. James is starting his final year of GCSE studies at Greensward Academy in Essex. âWhile itâs good to be back in school, itâs
obviously quite nerve-wracking as Covid is still out there and the pressure of
GCSEs,â the 15-year-old says. âAt the end of the day, weâve already had nearly
18 months of disrupted learning and any more would be too stressful due to
exams.â James has already been vaccinated once as his mum is
immunosuppressed. He thinks it would be good for other young people to be
vaccinated to provide an extra layer of protection, although he says itâs best
for the experts to decide. How are pupils being kept Covid-safe? Care home staff are facing a lack of clarity from the government over itsmandatory vaccination policy, England's largest membership body for independent adult social care providers says. The government says from 11 November, all staff in registered care homes in England must be vaccinated against Covid-19 if they are to continue working, unless they are medically exempt. This means staff must get their first dose by 16 September - a week on Thursday. With less than a fortnight to go, Care England tells PA news agency there is no sign of promised guidance concerning those who are exempt. PA says it understands the guidance and consultation will be published shortly, ahead of 16 September. The Scottish public has been warned against the abuse of staff in businesses and on public transport enforcing mask-wearing policies. In an attempt to stop the spread of Covid-19, face coverings have continued to be mandatory in some indoor spaces and on public transport. But Scotland's Justice Secretary Keith Brown has warned against abuse, threats and even violence directed at staff trying to enforce the rules.

Care home staff are facing a lack of clarity from the government over itsmandatory vaccination policy, England's largest membership body for independent adult social care providers says. The government says from 11 November, all staff in registered care homes in England must be vaccinated against Covid-19 if they are to continue working, unless they are medically exempt. This means staff must get their first dose by 16 September - a week on Thursday. With less than a fortnight to go, Care England tells PA news agency there is no sign of promised guidance concerning those who are exempt. PA says it understands the guidance and consultation will be published shortly, ahead of 16 September.

As university students begin the new term with many Covid restrictions lifted, there should be more in-person face-to-face teaching - but things won't be entirely normal. The government wants all students to get vaccinated but won't exclude those who aren't from going to university. All universities are urging undergraduates to get jabbed and many have on-site vaccination centres. Students are likely to be askedto wear a face covering in crowded areassuch as libraries, and will be encouraged totake regular Covid tests,even if they don't have any symptoms. Many unis are planning to hold Freshers' Week events, including club nights, sports sessions and student society fairs, for the first time since 2019. But experts have warned any sessions where people from across the country mix could become""superspreader"" events. The band will be joined by Sir Tom Jones Welsh rockers Stereophonics have announced a headline Christmas show in Cardiff with Sir Tom Jones and Catfish And The Bottlemen. Stereophonics' last shows in the city werethe final large events before Wales went into the first full national lockdown in March 2020. At the time, the Welsh government said the ""clear public health advice was that cancelling mass gatherings was not required"". But within days, all mass gatherings were banned, as coronavirus restrictions came into force. All adults attending the Christmas gig will have to provide proof of being double-vaccinated against Covid-19 and facemasks will must be worn while entering and moving around the stadium. Frontman Kelly Jones says: ""After almost two years of being locked down and families all having their own stories of stress and pressure and loss,I wanted to give something to the Welsh people to feel good about."" Covid-19 has made many of us more nervous about spreading germs. Even as we return to workplaces, or get back to networking face-to-face, will the habit, or for some - the ritual - of handing over a paper business card become a thing of the past? And what technology could fill the gap? Read morehere. Katy, aged 16, has just started her A-level courses at the
Greensward Academy in Essex so she says itâs an important year for her. She says she is âfeeling a mixture of apprehension and
excitementâ but is happy for âa sense of normalityâ. Katy thinks the easing of safety measures in schools âshould
be okâ. She says: âI personally donât mind not wearing a mask as itâs
nice to see everyoneâs mouth and nose.â She hopes her studies wonât be interrupted by any more
lockdowns. Matt Western says there should be more air ventilation filters on campuses Shadow education minister Matt Western warns of the return of ""campus chaos"" as he asks about funding for air ventilation filters to cope with coronavirus. He says: ""Here we are in September with a certain sense of 'Groundhog Day' with campus chaos set to return caused by the actions or inaction of this government. ""In November last year Sage published a report showing Covid outbreaks could be reduced on campus through the provision of air ventilation filters. Whilst the Welsh Labour government has committed funding for these machines, the UK Government has not."" He asks: ""So why hasn't the UK Government provided funding to make our campuses safe?"" Education secretary Gavin Williamson replies: ""(Western) seems to have missed quite a significant point and a difference between this year and last year and of course we've had one of the most successful vaccine programmes rolled out anywhere in Europe where we were one of the first countries to be able to offer people not just one vaccine, but two and making sure that the adult population have it available. ""That is the big difference from this year to last year."" James has just started his final GCSE year All day we've been bringing you the views of pupils, teachers and parents on the return to school, which has been today for millions of students in England and Wales. James is starting his final year of GCSE studies at Greensward Academy in Essex. âWhile itâs good to be back in school, itâs
obviously quite nerve-wracking as Covid is still out there and the pressure of
GCSEs,â the 15-year-old says. âAt the end of the day, weâve already had nearly
18 months of disrupted learning and any more would be too stressful due to
exams.â James has already been vaccinated once as his mum is
immunosuppressed. He thinks it would be good for other young people to be
vaccinated to provide an extra layer of protection, although he says itâs best
for the experts to decide. How are pupils being kept Covid-safe? Care home staff are facing a lack of clarity from the government over itsmandatory vaccination policy, England's largest membership body for independent adult social care providers says. The government says from 11 November, all staff in registered care homes in England must be vaccinated against Covid-19 if they are to continue working, unless they are medically exempt. This means staff must get their first dose by 16 September - a week on Thursday. With less than a fortnight to go, Care England tells PA news agency there is no sign of promised guidance concerning those who are exempt. PA says it understands the guidance and consultation will be published shortly, ahead of 16 September. The Scottish public has been warned against the abuse of staff in businesses and on public transport enforcing mask-wearing policies. In an attempt to stop the spread of Covid-19, face coverings have continued to be mandatory in some indoor spaces and on public transport. But Scotland's Justice Secretary Keith Brown has warned against abuse, threats and even violence directed at staff trying to enforce the rules. He said such attacks were ""completely unacceptable"", as new rules to protect retail workers, in particular, came into force last month. It is not clear if attacks on staff have increased in recent weeks, prompting the justice secretary's intervention. ""I would like to thank the vast majority of people who continue to wear face coverings and urge people to please follow the rules and guidelines still in place,"" he said. Read the latest rules and guidance on face coveringshere. Karen Rees-Unwin runs a uniform exchange at the Big Local Hub
in Stalybridge, Greater Manchester She is also a mother to two children aged 10 and 14, and feels âquite confidentâ about pupils returning to school. âItâs important they return, not just from an education
perspective but they also need their social lives. ""They learn so much from each
other and I think the schools have had enough experience now and are sensible enough to keep them safe.â A total of 91,725,196 vaccinations have been given in the UK,according to the latest government data.,external That's 48,270,113 first doses and 43,455,083 second doses. It means 88.8% of people in the UK aged 16 and over have had one jab and 79.9% have had two jabs. The UK has recorded 41,192 new coronavirus cases,according to the daily figures from the government.,external A further 45 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have also been registered. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Taiwanâs Central Epidemic Command Centre (CECC) has
announced that in two weeksâ time, high school students will be the first group
of people on the island to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The first
batch of Pfizer vaccines arrived in Taiwan last week, and the CECC has
confirmed that from 23 September, this vaccinewill be rolled out in schools,external.
No other vaccine is currently available to minors on the island, but Modernamay also soon become available to Taiwan teenagers,external. Taiwanâs Central News Agency says that senior high
school students will be first in line to receive Pfizer, and once they are all
vaccinated, the jab will be made available to junior high school students, i.e.
those as young as 12. TheTaiwan News Website says,externalthat
priority for Pfizer will then be given to âyoung people between the ages of 18
and 22â. Pfizer will be the fourth vaccine to arrive in
Taiwan. People over 18 can currently choose between Moderna, AstraZeneca or the
locally-developed Medigen vaccine. Pfizer was scheduled to arrive months
earlier, but Taiwanâs government has accused Beijing of blocking its arrival. Roughly
44% of Taiwanâs 23.5m population haveso far received one vaccine dose,external. Coronavirus ""will cast a long shadow over the NHS for many years to come"" and clearing the backlog could cost almost Â£17bn, an independent health charity says. The Health Foundation also warns better staffing levels will be needed, as well as investment to return to the 18-week waiting time standard. The organisation highlights two options for the UK Government - clearing the backlog over the course of this parliament, which it says will require boosting staffing levels and capacity, or tackling the waiting list over a longer period. Anita Charlesworth, the Health Foundation's director of research and Real Centre, says: ""Managing the costs of Covid could be as much as tackling the waiting list backlog. The government must resist the temptation to pick and mix funding for Covid and for the backlog - patients need both."" Last week, a joint report from NHS Providers and the NHS Confederation said the health service budget must increase by about Â£10bn next year and claimed anything less could see trusts forced to cut services. Copley Academy in Stalybridge has been staggering testing for students ahead of a return to the classroom. Years 8 and 9 are being tested today, with all students back in class tomorrow. Principal Ruth Craven says there are âanxious times ahead with the transmission rates as they are currentlyâ. She thinks school leaders need to be empowered to be able to adapt their
contingency plans quickly if there is a Covid outbreak in the future. ""Thatâs quite important for us, to make sure that weâre kept safe in
the school if the transmission rates do increase at such a pace.â  Europe's medicines regulator has said it is evaluating data on a booster dose for the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNTech. It would be
given six months after the second dose in people aged 16 years
and older, Reuters news agency reports. The European Medicines Agency says it will carry out a
speedy evaluation of the data, with an outcome expected ""within
the next few weeks"". It adds it is also assessing
data on the use of an additional dose of mRNA vaccines in people
with weak immune systems. Miles and Ella are two of the pupils heading back into class at Ringmer Primary and Nursery School in East Sussex today.  Ella, who is in Year Two, says she feels happy, ""because we donât have bubbles anymore
so we can play with whoever we want to"". And Miles, who is in Year Five, says: ""Iâm so glad to be back - over the moon - such a lovely feeling,
like youâre free and not having to listen to restrictions. ""And you are told you
are allowed to do this and that because things have changed and will hopefully
stay that way."" But he adds: ""I feel a bit anxious about what will happen if Covid comes back
again."" Boris Johnson will unveil his long-term plans for social care and the NHS as early as Tuesday, as the health service battles to sort a mounting backlog blamed on the pandemic. An extra Â£5.5bn for the NHS is also expected to be announced. A senior government figure says the money will help tackle the backlog following the Covid pandemic, as well as upcoming winter pressures, ahead of new funding beginning in April. Organisations representing the NHS have warnedservices may have to be cut unless NHS England receives an extra Â£10bn in fundingnext year. Johnson announced in 2019 his intention to solve problems with social care - but there is a growing row over how it is funded. Read morehere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"Ministers have also agreed to remove table service rules indoors and outdoors A number of changes to Covid restrictions have been agreed by the Northern Ireland Executive. Under the new moves, the number of people allowed indoors at domestic settings will rise from 10 to 15. Ministers have also agreed to remove table service rules indoors and outdoors at pubs and restaurants. People will be allowed to play pool, darts and gaming machines while dancing will also be allowed at weddings and civil partnership receptions. The requirement to purchase tickets in advance for live performances will be removed, as will the need for audience members to have allocated seats. The changes are seen as ""limited moves"" and a ""stepping stone"" approach. They will take effect from 17:00 BST on Friday, 10 September. First Minister Paul Givan, of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said: ""Today we made good progress and we met for nearly four hours in the executive and considered the current information around health, the economy, impacts on families and the community. ""We were able to reach decisions on a number of areas."" Hospitality Ulster said the moves were ""incremental changes"" and that it was time to provide indicative dates and a framework of action to move out of the remaining restrictions. ""A major strategic decision needs to be taken by the executive to bring forward a detailed and specific roadmap to address the problems that are gathering on the horizon - if not now, when?"" the organisation's Colin Neill said. ""Hospitality businesses are left hanging while restrictions continue to place a halt on viable trading. We need the best chance we can get to recover."" However, Sinn FÃ©in Junior Minister Declan Kearney said there was still a very high and dangerous infection level in Northern Ireland. ""So the executive I think has taken a very proportionate and measured and incremental approach towards the easements we have adopted today,"" he said. ""I don't think we can underestimate the extent of the challenge we still face - a lot of pressure on our health workers, there's still a very high impact on the health service, high levels of hospital admissions and bed occupancy."" The executive will meet again on Thursday as it keeps the issue of Covid-19 in schools under review. The DUP has been pushing for the executive to agree a plan - complete with dates - to remove all restrictions. Last week's meeting was cancelled after Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neilltested positive for Covid-19. The legal requirement for social distancing outdoors no longer exists in Northern Ireland. However, indoor premises such as restaurants and workplaces are still required to comply with at least 1m (3ft). That rule has already been removed in the rest of the UK, but guidance remains that people should socially distance where possible, and in places like hospitals and schools, the rules differ again. Some hospitality businesses in Northern Ireland have urged the executive to scrap the requirement for social distancing, saying it continues to affect their trade. Nightclubs in Northern Ireland remain closed, and dancing is not permitted at indoor venues where music is played. What are Northern Ireland's Covid-19 rules now?

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

This video can not be played Dr Nighat Arif told BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker how to do a basic self-examination for breast cancer The most common sign of breast cancer is a lump or thickening in the breast - but there are other symptoms too. They include: Change in size or feel of the breast Changes in the skin of the breast, such as dimpling or redness Fluid leaking from the nipple, outside of pregnancy or breast feeding Change in position of the nipple These symptoms can be caused by other conditions, so it is important to get any lumps or changes checked by a doctor. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK, with women over 50 more at risk than the under-40s. But there are many other factors that can increase a person's risk, including a family history of cancer and being overweight. Many treatments are available for breast cancer and survival is generally good if the disease is detected early.

"Boris Johnson will unveil his long-term plans for social care and the NHS as early as Tuesday, amid rows over how to pay for multi-billion pound funding. The PM said he had a plan to reform social care when he took power in 2019 but has yet to announce the detail. Reports of an increase in National Insurance to cover the cost -which would break his commitment not to raise taxes- has angered Tory MPs. The NHS in England will getan extra Â£5.4bnover the next six months. The prime minister said the money would ""go straight to the front line"" to help ""bust the Covid backlogs"". Organisations representing the NHS have warnedservices may have to be cut unless NHS England receives an extra Â£10bn in fundingnext year. What would a National Insurance rise mean for me? The nine problems facing social care right now Social care shake-up plans expected this week Meetings to discuss the social care plan for England have been taking place between the PM, Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Health Secretary Sajid Javid across the weekend, according to government sources. But while a deal is said to be ""close"", Laura Kuenssberg said it ""sounded like haggling was still going on"" over how to solve the funding issue. And she said a delay in reaching an agreement had ""created plenty of space for a backlash before the details have even emerged"". The rumoured increase in National Insurance - which has only been raised twice in the past 20 years - has particularly angered some Conservative MPs, with one cabinet minister telling the BBC: ""It is the wrong thing to do, and the wrong way to go about it"". Former minister and Tory MP Jake Berry also said it would not be a ""fair and equitable way"" to secure the money. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the rise would disproportionately affect working people ""on lower wages than many others in the country"", who would end up ""paying tax to support people to keep hold of their houses in other parts of the country where house prices may be much higher"".

NHS waiting list in England hits record 5.45 million Why workers face the bill for care revolution But it is widely accepted that major changes are needed to social care - which helps older and disabled people with day-to-day tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and medication - due an to ageing population and failures to address issues in the past. Defence Minister James Heappey said too many governments had ""ducked the opportunity"" to fix the system, leading to the ""social contract in the UK to be broken"". He told BBC Breakfast: ""The social contract is that whilst you are of working age, you pay your taxes to pay for those who aren't working in anticipation that when you yourself are retired, those who are of working age at that time will do the same for you. ""That social contract has become dangerously out of balance."" Mr Heappey would not confirm if National Insurance would be part of the government's proposals, but he said any plan would have pros and cons, and it was up to MPs to ""fiercely debate"" them when final detail is announced. Earlier this week,the government did not deny newspaper reportsthat it was considering increasing National Insurance contributions by at least 1% to improve social care and tackle the NHS backlog. National Insurance is paid by workers until they reach the state pension age and by employers. For someone on average earnings of Â£29,536 a year, a 1% increase in National Insurance would cost them Â£199.68 annually. Governments have only increased the tax twice since the 1990s - the Tory/Lib Dem coalition upped it in April 2011 (although it was announced by the previous Labour government) to improve public finances after the 2008 financial crash, and in 2003, Labour raised it to boost NHS spending. The last time the Conservatives increased National Insurance was in April 1994. But on all three occasions, the figure went up by 1%. Some Tories accept that a tax rise is needed - but say it should not be National Insurance because that could hit younger and lower income workers harder, while pensioners would not have to pay. However, during the last election, the Conservatives madea manifesto commitment,externalnot to raise National Insurance, income tax or VAT. Labour has voiced its opposition to an increase to National Insurance, with its leader, Sir Keir Starmer, ruling out his party's support. He told the Daily Mirror newspaper,external: ""We do need more investment in the NHS and social care but National Insurance, this way of doing it, simply hits low earners, it hits young people and it hits businesses. ""We don't agree that is the appropriate way to do it. Do we accept that we need more investment? Yes we do. Do we accept that NI is the right way to do it? No we don't. ""But we will look at what [the government puts] forward because after eleven years of neglect we do need a solution."" The SNP also called for the prime minister to ""go back to the drawing board"" over how to cover the cost. The party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, tweeted: ""This deeply regressive move would hammer young people, low paid workers and Scottish families by hundreds of pounds each year."" The social care system is devolved across the four nations, meaning governments need to develop separate solutions. In England, social care is generally not provided for free. Typically, only those with savings and assets worth less than Â£23,250 can get help from their council. There is no overall limit on costs, meaning thousands every year end up selling their homes to pay. Personal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is free in Scotland for those assessed by their local authority as needing it. Those in a home still have to contribute towards accommodation costs. The SNP said the UK government at Westminster should guarantee Scottish workers would not pay for an ""England-only policy"". Some care costs are capped in Wales, and home care is free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland. For decades now there have been arguments over how we pay for the support needed as people live longer with more complex health conditions. Scotland made the decision twenty years ago to give families more help with the costs. Wales and Northern Ireland have tweaked their systems making them slightly more generous, but in England, all plans for change have so far become mired in political arguments over how we pay the bill. In the meantime the crisis in social care has deepened, leaving a system that is underfunded, has patchy quality, struggles to recruit enough staff and relies on the many people who fund their own care to subsidise the care of those who get council help. Anyone with more than Â£23,250 pays for all their care costs, which when it comes to residential care can run into thousands of pounds a month. This is as true for someone who bought their council house under the Tories right to buy scheme, as it is for someone who lives in a mansion. Also about half of local authority care spending is on younger adults with disabilities and their needs are unlikely to be addressed in these plans. The danger is that too much heat and noise over the funding mechanism will obscure meaningful discussion about what the vision should be for a care system of the future - because at its best it could help many more people live the lives they want for longer. In 2019/20, local authorities received 1.9 million requests for support, according to the Kings Fund - up by over 100,000 in five years While 1.4 million were from older people, 560,00 came from working age adults In total, 839,000 people received long-term care - 548,000 older people and 290,000 working-age adults But despite the rise in demand, the total expenditure on adult social care was only Â£99m more than in 2010/11, with council spending in England about 3% lower than in 2010 An ageing population also means growing demand, and Age UK estimates 1.5 million people in England don't get the help they need The fees local authorities pay for care - in a person's own home or a care home - vary hugely People who don't qualify for free care are often charged more, with no maximum limit on costs There are huge staff shortages - Age UK estimates there are about 45,000 vacancies Will the National Insurance cut leave me better off?
