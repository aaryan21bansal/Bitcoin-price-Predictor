"Thirteen people were killed on Bloody Sunday in January 1972 and another died of his injuries some months later Prosecutors considering bringing charges against former paratroopers over Bloody Sunday have been told one of the soldiers has died. A solicitor for the soldier, known as Soldier N, last week informed prosecutors in Northern Ireland of his death. Thirteen people were shot dead when members of the Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in Londonderry in 1972. A fourteenth person died later. Bloody Sunday victim awarded thousands The victims of Bloody Sunday Key findings of Saville Report In an email received by some of the Bloody Sunday relatives, which the BBC has seen, the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) said: ""We received word last week from Soldier N's solicitor that Soldier N had recently died. ""We don't have any reason to doubt the information we've been given but I had directed the police to get some formal proof of that (a death certificate) and was waiting on that before alerting the families. Kate Nash, whose 19-year-old brother, William, was killed on Bloody Sunday, told BBC News NI she was disappointed at the news of Soldier N's death. ""If you walked in our shoes, you would realise how important justice is, not just to us, but to everybody,"" said Ms Nash. ""My brother, by not receiving justice, is being treated as worthless, which he is not."" Eighteen ex-paratroopershave been reported to the PPSover the killings and the Bloody Sunday victims are currently waiting to hear if any will face charges. A decision over whether to charge soldiers is expected at the end of February. The Ministry of Defence said it did not comment on individual cases. There have been a number of investigations into the events of Bloody Sunday, including the Widgery Tribunal - which was later described by some as a whitewash - and the Saville Inquiry, which in 2010 led to then Prime Minister David Cameronapologising to the Bloody Sunday families. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation after the Saville Report on the killings in 2010 said that those who were killed or injured on Bloody Sunday were innocent. The BBC previously obtained a letter from a senior public prosecutor detailing the criminal charges the soldiers could face. They include murder and attempted murder, wounding, perjury and joint enterprise, which means an offence where two or more people are involved. The correspondence stated: Two soldiers were reported to the PPS for the shooting of Damien Donaghy and John Johnston, the last person to die Four soldiers were reported for the killing of six people; also reported over the wounding of seven people Three different soldiers were reported over the killings of four other people A further three soldiers were reported over the killing of Kevin McElhinney An additional seven soldiers - one of whom had since died at the time the BBC obtained the correspondence - were reported over the killing of John Duddy and the shooting of Margaret Deery, Michael Bridge, Michael Bradley, Patrick McDaid, Patrick Brolly and Pius McCarron One soldier was reported for the killing of Hugh Gilmour and another soldier for the killing of Kevin McElhinney The four soldiers who were dead at the time the BBC obtained the correspondence were reported for the killing of nine people 'Job well done' says Bloody Sunday soldier Victims should get 'substantial sum' The victims of Bloody Sunday New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"Jayme Closs, her aunt/godmother Jennifer Smith and Molly the dog posing together after being reunited on January 11 Thirteen-year-old Jayme Closs, who escaped from a man who kidnapped her after killing her parents, will receive $25,000 (Â£19,000) in reward money. Hormel Foods, the company her parents worked for, had offered the money last October to anyone with information leading to Jayme's return. Jayme was found in rural Wisconsin on 10 January, after 88 days in captivity. The neighbours who helped Jayme contact police after her escape have also agreed the money should go to her. Her parents, Denise and James Closs, both worked at Jennie-O, a turkey plant owned by Hormel Foods. During the nationwide search for Jayme, the FBI had offered a $25,000 reward, which Hormel soon doubled to $50,000. The company will now donate their share of the reward money to Jayme.

"The UK and the European Union are in talks about how they could live and work together after Brexit. Politicians use many different terms when discussing Brexit - here is what some of the key ones mean. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Britain's exit from the European Union. A period lasting from 31 January to 31 December 2020, when the UK is no longer a member of the EU, but still follows all its rules. It was agreed by the UK and the EU to allow both sides time to reach a deal on their future relationship. Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. A deal between countries to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, trade barriers such as: Taxes that must be paid when trading Limits on how much of certain goods can be imported Rules on things such as hygiene or labelling of food How the agreement between the EU and the UK would be enforced if there is a dispute. One controversial issue has been about what role, if any, the European Court of Justice should play. A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders. Rules on who can fish where, and how much of each species can be caught. A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements often include level playing field measures. EU laws which prevent a government in one country from supporting companies there - over competitors in another country. This support could be financial - for instance, allowing companies to borrow more cheaply, or charging them less in tax. The 2019 agreement which set out how the UK would leave the EU. It covered: Money the UK still has to pay the EU The rights of EU citizens who already live in the UK and UK citizens in the EU The Northern Ireland protocol is part of this agreement. It set out special arrangements for Northern Ireland, to avoid the need for checks along the Irish border. This will be the situation if the UK and the EU don't reach a trade agreement by the end of 2020. It means that both sides would have to charge tariffs - or taxes - on goods crossing borders. If countries don't have free-trade agreements, they usually trade with each other under what's called WTO (World Trade Organization) rules, where each country sets tariffs - or taxes - on goods entering, and applies them equally to all its trading partners. The government currently refers to this as an ""Australian-style deal"".

"The Queen visits the Sandringham branch of the WI each year during her winter stay at the nearby Royal estate The Queen has urged people to find ""common ground"" and to respect ""different points of view"". Commentators say the remarks will be seen as referring to the Brexit debate, with MPs due to vote on the PM's deal for leaving the EU again next week. MPs rejected the deal last week but the UK will leave on 29 March with no deal unless they can agree on a way forward. BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell said there was little doubt the Queen was ""sending a message"". Queen shows off 'silky Pointless skills' Brexit: A really simple guide Fresh referendum 'doesn't have MP numbers' ""It is impossible to imagine that the head of state would use a construction of words such as this without it being appreciated that they would be seen as a reference to the current political debate,"" he said. Her words echoedthe theme of her Christmas broadcast, our correspondent added. Chancellor Philip Hammond said there was ""huge wisdom"" in the Queen's remarks. He told Radio 4's Today programme: ""I don't think anybody will be at all surprised to hear the Queen advocating the view that in all things controversial we should seek compromise, we should seek common ground, we should seek a way forward."" The Queen also received praise from other cabinet ministers - including Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, who called them ""wise words"". 'The bed that saved me from the Taliban' Bulger mother 'disgusted' by Oscar nomination Nurse held after patient gives birth Theresa May's official spokesman declined to comment directly on the Queen's remarks. He said: ""The prime minister's own view is that we should always show great respect for the point of view of others."" Analysis by BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond Twice now in the space of five or so weeks the Queen has dipped a rhetorical toe in the raging waters of the Brexit debate. Neither time has she mentioned the word that has driven the country either to apoplexy or to catatonic boredom. Each time it's been crystal clear as to what she is talking about. Some may be surprised. Isn't the Queen supposed to be above politics? Not really. Her role is more than just ceremonial. She is the head of state. Her weekly audiences with prime ministers are taken seriously by both sides. A constant flow of red boxes full of state papers means she is one of the best briefed in the land. She certainly isn't meant to be party political. But she has a political role. It is one that she has exercised very sparingly - if anything she has been a conservative Queen, pulling back from any intervention that might seem to involve the Monarchy in controversy or leave it open to accusations of political favouritism. But when the unity of the United Kingdom or the Commonwealth has been under threat she has acted.Her call before the Scottish referendum in 2014for voters to 'think very carefully' was long mulled and scrupulously scripted. Now, with the air full of vitriol, and accusations of treachery and betrayal hurled hither and thither, she has spoken again to try and calm a fevered nation. It is both her right, and her duty. The Queen, as head of state, remains neutral on political matters and does not usually express her views on contentious issues. However, speaking at an event to mark the 100 years of Sandringham Women's Institute in Norfolk, the Queen said: ""The continued emphasis on patience, friendship, a strong community focus, and considering the needs of others, are as important today as they were when the group was founded all those years ago. ""Of course, every generation faces fresh challenges and opportunities. ""As we look for new answers in the modern age, I for one prefer the tried and tested recipes, like speaking well of each other and respecting different points of view; coming together to seek out the common ground; and never losing sight of the bigger picture."" She said these approaches were ""timeless, and I commend them to everyone"". The Queen's appeal for common ground touched on the same issues as her Christmas message, in which she urged people to treat others with respect ""even with the most deeply held differences"". Historian Lord Hennessy said the Queen's second intervention within a month meant it was ""of immense significance"". He added: ""It's constitutionally impeccable as she always is, because her intervention is behavioural not political. It's about courtesy and civility and not policy.""

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd said there were ""lots of moving parts"" in Westminster at the moment Cabinet minister Amber Rudd has told the BBC she is ""committed to making sure we avoid"" a no deal Brexit and would not rule out resigning over it. The work and pensions secretary said she was ""going to wait and see"" whether the prime minister allowed MPs a free vote on potential options next week. Labour MP Yvette Cooper has tabled an amendment to delay Brexit if no deal is reached by the end of February. MPs heavily rejected the deal Theresa May agreed with the EU last week. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March and the prime minister has faced repeated calls to rule out the prospect of leaving without a deal, if no agreement can be reached. Stop playing to Brexit 'bad boys' says union chief Fresh referendum 'doesn't have enough MP support' UK will find trade difficult, says Irish PM She says it is not within the government's power to rule it out - but various backbench MPs will try to move amendments to postpone Brexit if no agreement can be reached, when the Commons votes on a way forward next Tuesday. This video can not be played WATCH: John McDonnell: PM trying to 'blackmail' MPs on Brexit Ms Rudd returned to the cabinet in November, less than seven months after quitting as home secretary in April 2018 over the Windrush scandal. She told the BBC's Newsnight that she wanted MPs to get a free vote on the various amendments - but would not say if she would resign her ministerial post to back an amendment from Labour's Yvette Cooper. The amendment would give time for a bill to suspend the Article 50 process for leaving the EU to the end of the year, if a new deal has not been agreed with Brussels by the end of February. Ms Rudd said the ""best outcome"" was for MPs to support Mrs May's deal and ""every day in Parliament we hear about MPs who voted against the withdrawal agreement who are reconsidering"". Pressed on whether she would quit to block no deal, she said: ""I think it's too early for anyone to make those sort of commitments because at the moment there is a lot of change going on. ""I have called for a free vote for the amendments on Tuesday and we'll see what position the government takes."" Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond told an audience of business people on Thursday: ""In the 2016 referendum, a promise was made to the majority who voted for Brexit - that they were voting for a more prosperous future. ""Not leaving would be seen as a betrayal of that referendum decision. ""But leaving without a deal would undermine our future prosperity, and would equally represent a betrayal of the promises that were made."" The chancellor, who like Ms Rudd campaigned for a Remain vote during the 2016 EU referendum, said: ""The only sustainable solution is a negotiated settlement with the EU."" Please upgrade your browser Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The chancellor must now surely consider his position in the government. ""Philip Hammond's comments today demonstrate he has acknowledged the damage a no-deal Brexit would do to our economy, jobs and living standards. ""If the prime minister fails to listen to his warnings and continues to refuse to take no deal off the table there is no other option, he must resign."" It comes as aerospace giant Airbuswarns that it could move its wing-building operations out of the UKif no Brexit deal is reached. Jaguar Land Roveralso announced it would extend its annual April shutdownin car production, because of uncertainties around Brexit. And Business Minister Richard Harrington also spoke out against a no-deal Brexit on Thursday saying: ""Crashing out is a disaster for businessâ¦ Airbus is correct to say it publicly and I'm delighted they have done so."" Later Airbus senior vice president Katherine Bennett was asked on Sky News whether the government had put the company up to issue warnings about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. She said: ""No, the government didn't. The government have been talking to us and other industry representatives all the time, of course, and we've given them lots of information about the potential impacts. ""But they did say 'could you make sure that you make clear the potential impact of a no deal?', and we are happy to do that because no deal is potentially going to be catastrophic for us."" Theresa May met union leaders on Thursday as she continues to seek support for her Brexit deal, ahead of a crucial Commons vote on Tuesday. Last week the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU was rejected by MPs by a historic margin -  432 votes to 202. The prime minister is hoping to tweak her deal to address concerns about the ""backstop"" among her own backbenchers and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to keep her in power, ahead of another vote on her proposed way forward next Tuesday. The backstop is the ""insurance policy"" in the withdrawal deal, intended to ensure that whatever else happens, there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU. But it has proved controversial with many MPs on her own side who argue it keeps Northern Ireland too closely aligned with the EU, and that the UK could be permanently trapped in the arrangement. A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments However as well as Yvette Cooper's amendment, her Labour colleague, Rachel Reeves, has also tabled an amendment to extend Article 50. Other amendments would ask the government to consider a range of options over six full days in Parliament before the March deadline, to set up a ""Citizens' Assembly"" to give the public more say or to insist on ""an expiry date to the backstop"". Plans by a group of Tory and Labour MPs to table an amendment on another EU referendum have been dropped, afterthey admitted they didn't have sufficient backing from MPs, although the Lib Dems will be tabling an amendment calling for a ""People's Vote"". It will be up to Speaker John Bercow to select amendments to put to the vote.

"This video can not be played Denise Fergus says the Oscar-nominated film about her son's death in 1993 has left her 'distraught' The director of a film about the boys who killed James Bulger has refused to withdraw it from the Academy Awards race. Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, told ITV earlier on Thursday: ""He should remove it from the Oscars. ""Remove it from the public domain - withdraw yourself."" But Vincent Lambe, whose film Detainment is nominated for best live action short film, told the BBC: ""I won't withdraw it from the Oscars."" Two young actors play Bulger's killers in the film Detainment He said: ""It's like saying we should burn every copy of it. I think it would defeat the purpose of making the film."" The story behind the James Bulger film Tina Malone summoned over Bulger killer Venables ID case James Bulger's mother 'disgusted' by Oscar nomination Detainment recreates the moments before and after 10-year-olds Robert Thompson and Jon Venables took James from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1993, as well as their police interviews using the original transcripts. Lambe said: ""The public opinion at the moment now is that those two boys were simply evil and anybody who says anything different or gives an alternate reason as to why they did it or tries to understand why they did it, they get criticised for it. ""I think we have the responsibility to try and make sense of what happened."" The filmmakers have faced criticism for not consulting Denise Bulger and her family about the film. Lambe has previously apologised for not making Mrs Fergus aware of it soon enough and told the BBC: ""It's something we did think long and hard about. I wanted to meet with them to try and explain why we made it."" But that was only after the film was being seen at screenings and film festivals. Lambe said: ""I do regret not telling them about it sooner."" James Bulger was two when he was abducted and killed in 1993 Last month, Mrs Fergus told ITV's Loose Women she was asking people to boycott the film ""because I just don't think it should have been made in the first place, especially without James's parents being consulted"". On Thursday, Mrs Fergus told This Morning the film was ""reliving the nightmare"" for her. ""I tried to put it behind me, I've got through all these years, to see that still [image] of him being led to his death by those two... And now it's being shown again?"" The detective who brought James Bulger's killers to justice has also said Lambe made a ""grave mistake"" in putting the film forward for an Oscar and called on him to show ""decency"" by withdrawing it. Albert Kirby said the film misrepresents the investigation into the toddler's death. Describing Detainment as ""insensitive"", he said the film depicted ""an awful lot of aggression"" during police interviews. The film depicts the boys being interviewed by police He told the BBC's North West Tonight: ""The actual events he puts in the film are accurate. You cannot fault that about it, but to my mind that's irrelevant. It's the whole context of it. ""The building they used, it looked like some disused warehouse, whereas we went to inordinate lengths to make sure where they were was comfortable. It was closed for prisoners. ""They had drinks, they had crisps...You had solicitors, a social worker with them and the parents. It was all very convivial."" The retired detective superintendent also said scenes on a railway line, where James's body was found, were ""dealt with so insensitively"". He added: ""It's causing so much unnecessary upset."" Mrs Fergus told This Morning there should be regulation on dramatisations, saying: ""If it's a documentary the families should be contacted beforehand. ""He's even said that he never got in contact because 'he knows I'd say no'. ""How does he know I'd say no? He's never met me, he doesn't know me. I wouldn't have said 'no' straight away. I'd have said, 'show me or tell me what your plans are and we'll take it from there'. The actors playing the boys were asked to recreate the events during and after the murder ""No, I wouldn't have agreed with the way he's done it but I would have told him to do it a different way."" Lambe said in a statement given to This Morning: ""The film was never intended to bring any further anguish to the family of James Bulger. ""We never intended any disrespect by not consulting them. While it is a painfully difficult case to understand, I believe we have a responsibility to try and make sense of what happened. ""Critics have specifically commended the film for being responsible and respectful to the victim."" Mrs Fergus's husband Stuart also questioned the duty of care to the child actors in the film, saying: ""It's bad enough for them to have to go through the lines. I'm hoping for the two children, the actors, that there's a duty of care for them, the scenes they had to re-enact were quite horrific."" He added: ""The child that's playing James is in tears, sobbing."" Presenter Phillip Schofield suggested a duty of care may have been taken during the film, adding: ""Child actors are notoriously brilliant, possibly they're young, good actors; they've cried because they're told to cry."" Lambe told the BBC he spent a lot of time working with the young actors before filming started and they ""were very well prepared for it"". ""There were lots of relaxed moments in between the scenes, even though the scenes themselves were quite intense. We'd still be having fun with them during the breaks."" Mr Fergus said he had seen the film but his wife had not. More than 150,000 people have now signed a petition set up before the nominations were announced on Tuesday, asking the Oscars to disqualify the 30-minute film and stop it from being shown. Mrs Fergus has been a vocal campaigner over the years, pressing for longer sentences for her son's murderers, who were sentenced to a minimum of eight years, and publishing her recent book, I Let Him Go. In a statement released after Mrs Fergus first spoke about the film, Lambe said: ""I have enormous sympathy for the Bulger family and I am extremely sorry for any upset the film may have caused them. With hindsight, I am sorry I didn't make Mrs Fergus aware of the film."" He added: ""The film was not made for financial gain and nobody involved in the making of the film intends to profit from it.""

"This video can not be played Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains The Trump administration is trying to cut Venezuelan president NicolÃ¡s Maduro's revenue streams, US National Security Adviser John Bolton says. The comments come one day after Mr Maduro cut diplomatic ties with the US. He was angry after they recognised an opposition figure, Juan GuaidÃ³, as interim president on Wednesday. Mr Bolton told reporters outside the White House the issue was ""complicated"" but they were working on a plan to funnel funds to Mr GuaidÃ³ instead. Figures from the Trump administration are continuing to try and compound pressure on Mr Maduro as the international community remains divided in its support of him. Russia has condemned foreign powers for backing Mr GuaidÃ³, saying the move violated international law and was a ""direct path to bloodshed"". Mike Pompeo, the US Secretary of State, has now requested a UN Security Council meeting be held on the issue on Saturday. At a meeting of the Organisation of American States (OAS) on Thursday he described Mr Maduro's government as ""morally bankrupt"" and ""undemocratic to the core"". How Venezuela's crisis developed What might happen next? Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Are you in Venezuela? Email your story tohaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external President Trump has said that ""all options are on the table"" in response to the unrest. Large protests were organised against, and some in support of, Mr Maduro on Wednesday. At one demonstration in Caracas, Mr GuaidÃ³, Venezuela's National Assembly leader, declared himself as the country's interim leader. He said articles within the country's constitution allow him to assume interim power because he believed Mr Maduro's election, and therefore presidency, was invalid. He has vowed to lead a transitional government and hold free elections. Within minutes of his declaration, Mr Trump recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as the country's legitimate head of state. A number of South American nations, as well as Canada and the UK, have now followed suit. The government of Mr Maduro, who has maintained the military's support, described Mr GuaidÃ³'s actions as an attempted coup. This video can not be played Thousands attended a rally in Caracas on Wednesday against President Maduro Mr Maduro has labelled the US comments a ""big provocation"" and broken off diplomatic relations. On Thursday, he ordered the closure of Venezuela's embassy and consulates in the US. The US state department meanwhile has ordered non-essential staff to leave Venezuela. Mr Maduro's sovereignty has been backed by China and Russia, who both have strategic interests in his country's economy. Others, including Mexico and Turkey, have also stood by Mr Maduro. A Caracas-based NGO, the Observatory of Social Conflict, says that at least 26 people have been killed in demonstrations so far this week. Analysis by Natalie Sherman, BBC News Business Reporter The US has already imposed a raft of sanctions in the past two years, which target officials in the Maduro government, restrict Venezuela's access to US debt markets and block dealings with those involved in the country's gold trade. But so far, the Trump administration has not taken action directly against oil imports, which are a key source of cash. A stand-off over US embassy personnel could push the White House to take that step. But analysts cautioned that oil sanctions would likely have limited effect on the Maduro regime, which could redirect shipments to allies such as China and Russia, while blaming the US for any additional hardship. Meanwhile, the decision would have consequences inthe US, which imported almost 20 million barrels of Venezuelan oil,externala month through October of last year. ""At the end of the day, it's a much more symbiotic relationship between Venezuela and the Gulf Coast,"" said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy, who worked on sanctions against Iran under the Obama administration. Mr Nephew said Mr Bolton's comments about supporting the opposition indicate the US may be looking more seriously at preparing an aid package. But he warned: ""Getting money back into the opposition's hands is much more complicated."" Mr Maduro has led the country since 2013 and was sworn in for a second term earlier this month. His re-election in May 2018 was marred by an opposition boycott and vote-rigging claims. The president has faced ongoing criticism international and internal opposition for his human rights record and handling of the economy.

"Pregnant women and parents returning to work will receive greater protection from redundancy under new plans. The government proposes extending legal protection against redundancy for pregnant women for six months after they return to work. The protections could also be extended to others, including men, who return from adoption or shared parental leave. Theresa May said: ""It's unacceptable that too many parents still encounter difficulties when returning to work."" Business Department research found that one in nine women had been fired or made redundant when they return to work after having a child, or were treated so badly they felt forced out of their job. The study also suggested that 54,000 women may lose their jobs due to pregnancy or maternity every year. Business Minister Kelly Tolhurst said: ""Pregnancy and maternity discrimination is illegal, but some new mothers still find unacceptable attitudes on their return to work which effectively forces them out of their jobs."" 'I lost my job because I had a baby' Firms told to be clearer on parental leave 'I lost my job after I gave birth' The government has launched a 10-week consultation on the proposals, which has been welcomed by consumer groups. Justine Roberts, Mumsnet founder, said: ""In a 2018 survey 96% of women we surveyed said having children affected mothers' careers for the worse. ""It's a multifaceted problem requiring a change in attitude and culture, as well as legislation, but stronger legal protection is a very welcome first step."" Jane van Zyl, chief executive of work-life balance charity Working Families, said:  ""We hear from women struggling with pregnancy and maternity discrimination every single day on our helpline. ""The proposals should go a long way toward reducing the shocking number of women who lose their jobs due to pregnancy and maternity discrimination."" Theresa May added: ""People in this country already benefit from some of the most rigorous workplace standards in the world, including parental leave and pay entitlements, but we are determined to do even more as we leave the EU."" Campaigner Joeli Brearley, founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, said the extensions won't help pregnant women being targeted at work. She pointed out that Equality and Human Rights Commission research published in 2016 showed that around one in 20 mothers were actually made redundant at some point during their pregnancy, either while pregnant, during maternity leave or after returning to work. ""More mothers are made redundant when the enhanced protections already exist than when they don't, proving that the enhanced protections which are already in place are not working, so what is the point of extending them?"" she said. ""The problem isn't the law - the law is very clear, it is illegal to make someone redundant due to pregnancy or maternity,"" she said. Ms Brearley said there are various problems that need to be addressed, such as access to justice. She also cited ""prohibitively expensive childcare"" plus the fact that a lack of flexible working ""makes it almost impossible for parents to manage their responsibilities"". ""Until we solve these issues, and create a society where women can be both bread winner and care giver, we will never reduce discrimination in the workplace,"" she said.

"This video can not be played President Trump: ""Many of those people who are not getting paid are totally in favour of what we are doing"" The US Senate has rejected two bills to end the government shutdown, leaving no end in sight to the record-breaking closure of federal agencies. The Republican legislation garnered 50 votes with 47 against, with 52-44 for the Democratic bill. Both measures needed 60 votes to pass. Meanwhile, 800,000 federal workers who are struggling to cover their bills will miss another payday on Friday. At 34 days with no end in sight, this is the longest shutdown in US history. Six Republican defectors - including former White House candidate and Utah Senator Mitt Romney - voted for the Democratic bill. It would have reopened the government until 8 February. One conservative Democrat backed the Republican measure, which would have provided the $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) that President Donald Trump wants to build a southern border wall. It would also have temporarily shielded from deportation some US residents who entered the country without documentation as children. 'I can't get my meds' Trump's wall - in seven charts Afterwards, Senate leaders from both parties briefly discussed a new proposal to reopen federal agencies for three weeks. Mr Trump was noncommittal, telling reporters at the White House that he would only sign a bill if it included a ""down payment"" on a border barrier. The Democratic leader of the US House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, said the Republican president's request was not reasonable. This video can not be played Boy sells art to help mother through shutdown The political imbroglio frayed tempers on the Senate floor on Thursday. Before voting began, Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat, shouted at Texas Republican Ted Cruz, accusing him of shedding ""crocodile tears"" over unpaid workers while supporting the president's plan for ""a medieval barrier"". Meanwhile,Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross questioned why unpaid civil servants have been visiting food banks, saying they should just take out a bank loan. Speaker Pelosi accused Mr Ross, multi-millionaire, of a ""'let them eat cake' kind of attitude"". Ahead of the vote,an Associated Press opinion poll,externalreported that the shutdown had negatively impacted Mr Trump's popularity. Just 34% of Americans in the survey supported Mr Trump overall - down from 42% a month earlier. But his approval among Republican voters was close to 80%. Now it's back to square one. Democrats in the House of Representatives suggest they could pass a package with border security - but no direct wall funding - as a compromise. That's a change from the no-negotiation position they held for over a month, but the president has previously said this was not sufficient. Something has to give. Will Mr Trump's sagging polls ratings and these latest signs of dissent in the party's Senate ranks be enough to change his mind? While the president boasts about never conceding defeat, he surprised many by abruptly backing away from the recent showdown over the State of the Union Address. He also reversed course last year on his family separation policy at the border following public outcry. A break, if it comes from the president, could happen quickly. The Democratic position would have to erode over time - and, for the moment, the party remains fairly united. Also on Thursday, former White House chief of staff John Kelly and four other former homeland security secretaries wrote to lawmakers and the president, calling for the agency to be funded again. They said it was ""unconscionable"" that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) employees were working unpaid on matters of national security. The letter said those civil servants ""should not have to rely on the charitable generosity of others for assistance in feeding their families and paying their bills"".

"More than 66 million bottles of gin were sold in the UK last year, according to the Wine and Spirits Trade Association England has more distilleries than Scotland for the first time since records began, amid a craft gin boom. There were 361 distilleries recorded in the UK last year, of which 166 were based in England and 160 in Scotland, official figures from HMRC showed. For years, Scottish manufacturers have made up the majority, owing to the popularity of Scotch whisky. But a growing thirst for gin has driven the number of English distilleries to increase by 620% since 2010. HMRC issued 31 new distillery licences in England in 2018 compared to 11 in Scotland. The figures do not distinguish between distilleries that make whisky, gin, both or other spirits. But according to the Wine and Spirits Trade Association (WSTA), more than 66 million bottles of gin were sold in the UK last year, up 41% on the previous 12 months. The total value of gin sales in the UK was Â£1.9bn last year, according to the trade alliance's end of year report. England had only 23 distilleries in 2010, when the WSTA started collecting data. In 2014 Daniel Szor left a career in finance to found the Cotswolds Distillery in Stourton, Warwickshire, which produces a dry gin and other spirits that are sold in shops including Majestic Wine, Selfridges and Fortnum and Mason. His decision to start the company was partly based on by the growing market for craft spirits in the US. ""Anything that works in the US seems to jump across the pond,"" he said. His company, which was started in an old farmhouse, now sells more than 100,000 bottles of gin a year. ""Our tremendous success in gin was initially a bit of a surprise,"" Mr Szor said. Daniel Szor left a career in finance to set up a distillery But its popularity was partly due to gin being considered ""quintessentially English"", he said. While spirits such as whisky are typically aged in oak casks for at least three years, gin can be made ""instantaneously"", making it easier to establish a gin distillery, he said. ""In my old business there was an expression 'the trend is your friend',"" he said. ""Will we reach peak gin? Sure. But when that moment will occur and how that will occur is beyond me."" After years of trading financial derivatives, Mr Szor said he found it satisfying to make and sell a physical product. ""I now love what I do and live to work rather than work to live,"" he said. Su Black, head distiller at Kintyre Gin in Campbeltown, Argyll and Bute, said English gins did not threaten the future of the Scottish spirits industry ""at all"". ""It's a very crowded market, there is a lot of competition,"" she said. ""But I think it's healthy and it means you have to be good at what you do to survive."" English distilleries were ""slightly behind the curve, in that Scottish ones got there first, but there is a place for authentic English craft spirits,"" she said. Su Black says the future of Scottish spirits is ""promising"" Kintyre Gin was established in 2017 on a site the company says is powered entirely by hydro electric energy. The future of the Scottish sprits industry was ""as promising as anywhere else"", Ms Black said. ""Nobody has a crystal ball, but there is a demand for authentic high quality spirits."" WSTA chief executive Miles Beale said: ""With all the uncertainty surrounding Brexit it is extremely reassuring that our talented spirit makers are continuing to innovate, invest and grow. ""With England now boasting more distilleries than its Scottish cousins, 2018 really has marked a moment in history."" How long can gin stay in high spirits?

TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

"Thirteen people were killed on Bloody Sunday in January 1972 and another died of his injuries some months later Prosecutors considering bringing charges against former paratroopers over Bloody Sunday have been told one of the soldiers has died. A solicitor for the soldier, known as Soldier N, last week informed prosecutors in Northern Ireland of his death. Thirteen people were shot dead when members of the Army's Parachute Regiment opened fire on civil rights demonstrators in Londonderry in 1972. A fourteenth person died later. Bloody Sunday victim awarded thousands The victims of Bloody Sunday Key findings of Saville Report In an email received by some of the Bloody Sunday relatives, which the BBC has seen, the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) said: ""We received word last week from Soldier N's solicitor that Soldier N had recently died. ""We don't have any reason to doubt the information we've been given but I had directed the police to get some formal proof of that (a death certificate) and was waiting on that before alerting the families. Kate Nash, whose 19-year-old brother, William, was killed on Bloody Sunday, told BBC News NI she was disappointed at the news of Soldier N's death. ""If you walked in our shoes, you would realise how important justice is, not just to us, but to everybody,"" said Ms Nash. ""My brother, by not receiving justice, is being treated as worthless, which he is not."" Eighteen ex-paratroopershave been reported to the PPSover the killings and the Bloody Sunday victims are currently waiting to hear if any will face charges. A decision over whether to charge soldiers is expected at the end of February. The Ministry of Defence said it did not comment on individual cases. There have been a number of investigations into the events of Bloody Sunday, including the Widgery Tribunal - which was later described by some as a whitewash - and the Saville Inquiry, which in 2010 led to then Prime Minister David Cameronapologising to the Bloody Sunday families. The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) began a murder investigation after the Saville Report on the killings in 2010 said that those who were killed or injured on Bloody Sunday were innocent. The BBC previously obtained a letter from a senior public prosecutor detailing the criminal charges the soldiers could face. They include murder and attempted murder, wounding, perjury and joint enterprise, which means an offence where two or more people are involved. The correspondence stated: Two soldiers were reported to the PPS for the shooting of Damien Donaghy and John Johnston, the last person to die Four soldiers were reported for the killing of six people; also reported over the wounding of seven people Three different soldiers were reported over the killings of four other people A further three soldiers were reported over the killing of Kevin McElhinney An additional seven soldiers - one of whom had since died at the time the BBC obtained the correspondence - were reported over the killing of John Duddy and the shooting of Margaret Deery, Michael Bridge, Michael Bradley, Patrick McDaid, Patrick Brolly and Pius McCarron One soldier was reported for the killing of Hugh Gilmour and another soldier for the killing of Kevin McElhinney The four soldiers who were dead at the time the BBC obtained the correspondence were reported for the killing of nine people 'Job well done' says Bloody Sunday soldier Victims should get 'substantial sum' The victims of Bloody Sunday New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"Iceland supermarket has told the BBC that - in a bid to meet a pledge to remove palm oil from all its own-brand products - it removed its branding from some items, rather than the ingredient. The retailervowed to remove palm oil from ""100%"" of its own products by the end of 2018, saying demand for the oil was devastating rainforests in Asia. Unable to meet the deadline, it then dropped its name from 17 palm products. Iceland blamed technical issues, adding it did not want to ""mislead consumers"". The retailer said it was pushing its manufacturers ""hard"" to remove palm oil from the items that had previously been own-brand, but now had no branding. It added that it ""was not possible to remove palm oil at a manufacturing level in these products by 31 December 2018"", adding that it had been ""transparent"". Iceland still selling own-brand palm oil Palm oil banned by Iceland supermarkets Warning of palm oil threat to primates Iceland said it had ""not given up"" on the nine frozen and eight chilled lines that had not yet been reformulated, which will have their branding reinstated by April. Consumer group Ethical Consumer said: ""In the cases where they have failed to reformulate products, simply re-labelling them is counter-productive."" It added it was important for companies ""to be transparent about the ethical problems they are facing"". On Wednesday, theBBC revealed Iceland was still selling own-label palm oil products,despite promising to stop doing so by the end of 2018. Iceland blamed a ""website issue"" after the BBC was able to find 28 own-brand products for sale online containing palm oil. Many of the products online were later removed by the retailer, but own-label products containing palm oil were still available to buy in stores that day. Iceland insisted there were no own-label fresh items available that still contained palm oil. ""The Iceland no palm oil pledge is that by the end of 2018, 100% of the supermarket's own label food lines will contain no palm oil, reducing demand for palm oil by more than 500 tonnes per year."" Despite continuing to sell own-label products containing palm oil, Iceland has spent weeks telling its customers on social media that none of its products contains it, while its website states the company is ""simply saying no to palm oil"". Even before the end of 2018, Iceland tweeted one customer to say: ""There's no palm oil in our own-brand products."" When the BBC pointed out that many of its own brand products still contained palm oil, Iceland said it was old stock and it now expected there to be no more products available to buy with palm oil ""within the next few weeks"". Iceland became the first UK supermarket to announce the removal of palm oil from its products when it made the pledge last year. Palm oil cultivation can destroy habitats for orangutans Palm oil production is said to have been responsible for about 8% of the world's deforestation between 1990 and 2008 Burning large areas of forests to clear areas where oil palms can be grown has also been blamed for high levels of air pollution in South East Asia Palm oil is used in almost half the products stocked by UK supermarkets and can be found in everything from shampoos to biscuits, as well as biofuels Some experts say eating palm oil is unhealthy because it is high in saturated fat EU labelling laws were changed in 2014 so products must now state specifically if they contain palm oil Iceland still selling own-brand palm oil Palm oil banned by Iceland supermarkets Warning of palm oil threat to primates New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"The UK has begun returning migrants, who cross the Channel in small boats, to France in a bid to deter others from doing the same, the Home Office said. On Thursday, a small number of failed asylum seekers, who landed on UK shores in October, were sent back to France. The Home Office said it wanted to provide ""a strong deterrent against the dangerous crossings"". The move is part of a new plan agreed by France and the UK which will see the UK spend an extra Â£3m on security. It is understood fewer than five were returned to France on Thursday morning. The Home Office said it could not say where the migrants were from, nor whether they had travelled to the UK together in a small boat. The measures come after a small spike in the number of migrants crossing the English Channel towards the end of last year. Following talks with French ministers, Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""Today's joint action plan strengthens our already strong relationship and increases joint action around keeping both our borders secure and discouraging these dangerous journeys."" Previously, the UK announced an extra Â£44.5m would be spent on strengthening Channel border security. The home secretary has agreed now to spend Â£6m (of which Â£3m is new) on CCTV, night goggles and number plate recognition capability. Extra security cameras will be placed at French ports and areas where migrants embark from, with a live feed viewable in the UK-France Coordination and Information Centre, in Calais, which is staffed by British and French agencies. The Home Office said there would also be increased surveillance of the Channel by air and boat patrols, and more foot patrols on beaches and coastal areas. Last week, UK Prime Minister Theresa May and French President Emmanuel Macronsigned the Sandhurst Treatywhich committed them to reducing the time taken to process migrants. It means it would take one month, rather than six, to process a migrant hoping to come to the UK from Calais - and 25 days to process children. Over the whole of last year, 539 people attempted to travel to the UK on small boats - 434 (around 80%) made their attempts in the last three months of the year, according to the Home Office. A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

"The Met Police issued this photo, which Adam Ali posted on Instagram on his ""chrono750"" account A dangerous driver who fled to Dubai has been jailed after being extradited back to Britain. Adam Ali, who left the UK in January 2017, was described as ""taunting"" police by using his Instagram account to pose with flash cars and watches. Ali, 30, from Essex, was convicted in his absence later in 2017 of ammunition possession and motoring offences. He has been given 10 months for fleeing while on bail, to serve on top of his original three-year jail sentence. Metropolitan Police officers originally went to Ali's house to investigate reports of dangerous driving. The force said it found self-filmed video of Ali speeding on roads in south Essex while he had one foot resting on the dashboard. But after being bailed by a court, Ali fled to the United Arab Emirates. Ali was eventually arrested after returning to Dubai from a trip to the US A police spokesman said Ali, of Thornwood near Harlow, remained abroad and ""appeared to lead a very lavish and luxurious lifestyle"" in Dubai, from where he ""taunted police via social media"". The Met said he posted pictures of himself on his Instagram account - since deleted - posing with sports cars and expensive watches. This came to an end after Ali visited the US in 2018 and, on his return to Dubai, he was arrested at the airport by the Emirati authorities. He was extradited on 16 January and sentenced on Tuesday at Southwark Crown Court, for fleeing while on bail and failing to surrender to the court. Ian Cruxton, from the UK's National Crime Agency, said: ""Ali fled justice to live a lavish lifestyle somewhere he thought his crimes wouldn't catch up with him.""

"After months of negotiations, the UK and European Union finally agreed a deal that will define their future relationship, which comes into effect at 23.00GMT on 31 December. It has. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on 31 January 2020. However, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, to allow enough time to agree to the terms of a new trade deal. It was a complex, sometimes bitter negotiation, but they finally agreed a deal on 24 December. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across EU borders without paying taxes and there were no limits on the amount of things which could be traded. Under the terms of the deal, that won't change on 1 January, but to be sure that neither side has an unfair advantage, both sides had to agree to some shared rules and standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. You can read more detail on other aspects of the deal, including more on travel, fishing, and financial services,here. What's in the Brexit deal? Freedom to work and live between the UK and the EU also comes to an end, and in 2021, UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with the Republic of Ireland. This will mean however that new checks will be introduced on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Now that it's no longer in the EU, the UK is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate deals with other countries. Talks are being held with the US, Australia and New Zealand - countries that currently don't have free trade deals with the EU. UK leader Boris Johnson signed the deal after the document was flown to the UK from Brussels in an RAF plane There may not be new taxes to pay at the border, but there will be new paperwork, and the potential for it to cause delays is a serious concern. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" according to William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. The UK says it will delay making most checks for six months, to allow people to get used to the new system, but the EU will be checking paperwork and carrying out checks from day one. So if businesses are not prepared, or do not fill in the new paperwork correctly, it could cause delays and backlogs at ports like Dover. The government has known about this for years, and has made plans to divert trade to other ports around the country and has built lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. It's difficult to predict what the scale of any disruption might be, but government minister Michael Gove has said that UK businesses should prepare for some ""bumpy moments"". Sadly, no. Decisions are still to be made on data sharing and on financial services, and the agreement on fishing only lasts five years. Also while the UK and EU have agreed to some identical rules now, they don't have to be identical in the future, and if one side takes exception to the changes, they can trigger a dispute, which could ultimately lead to tariffs (charges on imports) being imposed on some goods in the future. Expect the threat of disputes to be a new constant in UK-EU relations. The last few years have seen many words and phrases enter our lives. We haven't used them here, but politicians do use them. Here's what some of them mean: Transition period:The 11-month period following the UK's exit from the EU (finishing at the end of 2020), during which time the UK has followed EU rules, to allow leaders to make a deal. Free trade:Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. Level playing field:A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements like the Brexit deal often include level playing field measures.

"A key part of the Brexit negotiations has been the border that separates Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity in Ireland. Therefore the UK and EU agreed that whatever happens as a result of Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. This is where the controversial ""backstop"" comes in. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions with few restrictions. That is because the UK and Ireland are part of the EU's single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs or standards. But after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. The preference of both sides is to prevent this happening through a deep and comprehensive trade deal. However, the UK's ambition to leave the customs union and the single market, could make that very difficult. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. And if both sides couldn't reach agreement on a deal keeping the border as open as it is now - that's where the backstop would come in. So how might it it work? There are several options: This is what the EU originally proposed. It would involve Northern Ireland alone remaining in the EU's single market and customs union, leaving Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) free to strike trade deals. But the DUP - a Northern Ireland unionist party that propped up Theresa May's minority Conservative government - objected to this. It said it would see Northern Ireland treated differently and could threaten the union. Boris Johnson has alsospecifically ruled this out. After the DUP's objections, Mrs May agreed a backstop involving the whole of the UK retaining a very close relationship with the EU - staying in the customs union - for an indefinite period. It would also see Northern Ireland staying even more closely tied to some rules of the EU single market. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agree they are no longer necessary. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The backstop would not apply if the UK left the EU without a deal but the potential problems with the border would remain. The backstop plan was agreed by UK-EU negotiators and formed part of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in November 2018 (often referred to as the Brexit ""divorce deal""). It sparked a backlash from many Conservative MPs (and the DUP) at Westminster and several of her own ministers resigned in protest. Please upgrade your browser They feared that the backstop would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals. Ultimately, her deal was voted down three times, leading to her resignation. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is committed to ""getting rid"" of the backstop, describing it as ""anti-democratic"". His government has instead proposed the idea of a ""single regulatory zone"" on the island of Ireland. That would mean Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on animal health, food safety and manufactured goods. It would effectively mean a new regulatory border in the Irish Sea with checks and controls at ports. The DUP say they can accept this as long as there is a role for the Northern Ireland Assembly to give ongoing consent to these arrangements. On customs, the UK has said Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union. However the Prime Minister believes checks at the Irish frontier can be avoided by instead having customs processes mainly at company premises. The EU is sceptical about this and the latest negotiations have focused largely on customs. Many Brexit supporters say what are known as ""alternative arrangements"" could be used to avoid checks at the border. The phrase is normally used to refer to technical or technological solutions. These include things like trusted traders schemes and using GPS to track lorries. The EU has committed to working on alternative arrangements but has said no systems which could solve the border problem are currently ""operational"".

"One of the works attributed to the former German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler Three watercolour paintings attributed to the former Nazi leader Adolf Hitler have been seized by German police. The works were up for sale at the Kloss auction house in Berlin, but taken on suspicions of forgery, police say. The separate works depict a mountain scene, a river and a distant figure sitting beneath a tree. They were created in the early 20th Century while Hitler, later guilty of some of the worst crimes in history, worked as a painter in Munich. The BBC understands that the raid took place at about 10:30 local time (09:30 GMT) following a tip off. Auctioneers said that the works held ""no artistic value"" Berlin police tweeted that they had opened an enquiry into ""attempted fraud"" and ""falsification of documents"". Hitler-owned book hints at Nazi plans for North America The starting price for each painting was â¬4,000 ($4,500), according to AFP news agency. All the watercolours carried a seal of authenticity given by an expert. A police spokeswoman, Patricia BrÃ¤mer, told the BBC that investigators were looking into whether their authenticity had been ""faked"". No arrests have been made. No-one from Kloss auction house was immediately available for comment. The paintings' elderly sellers reportedly did not want to be identified. Hundreds of Hitler artworks are known to exist ""If you walk down the Seine and see 100 artists, 80 will be better than this,"" Heinz-Joachim Maeder, a spokesperson for the Kloss auction house in Berlin, earlier told Reuters. ""The value of these objects and the media interest is because of the name at the bottom,"" he added. Strong demand had been expected from online bidders in the UK, Scandinavia, the US and Russia. Prior to World War One, in which he fought, Hitler worked in Vienna as a casual labourer and an artist, drawing postcards and paintings. He was twice rejected from the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts. In his book Mein Kampf, he claimed to have produced as many as three paintings a day. In Germany, it is legal to sell paintings by Hitler so long as they do not contain Nazi symbols. Adolf Hitler worked as a painter in Vienna before rising to power in Nazi Germany While in power, Hitler allegedly ordered the collection and destruction of his artworks, but several hundred are known to still exist. Many are held by the US Army, which confiscated them at the end of World War Two. The collection has never been exhibited. Others are held in the private collections of individuals and institutions. One of the largest is housed at the International Museum of World War II in the US. In 2014, a watercolour of a registry office in Munich sold for â¬130,000 ($148,000) at an auction in Nuremberg, southern Germany. The picture came with a bill of sale and a signed letter by Nazi military commander Albert Bormann. Others have been auctioned for lower amounts.

"As secondary school tables are published, BBC analysis shows it will take over 70 years for poorer pupils to catch up with their peers at GCSE. If the pace of change remains the same as it has been since 2011, poor pupils will not do as well until the 2090s. The data shows the achievement between the poorest pupils in England and their classmates is closing but very slowly. This year, 24.9% of the poorest pupils got good passes in English and maths GCSE, compared with 50.1% of the rest. The league tables give national data, as well as details of how each school has performed. Readers can check how schools in their area have performed through the BBC's postcode search below.

The disadvantage gap has shrunk almost every year since 2011 but at a slow pace. To assess this gap, the government uses GCSE results in English and maths. The results of pupils classed as the most disadvantaged are compared with the results of all the other pupils. Children are counted as disadvantaged if they are eligible for the pupil premium, that is if they have been eligible for free school meals at any point during the past six years or have been in care continuously for at least six months. The government ranks all GCSE pupils from best to worst as if they were the results of a race. Secondary school league tables explained On average, poorer pupils rank worse. This difference in average ranking between poorer and better-off children is the disadvantage gap. In 2011, the gap was four places, meaning that poorer children would sit about four places further back on average in a ranking of 20 poorer and 20 better-off children. This year, it is down to 3.68 places - a very small change over a seven-year period. This video can not be played Are poorer children being left behind? Race explains how they are put at a disadvantage School Standards Minister Nick Gibb said making sure that all pupils, regardless of their background, were able to fulfil their potential was one of this government's key priorities and these results showed more pupils across the country were doing just that. ""It's been clear for some time that standards are rising in our schools and today's data underlines the role academies and free schools are playing in that improvement, with progress above the national average and impressive outcomes for disadvantaged pupils,"" he said. But Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said while schools were working incredibly hard to close the attainment gap between disadvantaged pupils and others, they could not do this alone. ""We need joined-up social and economic policies which restore hope and aspiration to blighted communities and which provide the support for families and young people which has been eroded in recent years by public sector cutbacks. ""To make matters worse, the level of funding for schools is totally inadequate and this hampers their ability to provide additional support to the most vulnerable learners. ""It is absolutely vital that the government improves the level of school and college funding as a matter of urgency if it wants to turn its rhetoric of improved social mobility into reality."" Data on how well Scottish pupils doin reading, writing and numeracy is published as part of its Curriculum for Excellence. The Welsh Assembly publishes school performance information in the form of a colour code. Schools are rated green, yellow, amber or red, according to how well they are performing.

"More than 66 million bottles of gin were sold in the UK last year, according to the Wine and Spirits Trade Association England has more distilleries than Scotland for the first time since records began, amid a craft gin boom. There were 361 distilleries recorded in the UK last year, of which 166 were based in England and 160 in Scotland, official figures from HMRC showed. For years, Scottish manufacturers have made up the majority, owing to the popularity of Scotch whisky. But a growing thirst for gin has driven the number of English distilleries to increase by 620% since 2010. HMRC issued 31 new distillery licences in England in 2018 compared to 11 in Scotland. The figures do not distinguish between distilleries that make whisky, gin, both or other spirits. But according to the Wine and Spirits Trade Association (WSTA), more than 66 million bottles of gin were sold in the UK last year, up 41% on the previous 12 months. The total value of gin sales in the UK was Â£1.9bn last year, according to the trade alliance's end of year report. England had only 23 distilleries in 2010, when the WSTA started collecting data. In 2014 Daniel Szor left a career in finance to found the Cotswolds Distillery in Stourton, Warwickshire, which produces a dry gin and other spirits that are sold in shops including Majestic Wine, Selfridges and Fortnum and Mason. His decision to start the company was partly based on by the growing market for craft spirits in the US. ""Anything that works in the US seems to jump across the pond,"" he said. His company, which was started in an old farmhouse, now sells more than 100,000 bottles of gin a year. ""Our tremendous success in gin was initially a bit of a surprise,"" Mr Szor said. Daniel Szor left a career in finance to set up a distillery But its popularity was partly due to gin being considered ""quintessentially English"", he said. While spirits such as whisky are typically aged in oak casks for at least three years, gin can be made ""instantaneously"", making it easier to establish a gin distillery, he said. ""In my old business there was an expression 'the trend is your friend',"" he said. ""Will we reach peak gin? Sure. But when that moment will occur and how that will occur is beyond me."" After years of trading financial derivatives, Mr Szor said he found it satisfying to make and sell a physical product. ""I now love what I do and live to work rather than work to live,"" he said. Su Black, head distiller at Kintyre Gin in Campbeltown, Argyll and Bute, said English gins did not threaten the future of the Scottish spirits industry ""at all"". ""It's a very crowded market, there is a lot of competition,"" she said. ""But I think it's healthy and it means you have to be good at what you do to survive."" English distilleries were ""slightly behind the curve, in that Scottish ones got there first, but there is a place for authentic English craft spirits,"" she said. Su Black says the future of Scottish spirits is ""promising"" Kintyre Gin was established in 2017 on a site the company says is powered entirely by hydro electric energy. The future of the Scottish sprits industry was ""as promising as anywhere else"", Ms Black said. ""Nobody has a crystal ball, but there is a demand for authentic high quality spirits."" WSTA chief executive Miles Beale said: ""With all the uncertainty surrounding Brexit it is extremely reassuring that our talented spirit makers are continuing to innovate, invest and grow. ""With England now boasting more distilleries than its Scottish cousins, 2018 really has marked a moment in history."" How long can gin stay in high spirits?

"The National Union of Students has confirmed it has cut 54 jobs in response to its ""financial issues"". The union also said it employs ""roughly half the number of staff it did this time last year"", although it didn't reveal the exact size of its workforce. The NUS said it offered voluntary redundancy to reduce staffing costs ""in a way that provided a positive exit"" for those involved. It wasreportedly,externalfacing bankruptcy after making a loss of Â£3.6m in 2017. The NUS, which had a turnover of Â£24.1m, also revealedin its last financial statement,externalthat it owed Â£1.8m in bank loans and had a pensions liability of Â£12.2m. The Guardian reported in November that the NUS told members of serious financial problems, and that it would look at cutting staff, reducing its activity and mortgaging its London headquarters. Fifteen staff left the union at the end of December, the NUS said, and the remaining 39 would leave between January and May. An NUS statement said: ""In response to the financial issues we faced last year, we proposed a staff voluntary redundancy scheme which launched on 19 November and closed on 12 December. ""By providing colleagues with choice, in what is a difficult and emotional time for all of us, our intention was to reduce our staffing costs in a way that provided a positive exit for those whose applications were accepted."" The NUS, whose highest paid employee earns between Â£90,000 and Â£100,000, is made up of more than 600 students' unions, representing seven million further and higher education students in the UK. In its financial statement the organisation said it had made ""great strides over the last seven years to diversify our revenue streams"".

"This video can not be played The CEO of Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists explained why the clock was unchanged The ""new abnormal"" the world is facing from risks like nuclear war and climate change has led the symbolic Doomsday Clock to be frozen at the closest it has ever been to midnight. The clock, created by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (BAS) in 1947, intends to warn of impending disasters. Its 2019 setting was announced on Thursday - staying in the same perilous position it was set at last year. The BAS has warned we are ""normalising a very dangerous world"". It marks only the third year the clock has been so close to midnight - first reaching the position in 1953 after the US and the Soviet Union tested highly destructive hydrogen bombs. In Thursday's announcement in Washington, representatives from the Bulletin said the clock's maintained position was ""bad news indeed"". ""Though unchanged from 2018, this setting should be taken not as a sign of stability but as a stark warning to leaders and citizens around the world,"" BAS President and CEO, Rachel Bronson, said. ""This new abnormal is simply too volatile and too dangerous to accept,"" Ms Bronson warned at the unveiling. Former California governor Jerry Brown, who serves as BAS executive chair, also cautioned: ""We're playing Russian roulette with humanity."" In the announcement, the bulletin did acknowledge improvements in US-North Korean relations, but also criticised developments like increased carbon emissions from some nations and continued diplomatic schisms across the world. The group cites nuclear weapons and climate change as the two major ongoing threats to mankind - and warned their risks were being ""exacerbated"" by the ""increased use of information warfare to undermine democracy around the world"". The clock (photographed in 2018) has stayed the same Herb Lin, a senior research scholar for cyber policy and security from Stanford University, spoke about the particular risks from ""fake news"" at Thursday's announcement. ""It's a terrible world in which rage and fantasy replace truth,"" he cautioned. When it debuted the clock's hand stood at seven minutes to midnight and it has been reset 23 times since. According to the Bulletin,its design was conceived by artist Martyl Langsdorf,external. She wanted to illustrate impassioned observations she had heard from scientists about the consequences of the world's first atomic weapons, which they helped develop. Today, the board - made up of physicists and environmental scientists from around the world - decides whether to adjust the clock in consultation with the group's Board of Sponsors, which include Nobel laureates.

"Laura Hopes and her six-year-old son Alfie were pronounced dead at the scene of the crash A mother may have been distracted by her children in the moments before a crash in which she and her six-year-old son were killed, an inquest has heard. Laura Hopes, 32, from Saltash, and her son Alfie died in the pile-up on the A38 in Cornwall on 9 July 2017. A third victim, Tony Woodman, who had got out of his car just before the smash, was also killed. The inquest in Truro heard inattention or distraction was the most likely cause of the collision. Mrs Hopes had been travelling with Alfie and her other son Tommy, four, at the time of the crash. Witnesses said they saw her Audi A3 drift across the central line of the road between Tideford and Landrake before it ploughed into the back of the Land Rover Freelander. The impact caused the driver to lose control, and the 4x4 rolled towards Mr Woodman, who was thrown over a hedge into a field. The inquest heard Mr Woodman, from Plymouth, had stopped his car to inspect a badger carcass at the roadside which he had thought was a dog. Tony Woodman was described as an ""awesome"" father and grandfather Mrs Hopes' Audi hit two other cars in the oncoming lane before coming to rest. Mr Woodman died from chest injuries while a post-mortem found Mrs Hopes and Alfie died from multiple injuries. All three died at the scene. Collision investigator Sgt Simon Bishop told the inquest the most likely reason for Mrs Hopes' driving was distraction or inattention caused by ""the children in the back or another source"". Coroner Guy Davies concluded the accident occurred mainly as a result of Mrs Hopes' driving, after she ""inexplicably"" drove into the back of the Land Rover. Mr Woodman died from chest injuries while a post-mortem found Mrs Hopes and Alfie died from multiple injuries A tribute released shortly after the crashsaid Mrs Hopes was a ""loving, kind and devoted mum"". Her husband Lee and fellow family members said she and Alfie were ""loved deeply"", and relatives had been left ""devastated"" by their deaths. Alfie was described as ""happy and popular boy"" and a keen footballer. ""He loved Liverpool Football Club and was rarely seen without a football kit on and a ball at his feet,"" the tribute said. Mr Woodman's family also paid tribute to him, describing him as a loving and caring son, an amazing brother and ""awesome"" dad and granddad, who would be ""deeply missed"" by everyone who knew him.

"This video can not be played Charlotte Brown's sister Katie says Jack Shepherd has shown ""unbelievable arrogance"" The family of a woman who died in a speedboat crash on the Thames believe her killer showed ""unbelievable arrogance"" when he appeared on TV. Jack Shepherd went into hiding in Georgia before a trial where he was found guilty of the manslaughter of 24-year-old Charlotte Brown. Ms Brown's sister Katie said her family felt ""increasingly angry"" after he told reporters he was innocent. Shepherd is expected to make his first court appearance in Tbilisi on Friday. He told a Georgian TV channel he hoped ""justice will be done... and that everyone can move forward with their lives"", before handing himself in to police in Tbilisi. But Ms Brown said she believed her sister's killer had given himself up ""for purely selfish reasons"". ""All he's thinking about is himself and his feelings,"" she said. Shepherd's lawyer confirmed the 31-year-old will appear at Tbilisi City Court at 13:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Friday. Shepherd took Charlotte Brown on a date in December 2015 While the family were ""relieved"" to see Shepherd in custody, Ms Brown said they felt ""shocked"" to see him ""just stroll into the police station smiling and waving, it was unbelievable arrogance"". ""Whilst he's been off in Georgia, he claims that he went to see friends and he has always wanted to see the scenery there - almost like he was claiming it was a holiday. ""He is not thinking about Charli, us, respect for the legal system, all he is thinking about is himself and his feelings,"" Ms Brown said. Speedboat killer hands himself in to police Victim was 'my best friend' The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error Shepherd was sentenced in his absence to six years jail in July for the manslaughter of Charlotte Brown. They had met online and on their first date on 8 December 2015, the pair had dinner then went on the web designer's speedboat. They were both thrown from the boat near Wandsworth Bridge at about midnight. Shepherd was found clinging to the hull while Ms Brown, from Clacton in Essex, was pulled from the water unconscious and unresponsive. Shepherd's boat was found to have several defects In his TV interview, Shepherd said UK authorities had ""rightly"" treated the crash as an accident initially, but ""after significant pressure by her father, the police decided to prosecute me for manslaughter"". However, Graham Brown toldthe Victoria Derbyshire programmethat was ""very misleading and inaccurate"". ""It was totally out of my control. The CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] made the decision to get the case reviewed, because of its complexities, by the serious homicide squad,"" he said. The CPS said it was ""not accurate that we ever made a decision not to charge Mr Shepherd"" and it was ""not unusual to instruct Queen's Counsel to provide advice"". Jack Shepherd is being held in a pre-trial detention centre in Tbilisi Tariel Kakabadze, Shepherd's lawyer in Georgia, said his client was ""extremely sad"" about Charlotte Brown's death but believed he was innocent. Shepherd is currently being held in a pre-trial detention centre ahead of his court appearance. Speaking about whether Shepherd will contest extradition, Mr Kakabadze said he would ""discuss it with my client... after we carefully study all the possibilities and options"". BBC correspondent Rayhan Demytrie said the process was expected to take ""several weeks"" because there were numerous formalities involved with it. Don't be surprised if Shepherd is not chalking up the days of his sentence in a British cell for some time to come. If Shepherd were in an EU state, the European Arrest Warrant system would have seen him bundled onto a plane almost as fast as it takes anyone to read the 599-page Brexit withdrawal agreement. Georgia, not being an EU state, is a signatory to a secondary and far slower international extradition deal. While it is by no means as efficient as the EAW, it at least sets out the principles of how to proceed with the UK's request for Shepherd's return. British diplomats will confirm what documents Georgia's judges need to see from our prosecutors and courts - that's expected to be a legal explanation of what Shepherd was accused of and an account of his trial and conviction. Manslaughter is is an internationally-recognised serious crime - so the UK's request for the return of a killer should be automatically recognised as valid, in the same way that such a request from Georgia would be acted on. It's then down to how long Georgia's courts need to reach a final decision, including considering any appeal that Shepherd mounts. So things will take a little longer - and possibly a lot longer if he tries to convince a judge that a man who went on the run from his own trial is a victim of an injustice. The CPS is currently drafting an extradition request to bring Shepherd back to the UK. The British Embassy in Georgia said authorities from both countries were ""cooperating closely"" over the case. Under theterms of extradition from Georgia,,externala person ""shall be extradited to a foreign state for such crimes that both under the legislation of Georgia and that of the foreign state concerned are punishable by at least imprisonment for one year or by a stricter punishment"". ""In the case of a convicted person, it is necessary that the person be sentenced to at least four months of imprisonment."" Shepherd made his first appearance at the Old Bailey on 26 January 2018, when he entered a not guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. He was released on unconditional bail by Judge Richard Marks QC, but failed to show up for his trial in July. After his conviction an international arrest warrant was issued. Despite being on the run, Shepherdwon the right to appeal against his conviction.

"Roger Waters paid for the private jet and pilot Pink Floyd star Roger Waters says he hopes to carry out more rescue missions after chartering a jet to bring two stranded foreign boys out of Syria and reuniting them with their mother. Waters flew a human rights lawyer and the boys' mother to northern Iraq to pick up the pair, aged seven and 11. The Trinidadian boys had been abducted and taken to Syria by their father. Waters told BBC News it was his first such trip. ""It's the first time, but I hope it won't be the last,"" he said. Seven-year-old Ayyub Ferreira and his brother Mahmud, 11, had been in Syria since being taken there by their father, an Islamic State fighter, in 2014 or 2015. The father is thought to have been killed in 2017 and the boys were then abandoned by his Belgian wife. They were found by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and taken to a refugee camp in northern Syria. Felicia Ferreira and her sons sleeping on the journey The guitarist got involved after being told about their plight by Clive Stafford-Smith, a lawyer and founder of human rights charity Reprieve, who helped track down their mother Felicia in Trinidad. The rock veteran helped persuade the Trinidadian government to issue travel documents for the boys and paid for the jet and crew, who set off at the start of this week. ""We all flew off to Irbil in northern Iraq and did a lot of hand-shaking and meetings with the minister of foreign relations and the governor of the state, and eventually the rescue team set off across the border with all the permissions,"" he said. ""I sat in Irbil pulling my hair out with anxiety, and after about 15 hours, Felicia and the two boys stumbled into our hotel at about half past one the next morning, and it was a moment of great happiness for all of us."" The boys were in good health, he said. ""They looked well fed. They are obviously startled, stunned. You can imagine how hard it is, particularly for the seven-year-old, to see their mother again. ""Clive went and saw them in the camp before Christmas and asked them what they wanted for Christmas, and Ayyub, who's the younger one, said he wanted to hug his mum. So he's got that wish, which was remarkable."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Waters has been an outspoken critic of Western intervention in Syria and elsewhere. He said he wanted to help because anyone who ever sees suffering children on TV wants ""to leap through the screen and gather them up and feed them and save them from harm"". He said: ""I'm privileged enough to at this point... to have the time because I've just finished a two-year tour and suddenly I've got some time to stop for a bit, so to be able to use some of the time getting these two kids out is great. ""But also it gives me some sort of a platform to say, what about all of the others? Why aren't we doing anything?"" One of the boys and his mother being led by an NGO worker in Qamishli, Syria Kurdish forces have rounded up hundreds of foreigners suspected of fighting for the IS group, but Stafford-Smith says they are also holding more than 1,200 children. At least 10 are British, he says. The Kurds have repeatedly called on their home countries to take them back, but most governments have refused to do so. ""These are children we have to look after, and the countries their parents come from should be the countries that are looking after them,"" Waters said. ""And also we need to provide some sort of a legal framework to deal with the ones in the detainment camps who are committed Isis followers because I'm not suggesting they should all be repatriated without any attention to the legal requirements.""

"Violent crime recorded by police in England and Wales has risen by 19% in a year, latest Home Office figures show. The number of homicides - including murder and manslaughter - rose from 649 to 739, an increase of 14%, in the 12 months to the end of September 2018. It is the the highest total for such crimes since 2007. Robbery went up by 17%, as did recorded sexual offences, according tothe data released by the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS). Overall crimes recorded by police went up by 7% with a total of 5,723,182 offences recorded. Is another year of rising knife crime ahead? A week in the life of a murder detective London's 2018 homicide victims John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation, which represents thousands of lower rank officers across England and Wales, said: ""Society just isn't as safe as it once was, and although the police service is doing everything within its power, we are swimming against the tide and it is the public who are being let down."" There has also been an increase in stalking and harassment offences recorded by police, which have risen by 41%. The ONS said it was likely that improvements in the way such crimes are recorded were likely to be behind the rise. Public order offences went up by 24% to 427,134. In this case, while the ONS said changes in recording practices might have had an impact, there could also be a ""genuine"" increase. Alex Mayes, policy and public affairs adviser at charity Victim Support, said of the violent crime statistics: ""These figures starkly highlight the devastating human cost of the recent rises in serious violence that we've seen across the country. ""Working with bereaved families through our national homicide service we know just how destructive these shocking crimes are."" Policing Minister Nick Hurd said overall the chance of being a victim of crime remains low, but added: ""We accept certain crimes, particularly violent crime, have increased and we are doing everything possible to reverse the trend."" He said those moves included a proposed increase in police funding, and a strategy to prevent young people turning to crime. Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said: ""These statistics show that your chance of being a victim of crime remains low, but we recognise that certain crimes - particularly violent crime - have increased, and we are taking action to address this."" Labour shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the data ""underlines the failures of government policy"". She said: ""Serious violent crime continues to rise yet the government remains in denial about the effects of its own policies. The Tories have cut police officer numbers. ""They have also exacerbated all the causes of crime, including inequality, poverty, poor mental health care as well the crisis in our schools, especially school exclusions. ""Labour is committed to increasing police numbers and to reversing the austerity policies which are contributing to crime."" There has been an 8% rise in the number of offences involving knives On homicide, statisticians said the increase continues an upward trend that has been seen since March 2014, indicating a change to the long-term decrease over the previous decade. The homicide figures exclude victims of terrorism attacks in England and Wales. The police-recorded figures on violent crime were looked at alongside information from the NHS, which showed there had been: An 8% increase in the number of offences involving knives or sharp instruments A 15% rise in the number of admissions to hospital in England for assaults involving a sharp instrument A 4% decrease in the number of police-recorded incidents involving firearms A lot of these crimes, which the ONS describes as ""lower-volume, higher-harm types of violence"", happened in London and other major cities. Chief Constable Bill Skelly, of the National Police Chiefs' Council, said some increases could be due to changes in how police record crime, and increasing reporting of incidents, there are ""real rises in serious crimes like robbery and violence with weapons, with a devastating impact on victims and families"". Police forces are committed to tackling violent crime and those having offensive weapons, but need to work alongside other organisations like the Home Office ""because this is not something that can be solved by policing alone,"" he said. ""Rising crime, increased terrorist activity and fewer police officers have put serious strain on the policing we offer to the public,"" he added. ""We are determining the additional capabilities and investment we need to drive down violence and catch more criminals - and we will make the case at the next government spending review."" The Home Office statistics are published at the same time as the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is based on people's experiences of crime. The survey includes crimes that people do not report to police. Longer-term trends, measured by the survey, suggest crime overall is stable. The only main crime type that showed a change in the 12-month period, according to the survey, was computer misuse - including crimes involving scams and computer viruses - which went down by 33%. Helen Ross, from the ONS centre for crime and justice, said: ""In recent decades we've seen the overall level of crime falling, but in the last year, it remained level. ""There are variations within this overall figure, depending on the type of crime. Burglary, shoplifting and computer misuse are decreasing but others, such as vehicle offences and robbery, are rising. ""We have also seen increases in some types of 'lower-volume, high-harm' violence including offences involving knives or sharp instruments."" BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the figures painted a ""pretty bleak picture"" and there were a number of possible reasons for the increase in violent crime. ""The Home Office has said that it's linked to the drugs market and the fact that cocaine, in particular, is now more readily available in this country,"" he said. ""The price of it has come down, the purity has gone up, and that is increasing the tension between drug gangs, which spills across to the streets. ""We're also seeing in these homicide statistics that there have been more domestic killings. ""That obviously isn't explained by the drugs market but there could be other factors - social factors, could it be to do with the fact there's been a decrease in the number of police officers in the past seven or eight years? ""These are some of the theories being put out there, but there's no simple explanation."" Is another year of rising knife crime ahead?

"One of the works attributed to the former German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler Three watercolour paintings attributed to the former German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler are being auctioned in Berlin. The separate works depict a mountain scene, a river and a distant figure sat beneath a tree. The watercolours were created in the early 20th Century while Hitler, later guilty of some of the worst crimes in history, worked as a painter in Munich. Auctioneers said that while they had ""no artistic value"", the pictures could sell for thousands of euros. Strong demand is expected from online bidders in the UK, Scandinavia, the US and Russia. The paintings' elderly sellers reportedly did not want to be identified. Auctioneers said that the works held ""no artistic value"" ""If you walk down the Seine and see 100 artists, 80 will be better than this,"" Heinz-Joachim Maeder, a spokesperson for the Kloss auction house in Berlin, told Reuters. ""The value of these objects and the media interest is because of the name at the bottom,"" he added. Hundreds of Hitler artworks are known to exist Before World War One, in which he fought, Hitler worked in Vienna as a casual labourer and an artist, drawing postcards and paintings. He was twice rejected from the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts. In his book Mein Kampf, he claimed to have produced as many as three paintings a day. While in power, Hitler allegedly ordered the collection and destruction of his artworks, but several hundred are known to still exist. In Germany, it is legal to sell pictures by Hitler so long as they do not contain Nazi symbols. Hitler worked as a painter in Vienna before rising to power in Nazi Germany Many are held by the US Army, which confiscated them at the end of World War Two. The collection has never been exhibited. Others are held in the private collections of individuals and institutions. One of the largest is housed at the International Museum of World War II in the US. In 2014, a watercolour of a registry office in Munich sold for â¬130,000 ($148,000) at an auction in Nuremberg, southern Germany. The picture came with a bill of sale and a signed letter by Nazi military commander Albert Bormann. Others have been auctioned for lower amounts. Mullock's of Shropshire sold a collection of 13 artworks in 2009 for â¬130,000. All were signed: A. Hitler.

While it is a painfully difficult case to understand, I believe we have a responsibility to try and make sense of what happened. ""Critics have specifically commended the film for being responsible and respectful to the victim."" Oscars 2019: James Bulger's mother 'disgusted' by nomination Detainment recreates the moments before and after 10-year-olds Robert Thompson and Jon Venables took James from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1993, as well as their police interviews using the original transcripts. James Bulger was two when he was abducted and killed in 1993 Last month, Mrs Fergus told ITV's Loose Women she was asking people to boycott the film ""because I just don't think it should have been made in the first place, especially without James's parents being consulted"". Irish director Lambe has previously apologised for not making Mrs Fergus aware of it soon enough and ""for any upset the film may have caused"". Mrs Fergus told This Morning the film was just ""reliving the nightmare"" for her. ""I tried to put it behind me, I've got through all these years, to see that still [image] of him being led to his death by those two... And now it's being shown again?"" The detective who brought James Bulger's killers to justice has also said Lambe made a ""grave mistake"" in putting the film forward for an Oscar and called on him to show ""decency"" by withdrawing it. Albert Kirby said the film misrepresents the investigation into the toddler's death. Describing Detainment as ""insensitive"", he said the film depicted ""an awful lot of aggression"" during police interviews. The film depicts the boys being interviewed by police He told the BBC: ""The actual events he puts in the film are accurate. You cannot fault that about it, but to my mind that's irrelevant. It's the whole context of it. ""The building they used, it looked like some disused warehouse, whereas we went to inordinate lengths to make sure where they were was comfortable. It was closed for prisoners. ""They had drinks, they had crisps...You had solicitors, a social worker with them and the parents. It was all very convivial."" The retired detective superintendent also said scenes on a railway line, where James's body was found, were ""dealt with so insensitively"". He added: ""It's causing so much unnecessary upset."" The BBC has contacted Lambe for comment. Mrs Fergus told This Morning there should be regulation on dramatisations, saying: ""If it's a documentary the families should be contacted beforehand. ""He's even said that he never got in contact because 'he knows I'd say no'. ""How does he know I'd say no? He's never met me, he doesn't know me. I wouldn't have said 'no' straight away. I'd have said, 'show me or tell me what your plans are and we'll take it from there'. The actors playing the boys were asked to recreate the events during and after the murder ""No, I wouldn't have agreed with the way he's done it but I would have told him to do it a different way."" Mrs Fergus's husband Stuart also questioned the duty of care to the child actors in the film, saying: ""It's bad enough for them to have to go through the lines. I'm hoping for the two children, the actors, that there's a duty of care for them, the scenes they had to re-enact were quite horrific."" He added: ""The child that's playing James is in tears, sobbing, what have they had to do to make that child cry, I don't know. ""Whatever they've done to that child, that child's thinking what have they done wrong?"" Presenter Phillip Schofield suggested a duty of care may have been taken during the film, adding: ""Child actors are notoriously brilliant, possibly they're young, good actors; they've cried because they're told to cry."" Mr Fergus said he had seen the film but his wife had not. More than 100,000 people have now signed a petition set up before the nominations were announced on Tuesday, asking the Oscars to disqualify the 30-minute film. Mrs Fergus has been a vocal campaigner over the years, pressing for longer sentences for her son's murderers, who were sentenced to a minimum of eight years, and publishing her recent book, I Let Him Go. In a statement released after Mrs Fergus first spoke about the film, Lambe said: ""I have enormous sympathy for the Bulger family and I am extremely sorry for any upset the film may have caused them. With hindsight, I am sorry I didn't make Mrs Fergus aware of the film."" He added: ""The film was not made for financial gain and nobody involved in the making of the film intends to profit from it.""

"Sophie Lionnet moved to London from her home in north-east France in January 2016 A man jailed for killing a French nanny and burning her body in the garden is to appeal against his conviction and prison sentence. Ouissem Medouni and his partner Sabrina Kouider were both found guilty of murdering Sophie Lionnet, 21, who worked for the couple as their au pair. Both were jailed for at least 30 years following a trial at the Old Bailey. Medouni will appear at the Court of Appeal for his hearing, but a date is yet to be set. Ms Lionnet was drowned in the bath on 20 September 2017, at the Wimbledon home of Medouni and Kouider, before her body was set on fire in the garden. Both Kouider and Medoun admitted manslaughter, but denied murder and blamed one another during the trial. Ouissem Medouni and Sabrina Kouider met in 2001 and had been in an on-off relationship In the lead up to her death Ms Lionnet had been starved and tortured, the court heard. Jurors were shown more than eight hours of recordings in which Ms Lionnet was slapped and called ""worse than a murderer"" by her tormentors. The 'toxic' couple who murdered their au pair French au pair killers jailed for life Accused 'had sex near nanny's body' On the day she died, Kouider and Medouni dunked her head into water, starved her, hit with an electrical cable and beat her so badly she had five broken ribs and a cracked breast bone. But hours before her death, a filmed ""confession"" showed an emaciated Ms Lionnet forced to falsely claim she had drugged Medouni so ex-Boyzone singer Mark Walton could sexually assault him. Giving evidence, Mr Walton, who is based in Los Angeles, told jurors the first he heard about Miss Lionnet was on 21 September 2017 when he was contacted by murder detectives. The couple denied murder, but admitted burning Ms Lionnet's body in the garden of their home Jurors convicted the couple of murder by a majority verdict of 10-2. Kouider and Medouni were jailed at the Old Bailey on 26 June for life with a minimum term of 30 years in prison. But the Court of Appeal received an appeal from Medouni on 10 July. The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed he was given permission by a judge to appeal both his conviction and sentence in November.

"This video can not be played Thousands attended a rally in Caracas on Wednesday against President Maduro Russia has condemned foreign powers for backing a Venezuelan opposition leader who declared himself interim president, calling it a bid to ""usurp power"". Moscow said that the move violated international law and was a ""direct path to bloodshed"". Juan GuaidÃ³ declared himself interim leader on Wednesday - a move recognised by the US and several other nations. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, who retains some other nations' support, broke off relations with the US in response. Mr Maduro has been in office since 2013. He was sworn in for a second term earlier this month, after winning a May 2018 election marred by an opposition boycott and widespread claims of vote-rigging. How Venezuela's crisis developed What might happen next? Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Are you in Venezuela? Email your story tohaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Mr GuaidÃ³ is the head of the National Assembly. He has said articles within the country's constitution allow him to assume interim power because he believes Mr Maduro's election, and therefore presidency, is invalid. He has vowed to lead a transitional government and hold free elections. US President Donald Trump recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as Venezuela's new head of state minutes after his declaration in the capital, Caracas, on Wednesday. Mr Trump urged other nations to follow suit - but the move has divided much of the international community. Seven South American nations, as well as Canada and the UK, have now backed his call. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Thursday that the UK agreed that Mr Maduro was ""not the legitimate leader of Venezuela"". ""The United Kingdom believes Juan GuaidÃ³ is the right person to take Venezuela forward,"" he said in a statement. The country that has lost three million people The European Union has stopped short of recognition, but called for ""free and credible elections"" and said Mr GuaidÃ³'s freedom and safety should be respected. Venezuela's defence minister has backed Mr Maduro at a news conference Mexico, Bolivia and Cuba all expressed support for Mr Maduro, while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan tweeted: ""My brother Maduro! Stand tall, we are standing by you."" China, a major investor in Venezuela, said it opposed any outside interference. Moscow sees Venezuela as one of its closest allies in the region. It has lent billions of dollars and has backed its oil industry and its military. Russia has also taken part in military exercises in Venezuela. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""We consider the attempt to usurp sovereign authority in Venezuela to contradict and violate the basis and principles of international law. ""Maduro is the legitimate head of state."" This video can not be played What drives someone to cross South America on foot? A Russian foreign ministry statement said Mr GuaidÃ³'s declaration was a ""direct path to lawlessness and bloodshed"", adding: ""Only Venezuelans have the right to determine their future. ""Destructive outside interference, especially in the current extremely tense situation, is unacceptable."" Russia also warned that any US military interference would amount to ""adventurism which is fraught with catastrophic consequences"". He was asked about military intervention and while he said he was not considering it, he added that ""all options are on the table"". In a statement,he described Mr Maduro's leadership as ""illegitimate"",external, adding: ""The people of Venezuela have courageously spoken out against Maduro and his regime and demanded freedom and the rule of law."" From shopping mall to torture centre,external The bridge of desperation Venezuela's migration crisis: Is enough being done? It warned Mr Maduro tougher sanctions could be imposed. The US has urged the Venezuelan military to back Mr GuaidÃ³, but so far it has remained loyal to Mr Maduro. He accused Washington of trying to govern Venezuela from afar and said the opposition was seeking to stage a coup. NicolÃ¡s Maduro rallied supporters at the presidential palace ""We've had enough interventionism, here we have dignity, damn it!"" he said in a televised address from the presidential palace, the Miraflores, where his supporters gathered to back him on Wednesday. NicolÃ¡s Maduro, the leader who divides opinion Venezuela hospitals at 'breaking point' Mothers giving away babies, children living on streets The country's Defence Minister, Vladimir Padrino Lopez, has accused Mr GuaidÃ³ of trying to launch a ""coup d'etat"" driven by foreign powers. Speaking at a news conference flanked by senior military figures, he said the declaration went ""against democracy, against our constitution, against the President Nicolas Maduro: the legitimate president."" On Wednesday Mr Maduro gave US diplomats 72 hours to leave the country, but the US said the ""former president"" no longer had the authority to order them out. Mr Maduro and his core supporters believe Venezuela's problems are caused by US sanctions that have hampered the government by making it hard to restructure its debt. The annual inflation rate reached 1,300,000% in the 12 months to November 2018, according to a study by the National Assembly. Mr GuaidÃ³ became president of the opposition-controlled National Assembly this month. The opposition took power there after elections in 2015, but in 2017 Mr Maduro set up a separate body, the constituent assembly, which is filled with his supporters. Both chambers are meeting and passing laws but the constituent assembly is the only one whose laws are being enacted by the government. What has Venezuela's constituent assembly achieved? Tens of thousands of Venezuelans took to the streets to rally in support of Mr GuaidÃ³ on Wednesday - while others demonstrated in favour of Mr Maduro. Mr GuaidÃ³ has cited articles 233,externaland 333 of the constitution,externalwhich allow him to assume interim power in the absence of the president. He argues Mr Maduro is not president because the elections are invalid. Venezuelan NGOs said that 14 people were shot dead during protests on Tuesday and Wednesday.

"This video can not be played Amber Rudd said there were ""lots of moving parts"" in Westminster at the moment Cabinet minister Amber Rudd has told the BBC she is ""committed to making sure we avoid"" a no deal Brexit and would not rule out resigning over it. The work and pensions secretary said she was ""going to wait and see"" whether the prime minister allowed MPs a free vote on potential options next week. Labour MP Yvette Cooper has tabled an amendment to delay Brexit if no deal is reached by the end of February. MPs heavily rejected the deal Theresa May agreed with the EU last week. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March and the prime minister has faced repeated calls to rule out the prospect of leaving without a deal, if no agreement can be reached. Stop playing to Brexit 'bad boys' says union chief Fresh referendum 'doesn't have enough MP support' UK will find trade difficult, says Irish PM She says it is not within the government's power to rule it out - but various backbench MPs will try to move amendments to postpone Brexit if no agreement can be reached, when the Commons votes on a way forward next Tuesday. This video can not be played WATCH: John McDonnell: PM trying to 'blackmail' MPs on Brexit Ms Rudd returned to the cabinet in November, less than seven months after quitting as home secretary in April 2018 over the Windrush scandal. She told the BBC's Newsnight that she wanted MPs to get a free vote on the various amendments - but would not say if she would resign her ministerial post to back an amendment from Labour's Yvette Cooper. The amendment would give time for a bill to suspend the Article 50 process for leaving the EU to the end of the year, if a new deal has not been agreed with Brussels by the end of February. Ms Rudd said the ""best outcome"" was for MPs to support Mrs May's deal and ""every day in Parliament we hear about MPs who voted against the withdrawal agreement who are reconsidering"". Pressed on whether she would quit to block no deal, she said: ""I think it's too early for anyone to make those sort of commitments because at the moment there is a lot of change going on. ""I have called for a free vote for the amendments on Tuesday and we'll see what position the government takes."" Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond told an audience of business people on Thursday: ""In the 2016 referendum, a promise was made to the majority who voted for Brexit - that they were voting for a more prosperous future. ""Not leaving would be seen as a betrayal of that referendum decision. ""But leaving without a deal would undermine our future prosperity, and would equally represent a betrayal of the promises that were made."" The chancellor, who like Ms Rudd campaigned for a Remain vote during the 2016 EU referendum, said: ""The only sustainable solution is a negotiated settlement with the EU."" Please upgrade your browser Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: ""The chancellor must now surely consider his position in the government. ""Philip Hammond's comments today demonstrate he has acknowledged the damage a no-deal Brexit would do to our economy, jobs and living standards. ""If the prime minister fails to listen to his warnings and continues to refuse to take no deal off the table there is no other option, he must resign."" It comes as aerospace giant Airbuswarns that it could move its wing-building operations out of the UKif no Brexit deal is reached. Jaguar Land Roveralso announced it would extend its annual April shutdownin car production, because of uncertainties around Brexit. And Business Minister Richard Harrington also spoke out against a no-deal Brexit on Thursday saying: ""Crashing out is a disaster for businessâ¦ Airbus is correct to say it publicly and I'm delighted they have done so."" Later Airbus senior vice president Katherine Bennett was asked on Sky News whether the government had put the company up to issue warnings about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. She said: ""No, the government didn't. The government have been talking to us and other industry representatives all the time, of course, and we've given them lots of information about the potential impacts. ""But they did say 'could you make sure that you make clear the potential impact of a no deal?', and we are happy to do that because no deal is potentially going to be catastrophic for us."" Theresa May met union leaders on Thursday as she continues to seek support for her Brexit deal, ahead of a crucial Commons vote on Tuesday. Last week the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU was rejected by MPs by a historic margin -  432 votes to 202. The prime minister is hoping to tweak her deal to address concerns about the ""backstop"" among her own backbenchers and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to keep her in power, ahead of another vote on her proposed way forward next Tuesday. The backstop is the ""insurance policy"" in the withdrawal deal, intended to ensure that whatever else happens, there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU. But it has proved controversial with many MPs on her own side who argue it keeps Northern Ireland too closely aligned with the EU, and that the UK could be permanently trapped in the arrangement. A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments However as well as Yvette Cooper's amendment, her Labour colleague, Rachel Reeves, has also tabled an amendment to extend Article 50. Other amendments would ask the government to consider a range of options over six full days in Parliament before the March deadline, to set up a ""Citizens' Assembly"" to give the public more say or to insist on ""an expiry date to the backstop"". Plans by a group of Tory and Labour MPs to table an amendment on another EU referendum have been dropped, afterthey admitted they didn't have sufficient backing from MPs, although the Lib Dems will be tabling an amendment calling for a ""People's Vote"".

Frances O'Grady said she did not get the workers' rights guarantees she wanted in a meeting with the PM. The UK's most senior union leaders met Mrs May to urge her to rule out a ""no deal"" Brexit and extend negotiations.

TUC General Secretary Ms O'Grady said workers were worried about their jobs and needed reassurances about their future. ""We have a prime minister on a temporary contract - she cannot bind the hands of a future prime minister,"" she said. ""People wanting her job are on record as saying Brexit is an opportunity to reduce workers' rights.

""Is this just a PR stunt for the mediaâ¦ or this a genuine attempt to see if we can talk about issues that matter to us?,"" he said. ""Warm words are one thing but action is needed."" He said a nine-month delay to Article 50 -  the process taking the UK out of the EU at the end of March - would be ""too long"", but he would like an extension of three months. And he said Mr Corbyn was ""correct"" not to hold Brexit talks with Theresa May because leaders from other parties, such as the SNP and the Lib Dems, had been made to look ""rather stupid"" for doing so. It was different for union leaders, he added. Unite union leader Len McCluskey says he would like a three-month extension of Article 50 Unison leader Dave Prentis said he believed it to be ""in everyone's interest"" that Article 50 was extended and urged Mrs May to stop ""appeasing the right wing"" of her party while Mr Roache also asked for an extension but added that ""most important of all"" was ruling out the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Mrs May is hoping to tweak her deal to address concerns about the ""backstop"" among her own backbenchers and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to keep her in power, ahead of another vote on her proposed way forward next Tuesday.

However Irish PM Leo Varadkarsaid the UK would find it ""very difficult"" to do trade dealsafter Brexit, if it has not resolved the Irish border issue. Mrs May has not ruled out the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal and has said the only way to prevent it is to leave with her deal.

He said: ""Crashing out is a disaster for businessâ¦ Airbus is correct to say it publicly and I'm delighted they have done so.""

It is is backed by several Remainer Conservatives and is the only amendment that would be legally binding on the government, if passed.

""If nothing moves, if no positive suggestions are put on the table, then we will be heading for a more or less bumpy or accidental no-deal on 30 March,"" he said. Mr Barnier also played down suggestions that the two-year Article 50 process ought to be extended, saying: ""I personally believe that we do not need so much more time, but that we now need to make decisions, to be taken by the British government and the Parliament of Great Britain.""

The planemaker's chief executive, Tom Enders, said Airbus ""will have to make potentially very harmful decisions for the UK"" in the event of no deal. He said it was a ""disgrace"" that firms could still not plan for Brexit. His remarks were welcomed by Business Minister Richard Harrington, who said Airbus was correct to warn of the dangers of a no-deal scenario. ""Crashing out is a disaster for business,"" Mr Harrington told a meeting at the German embassy on Thursday morning. ""Airbus is correct to say it publicly about and I'm delighted they have done so,"" he added. In all, Airbus employs 14,000 people in the UK. That includes 6,000 jobs at its main wings factory at Broughton in Wales, as well as 3,000 at Filton, near Bristol, where wings are designed and supported. Brexit: Jargon-busting guide to the key terms Brexit: What does no deal mean? Mr Enders said: ""Please don't listen to the Brexiteers' madness which asserts that, because we have huge plants here, we will not move and we will always be here. They are wrong."" Responding to Airbus's statement, a government spokesperson said: ""The UK is a world leader in aerospace. We are the home of the jet engine, the wing factory of the world and are world-renowned for our skills and capabilities in the most technically-advanced parts of aerospace manufacturing. ""It remains our top priority to leave the EU with a good deal; a deal that is good for business, will protect jobs and prosperity, and provide the certainty that business needs."" Airbus's latest intervention follows announcements by two other companies that they were moving their headquarters out of the UK. Sony said it would transfer its European HQ from the UK to the Netherlands to avoid disruptions caused by Brexit. And appliance maker Dyson announced it was moving its headquarters to Singapore, from Malmesbury in Wiltshire, although it said the decision had nothing to do with Brexit. However, another firm, Japanese technology company Fujitsu, told the BBC it had ""zero intention"" of moving its operations out of London. Duncan Tait, Fujitsu's European boss, said it had ""a thriving business in the UK"", adding: ""We're recruiting people every week."" Brexit prompts Sony's Europe HQ move Dyson to move head office to Singapore Mr Enders said that while the world's second-largest aerospace group could not ""pick up and move our large UK factories to other parts of the world immediately"", Airbus could be ""forced to redirect future investments in the event of a no-deal Brexit"". ""And make no mistake, there are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraft,"" he added. ""Brexit is threatening to destroy a century of development based on education, research and human capital."" This video can not be played Katherine Bennett, senior vice-president of Airbus in the UK Katherine Bennett, senior vice-president of Airbus in the UK, reinforced Mr Enders' message. She told the BBC that a no-deal Brexit would be ""catastrophic"" for her business, with ""chaos at the borders"" that would hold up delivery of vital components. This is not the first time that Airbus has warned of the consequences for its business of a no-deal Brexit. Last year,it issued a risk assessmentsaying that if the UK left the EU without a withdrawal deal, it ""would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK and its long-term footprint in the country"". The company has about 14,000 employees at 25 different UK sites However, Mr Enders' latest remarks suggest that the firm has toughened its stance since then. MPs are putting forward alternative plans to Theresa May's Brexit plan after it was voted down by Parliament last week. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March this year. by Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent The gloves are off. That's the clear message from Airbus' pugnacious chief executive, Tom Enders. Opposition to Brexit from Airbus is not new. The company warned of the potential dangers to its business even before the referendum had taken place. Since then, the rhetoric has been steadily ramped up. Last year, the company published a ""Brexit Risk Assessment"", in which it warned that leaving without a deal would be ""catastrophic"" for its business. We've had warnings about the risk to future investment before, but now the threat is much more explicit and the language is much more forthright. The failure to come up with a clear plan is a ""disgrace"". Other countries would ""love"" to build the aircraft wings currently made at Broughton. There's even a warning not to listen to ""the Brexiteers' madness"". The time for diplomacy, it seems, is past. So what's changed? The company clearly believes that the risk of ""no deal"" is growing, thanks to the impasse in the House of Commons. And as a business which relies on the rapid transfer of parts from the UK to assembly lines in France and Germany, it is very exposed to any delays in shipments - or problems getting new safety certification. Meanwhile, Tom Enders is due to leave his job in April. So perhaps he's in a very good position to talk tough, without worrying whom he's upsetting in the process.

"Sophie Lionnet moved to London from her home in north-east France in January 2016 A man jailed for killing a French nanny and burning her body in the garden is to appeal against his conviction and prison sentence. Ouissem Medouni and his partner Sabrina Kouider were both found guilty of murdering Sophie Lionnet, 21, who worked for the couple as their au pair. Both were jailed for at least 30 years following a trial at the Old Bailey. Medouni will appear at the Court of Appeal for his hearing, but a date is yet to be set. Ms Lionnet was drowned in the bath on 20 September 2017, at the Wimbledon home of Medouni and Kouider, before her body was set on fire in the garden. Both Kouider and Medoun admitted manslaughter, but denied murder and blamed one another during the trial. Ouissem Medouni and Sabrina Kouider met in 2001 and had been in an on-off relationship In the lead up to her death Ms Lionnet had been starved and tortured, the court heard. Jurors were shown more than eight hours of recordings in which Ms Lionnet was slapped and called ""worse than a murderer"" by her tormentors. The 'toxic' couple who murdered their au pair French au pair killers jailed for life Accused 'had sex near nanny's body' On the day she died, Kouider and Medouni dunked her head into water, starved her, hit with an electrical cable and beat her so badly she had five broken ribs and a cracked breast bone. But hours before her death, a filmed ""confession"" showed an emaciated Ms Lionnet forced to falsely claim she had drugged Medouni so ex-Boyzone singer Mark Walton could sexually assault him. Giving evidence, Mr Walton, who is based in Los Angeles, told jurors the first he heard about Miss Lionnet was on 21 September 2017 when he was contacted by murder detectives. The couple denied murder, but admitted burning Ms Lionnet's body in the garden of their home Jurors convicted the couple of murder by a majority verdict of 10-2. Kouider and Medouni were jailed at the Old Bailey on 26 June for life with a minimum term of 30 years in prison. But the Court of Appeal received an appeal from Medouni on 10 July. The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed he was given permission by a judge to appeal both his conviction and sentence in November.

"Iceland supermarket has told the BBC that - in a bid to meet a pledge to remove palm oil from all its own-brand products - it removed its branding from some items, rather than the ingredient. The retailervowed to remove palm oil from ""100%"" of its own products by the end of 2018, saying demand for the oil was devastating rainforests in Asia. Unable to meet the deadline, it then dropped its name from 17 palm products. Iceland blamed technical issues, adding it did not want to ""mislead consumers"". The retailer said it was pushing its manufacturers ""hard"" to remove palm oil from the items that had previously been own-brand, but now had no branding. It added that it ""was not possible to remove palm oil at a manufacturing level in these products by 31 December 2018"", adding that it had been ""transparent"". Iceland still selling own-brand palm oil Palm oil banned by Iceland supermarkets Warning of palm oil threat to primates Iceland said it had ""not given up"" on the nine frozen and eight chilled lines that had not yet been reformulated, which will have their branding reinstated by April. Consumer group Ethical Consumer said: ""In the cases where they have failed to reformulate products, simply re-labelling them is counter-productive."" It added it was important for companies ""to be transparent about the ethical problems they are facing"". On Wednesday, theBBC revealed Iceland was still selling own-label palm oil products,despite promising to stop doing so by the end of 2018. Iceland blamed a ""website issue"" after the BBC was able to find 28 own-brand products for sale online containing palm oil. Many of the products online were later removed by the retailer, but own-label products containing palm oil were still available to buy in stores that day. Iceland insisted there were no own-label fresh items available that still contained palm oil. ""The Iceland no palm oil pledge is that by the end of 2018, 100% of the supermarket's own label food lines will contain no palm oil, reducing demand for palm oil by more than 500 tonnes per year."" Despite continuing to sell own-label products containing palm oil, Iceland has spent weeks telling its customers on social media that none of its products contains it, while its website states the company is ""simply saying no to palm oil"". Even before the end of 2018, Iceland tweeted one customer to say: ""There's no palm oil in our own-brand products."" When the BBC pointed out that many of its own brand products still contained palm oil, Iceland said it was old stock and it now expected there to be no more products available to buy with palm oil ""within the next few weeks"". Iceland became the first UK supermarket to announce the removal of palm oil from its products when it made the pledge last year. Palm oil cultivation can destroy habitats for orangutans Palm oil production is said to have been responsible for about 8% of the world's deforestation between 1990 and 2008 Burning large areas of forests to clear areas where oil palms can be grown has also been blamed for high levels of air pollution in South East Asia Palm oil is used in almost half the products stocked by UK supermarkets and can be found in everything from shampoos to biscuits, as well as biofuels Some experts say eating palm oil is unhealthy because it is high in saturated fat EU labelling laws were changed in 2014 so products must now state specifically if they contain palm oil Iceland still selling own-brand palm oil Palm oil banned by Iceland supermarkets Warning of palm oil threat to primates New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"This video can not be played Australian Open 2019: Best shots as Rafael Nadal beats Frances Tiafo Australian Open 2019 Venue:Melbourne ParkDates:14-27 January Coverage:Text commentaries on the BBC Sport website, listen to Tennis Breakfast from 08:00 GMT on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra and watch highlights on BBC TV and online. Second seed Rafael Nadal ended Greek youngster Stefanos Tsitsipas' captivating run to reach his fifth Australian Open final. Nadal, 32, was in devastating form as he beat the 20-year-old 14th seed 6-2 6-4 6-0 in one hour and 46 minutes. The Spaniard cracked 28 winners, breaking Tsitsipas' serve six times and only facing one break point himself. He will play either top seed Novak Djokovic or France's Lucas Pouille - who meet on Friday - in Sunday's final. ""It was a great match, it has been a great tournament and I have played very well every day,"" Nadal said. ""Hopefully I can play better than that."" Nadal, who triumphed at Melbourne Park in 2009, is one more victory away from winning all four Grand Slams at least twice - a feat which no other man has achieved in the Open era. Serbia's Djokovic is also chasing a slice of history as he bids for a record seventh men's singles title, although he must first beat Grand Slam semi-final debutant Pouille. You can follow the match on the BBC Sport website and BBC Radio 5 live sports extra from 08:30 GMT. Relive Nadal v Tsitsipas semi-final as it happened Kvitova reaches first Grand Slam final since stabbing Impressive Osaka holds off Pliskova to make final After a number of injury problems, Nadal is playing his first tournament since losing in last year's US Open semi-finals. The world number two pulled out of the Brisbane International earlier this month with a thigh strain and the move has paid dividends for the 17-time Grand Slam champion. ""To start the season like this when a few weeks ago I was in Brisbane having to take a tough decision not to play there, it is difficult to imagine where I am today,"" Nadal said. ""But I never stopped practising. That week of practice made me feel good."" Nadal has looked sharp in his six matches on his way to the final and has still not dropped a set. He has played three players - Alex de Minaur, Frances Tiafoe and now Tsitsipas - who are aged under 21 and competed in the Next Gen finals. ""They don't need me to send them a message - they are good,"" he said. ""It is always a big challenge to play against them. They are a young and new generation that are already here fighting for the most important things."" Tsitsipas, playing in his first Grand Slam semi-final, was the highest-ranked player Nadal had faced this fortnight but, with his service game and famed forehand tuned in from the start, the Spaniard had no concerns. Nadal won 100% of the first serves he landed in the first set, backing that up with a strong 63% on his second serve, allowing him to put pressure on Tsitsipas. After Nadal broke in the third game for a 2-1 lead, Tsitsipas produced two double faults and the Spaniard pounced for a 5-2 advantage before serving out the opener in 31 minutes. Tsisitpas, who cut a forlorn figure in his post-match news conference, has ""everything to become a great champion"", according to Nadal. ""There are not many reasons to be down when you have started the season like this, even if is normal just straight after the match not to be happy,"" he said. Where the greats have won their Grand Slam titles Australian Open French Open Wimbledon US Open Total Roger Federer 6 1 8 5 20 Rafael Nadal 1 11 2 3 17 Novak Djokovic 6 1 4 3 14 Tsitsipas has become a global star on the back of his run in Melbourne, with his last-16 victory over Roger Federer bringing him to the attention of a wider audience. With his entertaining style of play and colourful character off the court, Tsitsipas has emerged as a leading contender to fill the void when the likes of Nadal, Federer and Djokovic retire. However, this was a stark, first-hand reminder that Nadal is not willing to depart quite yet. ""I was not even close to getting something,"" Tsitsipas said. ""I feel like I could do better today - but it is a weird feeling. It feels like I couldn't play better. ""He's not the biggest server on tour, has a pretty average serve, but it's annoying that I didn't get close to break him at all. ""He's just very aggressive from the baseline. That's pretty much it."" Stefanos Tsitsipas has made a big impression in his second appearance at the Australian Open Tsitsipas was not allowed to settle by Nadal and once that first set flashed by him, never looked like causing another upset on Rod Laver Arena. The second set was tighter, however, with Tsitsipas rediscovering his first serve to fight off three break points in the fifth game and eventually clinching the hold with an ace out wide for 3-2. Nadal continued to dominate his service games, dropping just one point in his next three, serving out after pouncing again to break in the ninth game of the set. Tsitsipas looked lost in the third set, winning only eight points, as Nadal stormed to victory. ""He gives you no rhythm. He plays just a different game style than the rest of the players,"" Tsitsipas said. ""He has this talent that no other player has. He makes you play bad. I would call that a talent.""

"This video can not be played TUC chief Frances O'Grady: PM should ""stop playing to the bad boys at the back of the class"" The UK's trade union movement chief has told Theresa May to ""stop playing to the bad boys at the back of the class"" over Brexit and ""start listening"". Frances O'Grady said she did not get the workers' rights guarantees she wanted in a meeting with the PM. The UK's most senior union leaders met Mrs May to urge her to rule out a ""no deal"" Brexit and extend negotiations. Mrs May is seeking support for her Brexit deal ahead of a crucial Commons vote on Tuesday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has refused to join the talks until Mrs May rules out the UK leaving the EU with no deal, which he says would bring ""chaos"" to the country. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March. Fresh referendum 'doesn't have MP numbers' Brexit uncertainty is disgrace, says Airbus Give our people back, says Poland's leader Brexit: A really simple guide Mrs May met Ms O'Grady, Unite leader Len McCluskey, Tim Roache of the GMB and Dave Prentis of Unison at Downing Street on Thursday. TUC General Secretary Ms O'Grady said workers were worried about their jobs and needed reassurances about their future. ""We have a prime minister on a temporary contract - she cannot bind the hands of a future prime minister,"" she said. ""People wanting her job are on record as saying Brexit is an opportunity to reduce workers' rights. ""The prime minister, frankly, has to stop playing to the bad boys at the back of the class and start listening to where I think Parliament is, which is wanting no deal off the table and more time for genuine talks to take place."" Please upgrade your browser Unite union leader Mr McCluskey, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, said he was ""not full of optimism"" after his meeting with Mrs May. But he said the talks had been a chance to ""re-emphasise"" that a no-deal Brexit would be ""disastrous"". ""Is this just a PR stunt for the mediaâ¦ or this a genuine attempt to see if we can talk about issues that matter to us?,"" he said. ""Warm words are one thing but action is needed."" He said a nine-month delay to Article 50 -  the process taking the UK out of the EU at the end of March - would be ""too long"", but he would like an extension of three months. And he said Mr Corbyn was ""correct"" not to hold Brexit talks with Theresa May because leaders from other parties, such as the SNP and the Lib Dems, had been made to look ""rather stupid"" for doing so. It was different for union leaders, he added. Unite union leader Len McCluskey says he would like a three-month extension of Article 50 Unison leader Dave Prentis said he believed it to be ""in everyone's interest"" that Article 50 was extended and urged Mrs May to stop ""appeasing the right wing"" of her party while Mr Roache also asked for an extension but added that ""most important of all"" was ruling out the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Mrs May is hoping to tweak her deal to address concerns about the ""backstop"" among her own backbenchers and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to keep her in power, ahead of another vote on her proposed way forward next Tuesday. The backstop is the ""insurance policy"" in the withdrawal deal, intended to ensure that whatever else happens, there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU. Rees-Mogg: Brexit deal could be 'reformed' Are Brexiteers softening on May's deal? Both the UK and the EU believe that bringing back border checks could put the peace process at risk but critics say the backstop keeps Northern Ireland too closely aligned with the EU and separate from the rest of the UK - and that the UK could be permanently trapped in it. However Irish PM Leo Varadkarsaid the UK would find it ""very difficult"" to do trade dealsafter Brexit, if it has not resolved the Irish border issue. Mrs May has not ruled out the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal and has said the only way to prevent it is to leave with her deal. But Business Minister Richard Harrington spoke out against a no-deal Brexit, at a meeting of business people at the German embassy on Thursday. He said: ""Crashing out is a disaster for businessâ¦ Airbus is correct to say it publicly and I'm delighted they have done so."" He said he was ""happy"" to continue in his role, but added: ""I quite understand if the prime minister thinks I'm not the right person to be business minister."" This video can not be played WATCH: John McDonnell: PM trying to 'blackmail' MPs on Brexit A number of MPs are proposing amendments putting forward alternative plans to the PM's deal with the EU - including seeking an extension to the UK's exit date. Labour MP Yvette Cooper has tabled one that would give time for a bill to suspend the Article 50 process for leaving the EU to the end of the year if a new deal has not been agreed with Brussels by the end of February. It is is backed by several Remainer Conservatives and is the only amendment that would be legally binding on the government, if passed. Her Labour colleague, Rachel Reeves, has also tabled an amendment to extend Article 50. Other amendments would ask the government to consider a range of options over six full days in Parliament before the March deadline, to set up a ""Citizens' Assembly"" to give the public more say or to insist on ""an expiry date to the backstop"". Plans by a group of Tory and Labour MPs to table an amendment on another EU referendum have been dropped, but the Lib Dems will be tabling an amendment calling for a ""People's Vote"". It will be up to Speaker John Bercow to select amendments to put to the vote. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC's Hardtalk he believes it is ""highly likely"" Labour's front bench will support Ms Cooper's amendment but that it first had to go through the party's  ""normal process"". Party leader Mr Corbyn said the decision had not yet been made. Read more about the amendments here The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier reiterated on Germany's Deutschlandfunk radio that there can be no time-limit on the proposed backstop. ""If nothing moves, if no positive suggestions are put on the table, then we will be heading for a more or less bumpy or accidental no-deal on 30 March,"" he said. Mr Barnier also played down suggestions that the two-year Article 50 process ought to be extended, saying: ""I personally believe that we do not need so much more time, but that we now need to make decisions, to be taken by the British government and the Parliament of Great Britain.""

"Two young actors play Bulger's killers in the film Detainment The mother of murdered toddler James Bulger has said the director of a film about the boys who killed her son should withdraw from the Oscars race. Vincent Lambe's Detainment isnominated for best live action short film. Denise Fergus told ITV: ""He should remove it from the Oscars, he's nominated himself... remove it from the public domain - withdraw yourself."" Lambe said in a statement: ""The film was never intended to bring any further anguish to the family of James Bulger. ""We never intended any disrespect by not consulting them. While it is a painfully difficult case to understand, I believe we have a responsibility to try and make sense of what happened. ""Critics have specifically commended the film for being responsible and respectful to the victim."" Oscars 2019: James Bulger's mother 'disgusted' by nomination Detainment recreates the moments before and after 10-year-olds Robert Thompson and Jon Venables took James from a shopping centre in Bootle, Merseyside, in 1993, as well as their police interviews using the original transcripts. James Bulger was two when he was abducted and killed in 1993 Last month, Mrs Fergus told ITV's Loose Women she was asking people to boycott the film ""because I just don't think it should have been made in the first place, especially without James's parents being consulted"". Irish director Lambe has previously apologised for not making Mrs Fergus aware of it soon enough and ""for any upset the film may have caused"". Mrs Fergus told This Morning the film was just ""reliving the nightmare"" for her. ""I tried to put it behind me, I've got through all these years, to see that still [image] of him being led to his death by those two... And now it's being shown again?"" The detective who brought James Bulger's killers to justice has also said Lambe made a ""grave mistake"" in putting the film forward for an Oscar and called on him to show ""decency"" by withdrawing it. Albert Kirby said the film misrepresents the investigation into the toddler's death. Describing Detainment as ""insensitive"", he said the film depicted ""an awful lot of aggression"" during police interviews. The film depicts the boys being interviewed by police He told the BBC: ""The actual events he puts in the film are accurate. You cannot fault that about it, but to my mind that's irrelevant. It's the whole context of it. ""The building they used, it looked like some disused warehouse, whereas we went to inordinate lengths to make sure where they were was comfortable. It was closed for prisoners. ""They had drinks, they had crisps...You had solicitors, a social worker with them and the parents. It was all very convivial."" The retired detective superintendent also said scenes on a railway line, where James's body was found, were ""dealt with so insensitively"". He added: ""It's causing so much unnecessary upset."" The BBC has contacted Lambe for comment. Mrs Fergus told This Morning there should be regulation on dramatisations, saying: ""If it's a documentary the families should be contacted beforehand. ""He's even said that he never got in contact because 'he knows I'd say no'. ""How does he know I'd say no? He's never met me, he doesn't know me. I wouldn't have said 'no' straight away. I'd have said, 'show me or tell me what your plans are and we'll take it from there'. The actors playing the boys were asked to recreate the events during and after the murder ""No, I wouldn't have agreed with the way he's done it but I would have told him to do it a different way."" Mrs Fergus's husband Stuart also questioned the duty of care to the child actors in the film, saying: ""It's bad enough for them to have to go through the lines. I'm hoping for the two children, the actors, that there's a duty of care for them, the scenes they had to re-enact were quite horrific."" He added: ""The child that's playing James is in tears, sobbing, what have they had to do to make that child cry, I don't know. ""Whatever they've done to that child, that child's thinking what have they done wrong?"" Presenter Phillip Schofield suggested a duty of care may have been taken during the film, adding: ""Child actors are notoriously brilliant, possibly they're young, good actors; they've cried because they're told to cry."" Mr Fergus said he had seen the film but his wife had not. More than 100,000 people have now signed a petition set up before the nominations were announced on Tuesday, asking the Oscars to disqualify the 30-minute film. Mrs Fergus has been a vocal campaigner over the years, pressing for longer sentences for her son's murderers, who were sentenced to a minimum of eight years, and publishing her recent book, I Let Him Go. In a statement released after Mrs Fergus first spoke about the film, Lambe said: ""I have enormous sympathy for the Bulger family and I am extremely sorry for any upset the film may have caused them. With hindsight, I am sorry I didn't make Mrs Fergus aware of the film."" He added: ""The film was not made for financial gain and nobody involved in the making of the film intends to profit from it.""

"This video can not be played Thousands attended Wednesday's rally in Caracas against President Maduro Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has broken off relations with the US after it recognised opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ as interim leader. Mr Maduro gave US diplomats 72 hours to leave the country but the US said the ""former president"" no longer had the authority to order them out. On Wednesday, Mr GuaidÃ³ had declared himself president during mass protests. The US has urged the military to back Mr GuaidÃ³, but so far it has remained loyal to Mr Maduro. Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? How Venezuela's crisis developed The country that has lost three million people Mr Maduro took office in 2013 after the death of Hugo ChÃ¡vez. He was sworn in for a second term this month after elections last May that were marred by an opposition boycott and widespread claims of vote-rigging. Venezuela has been in economic freefall. Hyperinflation, power cuts and shortages of basic items have driven millions of people from the country. Thousands of Venezuelans attended a rally on Wednesday in support of Mr GuaidÃ³, who is the head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly. He told the cheering crowd that protests would continue ""until Venezuela is liberated"". NGOs said 14 people had been shot dead during protests Mr GuaidÃ³ then raised his right hand and said: ""I swear to formally assume the national executive powers as acting president,"" vowing to lead a transitional government and hold free elections. Mr GuaidÃ³ isciting articles 233 and 333 of the constitution,externalwhich allow the head of the National Assembly to become interim president in the absence of the president. Mr GuaidÃ³ argues that Mr Maduro is not president because last May's elections are invalid. Mr GuaidÃ³ has called on the armed forces to disobey the government. Venezuelan NGOs said that 14 people were shot dead during protests on Tuesday and Wednesday. President Donald Trump recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president in an apparently co-ordinated move minutes after the 35-year-old declared himself acting leader. In a statement,he described Mr Maduro's leadership as ""illegitimate"",external, adding: ""The people of Venezuela have courageously spoken out against Maduro and his regime and demanded freedom and the rule of law."" It warned Mr Maduro tougher sanctions could be imposed. Mr Trump told journalists he was not considering military action but added that ""all options are on the table"". He called on other nations to follow suit in supporting Mr GuaidÃ³. Seven South American nations, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina and Paraguay have recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as the legitimate president. The bridge of desperation Venezuela's migration crisis: Is enough being done? Venezuela hospitals at 'breaking point' Canada is also supporting him, while the EU called for new elections. The Organization of American States (OAS) also recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as president. Venezuela withdrew from organisation in 2017, accusing it of meddling in its internal affairs. This video can not be played What drives someone to cross South America on foot? Mexico, Bolivia and Cuba have expressed support for Mr Maduro. Russia criticised those in the international community who ""seek a change in power"" and said any US military intervention would be ""catastrophic"". Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan tweeted: ""My brother Maduro! Stand tall, we are standing by you."" A spokesman for the UN secretary general said AntÃ³nio Guterres was calling for peaceful political dialogue to address the crisis. He accused Washington of trying to govern Venezuela from afar and said the opposition was seeking to stage a coup. ""We've had enough interventionism, here we have dignity, damn it!"" he said in a televised address from the presidential palace, the Miraflores, where his supporters had gathered to back him. NicolÃ¡s Maduro, the leader who divides opinion Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino condemned Mr GuaidÃ³'s call for the army to switch sides. ""The nation's soldiers don't accept a president imposed by obscure interests, nor one self-proclaimed outside of the law,"" he tweeted. Mr Maduro and his core supporters believe Venezuela's problems are caused by US sanctions that have hampered the government by making it hard to restructure its debt. The annual inflation rate reached 1,300,000% in the 12 months to November 2018, according to a study by the National Assembly. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent Does the Trump administration have a coherent plan for raising the pressure on the Maduro regime - such as freezing assets? Crisis could simply lead to a greater calamity for the Venezuelan people. Much will depend on which way the Venezuelan military jumps. For now, its generals may be backing the current regime. But will the lower ranks remain loyal to Mr Maduro or will they heed the growing unrest inside the country and the chorus of powerful voices coming from abroad? Mr GuaidÃ³ was relatively unknown until he became president of the National Assembly this month. Mothers giving away babies, children living on streets The opposition took power there after elections in 2015, but in 2017 Mr Maduro set up a separate body, the constituent assembly, which is filled with his supporters. Both chambers are meeting and passing laws but the constituent assembly is the only one whose laws are being enacted by the government. What has Venezuela's constituent assembly achieved? Leopoldo Lopez, Venezuela's most popular opposition leader, is seen as the architect behind Mr GuaidÃ³'s rise. Mr Lopez is under house arrest and considered by his supporters to be a political prisoner. As a student, Mr GuaidÃ³ led protests against Hugo ChÃ¡vez, who handpicked Mr Maduro as his successor.

"This video can not be played Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump? US President Donald Trump says he will not deliver his annual State of the Union speech until after the government shutdown is over. On Wednesday House Speaker Nancy Pelosi withdrew an invitation for him to address Congress, saying government services should fully reopen first. The shutdown has left 800,000 federal staff without pay since 22 December. Mr Trump wants $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) to build a wall on the US-Mexico border, but newly empowered Democrats have refused. The row over border security has led to the longest government shutdown in US history. Having initially said the speech should be ""on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location"", he conceded overnight that he could not deliver on his pledge. He acknowledged on Twitter Mrs Pelosi's refusal to allow Congress to host the State of the Union address until the shutdown - now in its 34th day - had been resolved. ""This is her prerogative,"" he said, adding that he was no longer looking for an alternative venue but looked forward to making the speech in the near future. Mrs Pelosi responded with her own tweet saying she hoped Mr Trump would back a bill passed by the House of Representatives to fund the agencies affected by the shutdown. Allow Twitter content?

The impact of the government shutdown 'I can't get my meds' All you need to know about Trump's wall Democrats have argued that with so many federal employees furloughed - temporarily laid off - or working without pay, the high-profile State of the Union address, which involves both chambers of Congress and the president, would not be logistically feasible. But Mr Trump has denied that there were any security concerns posed by the ongoing partial shutdown. He also rejected suggestions that he could deliver the speech from the White House or another location. This video can not be played Boy sells art to help mother through shutdown What isMrsPelosi's position? In early January, the House speaker, the third most powerful politician in the US, had invited Mr Trump to address Congress on the agreed-upon date of the 29th. ""At that time, there was no thought that the government would still be shut down,"" Mrs Pelosi said in her letter on Wednesday. ""I am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorising the President's State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened."" ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened."" This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate Mrs Pelosi had first asked for the State of the Union,an agenda-setting speech by the president, to be delayed on 16 January, citing an unfunded Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security. In retaliation, Mr Trump last week denied Mrs Pelosi the use of military aircraft on a trip to Brussels and Afghanistan - less than an hour before her flight was due to depart. He asked her to stay to negotiate an end to the partial US government shutdown. For much of Wednesday it appeared that Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi were headed for a dramatic confrontation over when and where he would give his State of the Union Address. Then the president backed down. The speech standoff was always a game within a game - a symbolic fight for the battle over the government shutdown, which in turn is a proxy battle for which party will set policy priorities for the next two years. It won't be long before it's clear whether the president's retreat marks the beginning of the end for his line-in-the-sand demand for wall funding. The Senate votes on two measures to reopen the government on Thursday - the first with wall funding and the other without. Both are expected to fail, but the pressure could be growing on Republicans to support the measure to reopen the government temporarily, allow furloughed workers to collect back pay and give the president an opportunity to deliver his State of the Union Address. If the measure goes down in flames, the shutdown will drag into next week. Then it's back to the drawing board, with hints of new ""compromise"" proposals to come but no firm idea of how a deal can be made.

"Drug-resistant superbugs are as big a threat as climate change, the health secretary will say as he unveils a new five-year plan to tackle the problem. Overuse of antibiotics is making infections harder to treat and leading to thousands of deaths a year through drug-resistant superbugs. The government plans to change the way it funds drug companies to encourage them to develop new medicines. It is also increasing efforts to cut unnecessary use of the drugs. The government's plan aims to control and contain antimicrobial resistance - a term that covers drug resistance in bacteria, viruses, parasites and other infections - by 2040, and reduce the use of antibiotics in humans by 15% over the next five years. It also plans to cut antibiotic use in animals by 25% from 2016 levels by next year. What is antibiotic resistance? The drugs advisory body, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and NHS England will also trial a new payment model that means pharmaceutical companies will be paid for drugs based on how valuable the medicines are to the NHS, rather than by the quantity of drugs sold. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, launching the government's 20-year vision at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, will say: ""Each and every one of us benefits from antibiotics but we all too easily take them for granted and I shudder at the thought of a world in which their power is diminished. ""Antimicrobial resistance is as big a danger to humanity as climate change or warfare. That's why we need an urgent global response."" Catherine Williams has been on and off antibiotics since she was a teenager For more than a decade, Catherine Williams has been battling an infection drugs can keep at bay but not defeat. A urinary tract infection (UTI) as a teenager failed to properly respond to antibiotics and has since repeatedly returned, leaving her in serious pain and even requiring hospital treatment. Because the infection was caused by bacteria in her body that are resistant to the main form of antibiotics for UTIs, cephalosporins, and another type, gentamicin, it has never fully cleared. It has meant that the 32-year-old has needed to take antibiotics on and off ever since, just to keep the infection at bay. Some of her infections have been so bad they have required hospital treatment. Physically run-down and emotionally low, Catherine has had to take strong painkillers and steroids for the pain in her bladder. ""It's horrific,"" she said. ""The pain, you're bedbound until you're back on antibiotics and that's frightening, knowing that I have to stay on them to function normally. ""Every time I come off them it comes straight back. ""Why can't they cure something as simple as what I thought was an uncomplicated urine infection in my late teens, which has led to a lifelong hell for me?"" Since 2014, the UK has cut the amount of antibiotics it uses by more than 7% but the number of drug-resistant bloodstream infections increased by 35% from 2013 to 2017. As part of the government's plans, there will be a drive to reduce infections contracted during operations and guidance for clinicians on how to prescribe antibiotics appropriately. Research has previously found,externalthat the medicines are often prescribed for conditions that are normally self-healing, such as sore throats, or for viruses, which do not even respond to antibiotics. By 2025, the plans aim to: cut the number of drug-resistant infections by 5,000 (10%) be preventing at least 15,000 patients each year from contracting infections as a result of their healthcare Drugs companies are paid for the amount of antibiotics they sell. The government says this has led to a ""market failure"" where companies are incentivised to sell existing antibiotics, rather than innovate and develop new treatments for infections where they are most needed. By changing to a model where companies are paid based on how valuable the medicines are to the NHS, the government hopes companies will start to invest in the development of new, high-priority drugs. Mike Thompson, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said pharmaceutical companies were ""ready and waiting"" to start testing the new model to support antibiotics research and development in 2019. He added: ""The UK has shown international leadership in raising the profile of this global health threat and today reinforces its commitment to finding solutions to the issues which have hampered the development of new medicines for so long.""

The impact of the government shutdown 'I can't get my meds' All you need to know about Trump's wall Democrats have argued that with so many federal employees furloughed - temporarily laid off - or working without pay, the high-profile State of the Union address, which involves both chambers of Congress and the president, would not be logistically feasible. But Mr Trump has denied that there were any security concerns posed by the ongoing partial shutdown. He also rejected suggestions that he could deliver the speech from the White House or another location. This video can not be played Boy sells art to help mother through shutdown What isMrsPelosi's position? In early January, the House speaker, the third most powerful politician in the US, had invited Mr Trump to address Congress on the agreed-upon date of the 29th. ""At that time, there was no thought that the government would still be shut down,"" Mrs Pelosi said in her letter on Wednesday. ""I am writing to inform you that the House of Representatives will not consider a concurrent resolution authorising the President's State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened."" ""Again, I look forward to welcoming you to the House on a mutually agreeable date for this address when government has been opened."" This video can not be played The return of the woman Republicans love to hate Mrs Pelosi had first asked for the State of the Union,an agenda-setting speech by the president, to be delayed on 16 January, citing an unfunded Secret Service and Department of Homeland Security. In retaliation, Mr Trump last week denied Mrs Pelosi the use of military aircraft on a trip to Brussels and Afghanistan - less than an hour before her flight was due to depart. He asked her to stay to negotiate an end to the partial US government shutdown. For much of Wednesday it appeared that Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi were headed for a dramatic confrontation over when and where he would give his State of the Union Address. Then the president backed down. The speech standoff was always a game within a game - a symbolic fight for the battle over the government shutdown, which in turn is a proxy battle for which party will set policy priorities for the next two years. It won't be long before it's clear whether the president's retreat marks the beginning of the end for his line-in-the-sand demand for wall funding. The Senate votes on two measures to reopen the government on Thursday - the first with wall funding and the other without. Both are expected to fail, but the pressure could be growing on Republicans to support the measure to reopen the government temporarily, allow furloughed workers to collect back pay and give the president an opportunity to deliver his State of the Union Address. If the measure goes down in flames, the shutdown will drag into next week. Then it's back to the drawing board, with hints of new ""compromise"" proposals to come but no firm idea of how a deal can be made.

"This video can not be played More and more Poles are coming back from the UK, Mr Morawiecki says Poland's prime minister says he wants to see more workers return from the UK to help its domestic economy grow. Mateusz Morawiecki told the BBC that ""more and more are coming back and I'm pleased about that because there is a low level of unemployment... Give us our people back"". But he said people who want to stay in the UK should be allowed to, ""and be treated exactly as they are now"". He said Prime Minister Theresa May had given him that commitment. Speaking at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Mr Morawiecki said there was a low level of unemployment in Poland and 5.5% GDP growth. ""So I would hope that many Poles would come back to Poland,"" he said. Mr Morawiecki is desperate for the UK to avoid a hard Brexit - an outcome he says would be damaging for the UK, Poland and the whole EU. Poland has been critical of the way the EU has handled the Brexit negotiations. Its foreign minister, Jacek Czaputowicz, has recently suggested that the Irish backstop should be time-limited to five years. The backstop would keep the UK in a customs union with the EU until future arrangements are agreed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. MPs 'playing Russian Roulette over Brexit' What are Germany's no-deal Brexit plans? This was seen by many in the UK as a crack in the solidarity of the EU27's negotiating position and was dismissed by the European Commission. The Polish prime minister said his minister's comments were an attempt to be more creative in the fight for any compromise that avoided a hard Brexit. However, he told the BBC that the negotiation was now over and the ball was now in Mrs May's court. I asked if he shared the emerging consensus among business and political leaders that no-deal was getting less and less likely. ""I do get that sense, I see that sterling is strengthening and that may be because of this,"" he replied. His comments follow remarks by the former chancellor George Osborne, who told the BBC that a delay of Brexit was now the most likely outcome. However, International Trade Secretary Dr Liam Fox warned that political and business leaders gathered at Davos were becoming far too complacent in assuming that a no-deal Brexit would be averted and that could prove costly for them as well as the UK. ""Some countries believe that no-deal is not possible so think - why should I put the work in? It's my job to remind them that it is a possibility and you need to get that work done.""

"Real Madrid has topped the table of the world's 20 richest football clubs, displacing Manchester United with record revenues of â¬750.9m (Â£674.6m). Man Utd slipped to third with Barcelona making it the first Spanish one-two since 2014-15, said Deloitte. Its Football Money League, based on season 2017-18, also shows the combined revenues of the top 20 clubs has risen 6% to â¬8.3bn (Â£7.4bn), a new record. There were a record six English Premier League clubs in the top 10. The list, the 22nd of its kind, only looks at revenues and does not take into account club debts. This gap this year between the top two places was the second widest yet, with â¬60.5m between the leading pair. Real Madrid won their third successive Champions League, beating Liverpool 3-1 in Kiev last May. That helped raise income for Los Blancos, who have now topped Deloitte's money league 12 times. Real Madrid revenues were boosted by a third consecutive Champions League win The club experienced commercial growth of â¬54.8m, including an increase in sponsorship and merchandising revenues, as well as exploitation of increasingly lucrative pre-season tour matches. At â¬356.2m, Real Madrid now have the highest commercial revenue of any football club globally, contributing to those world-record revenues. Dan Jones, head of Deloitte's sports business group, said: ""Real Madrid's outstanding financial performance in 2017-18 is built on their long history of success on the pitch, most recently three consecutive Champions League titles. ""This has enabled the club to continue to drive commercial revenue as the appetite to partner with Europe's most successful clubs remains stronger than ever."" He said most of Deloitte's top 10 of our top 10 were through to the round of 16 in this season's Champions League and forecasting further revenue growth. Bayern Munich and Manchester City completed the top five, retaining their positions from the past two years. Paris St-Germain, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, and Tottenham Hotspur occupied places six to 10, with Spurs making it into the top tier for only the second time, having last appeared in 2006-07. Everton were in 17th spot, Newcastle United 19th, and West Ham United 20th. All the 20 clubs represented are from the ""big five"" European leagues, with Italy having four places, Germany and Spain contributing three clubs, and France one. Other findings include: Spurs have capitalised on playing a full season at Wembley Stadium which has seen match-day revenue increase by 54% Paris Saint-Germain have reversed two consecutive years of decline AS Roma and AC Milan return to the top 20 thanks to performances in Uefa competition Turkish giants Besiktas have achieved their highest ever ranking, at 26th ""The substantial presence of Premier League clubs continues to be felt in this year's Deloitte Football Money League,"" said Deloitte's Sam Boor. ""However, with the Premier League's tender for the next cycle of domestic rights from 2019-20 complete and sale of overseas rights nearing conclusion, it is clear that Premier League clubs will be unable to rely on explosive growth in broadcast distributions as a source of future growth, as has been the case in recent years, ""As a result, we expect an even greater emphasis among these clubs on generating their own growth in the coming season, and in particular the optimisation of commercial revenue, which has been a key area for differentiating growth across most of Europe's leading clubs in recent years.""

"Holly Burke was off duty when she was killed A man has appeared in court charged with killing an off-duty PCSO whose car was hit by a vehicle being pursued by police. Holly Burke, 28, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash in Lordswood Road, Birmingham, on Tuesday night. Darren Ogom, 42, did not enter a plea to a charge of causing death by dangerous driving when he appeared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court. He was remanded in custody to appear at the city's crown court on 21 February. Mr Ogom spoke only to confirm his name, address and nationality during a five-minute hearing. He is accused of causing Ms Burke's death by driving a silver Renault Megane Scenic dangerously. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Police said the vehicle had been involved in a 15-minute police pursuit before it collided with Ms Burke's car in the Bearwood area of the city. Mr Ogom, of Longdales Road, Kings Norton, also faces charges of driving without a licence, driving with no insurance and failing to stop for a police officer. Holly Burke had been a PCSO for 14 months Ms Burke had been a police community support officer (PCSO) with West Midlands Police for 14 months. Ch Supt Kenny Bell said it was ""a desperately sad time for everyone who knew Holly"". Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson described Ms Burke's death as ""truly tragic"" and said she was ""greatly valued"" by the force and the communities she served. The force said the circumstances surrounding the crash had been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct which said it has been gathering evidence including body-worn and in-car footage.

"Drug-resistant superbugs are as big a threat as climate change, the health secretary will say as he unveils a new five-year plan to tackle the problem. Overuse of antibiotics is making infections harder to treat and leading to thousands of deaths a year through drug-resistant superbugs. The government plans to change the way it funds drug companies to encourage them to develop new medicines. It is also increasing efforts to cut unnecessary use of the drugs. The government's plan aims to control and contain antimicrobial resistance - a term that covers drug resistance in bacteria, viruses, parasites and other infections - by 2040, and reduce the use of antibiotics in humans by 15% over the next five years. It also plans to cut antibiotic use in animals by 25% from 2016 levels by next year. What is antibiotic resistance? The drugs advisory body, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, and NHS England will also trial a new payment model that means pharmaceutical companies will be paid for drugs based on how valuable the medicines are to the NHS, rather than by the quantity of drugs sold. Health Secretary Matt Hancock, launching the government's 20-year vision at the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, will say: ""Each and every one of us benefits from antibiotics but we all too easily take them for granted and I shudder at the thought of a world in which their power is diminished. ""Antimicrobial resistance is as big a danger to humanity as climate change or warfare. That's why we need an urgent global response."" Catherine Williams has been on and off antibiotics since she was a teenager For more than a decade, Catherine Williams has been battling an infection drugs can keep at bay but not defeat. A urinary tract infection (UTI) as a teenager failed to properly respond to antibiotics and has since repeatedly returned, leaving her in serious pain and even requiring hospital treatment. Because the infection was caused by bacteria in her body that are resistant to the main form of antibiotics for UTIs, cephalosporins, and another type, gentamicin, it has never fully cleared. It has meant that the 32-year-old has needed to take antibiotics on and off ever since, just to keep the infection at bay. Some of her infections have been so bad they have required hospital treatment. Physically run-down and emotionally low, Catherine has had to take strong painkillers and steroids for the pain in her bladder. ""It's horrific,"" she said. ""The pain, you're bedbound until you're back on antibiotics and that's frightening, knowing that I have to stay on them to function normally. ""Every time I come off them it comes straight back. ""Why can't they cure something as simple as what I thought was an uncomplicated urine infection in my late teens, which has led to a lifelong hell for me?"" Since 2014, the UK has cut the amount of antibiotics it uses by more than 7% but the number of drug-resistant bloodstream infections increased by 35% from 2013 to 2017. As part of the government's plans, there will be a drive to reduce infections contracted during operations and guidance for clinicians on how to prescribe antibiotics appropriately. Research has previously found,externalthat the medicines are often prescribed for conditions that are normally self-healing, such as sore throats, or for viruses, which do not even respond to antibiotics. By 2025, the plans aim to: cut the number of drug-resistant infections by 5,000 (10%) be preventing at least 15,000 patients each year from contracting infections as a result of their healthcare Drugs companies are paid for the amount of antibiotics they sell. The government says this has led to a ""market failure"" where companies are incentivised to sell existing antibiotics, rather than innovate and develop new treatments for infections where they are most needed. By changing to a model where companies are paid based on how valuable the medicines are to the NHS, the government hopes companies will start to invest in the development of new, high-priority drugs. Mike Thompson, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said pharmaceutical companies were ""ready and waiting"" to start testing the new model to support antibiotics research and development in 2019. He added: ""The UK has shown international leadership in raising the profile of this global health threat and today reinforces its commitment to finding solutions to the issues which have hampered the development of new medicines for so long.""

"This video can not be played Police IT system 'pushed us to the edge' (Officers played by actors) A police IT system is ""unfit for purpose"" and causing some criminals to escape justice, officers have told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Nine forces in England and Wales use Athena, which promised to speed up the detection of crimes. But officers say it regularly crashes and is overly complicated, meaning some cases are not built in time or dropped. Developers Northgate Public Services apologised for problems ""in small areas"", which it says it is fixing. A joint response from the nine police forces said Athena - which has cost Â£35m over the past 10 years - had been ""resilient and stable, although no system is perfect"". The system was introduced following a government directive for forces to share intelligence after the Soham murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, in 2002. Officers say the intelligence-sharing function works well but problems arise when they use the system to build cases for the Crown Prosecution Service. The delays it causes means officers can struggle to get the information together in time to charge suspects or the cases are not up to a high-enough standard and are dropped. Serving officers at Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Essex told the programme the process could now take up to twice as long. We have not named the officers because they could face disciplinary action for speaking out. Their comments included: ""The first two weeks it was brought in were the worst two weeks of my entire career. It's overly bureaucratic. It doesn't understand the police investigative process at all. From day one, it malfunctioned. Four years on, it is still malfunctioning"" ""It often requires information that is totally irrelevant and if you miss just one data entry point (like whether a solicitor is male or female), I have to reject the whole case and send it back to the officer"" ""Even for a simple shoplift, I probably have to press about 50 buttons, with a 30-second minimum loading time between each task"" ""There have been incidents where charges have been dropped because of the inadequacies of the system. There have been cases of assaults, albeit fairly minor assaults, but these are still people who should be facing criminal charges"" ""It slows the whole criminal justice system down. At the moment, it is not fit for purpose. This is the most challenging time I have come across. We're at breaking point already. This has pushed some officers over the edge"" ""When you've got detainees in a custody block who've got various illnesses and ailments, medical conditions that are all recorded on there and they need medication at certain times - it became very dangerous because we were unable to access the records"" The nine forces - which also include those in Cambridgeshire, Kent, Norfolk, Suffolk, Warwickshire and West Mercia - said in a joint statement that they had been working with the supplier to identify and correct issues as they arose. ""Over the 12 months up to November 2018, there have only been 72 hours of total downtime and there are detailed plans in place of how to manage business when this occurs."" Northgate Public Services, which created Athena, said 40,000 officers accessed the system and benefited from improved criminal intelligence. But it said it was working to make improvements to the ""complex system"". ""We recognise there are a small number of areas of the solution where improvements can be made and we apologise for any difficulties this has caused. ""We are working hard with the customer and other parties to make these improvements as a priority.""

"A woman wearing a ""hungry hostage"" headband protests on Capitol Hill President Donald Trump's standoff with Democrats over funding for his proposed border wall has resulted in the longest government shutdown in US history. How has it affected American life so far? Mr Trump insists the government will stay closed until he gets that funding, and as the shutdown enters day 34, Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have remained equally firm that there will be no congressional funding for a wall. A quarter of the federal government has been unfunded since 22 December, leaving 800,000 employees without pay. Here is some of the misery Washington's political gridlock is inflicting on the nation at large. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers, who oversee airport security, have been calling in sick or quitting as the shutdown drags on, though the agency insists standards have not been compromised. Flight traffic controllers are alsofeeling the effects of the shutdown,external, working long shifts to cope with with record low numbers of fully-certified staff to handle over 43,000 daily flights. On Wednesday, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association the Air Line Pilots Association, and the Association of Flight Attendants released a bleak joint statement. ""We cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break. It is unprecedented."" President Sara Nelson of the flight attendant's association has alsocalled for a general nationwide worker's strike,externalto end the shutdown. Resources at the Federal Bureau of Investigation are quickly running out, according to a new report comprised of agent stories from across the nation. Thomas O'Connor of the FBI Agents Association said in a statement: ""The resources available to support the work of FBI agents are currently stretched to the breaking point and are dwindling day by day."" The report reveals,externalthe shutdown has impacted criminal, counter-terrorism and intelligence work, delaying sensitive investigations and compromising many basic operations. Coast Guard families pick up groceries at a food pantry As federal workers are due to miss their second paychecks of 2019,Coast Guard commandant Adm Karl Schultz,externalsaid it was ""unacceptable that USCG members must rely on food pantries and donations to get through day-to-day life"". ""You, as members of the armed forces, should not be expected to shoulder this burden."" On Wednesday, Democratic Representative Derek Kilmer of Washington statetold The Hill,externala food pantry for Coast Guard members in his district has already run out of food. Around 8,500 Coast Guard civilian employees were offered a ""managing your finances during a furlough""tip sheet,externalearlier this month, including budgeting suggestions like having a garage sale or monetising hobbies. In addition to pay, these employees are missing federal housing subsidies that help offset their expensive coastal housing, according to the Washington Post.

According to internet services website Netcraft, more than 80 security certificates used by .gov websites have expired. US shutdown leaves websites insecure The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has suspended all non-essential work, causing nationwide concerns over unsafe food as most inspections have stopped. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb on Wednesday said the agency was working to ensure ""high risk"" facility checks continue. He said about one third of the FDA's food inspections are considered high risk, looking at goods like cheese, fresh produce and seafood. ""It's not business as usual, and we are not doing all the things we would do under normal circumstances,"" Mr Gottliebtold NBC News,external.

The current backlog is already over 800,000. Immigration courts have been dealing with high numbers of cases and these indefinite delays will have a ""devastating impact"",Judge Dana Leigh Marks told PBS,external. Faced with deteriorating and increasingly hazardous conditions, including waste buildup and unsafe roads, National Parks across the country are struggling to stay open during the shutdown. With a skeleton staff unable to respond quickly to emergencies, at least seven people have died in parks since the shutdown,the Washington Post reported,external.

"The US government has been partially shutdown for the longest time in history ""Now that I have nothing to help me stabilise my mood, I'm just very worried that I'm going to start having more bad days than good days."" Jazz Sexton works for the US government - or at least did until just before Christmas. She's not been to work since 21 December and is running out of money, which means she's been unable to renew her anti-depressants prescription. Since then the US government has been partially shut down, with President Donald Trump refusing to approve a budget unless it includes $5.7bn (Â£4.43bn) to fund a wall on the border with Mexico - something the opposition Democratic Party has rejected. ""I thought for sure it could not last more than two weeks,"" Jazz, who works as a trainee for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), told Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""Everyone who I was in training with, we were a little excited at the prospect of having a few days off with a shutdown because Christmas was on a Tuesday, so we had Monday and Tuesday off and we thought well, if there's a shutdown for the rest of the week for Christmas, that's OK. Jazz lives with and looks after her elderly parents ""Obviously now I was a little naive in that because we're in our fourth week. And it's been very difficult."" The shutdown, which Jazz says she blames on President Trump and ""racist rhetoric in the US"", has affected about a quarter of the federal government - meaning 800,000 employees haven't been paid. Jazz joined the IRS in October and didn't have any savings from her previous job. She says that with no end to the shutdown in sight, she's down to her last couple of hundred dollars - which is needed to help out with rent. And because she joined so recently, her healthcare hadn't been properly processed before the shutdown. ""So I haven't been able to renew my prescriptions for my medication that I've been on for the last few years,"" Jazz says. ""I've had to wean myself off 40mg tablets, down to 20mgs and then down to 10mgs. And yesterday was my very last day - I don't have any more."" This is a quarter of an anti-depressant pill - the last one Jazz had Jazz says the anti-depressants she needs cost anywhere between $900 and $1000 (between Â£700 and Â£800) for between 30 and 90 days of medication - money she simply doesn't have. ""It means I just can't predict how I'm going to feel from day to day. I'm having a pretty good day today, I feel like everything's alright today. ""A couple days ago I felt like I just wanted to go to sleep and not wake up again. I felt like all of my choices that I've ever made in life were just terrible choices and that I'm bad at being a person."" The stress of not knowing when she'll be able to go back to work isn't helping, but Jazz is doing what she can to help her mental health - going on walks, exercising. She's also used some of the time off to apply for other jobs. ""When I started this job with the IRS, I felt that this was my pathway to financial stability, finally. Obviously at this moment it is not that. ""I'd like to stay with the IRS, but if this is going to go on as President Trump said for months, or even years, I have no idea at this point. So I'm looking into finding that financial stability that I need."" Jazz has swapped reading books for applying for jobs Timothy Nicholson is an economist at the Environment Protection Agency (EPA). And despite not being paid since 28 December, he insists he's ""one of the lucky ones"". ""I don't have a family to take care of or any kids so I was able to save enough money to hopefully get through the next few months."" His friends weren't quite so fortunate though. ""I didn't buy very many Christmas gifts. It sort of seemed like a shutdown was in the works for a little while, so I definitely cut back on my spending quite a bit from then until now."" The 26-year-old says he's been reducing the amount of money he pays back on his student loans over the past year so that he could save for a potential emergency like this. But even that might not be enough. ""Right now I'm OK but if this goes on for much longer, I'm going to start panicking."" Government workers have been protesting in Washington Both Jazz and Timothy stressed that while things can seem pretty bad for them, it's worse for other people. ""Most government employees don't get paid all that much to begin with so it's definitely pretty tough for others,"" Timothy says. ""I've seen a few new food banks temporarily open here in DC. ""One particular chef, Jose Andres, has been great in terms of making sure that workers who are downtown are able to get free lunches - and he's also opening a new food kitchen for government workers on Wednesday here, which is very nice of him."" Jazz is worried that if the government shutdown rolls on into February, it will start to seriously affect people who rely on state benefits. ""Some people rely on welfare completely for their income. That goes towards food, and if they don't have that the food banks might be overflowing with people, and it's just a huge strain on the resources for everyone in the country."" Government shutdowns aren't all that unusual, but this one is now the longest in US history - and it doesn't look like either side is ready to budge. There has been speculation that President Trump could declare a state of emergency in order to bypass Congress and get the money he wants for his wall. He called that the ""easy way out"" though, saying he'd prefer Congress to solve the problem. ""If they can't do it... I will declare a national emergency. I have the absolute right,"" he added. For Jazz, an end to the shutdown would mean not only job stability but stability in terms of health too. ""If the shutdown were to end, the federal government would be able to process my health insurance application as a new hire for the IRS and I would be able to renew my prescriptions and continue to be a healthy individual.""

"The chief inspector of probation said ""it's a very troubling picture indeed"" Not enough is being done to protect the public in England and Wales from sex offenders, inspectors for the prison and probation services have found. In two cases, convicted sex offenders who should have been put in monitored bail hostels after leaving jail were allowed to stay in budget hotels. The warnings are in a new report, following the first inspection to focus on sex offenders in nine years. The government has promised to tackle the ""very serious"" concerns raised. Catching a paedophile: The team tracking down paedophiles Sex offenders jail near school plan pulled Sex offender therapy in prison 'fails' In their joint review, released on Thursday, the separate watchdogs for prisons and probation said urgent action was needed to make sure that managing sex offenders is a national priority. The chief inspector of probation, Dame Glenys Stacey, said: ""The public might be assuming that all possible work is done in prisons and in the community [to reduce the risk to the public] and that is simply not the case."" Much of the work in custody to address sexual re-offending was said to be ""poor"", the report said. It found: Courses to stop re-offending, known as accredited programmes, were not used enough. Out of 120 probation cases inspected, only 17 offenders of the 42 ordered to start a programme had done so Proper safeguarding checks were not being carried out - in one in three cases, children were not being protected properly Four in 10 sex offenders who had been released from prison were doing no work at all to reduce the risk of re-offending One third of offenders had not been visited at home after leaving prison, a visit that would allow staff to check up on them In 42 cases, the offender - after leaving jail - should have faced enforcement action for missing appointments, breaching licence conditions or re-offending. But in nearly half of cases, no action was taken The report says a 25% shortfall of places in approved premises - also known as probation or bail hostels where prisoners can be safely monitored on release - meant some sex offenders were placed in unsuitable accommodation. One man, assessed as posing a high risk of harm after serving four years in jail, spent at least two weeks in a budget hotel. ""We found it hard to see how such accommodation could be defensible in terms of protecting the public,"" the inspectors said. ""Other hotel residents are likely to be transient and close monitoring of the offender problematic."" In another case, one inmate had used another prisoner's phone account to contact his victim. The jail was too slow to react and had not monitored the inmate's communications as would be expected, the inspection found. There were 13,535 inmates serving prison terms for sex offences in England and Wales,according to the latest figures,externalin June 2018. That is almost a fifth of the total prison population. The number of prisoners serving immediate custodial sentences for sex offences is at its highest level in 17 years. The last inspection of this kind was carried out in 2010. Since then, the number of registered sex offenders has increased from 34,939 to 58,637in March 2018.,external The inspectors examined 53 cases across five male prisons and studied 120 probation cases. Dame Glenys said: ""With many probation staff unsure what to do for the best with sexual offenders under probation supervision, the public are not sufficiently protected. This makes no sense."" Meanwhile separately, the head of charity the Howard League for Penal Reform, has warned there could be more victims of sexual crimes if funding for a national support scheme to help rehabilitate sex offenders is cut. The scheme - called Circles of Support and Accountability and which sees volunteers meet convicted sex offenders - is at risk as its funding is being cut by the National Probation Service. Charity boss Frances Crook said: ""What will happen is the men coming out of prison or given a community sentence will not get the support they need, they will just be dumped into local communities and I fear that that could mean that those men may go on to commit another crime and create more victims and nobody wants that."" The Ministry of Justice said it was ""absolutely not standard practice to release sex offenders into hotels"" - and where possible, they would be released to ""stable, risk-assessed accommodation"". Sometimes in exceptional circumstances, sex offenders might need to be placed temporarily in hotels but it would follow a ""comprehensive risk-assessment"" to ensure no risk to the public, the government added. Rory Stewart, the minister for prisons and probation, said: ""We have already introduced a new director general role for probation to develop a dedicated approach to managing sex offenders, and we are expanding supervised accommodation, investing in training and deploying specially trained probation officers to focus on sex offenders in prison. ""However, the inspectors raise very serious concerns - we will get to the bottom of the problems this report raises and tackle them one by one.""

"This video can not be played Charlotte Brown's sister Katie says Jack Shepherd has shown ""unbelievable arrogance"" The family of a woman who died in a speedboat crash on the Thames believe her killer showed ""unbelievable arrogance"" when he appeared on TV. Jack Shepherd went into hiding in Georgia before a trial where he was found guilty of the manslaughter of 24-year-old Charlotte Brown. Ms Brown's sister Katie said her family felt ""increasingly angry"" after he told reporters he was innocent. Shepherd is expected to make his first court appearance in Tbilisi on Friday. He told a Georgian TV channel he hoped ""justice will be done... and that everyone can move forward with their lives"", before handing himself in to police in Tbilisi. But Ms Brown said she believed her sister's killer had given himself up ""for purely selfish reasons"". ""All he's thinking about is himself and his feelings,"" she said. Shepherd's lawyer confirmed the 31-year-old will appear at Tbilisi City Court at 13:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Friday. Shepherd took Charlotte Brown on a date in December 2015 While the family were ""relieved"" to see Shepherd in custody, Ms Brown said they felt ""shocked"" to see him ""just stroll into the police station smiling and waving, it was unbelievable arrogance"". ""Whilst he's been off in Georgia, he claims that he went to see friends and he has always wanted to see the scenery there - almost like he was claiming it was a holiday. ""He is not thinking about Charli, us, respect for the legal system, all he is thinking about is himself and his feelings,"" Ms Brown said. Speedboat killer hands himself in to police Victim was 'my best friend' The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error Shepherd was sentenced in his absence to six years jail in July for the manslaughter of Charlotte Brown. They had met online and on their first date on 8 December 2015, the pair had dinner then went on the web designer's speedboat. They were both thrown from the boat near Wandsworth Bridge at about midnight. Shepherd was found clinging to the hull while Ms Brown, from Clacton in Essex, was pulled from the water unconscious and unresponsive. Shepherd's boat was found to have several defects In his TV interview, Shepherd said UK authorities had ""rightly"" treated the crash as an accident initially, but ""after significant pressure by her father, the police decided to prosecute me for manslaughter"". However, Graham Brown toldthe Victoria Derbyshire programmethat was ""very misleading and inaccurate"". ""It was totally out of my control. The CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] made the decision to get the case reviewed, because of its complexities, by the serious homicide squad,"" he said. The CPS said it was ""not accurate that we ever made a decision not to charge Mr Shepherd"" and it was ""not unusual to instruct Queen's Counsel to provide advice"". Jack Shepherd is being held in a pre-trial detention centre in Tbilisi Tariel Kakabadze, Shepherd's lawyer in Georgia, said his client was ""extremely sad"" about Charlotte Brown's death but believed he was innocent. Shepherd is currently being held in a pre-trial detention centre ahead of his court appearance. Speaking about whether Shepherd will contest extradition, Mr Kakabadze said he would ""discuss it with my client... after we carefully study all the possibilities and options"". BBC correspondent Rayhan Demytrie said the process was expected to take ""several weeks"" because there were numerous formalities involved with it. Don't be surprised if Shepherd is not chalking up the days of his sentence in a British cell for some time to come. If Shepherd were in an EU state, the European Arrest Warrant system would have seen him bundled onto a plane almost as fast as it takes anyone to read the 599-page Brexit withdrawal agreement. Georgia, not being an EU state, is a signatory to a secondary and far slower international extradition deal. While it is by no means as efficient as the EAW, it at least sets out the principles of how to proceed with the UK's request for Shepherd's return. British diplomats will confirm what documents Georgia's judges need to see from our prosecutors and courts - that's expected to be a legal explanation of what Shepherd was accused of and an account of his trial and conviction. Manslaughter is is an internationally-recognised serious crime - so the UK's request for the return of a killer should be automatically recognised as valid, in the same way that such a request from Georgia would be acted on. It's then down to how long Georgia's courts need to reach a final decision, including considering any appeal that Shepherd mounts. So things will take a little longer - and possibly a lot longer if he tries to convince a judge that a man who went on the run from his own trial is a victim of an injustice. The CPS is currently drafting an extradition request to bring Shepherd back to the UK. The British Embassy in Georgia said authorities from both countries were ""cooperating closely"" over the case. Under theterms of extradition from Georgia,,externala person ""shall be extradited to a foreign state for such crimes that both under the legislation of Georgia and that of the foreign state concerned are punishable by at least imprisonment for one year or by a stricter punishment"". ""In the case of a convicted person, it is necessary that the person be sentenced to at least four months of imprisonment."" Shepherd made his first appearance at the Old Bailey on 26 January 2018, when he entered a not guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. He was released on unconditional bail by Judge Richard Marks QC, but failed to show up for his trial in July. After his conviction an international arrest warrant was issued. Despite being on the run, Shepherdwon the right to appeal against his conviction.

"The paramilitary group EOKA fought a guerrilla campaign against the British presence in Cyprus Thirty-three Cypriots who claimed they were tortured by British forces during an armed uprising in the late 1950s are to be awarded Â£1m damages, to be shared between them, by the UK government. The group was arrested on suspicion of being part of paramilitary organisation EOKA, which fought a guerrilla campaign to overthrow British control in Cyprus. One woman, aged 16 at the time, said she was repeatedly raped by soldiers. The government said the settlement was not ""any admission of liability"". The 1955-59 rebellion was known as the Cyprus Emergency, during which the governor enacted draconian laws, flooding the island with thousands of soldiers and increasing the size of the police force. Some 371 British military personnel died during the emergency. Dark clouds of history over sun-kissed island,external The claimants - now in their 70s and 80s and in poor health - have had to wait almost 60 years to seek justice for their injuries, because the government documents outlining their treatment were classified and out of reach until 2012. Cristos Socratous says he still suffers nightmares after being beaten by British soldiers Cristos Socratous said he was about 18 when he was picked up by British soldiers, detained and beaten every day for 28 days. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people in British uniforms and civilian clothes stripped him naked, deprived him of sleep and interrogated him about planting a bomb, which he denied. ""I was so tired I couldn't stand. The pain was very bad. They had these big police truncheons and they hit me on my arms, my stomach, my chest, my legs,"" he said. After four weeks they released him, his face bloodied. ""I didn't go back to my parents' house because I didn't want my parents to see me like that,"" he said. It took about six months to recover, but Mr Socratous, who now lives in Ilford, east London, said he still suffers nightmares. ""I'm still scared,"" he said. But he declined to say if he had any involvement with EOKA, the armed group that fought against British rule. ""Whatever I did, it was for myself,"" he said. The most serious case involved the 16-year-old, who said she was detained and repeatedly raped by men she described in court documents as soldiers. She said she was then beaten for days before being forced to wear a noose in a mock execution. Her medical report revealed she has suffered lifelong physical and mental torture which has made forming relationships difficult. Anti-British demonstrations took place in Greece in the late 1950s Another man lost a kidney as a result of his interrogation in a notorious facility in Limassol, known as the Red House, and was jailed for several months for carrying leaflets supporting the EOKA forces. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme in November 2017 Demetrios Glykis recalled being chased through the streets by British military police. ""They were swearing at me, I was very scared. They threw me in their car, the back of a Land Rover and said 'we will fix you up, you bastard Greek',"" he said. ""One of officers came up to me and gave me a slap in the face. My head almost came off. My eardrum broke. ""I can't get my health back. I just want justice."" Though it has taken since 2015 to reach this settlement, the government has consistently denied liability, saying too much time has passed for a court to decide who was responsible. In a written ministerial statement, Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said: ""The settlement does not constitute any admission of liability and is not a precedent in respect of any potential future claims against the government. ""However, the government has settled the case in order to draw a line under this litigation and to avoid the further escalation of costs, which would ultimately be borne by the taxpayer."" He added: ""It is a matter of regret for the UK government that the transition of Cyprus from British administration to independence should have been preceded by five years of violence and loss of life, affecting all residents of the island."" The Army continues to operate military bases in Cyprus, not far from the city of Limassol The small firm of Birmingham solicitors which took on the case said there was ample evidence of violent treatment, but it welcomed the settlement which has brought to an end a lengthy, costly and occasionally bitter legal battle over a dark part of Britain's colonial history. The claimants described their suffering as a stain on British history that has now been put to bed. Sir Alan said that in reaching the settlement, the UK has reaffirmed its highest respect for the memory and sacrifice of British and Cypriot service personnel and employees of the Crown who gave their lives.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has refused to join the talks until Mrs May rules out the UK leaving the EU with no deal, which he says would bring ""chaos"" to the country. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March. Fresh referendum 'doesn't have MP numbers' Brexit uncertainty is disgrace, says Airbus Give our people back, says Poland's leader Brexit: A really simple guide Mrs May met Ms O'Grady, Unite leader Len McCluskey, Tim Roache of the GMB and Dave Prentis of Unison at Downing Street on Thursday. TUC General Secretary Ms O'Grady said workers were worried about their jobs and needed reassurances about their future. ""We have a prime minister on a temporary contract - she cannot bind the hands of a future prime minister,"" she said. ""People wanting her job are on record as saying Brexit is an opportunity to reduce workers' rights. ""The prime minister, frankly, has to stop playing to the bad boys at the back of the class and start listening to where I think Parliament is, which is wanting no deal off the table and more time for genuine talks to take place."" Please upgrade your browser Unite union leader Mr McCluskey, a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, said he was ""not full of optimism"" after his meeting with Mrs May. But he said the talks had been a chance to ""re-emphasise"" that a no-deal Brexit would be ""disastrous"". ""Is this just a PR stunt for the mediaâ¦ or this a genuine attempt to see if we can talk about issues that matter to us?,"" he said. ""Warm words are one thing but action is needed."" He said a nine-month delay to Article 50 -  the process taking the UK out of the EU at the end of March - would be ""too long"", but he would like an extension of three months. And he said Mr Corbyn was ""correct"" not to hold Brexit talks with Theresa May because leaders from other parties, such as the SNP and the Lib Dems, had been made to look ""rather stupid"" for doing so. It was different for union leaders, he added. Unite union leader Len McCluskey says he would like a three-month extension of Article 50 Unison leader Dave Prentis said he believed it to be ""in everyone's interest"" that Article 50 was extended and urged Mrs May to stop ""appeasing the right wing"" of her party while Mr Roache also asked for an extension but added that ""most important of all"" was ruling out the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Mrs May is hoping to tweak her deal to address concerns about the ""backstop"" among her own backbenchers and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, which she relies on to keep her in power, ahead of another vote on her proposed way forward next Tuesday. The backstop is the ""insurance policy"" in the withdrawal deal, intended to ensure that whatever else happens, there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU. Rees-Mogg: Brexit deal could be 'reformed' Are Brexiteers softening on May's deal? Both the UK and the EU believe that bringing back border checks could put the peace process at risk but critics say the backstop keeps Northern Ireland too closely aligned with the EU and separate from the rest of the UK - and that the UK could be permanently trapped in it. However Irish PM Leo Varadkarsaid the UK would find it ""very difficult"" to do trade dealsafter Brexit, if it has not resolved the Irish border issue. Mrs May has not ruled out the prospect of the UK leaving the EU without a deal and has said the only way to prevent it is to leave with her deal. But Business Minister Richard Harrington spoke out against a no-deal Brexit, at a meeting of business people at the German embassy on Thursday. He said: ""Crashing out is a disaster for businessâ¦ Airbus is correct to say it publicly and I'm delighted they have done so."" He said he was ""happy"" to continue in his role, but added: ""I quite understand if the prime minister thinks I'm not the right person to be business minister.""

Labour MP Yvette Cooper has tabled one that would give time for a bill to suspend the Article 50 process for leaving the EU to the end of the year if a new deal has not been agreed with Brussels by the end of February. It is is backed by several Remainer Conservatives and is the only amendment that would be legally binding on the government, if passed. Her Labour colleague, Rachel Reeves, has also tabled an amendment to extend Article 50. Other amendments would ask the government to consider a range of options over six full days in Parliament before the March deadline, to set up a ""Citizens' Assembly"" to give the public more say or to insist on ""an expiry date to the backstop"". Plans by a group of Tory and Labour MPs to table an amendment on another EU referendum have been dropped, but the Lib Dems will be tabling an amendment calling for a ""People's Vote"". It will be up to Speaker John Bercow to select amendments to put to the vote. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC's Hardtalk he believes it is ""highly likely"" Labour's front bench will support Ms Cooper's amendment but that it first had to go through the party's  ""normal process"". Party leader Mr Corbyn said the decision had not yet been made. Read more about the amendments here The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier reiterated on Germany's Deutschlandfunk radio that there can be no time-limit on the proposed backstop. ""If nothing moves, if no positive suggestions are put on the table, then we will be heading for a more or less bumpy or accidental no-deal on 30 March,"" he said. Mr Barnier also played down suggestions that the two-year Article 50 process ought to be extended, saying: ""I personally believe that we do not need so much more time, but that we now need to make decisions, to be taken by the British government and the Parliament of Great Britain.""

"Airbus has warned that it could move wing-building out of the UK in the future if there is a no-deal Brexit. The planemaker's chief executive, Tom Enders, said Airbus ""will have to make potentially very harmful decisions for the UK"" in the event of no deal. He said it was a ""disgrace"" that firms could still not plan for Brexit. His remarks were welcomed by Business Minister Richard Harrington, who said Airbus was correct to warn of the dangers of a no-deal scenario. ""Crashing out is a disaster for business,"" Mr Harrington told a meeting at the German embassy on Thursday morning. ""Airbus is correct to say it publicly about and I'm delighted they have done so,"" he added. In all, Airbus employs 14,000 people in the UK. That includes 6,000 jobs at its main wings factory at Broughton in Wales, as well as 3,000 at Filton, near Bristol, where wings are designed and supported. Brexit: Jargon-busting guide to the key terms Brexit: What does no deal mean? Mr Enders said: ""Please don't listen to the Brexiteers' madness which asserts that, because we have huge plants here, we will not move and we will always be here. They are wrong."" Responding to Airbus's statement, a government spokesperson said: ""The UK is a world leader in aerospace. We are the home of the jet engine, the wing factory of the world and are world-renowned for our skills and capabilities in the most technically-advanced parts of aerospace manufacturing. ""It remains our top priority to leave the EU with a good deal; a deal that is good for business, will protect jobs and prosperity, and provide the certainty that business needs."" Airbus's latest intervention follows announcements by two other companies that they were moving their headquarters out of the UK. Sony said it would transfer its European HQ from the UK to the Netherlands to avoid disruptions caused by Brexit. And appliance maker Dyson announced it was moving its headquarters to Singapore, from Malmesbury in Wiltshire, although it said the decision had nothing to do with Brexit. However, another firm, Japanese technology company Fujitsu, told the BBC it had ""zero intention"" of moving its operations out of London. Duncan Tait, Fujitsu's European boss, said it had ""a thriving business in the UK"", adding: ""We're recruiting people every week."" Brexit prompts Sony's Europe HQ move Dyson to move head office to Singapore Mr Enders said that while the world's second-largest aerospace group could not ""pick up and move our large UK factories to other parts of the world immediately"", Airbus could be ""forced to redirect future investments in the event of a no-deal Brexit"". ""And make no mistake, there are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraft,"" he added. ""Brexit is threatening to destroy a century of development based on education, research and human capital."" This video can not be played Katherine Bennett, senior vice-president of Airbus in the UK Katherine Bennett, senior vice-president of Airbus in the UK, reinforced Mr Enders' message. She told the BBC that a no-deal Brexit would be ""catastrophic"" for her business, with ""chaos at the borders"" that would hold up delivery of vital components. This is not the first time that Airbus has warned of the consequences for its business of a no-deal Brexit. Last year,it issued a risk assessmentsaying that if the UK left the EU without a withdrawal deal, it ""would force Airbus to reconsider its investments in the UK and its long-term footprint in the country"". The company has about 14,000 employees at 25 different UK sites However, Mr Enders' latest remarks suggest that the firm has toughened its stance since then. MPs are putting forward alternative plans to Theresa May's Brexit plan after it was voted down by Parliament last week. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March this year. by Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent The gloves are off. That's the clear message from Airbus' pugnacious chief executive, Tom Enders. Opposition to Brexit from Airbus is not new. The company warned of the potential dangers to its business even before the referendum had taken place. Since then, the rhetoric has been steadily ramped up. Last year, the company published a ""Brexit Risk Assessment"", in which it warned that leaving without a deal would be ""catastrophic"" for its business. We've had warnings about the risk to future investment before, but now the threat is much more explicit and the language is much more forthright. The failure to come up with a clear plan is a ""disgrace"". Other countries would ""love"" to build the aircraft wings currently made at Broughton. There's even a warning not to listen to ""the Brexiteers' madness"". The time for diplomacy, it seems, is past. So what's changed? The company clearly believes that the risk of ""no deal"" is growing, thanks to the impasse in the House of Commons. And as a business which relies on the rapid transfer of parts from the UK to assembly lines in France and Germany, it is very exposed to any delays in shipments - or problems getting new safety certification. Meanwhile, Tom Enders is due to leave his job in April. So perhaps he's in a very good position to talk tough, without worrying whom he's upsetting in the process.

"This video can not be played Jack Shepherd told police he never asked if Charlotte Brown could swim A man convicted of killing his date in a speedboat crash on the River Thames has handed himself in to police in Georgia after months on the run. Jack Shepherd was sentenced to six years in July for the manslaughter of 24-year-old Charlotte Brown. The 31-year-old had been in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi since March and was absent throughout his trial. Ms Brown's father Graham Brown said: ""I feel very emotional at the fact that my daughter will get some justice."" Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, he added: ""I do think the family will be in a much better position to deal with our loss and heartbreak over the last three years."" Mr Brown,who earlier on Wednesday gave an interview to the Victoria Derbyshire programmeurging Shepherd to hand himself in, described the fugitive as ""a very crass, reckless man who stuck two fingers up to the judiciary system"". ""He's done the right thing and thank goodness he has handed himself in,"" he added. This video can not be played Charlotte Brownâs father Graham told BBC Radio 5 Live he felt an âoverwhelming sense of emotionâ following the arrest A spokesman for the Georgian Embassy in London confirmed Shepherd's arrest, which comes afterMs Brown's family met the Home Secretary Sajid Javid on Tuesday. Under current diplomatic agreements between Georgia and the UK, Shepherd is eligible for extradition. Georgian Rustavi TV has shown footage of him before he handed himself in, during an ""exclusive interview"" in his final minutes as a ""free man"". Speaking in English, which was then voiced over and translated into Georgian, Shepherd described it as ""a tragic accident"". Jack Shepherd let Charlotte Brown drive his speedboat for a ""thrill"", the Old Bailey heard Ms Brown's sister Katie Brown said her family were ""relieved"" Shepherd had handed himself in but described him as ""arrogant"". ""To just stroll in with a very smug look on his face and to claim innocence is unbelievable. This is a small amount of justice for my sister."" The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia, the law enforcement agency in the country, previously told the BBC it was working with the Met Police to track Shepherd. Victim's father appeals to speedboat killer The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error Anger over on-the-run speedboat killer The Met said it was informed by the National Crime Agency that Shepherd was in the custody of police in Georgia. A Home Office spokesman added: ""It is now for the Crown Prosecution Service to decide on whether to make an extradition request to the Georgian authorities, via the Home Office."" Charlotte's father Graham Brown said Shepherd was ""a very crass reckless man"" After meeting on the dating website OkCupid, Shepherd took Ms Brown on a date on 8 December 2015. Shepherd spent Â£150 on wine and food at a restaurant in The Shard before taking her on a speedboat he claimed he owned. Ms Brown and Shepherd were thrown from the boat when it hit branches in the water near Wandsworth Bridge at about midnight. Shepherd was found clinging to the hull and Ms Brown, from Clacton in Essex, was pulled from the water unconscious and unresponsive. A post-mortem examination found she died from cold water immersion. By BBC correspondent Rayhan Demytrie I am outside the police station where Jack Shepherd, who is now officially under arrest, is currently being held. He will be moved to a temporary detention centre and his lawyer says according to Georgian law the detention period in this kind of case can be up to nine months. But it will be up to a judge to decide how long Shepherd will be in the custody of the Georgian police. Shepherd gave an interview to a local television station where he maintains his innocence. He says he does not agree with the court's decision and that he is now ready to co-operate with the investigation. Shepherd made his first appearance at the Old Bailey on 26 January, when he entered a not guilty plea to a charge of manslaughter by gross negligence. He was released on unconditional bail by Judge Richard Marks QC, but failed to show up for his trial in July. After his conviction an international arrest warrant was issued. Despite being on the run, Shepherdhas won the right to appeal against his conviction. Shepherd's solicitor Richard Egan said: ""In the light of today's developments I don't think it would be appropriate to comment further until Mr Shepherd is back in the jurisdiction.""

"Scientistsare working on a new antibioticthat has produced promising results in early trials. Medicine will need more of these in coming years if increasing bacterial resistance is not to pose a very serious threat to human health. When they were introduced, in the 1940s, antibiotics were hailed as a ""wonder drug"". But there are major concerns that over-prescription has led to increasing resistance to the drugs. Last week, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies, went as far as to say we were ""at risk of putting medicine back in the dark ages"" - but why has this happened? Scottish chemist Alexander Fleming discovered the first true antibiotic, penicillin, in 1928, as a mould on a petri dish that inhibited the growth of bacteria. His discovery revolutionised the treatment of certain types of bacterial infection, saving countless lives in the process. Antibiotics fight bacteria in a number of ways, including by killing them or preventing them from spreading. However, they also have a major weakness. Antibiotics are very effective at killing most, but not all, bacteria. Some bacteria acquire genes that protect them from the drug's attack. They survive treatment and reproduce themselves, spreading the key genes more widely so the drug becomes ever less effective. If somebody is infected by these drug-resistant bacteria, then it can become harder to deploy antibiotics to treat them successfully. At present other types of antibiotic might do the trick but the options are starting to narrow as bacteria develop the ability to block more than one drug. Analysis: Antibiotic apocalypse How economics killed the antibiotic dream Superbug find renews hope for antibiotic treatment In the past four years in England, there has been a 35% increase in antibiotic-resistant blood infections. This is because there have been greater efforts by clinicians and other health professionals to identify sepsis cases. However, even though the absolute number of infections being detected has increased, the relative proportion of blood infections resistant to antibiotics has remained stable. From the point of view of health experts, a key to reduce antibiotic-resistant blood infections is to ensure that resistant bacteria cannot become prevalent in the first place. Arecent report,externalhighlights that without effective antibiotics, life-threatening infections linked to operations such as hip replacements and Caesarean sections could increase. Since 2013, Public Health England has actively been campaigning to reduce the amount of antibiotics taken by patients. They say that over-prescription of antibiotics is a major cause of the increase in resistance to them. This is because the more antibiotics are used are used, the less effective they become. In addition, GPs have been prescribing antibiotics to patients who are not infected with bacterial diseases, even though they will never work. Antibiotic consumption in England has decreased by about 5% since 2013 - but the average daily dose per 1,000 people varies across the country. Public Health England points out that antibiotic resistance and prescription are ""inextricably linked - areas with high levels of antibiotic prescribing also have high levels of resistance"". Its campaign involves ensuring all areas have access to best practices for using antibiotics - in particular in community care, as 90% of antibiotics are prescribed by GPs. They want to see patients and carers educated about the inappropriate use of antibiotics and greater efforts by health professionals in preventing infections in the first place. And in 2016 the government called for a 50% reduction in the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics by 2021. Spanish flu pandemic 1918 - could it happen again? Use honey first for a cough, new guidelines say About half of all patients with a cough or cold leave their GP's surgery with a prescription for antibiotics. And there are concerns that patient expectations are driving the problem. Recent research suggests 38% of people expect to be prescribed antibiotics when they go to the doctor. So efforts are now being made not only to reduce the number of antibiotics prescribed but also for GPs not to prescribe antibiotics for conditions that will naturally clear up by themselves after a few days. Over-prescription is not a problem unique to the UK. The European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Network has called the spread of drug-resistant bacteria a ""public health threat"", with estimates suggesting that 25,000 people die in Europe from linked infections every year. Currently, the UK has below average consumption compared with other EU countries. Efforts to mitigate future costs related to the problem have led countries with high consumption to learn from others - in particular in northern Europe - who consume fewer antibiotics. One of the biggest global concerns regarding antibiotics is over drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), TB remains the world's deadliest infectious disease. Treatment has been effective, with an estimated 54 million lives saved through diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2017. Even so, and with the global incidence of TB falling at about 2% per year, it remains one of top 10 causes of death worldwide. In 2017, 10 million people fell ill with TB and 1.6 million died from the disease, mainly in developing countries. The WHO says that 490,000 people have multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), when bacteria do not respond to the two most powerful first-line anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin. Second-line drugs can treat and cure MDR-TB. However, such treatment options can mean that patients have to undergo up to two years of chemotherapy involving costly and toxic medicines. It has been 30 years since a new class of antibiotic became available. And resistance has developed to all those that do exist. But antibiotics are expensive to produce and can take a long time to become available to clinicians and patients. In 2017, Public Health Englandwarned that a failure to address resistance to antibiotics,externalcould lead to an estimated 10 million deaths every year globally by 2050 at a cost of Â£66trillion in lost productivity to the global economy. That is why they, and other health organisations, are calling for a reduction in the overuse and misuse of antibiotics.

"Real Madrid has topped the table of the world's 20 richest football clubs, displacing Manchester United with record revenues of â¬750.9m (Â£674.6m). Man Utd slipped to third with Barcelona making it the first Spanish one-two since 2014-15, said Deloitte. Its Football Money League, based on season 2017-18, also shows the combined revenues of the top 20 clubs has risen 6% to â¬8.3bn (Â£7.4bn), a new record. There were a record six English Premier League clubs in the top 10. The list, the 22nd of its kind, only looks at revenues and does not take into account club debts. This gap this year between the top two places was the second widest yet, with â¬60.5m between the leading pair. Real Madrid won their third successive Champions League, beating Liverpool 3-1 in Kiev last May. That helped raise income for Los Blancos, who have now topped Deloitte's money league 12 times. Real Madrid revenues were boosted by a third consecutive Champions League win The club experienced commercial growth of â¬54.8m, including an increase in sponsorship and merchandising revenues, as well as exploitation of increasingly lucrative pre-season tour matches. At â¬356.2m, Real Madrid now have the highest commercial revenue of any football club globally, contributing to those world-record revenues. Dan Jones, head of Deloitte's sports business group, said: ""Real Madrid's outstanding financial performance in 2017-18 is built on their long history of success on the pitch, most recently three consecutive Champions League titles. ""This has enabled the club to continue to drive commercial revenue as the appetite to partner with Europe's most successful clubs remains stronger than ever."" He said most of Deloitte's top 10 of our top 10 were through to the round of 16 in this season's Champions League and forecasting further revenue growth. Bayern Munich and Manchester City completed the top five, retaining their positions from the past two years. Paris St-Germain, Liverpool, Chelsea, Arsenal, and Tottenham Hotspur occupied places six to 10, with Spurs making it into the top tier for only the second time, having last appeared in 2006-07. Everton were in 17th spot, Newcastle United 19th, and West Ham United 20th. All the 20 clubs represented are from the ""big five"" European leagues, with Italy having four places, Germany and Spain contributing three clubs, and France one. Other findings include: Spurs have capitalised on playing a full season at Wembley Stadium which has seen match-day revenue increase by 54% Paris Saint-Germain have reversed two consecutive years of decline AS Roma and AC Milan return to the top 20 thanks to performances in Uefa competition Turkish giants Besiktas have achieved their highest ever ranking, at 26th ""The substantial presence of Premier League clubs continues to be felt in this year's Deloitte Football Money League,"" said Deloitte's Sam Boor. ""However, with the Premier League's tender for the next cycle of domestic rights from 2019-20 complete and sale of overseas rights nearing conclusion, it is clear that Premier League clubs will be unable to rely on explosive growth in broadcast distributions as a source of future growth, as has been the case in recent years, ""As a result, we expect an even greater emphasis among these clubs on generating their own growth in the coming season, and in particular the optimisation of commercial revenue, which has been a key area for differentiating growth across most of Europe's leading clubs in recent years.""

"Holly Burke was off duty when she was killed A man has appeared in court charged with killing an off-duty PCSO whose car was hit by a vehicle being pursued by police. Holly Burke, 28, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash in Lordswood Road, Birmingham, on Tuesday night. Darren Ogom, 42, did not enter a plea to a charge of causing death by dangerous driving when he appeared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court.

"The blaze broke out at the house in Dovercliffe Road on Wednesday night Two people have died in a house fire in Liverpool. Firefighters found the house on Dovercliffe Road in Old Swan, ""well alight"" when they arrived just before 21:00 GMT on Wednesday. Crews managed to pull two people from the property but they were later pronounced dead in hospital. Neighbours told the BBC an elderly couple in their 80s lived at the house. The blaze has been put out and is not being treated as suspicious. A spokesperson for Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service said family members had been informed. The fire service said the parents of two young children from a neighbouring property were advised to take them to hospital to be checked for the effects of smoke inhalation. Forensic investigators are at the scene and an investigation has begun to establish the cause of the fire.

"The paramilitary group EOKA fought a guerrilla campaign against the British presence in Cyprus Thirty-three Cypriots who claimed they were tortured by British forces during an armed uprising in the late 1950s are to be awarded Â£1m damages, to be shared between them, by the UK government. The group was arrested on suspicion of being part of paramilitary organisation EOKA, which fought a guerrilla campaign to overthrow British control in Cyprus. One woman, aged 16 at the time, said she was repeatedly raped by soldiers. The government said the settlement was not ""any admission of liability"". The 1955-59 rebellion was known as the Cyprus Emergency, during which the governor enacted draconian laws, flooding the island with thousands of soldiers and increasing the size of the police force. Some 371 British military personnel died during the emergency. Dark clouds of history over sun-kissed island,external The claimants - now in their 70s and 80s and in poor health - have had to wait almost 60 years to seek justice for their injuries, because the government documents outlining their treatment were classified and out of reach until 2012. Cristos Socratous says he still suffers nightmares after being beaten by British soldiers Cristos Socratous said he was about 18 when he was picked up by British soldiers, detained and beaten every day for 28 days. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people in British uniforms and civilian clothes stripped him naked, deprived him of sleep and interrogated him about planting a bomb, which he denied. ""I was so tired I couldn't stand. The pain was very bad. They had these big police truncheons and they hit me on my arms, my stomach, my chest, my legs,"" he said. After four weeks they released him, his face bloodied. ""I didn't go back to my parents' house because I didn't want my parents to see me like that,"" he said. It took about six months to recover, but Mr Socratous, who now lives in Ilford, east London, said he still suffers nightmares. ""I'm still scared,"" he said. But he declined to say if he had any involvement with EOKA, the armed group that fought against British rule. ""Whatever I did, it was for myself,"" he said. The most serious case involved the 16-year-old, who said she was detained and repeatedly raped by men she described in court documents as soldiers. She said she was then beaten for days before being forced to wear a noose in a mock execution. Her medical report revealed she has suffered lifelong physical and mental torture which has made forming relationships difficult. Anti-British demonstrations took place in Greece in the late 1950s Another man lost a kidney as a result of his interrogation in a notorious facility in Limassol, known as the Red House, and was jailed for several months for carrying leaflets supporting the EOKA forces. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme in November 2017 Demetrios Glykis recalled being chased through the streets by British military police. ""They were swearing at me, I was very scared. They threw me in their car, the back of a Land Rover and said 'we will fix you up, you bastard Greek',"" he said. ""One of officers came up to me and gave me a slap in the face. My head almost came off. My eardrum broke. ""I can't get my health back. I just want justice."" Though it has taken since 2015 to reach this settlement, the government has consistently denied liability, saying too much time has passed for a court to decide who was responsible. In a written ministerial statement, Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said: ""The settlement does not constitute any admission of liability and is not a precedent in respect of any potential future claims against the government. ""However, the government has settled the case in order to draw a line under this litigation and to avoid the further escalation of costs, which would ultimately be borne by the taxpayer."" He added: ""It is a matter of regret for the UK government that the transition of Cyprus from British administration to independence should have been preceded by five years of violence and loss of life, affecting all residents of the island."" The Army continues to operate military bases in Cyprus, not far from the city of Limassol The small firm of Birmingham solicitors which took on the case said there was ample evidence of violent treatment, but it welcomed the settlement which has brought to an end a lengthy, costly and occasionally bitter legal battle over a dark part of Britain's colonial history. The claimants described their suffering as a stain on British history that has now been put to bed. Sir Alan said that in reaching the settlement, the UK has reaffirmed its highest respect for the memory and sacrifice of British and Cypriot service personnel and employees of the Crown who gave their lives. Update 24 January 2019: An earlier version of this article included a reference to ""Turkish-Cypriot thugs"" which has since been removed.

"This video can not be played Police IT system 'pushed us to the edge' (Officers played by actors) A police IT system is ""unfit for purpose"" and causing some criminals to escape justice, officers have told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. Nine forces in England and Wales use Athena, which promised to speed up the detection of crimes. But officers say it regularly crashes and is overly complicated, meaning some cases are not built in time or dropped. Developers Northgate Public Services apologised for problems ""in small areas"", which it says it is fixing. A joint response from the nine police forces said Athena - which has cost Â£35m over the past 10 years - had been ""resilient and stable, although no system is perfect"". The system was introduced following a government directive for forces to share intelligence after the Soham murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, in 2002. Officers say the intelligence-sharing function works well but problems arise when they use the system to build cases for the Crown Prosecution Service. The delays it causes means officers can struggle to get the information together in time to charge suspects or the cases are not up to a high-enough standard and are dropped. Serving officers at Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and Essex told the programme the process could now take up to twice as long. We have not named the officers because they could face disciplinary action for speaking out. Their comments included: ""The first two weeks it was brought in were the worst two weeks of my entire career. It's overly bureaucratic. It doesn't understand the police investigative process at all. From day one, it malfunctioned. Four years on, it is still malfunctioning"" ""It often requires information that is totally irrelevant and if you miss just one data entry point (like whether a solicitor is male or female), I have to reject the whole case and send it back to the officer"" ""Even for a simple shoplift, I probably have to press about 50 buttons, with a 30-second minimum loading time between each task"" ""There have been incidents where charges have been dropped because of the inadequacies of the system. There have been cases of assaults, albeit fairly minor assaults, but these are still people who should be facing criminal charges"" ""It slows the whole criminal justice system down. At the moment, it is not fit for purpose. This is the most challenging time I have come across. We're at breaking point already. This has pushed some officers over the edge"" ""When you've got detainees in a custody block who've got various illnesses and ailments, medical conditions that are all recorded on there and they need medication at certain times - it became very dangerous because we were unable to access the records"" The nine forces - which also include those in Cambridgeshire, Kent, Norfolk, Suffolk, Warwickshire and West Mercia - said in a joint statement that they had been working with the supplier to identify and correct issues as they arose. ""Over the 12 months up to November 2018, there have only been 72 hours of total downtime and there are detailed plans in place of how to manage business when this occurs."" Northgate Public Services, which created Athena, said 40,000 officers accessed the system and benefited from improved criminal intelligence. But it said it was working to make improvements to the ""complex system"". ""We recognise there are a small number of areas of the solution where improvements can be made and we apologise for any difficulties this has caused. ""We are working hard with the customer and other parties to make these improvements as a priority.""

"Scientistsare working on a new antibioticthat has produced promising results in early trials. Medicine will need more of these in coming years if increasing bacterial resistance is not to pose a very serious threat to human health. When they were introduced, in the 1940s, antibiotics were hailed as a ""wonder drug"". But there are major concerns that over-prescription has led to increasing resistance to the drugs. Last week, the Chief Medical Officer for England, Prof Dame Sally Davies, went as far as to say we were ""at risk of putting medicine back in the dark ages"" - but why has this happened? Scottish chemist Alexander Fleming discovered the first true antibiotic, penicillin, in 1928, as a mould on a petri dish that inhibited the growth of bacteria. His discovery revolutionised the treatment of certain types of bacterial infection, saving countless lives in the process. Antibiotics fight bacteria in a number of ways, including by killing them or preventing them from spreading. However, they also have a major weakness. Antibiotics are very effective at killing most, but not all, bacteria. Some bacteria acquire genes that protect them from the drug's attack. They survive treatment and reproduce themselves, spreading the key genes more widely so the drug becomes ever less effective. If somebody is infected by these drug-resistant bacteria, then it can become harder to deploy antibiotics to treat them successfully. At present other types of antibiotic might do the trick but the options are starting to narrow as bacteria develop the ability to block more than one drug. Analysis: Antibiotic apocalypse How economics killed the antibiotic dream Superbug find renews hope for antibiotic treatment In the past four years in England, there has been a 35% increase in antibiotic-resistant blood infections. This is because there have been greater efforts by clinicians and other health professionals to identify sepsis cases. However, even though the absolute number of infections being detected has increased, the relative proportion of blood infections resistant to antibiotics has remained stable. From the point of view of health experts, a key to reduce antibiotic-resistant blood infections is to ensure that resistant bacteria cannot become prevalent in the first place. Arecent report,externalhighlights that without effective antibiotics, life-threatening infections linked to operations such as hip replacements and Caesarean sections could increase. Since 2013, Public Health England has actively been campaigning to reduce the amount of antibiotics taken by patients. They say that over-prescription of antibiotics is a major cause of the increase in resistance to them. This is because the more antibiotics are used are used, the less effective they become. In addition, GPs have been prescribing antibiotics to patients who are not infected with bacterial diseases, even though they will never work. Antibiotic consumption in England has decreased by about 5% since 2013 - but the average daily dose per 1,000 people varies across the country. Public Health England points out that antibiotic resistance and prescription are ""inextricably linked - areas with high levels of antibiotic prescribing also have high levels of resistance"". Its campaign involves ensuring all areas have access to best practices for using antibiotics - in particular in community care, as 90% of antibiotics are prescribed by GPs. They want to see patients and carers educated about the inappropriate use of antibiotics and greater efforts by health professionals in preventing infections in the first place. And in 2016 the government called for a 50% reduction in the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics by 2021. Spanish flu pandemic 1918 - could it happen again? Use honey first for a cough, new guidelines say About half of all patients with a cough or cold leave their GP's surgery with a prescription for antibiotics. And there are concerns that patient expectations are driving the problem. Recent research suggests 38% of people expect to be prescribed antibiotics when they go to the doctor. So efforts are now being made not only to reduce the number of antibiotics prescribed but also for GPs not to prescribe antibiotics for conditions that will naturally clear up by themselves after a few days. Over-prescription is not a problem unique to the UK. The European Surveillance of Antimicrobial Consumption Network has called the spread of drug-resistant bacteria a ""public health threat"", with estimates suggesting that 25,000 people die in Europe from linked infections every year. Currently, the UK has below average consumption compared with other EU countries. Efforts to mitigate future costs related to the problem have led countries with high consumption to learn from others - in particular in northern Europe - who consume fewer antibiotics. One of the biggest global concerns regarding antibiotics is over drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), TB remains the world's deadliest infectious disease. Treatment has been effective, with an estimated 54 million lives saved through diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2017. Even so, and with the global incidence of TB falling at about 2% per year, it remains one of top 10 causes of death worldwide. In 2017, 10 million people fell ill with TB and 1.6 million died from the disease, mainly in developing countries. The WHO says that 490,000 people have multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), when bacteria do not respond to the two most powerful first-line anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and rifampicin. Second-line drugs can treat and cure MDR-TB. However, such treatment options can mean that patients have to undergo up to two years of chemotherapy involving costly and toxic medicines. It has been 30 years since a new class of antibiotic became available. And resistance has developed to all those that do exist. But antibiotics are expensive to produce and can take a long time to become available to clinicians and patients. In 2017, Public Health Englandwarned that a failure to address resistance to antibiotics,externalcould lead to an estimated 10 million deaths every year globally by 2050 at a cost of Â£66trillion in lost productivity to the global economy. That is why they, and other health organisations, are calling for a reduction in the overuse and misuse of antibiotics.

"Feeling a little lost on Brexit? Never really got your head around it in the first place? Let us walk you through it. Brexit is short for ""British exit"" - and is the word people use to talk about the United Kingdom's decision to leave the European Union (EU). The EU is a political and economic union of 28 countries that trade with each other and allow citizens to move easily between the countries to live and work(click here if you want to see the full list).,external The UK joined the EU, then known as the EEC (European Economic Community), in 1973. A public vote - calleda referendum- was held on Thursday 23 June 2016 when voters were asked just one question - whether the UK should leave or remain in the European Union. TheLeave side won by nearly 52% to 48% - 17.4m votes to 16.1m- but the exit didn't happen straight away. It was due to take place on 29 March 2019 - but the departure date has been delayed (we will explain in more detail below). The 2016 vote was just the start. Since then, negotiations have been taking place between the UK and the other EU countries. The discussions have been mainly over the ""divorce"" deal, which sets out exactly how the UK leaves - not what will happen afterwards. This deal is known as theWithdrawal Agreement. The withdrawal agreement covers some of these key points: How much money the UK will have to pay the EU in order to break the partnership - that's about Â£39bn What will happen to UK citizens living elsewhere in the EU and, equally, what will happen to EU citizens living in the UK How to avoid the return of a physical border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland when it becomes the frontier between the UK and the EU This video can not be played Adam Fleming summarises the Brexit agreement in one minute(ish) It also includes atransition period,which has been agreed to allow the UK and EU to agree a trade deal and to give businesses the time to adjust. That means that if the withdrawal agreement gets the green light, there will be no huge changes between the date of Brexit and 31 December 2020. Click here for more on the draft withdrawal agreement Another, much shorter, document has also been drawn up that gives an overview of what the UK and EU's future relationship will be in the longer term. This is thepolitical declaration.However, neither side has to stick exactly to what it says - it is a set of ambitions for future talks. Click here for more on the political declaration The deal was agreed by the UK and the EU in November 2018, but it also has to be approved by British MPs. Well, no. They have voted against it three times. On 15 January they rejected the dealby 432 votes to 202- a record defeat. Then on 12 March, after Theresa May - the prime minister at the time - had gone back to the EU to secure further legal assurances,they rejected it again. And on 29 March - the original day that the UK was due to leave the EU -MPs rejected it for a third time(this vote was slightly different as it did not include the political declaration). Yes. As MPs did not approve Mrs May's withdrawal deal, she was forced to ask other EU leaders to delay Brexit. The deadline was delayed until 31 October- but, unable to see a way forward, Mrs May stepped down as PM and was replaced by Boris Johnson. There isa broad range of complaints, many of which claim the deal fails to give back to the UK control of its own affairs from the EU. One of the biggest sticking points has been over what happens at the Irish border. Both the EU and UK want to avoid the return of guard posts and checks (here's why), so something calledthe backstop- a sort of safety net - was included in the deal. The backstop is meant to be a last resort to keep an open border on the island of Ireland - whatever happens in the Brexit negotiations. It would mean that Northern Ireland, but not the rest of the UK, would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products. Theresa May insisted that, if all went as planned, it would never be used. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop But it has annoyed some MPs, who are angry that the UK would not be able to end it without the EU's permission and so EU rules could remain in place for good. Other MPs would prefer the UK to stay closer to the EU - or even still in it. And others say Northern Ireland should not be treated separately from the rest of the UK. Boris Johnson has said he wants to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement with the EU - and remove the backstop. If he succeeds in doing this, it will still have to be approved by MPs before being passed into UK law. However, EU leaders have consistently said they will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and that the backstop is an essential part of any deal. If the prime minister fails to convince the EU to change the withdrawal agreement, he has promised to take the UK out of the EU without a deal on 31 October. Leaving the EU without a withdrawal agreement would be known as a ""no-deal Brexit"". New PM Boris Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU with or without a deal ""No deal"" means the UK will have failed to agree a withdrawal agreement. It would mean there would be no transition period after the UK leaves and EU laws would stop applying to the UK immediately(more on that here). The government says it is preparing for this potential situation. It expects some food prices could rise and customs checks at borders could cost businesses billions of pounds.(Read the government's report here),external. It has published a series of guides,external- which cover everything from mobile roaming on holiday to the impact on electricity supplies. Here is a list of10 ways you could be affectedby a no-deal Brexit. It is still written into law that the UK will be leaving, even though the deadline has shifted. The European Court of Justice has said the UK couldcancel Brexit altogether without the agreement of other nations- but few politicians publicly back this option.

"Supermarket giant Iceland has continued to sell own-brand products containing palm oil despite pledging to stop doing so by the end of 2018. The retailermade the promise last April, saying demand for the oil was devastating rainforests in Asia. But Iceland still sells 28 own-brand products with palm oil or fat, as well as more than 600 from other brands. Iceland said it had ""fulfilled"" its promise and no longer made own-brand products containing palm oil. It added that own-brand products still available were old stock, including frozen desserts and frozen pastry products, which ""obviously have a longer shelf life than fresh and chilled food lines"". However, the BBC also found non-frozen perishable goods such as fairy cakes, hot cross buns and jam tarts - all made with palm oil - available to buy online. One product carried a logo saying it was ""new"". The BBC was also able to purchase frozen own-brand products containing palm oil in store, though not fresh ones. Palm oil banned by Iceland supermarkets Warning of palm oil threat to primates Is beauty killing the beasts? Iceland said: ""If there is fresh food on our website that is labelled as still containing palm oil, this is a website issue and our team are working quickly to resolve."" It insisted there were no Iceland own-label fresh items available that still contained palm oil. Since the BBC contacted the retailer, a number of products containing palm oil have been marked as ""currently unavailable"" on the website. The BBC was able to purchase numerous Iceland products containing palm oil in store Iceland has spent weeks telling its customers on social media that it has achieved that goal while its website states the company is ""simply saying no to palm oil"". In some stores, a cartoon orangutan featured in the supermarket's ""No palm oil"" promotional campaign appears at checkouts. Even before the end of 2018, Iceland tweeted one customer to say: ""There's no palm oil in our own-brand products."" It has repeated this claim on social media multiple times since. When the BBC put it to Iceland that there was in fact still palm oil in its own-brand products, it said it now expected there to be no more products available to buy with palm oil ""within the next few weeks"". ""The Iceland no palm oil pledge is that by the end of 2018, 100 per cent of the supermarket's own label food lines will contain no palm oil, reducing demand for palm oil by more than 500 tonnes per year."" A supposedly ""new"" product containing palm oil for sale on the Iceland website on 23 January John Sauven, executive director of environmental charity Greenpeace UK, said: ""If they still have old stock on their shelves, they need to make that clear to consumers in order to fulfil the promise they made."" In November, Iceland attempted to run a Christmas advert - originally a short film made by Greenpeace - telling the story of an orangutan whose home had been destroyed by deforestation caused by the palm oil trade. Due to UK legislation surrounding political messaging on TV, the advert was never broadcast - yet the supermarket received significant attention and praise from consumers online. The Iceland/Greenpeace advert highlights the impact that palm oil production is having on the planet Responding to the news Iceland was still selling products containing palm oil, a spokesman for consumer organisation Ethical Consumer said: ""If the target has been missed, it should now be revised and the company should be transparent about how they are dealing with problems they have faced in their supply chain. ""This transparency would have two positive effects - firstly it would maintain customer trust and secondly it could help other producers overcome similar difficulties."" Iceland became the first UK supermarket to announce the removal of palm oil from its products when it made the pledge last year. Palm oil cultivation can destroy habitats for orangutans Palm oil production is said to have been responsible for about 8% of the world's deforestation between 1990 and 2008 Burning large areas of forests to clear areas where oil palms can be grown has also been blamed for high levels of air pollution in South East Asia Palm oil is used in almost half the products stocked by UK supermarkets and can be found in everything from shampoos to biscuits, as well as biofuels Some experts say eating palm oil is unhealthy because it is high in saturated fat EU labelling laws were changed in 2014 so products must now state specifically if they contain palm oil Palm oil banned by Iceland supermarkets Is beauty killing the beasts?

"The paramilitary group EOKA fought a guerrilla campaign against the British presence in Cyprus Thirty-three Cypriots who claimed they were tortured by British forces during an armed uprising in the late 1950s are to be awarded Â£1m damages, to be shared between them, by the UK government. The group was arrested on suspicion of being part of paramilitary organisation EOKA, which fought a guerrilla campaign to overthrow British control in Cyprus. One woman, aged 16 at the time, said she was repeatedly raped by soldiers. The government said the settlement was not ""any admission of liability"". The 1955-59 rebellion was known as the Cyprus Emergency, during which the governor enacted draconian laws, flooding the island with thousands of soldiers and increasing the size of the police force. Some 371 British military personnel died during the emergency. Dark clouds of history over sun-kissed island,external The claimants - now in their 70s and 80s and in poor health - have had to wait almost 60 years to seek justice for their injuries, because the government documents outlining their treatment were classified and out of reach until 2012. Cristos Socratous says he still suffers nightmares after being beaten by British soldiers Cristos Socratous said he was about 18 when he was picked up by British soldiers, detained and beaten every day for 28 days. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that people in British uniforms and civilian clothes stripped him naked, deprived him of sleep and interrogated him about planting a bomb, which he denied. ""I was so tired I couldn't stand. The pain was very bad. They had these big police truncheons and they hit me on my arms, my stomach, my chest, my legs,"" he said. After four weeks they released him, his face bloodied. ""I didn't go back to my parents' house because I didn't want my parents to see me like that,"" he said. It took about six months to recover, but Mr Socratous, who now lives in Ilford, east London, said he still suffers nightmares. ""I'm still scared,"" he said. But he declined to say if he had any involvement with EOKA, the armed group that fought against British rule. ""Whatever I did, it was for myself,"" he said. The most serious case involved the 16-year-old, who said she was detained and repeatedly raped by men she described in court documents as soldiers. She said she was then beaten for days before being forced to wear a noose in a mock execution. Her medical report revealed she has suffered lifelong physical and mental torture which has made forming relationships difficult. Anti-British demonstrations took place in Greece in the late 1950s Another man lost a kidney as a result of his interrogation in a notorious facility in Limassol, known as the Red House, and was jailed for several months for carrying leaflets supporting the EOKA forces. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme in November 2017 Demetrios Glykis recalled being chased through the streets by British military police. ""They were swearing at me, I was very scared. They threw me in their car, the back of a Land Rover and said 'we will fix you up, you bastard Greek',"" he said. ""One of officers came up to me and gave me a slap in the face. My head almost came off. My eardrum broke. ""I can't get my health back. I just want justice."" Though it has taken since 2015 to reach this settlement, the government has consistently denied liability, saying too much time has passed for a court to decide who was responsible. In a written ministerial statement, Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan said: ""The settlement does not constitute any admission of liability and is not a precedent in respect of any potential future claims against the government. ""However, the government has settled the case in order to draw a line under this litigation and to avoid the further escalation of costs, which would ultimately be borne by the taxpayer."" He added: ""It is a matter of regret for the UK government that the transition of Cyprus from British administration to independence should have been preceded by five years of violence and loss of life, affecting all residents of the island."" The Army continues to operate military bases in Cyprus, not far from the city of Limassol The small firm of Birmingham solicitors which took on the case said there was ample evidence of violent treatment, but it welcomed the settlement which has brought to an end a lengthy, costly and occasionally bitter legal battle over a dark part of Britain's colonial history. The claimants described their suffering as a stain on British history that has now been put to bed. Sir Alan said that in reaching the settlement, the UK has reaffirmed its highest respect for the memory and sacrifice of British and Cypriot service personnel and employees of the Crown who gave their lives. Update 24 January 2019: An earlier version of this article included a reference to ""Turkish-Cypriot thugs"" which has since been removed.
