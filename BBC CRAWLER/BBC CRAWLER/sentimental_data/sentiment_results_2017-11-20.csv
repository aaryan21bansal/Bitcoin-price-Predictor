"Origins of teeth traced back to primitive fish scales Teeth grew from the scales of primitive shark-like fish millions of years ago, research by scientists suggests. Old lineage cartilaginous fish like sharks, skates and rays that have skin which contained small spiky scales or ""dermal denticles"" may be the key, scientists say. Cambridge University said their tooth-like appearance is no accident. Researchers suggest it may be a direct link between us and marine ancestors from up to 400 million years ago. During early evolution of jawed vertebrates, dermal denticles were transferred from the skins of primitive fish to their mouth. In the millennia that followed, the tiny appendages went on to produce the flesh-tearing six-inch long teeth of dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex and the fangs of the sabre-toothed cat, the team said. A close-up of a fish scale Lead scientist Dr Andrew Gillis, from the Department of Zoology, said: ""Stroke a shark and you'll find it feels rougher than other fish, as shark skin is covered entirely in dermal denticles. ""By labelling the different types of cells in the embryos of skate, we were able to trace their fates. ""We show that... the denticle scales of sharks and skate develop from neural crest cells, just like teeth."" Neural crest cells are central to the process of tooth development in mammals said Dr Gillis, adding their finding suggest a deep evolutionary relationship between the primitive fish scales and the teeth of vertebrates. The fact teeth and sharks' denticle scales both arise from the same kind of embryonic cell suggests a common evolutionary origin, the team reported in the journalProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,external. The skins of sharks are all that remains of amour plating that clad their jawless forbears some 400 million years ago to protect against predators such as sea scorpions.

"Time Warner owns HBO, the company behind Game of Thrones The US Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit to block telecoms giant AT&T's acquisition of Time Warner, the owner of CNN and HBO. The department said the merger would reduce competition and lead to higher consumer prices. AT&T vowed to fight the move, calling it a radical departure from US competition practice. US President Donald Trump objected to the deal during his campaign last year, fuelling the controversy. AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson said he thought the acquisition had been on a good path ""until recently"". He referred to concerns about possible political influence as the ""elephant in the room"". President Trump is a vocal critic of CNN which is owned by Time Warner. Mr Stephenson said: ""There's been a lot of reporting and speculation whether this is all about CNN. And frankly I don't know. Nobody should be surprised the question keeps coming up."" In its lawsuit, the Department of Justice claimed that the deal - valued at more than $85bn when it was announced last year - would harm American consumers. Assistant attorney general Makan Delrahim of the Department of Justice's antitrust division, said: ""It would mean higher monthly television bills and fewer of the new, emerging innovative options that consumers are beginning to enjoy."" Of the 24 firms that were part of the nationwide landline telephone network Bell System, ten are a part of the current AT&T. The firm has also been on a buying spree in the past two decades. AT&T offshoot SBC Communications bought Pacific Telesis Group in 1997 and Ameritech in 1999. In 2005, SBC then bought out its parent group AT&T Corporation, creating the new AT&T Inc. In 2006 AT&T bought BellSouth, which gave it total ownership of previous joint venture Cingular Wireless. In 2013, it bought prepaid-wireless provider Cricket. In 2015, it completed the purchase of two Mexican wireless companies, Lusacell and Nextel Mexico, and also bought pay-TV firm DIRECTV.  AT&T also owns approximately a 2% stake in Canadian-based entertainment company Lionsgate. Meanwhile, Time Warner comprises three divisions: pay television service Home Box Office behind the popular Game of Thrones series, multi-channel TV provider Turner Broadcasting System, and giant entertainment conglomerate Warner Bros. Mr Delrahim said the combination would hurt the emergence of new online television options and give AT&T the power to force rival pay TV companies to pay ""hundreds of millions of dollars more"" for Time Warner content. The department has also denied political interference. The decision to take legal action sets up a high-profile fight over US anti-trust law, which has rarely been tested in cases involving companies that do not directly compete. George Hay, a professor of law and economics at Cornell, said there was ""no question"" the merger's potential competitive impact merited serious review. However, he said the lawsuit was noteworthy given the president's comments during the presidential campaign. ""There would be nothing unusual if you didn't have all of this political background,"" he said. AT&T chief executive Randall Stephenson (L) and President Donald Trump During his presidential campaign last October, Mr Trump said that the deal would not be approved ""in my administration because it's too much concentration of power in the hands of too few"". But challenges of vertical mergers - when firms operating at different levels within an industry's supply chain combine - have been rare, since at least one of the parties involved must have a major market position to raise concerns, Professor Hay said. In the past, competition officials have also been open to settlements in such cases, assuming the deals will create efficiencies that could benefit the consumer. In those cases, companies can merge but face restrictions on their behaviour. That happened in 2011, when the department allowed a merger between Comcast and NBCUniversal. Last year, Mr Delrahim said he did not see major issues with the merger. But he has also criticised so-called behavioural remedies used in the past to keep anti-competitive activity in check, saying they are overly intrusive and hard to enforce. AT&T called Monday's lawsuit ""a radical and inexplicable departure from decades of antitrust precedent"". The company's general counsel, David McAtee, said: ""Vertical mergers like this one are routinely approved because they benefit consumers without removing any competitor from the market. We see no legitimate reason for our merger to be treated differently."" AT&T also denied that the deal would lead to higher charges and said it had been willing to negotiate. Previously, US media reported that the Department of Justice was pushing AT&T to sell some of its assets as a condition for approval. The options included Turner Broadcasting or its satellite network. Mr Stephenson has said he is unwilling to sell CNN, which is part of Turner. Professor Hay said it was not clear how the case would fare in court and it could still get resolved with a settlement. He said it was surprising that the challenge was coming under a Republican administration, since Republicans and their appointees have historically been more business friendly. But he was ""sceptical"" the decision to bring the case would turn out to be entirely political, given how much Department of Justice staff prize their independence. If it were, he said, it would harm the department's case.

"Hard conversations are coming for Theresa May Did you watch Theresa May try to make the best of her Swedish photo opportunities yesterday? Or listen to David Davis as he urged the EU side to blink first, rather than the UK side? They both know that time is short to guarantee the UK gets what it wants and pushes the EU to move to the next stage of vital Brexit talks at the next leaders' jamboree in December. What's been missing until now is a sense of when the UK will be able to resolve its own short-term position. Is the cabinet willing to sanction a political move to offer the promise (not the figure) of more money on the table to settle our EU accounts? And if ministers are willing to do so, what do they expect in return - and when? It's been all too obvious that the EU side has, for a long time, been clear that they'll only budge when the UK is ready to promise - even vaguely or implicitly - a lot more cash. The hold-up has in part been that the UK has been pushing to make sure that taxpayers at home don't shell out when they don't have to. And also because UK and EU officials have taken a very different approach to settling the bill. But it's also the case that cabinet ministers have not been ready to agree how they want to proceed, and without that political agreement, it's been hard for the negotiations about the money to progress. However, the crunch is coming fast. I'm told on Monday there will be a significant meeting of the small cabinet committee that decides the Brexit negotiating strategy. Several government sources say the meeting of the Brexit strategy group could change the course of our departure. The question to be answered on Monday could be profound. One source told me: ""People have to decide if they really want to make progress and support this prime minister, or not."" For some in government that tight group of cabinet ministers must on Monday take a decision as vital as that - do they want to do a deal with the EU, or not? David Davis has urged EU negotiators to blink first Of course there is bravado on both sides. As ever, whether thinking of talks on the continent, or in government, take every utterance with a pinch of salt. Brexiteer ministers believe that they need to be clearer about what the UK would get in return for paying a bigger bill - a view that would no question have sympathy among swathes of taxpayers. They are not, thus far, ready to sign up to what they see as Number 10's version of the next move - a promise to pay a lot more cash, potentially as much as 50bn-60bn euros. They do not rule it out completely, but not before it is clear what we get in return. But the lack of clarity in government about our eventual destination - whether we are closely, or loosely tied to the EU after departure - makes that hard to conclude. One insider said: ""We still have to settle the broader question - what do we actually want? That's the point to consider."" The discussion on Monday could therefore spill into conversations about the future relationship after Brexit, as well as cold hard cash. For some in government, Monday feels vital. For others, it's OK in theory to let another decision point go past without conclusions. But if they don't reach any conclusions, some in government believe that sets us on a course to crash out with no deal. Time is running short for the discussion in government that Theresa May has put off for so long. But one insider said there is no ""limping"" on until March: ""We have to just decide."" Donald Tusk's deadline is hypothetical, but the pressure to move on is now not just coming from Brussels or Berlin, but from some elements in government. Theresa May is yet to give her own public view. But hard conversations don't get easier the longer you wait.

"We need to talk about the Brexit divorce bill, known officially as the financial settlement. Until ""sufficient progress"" is made in deciding how it should be calculated, Brexit negotiations between the EU and the UK won't move on to discuss the outlines of a future relationship covering trade, security and so on. The EU says the UK needs to settle its accounts before it leaves. It says the UK has made a variety of financial commitments that have to be settled as part of an overall withdrawal agreement. The UK accepts that it has some obligations. And it has promised not to leave any other country out of pocket in the current EU budget period from 2014-20. But the devil lies in the detail. That rather depends on who you ask. Well, at this stage they don't want to put a figure on it. They recognise the political sensitivity of this issue in the UK. What they do want is agreement on a fairly precise method for calculating the bill. In other words, an agreement on what should be included. The EU argues that the UK has to pay in full its share of money that has been committed in budgets but not yet spent. This is the so-called Reste a Liquider. As of September 2017, it was running at about 239bn euro (Â£213bn). In theory that produces a UK share of roughly 30bn euro (Â£27bn). There are also other investment projects in less developed regions of the EU on which work is only due to begin after the UK has left the EU. But the EU says the UK has already promised to help fund these projects. EU officials say that could amount to more than 20bn euro (Â£18bn) added to the UK bill, although this figure has not been officially published. Then there are long-term commitments such as pension contributions for EU staff. The pension bill could be roughly 10bn euro (Â£9bn), depending - crucially - on how you calculate it. Another long-term commitment is contingent liabilities - loans which have to be guaranteed (but which should eventually be repaid to the UK) to countries like Ukraine and Ireland.  Contingent liabilities amount to 11.5bn euro (Â£10bn). Less than that. The UK has already said it will pay budget contributions amounting to about Â£18bn (20bn euro) in 2019 and 2020. That meets its commitment to ensure that no other country is out of pocket in the current seven-year budget. It also coincides fairly neatly with the transition period it wants to be put in place for about two years after Brexit. If such a transition is agreed, the UK would be required to make budget contributions anyway, so this was a relatively easy offer to make. The UK has also said it will ""honour commitments"" made during its membership of the EU, and it is going through the EU's suggestions line-by-line. There are several ways in which the bill could be reduced: The UK will argue that it should pay a lower percentage of total EU commitments (reducing it from 13% to 12%, for example, would save billions of pounds). The UK thinks it is fair to calculate its pension liabilities in a different way, and that could reduce the bill considerably. The UK will want to limit payments it makes for projects that begin after it has left the EU. The UK insists that if it is responsible for its share of EU commitments, then it must be entitled to its share of EU assets as well. Some EU countries, including Germany, argue that the assets belong to the EU as a whole and not to individual member states. As soon as possible. The European Council President Donald Tusk said that he told Theresa May in their meeting today that progress needs to be made by the beginning of December at the latest. There have been hints that the UK is prepared to pay considerably more than it has offered so far in order to get talks moving. After all, far more money is at stake in the future of trade relations than in the size of the withdrawal agreement. A lot depends on what Theresa May meant in her speech in Florence when she first said that the UK would ""honour commitments"" it made during its membership. That now needs to be discussed in detail between the two negotiating teams. Yes. But in the end, the final decisions about the financial settlement will not be technical or legal ones. They will have to be political ones.

"This video can not be played German chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday said it was a day of ""deep reflection"" for Germany German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she would prefer new elections to leading a minority government, after a breakdown in coalition talks plunged the country into political crisis. She also said she did not see any reason to resign from her post despite the failed negotiations. On Sunday evening, the FDP liberals pulled out of talks with Mrs Merkel's CDU/CSU bloc and the Greens. Germany's president called on parties to ""reconsider their attitudes"". Frank-Walter Steinmeier urged them to make compromises for Germany's ""well-being"", amid a situation he said was unprecedented. Mrs Merkel faces her biggest challenge in 12 years as chancellor. ""The path to the formation of a government is proving harder than any of us had wished for,"" she told broadcaster ARD. But she said she was ""very sceptical"" about a minority government, adding that ""new elections would be the better path"". In a separate interview with the ZDF broadcaster, she argued Germany needed stability and a government ""that does not need to seek a majority for every decision"". The elections were held in late September. What are the options now? Why German election was a turning point Long read: How Merkel rose to power Some in Mrs Merkel's party still hope for another grand coalition with the Social Democrats (SPD), despite that party repeatedly ruling such an option out. Earlier on Monday, SPD leader Martin Schulz said his party was ""not afraid of new elections"". When asked about the prospect of another alliance with the SPD, Mrs Merkel told ZDF she would wait to see what came of upcoming talks between President Steinmeier and SPD leaders. However, she said a demand for her to resign would not make a positive start for a new coalition. If fresh elections are to happen, they would need to be called by Mr Steinmeier, after a long drawn-out process that would take months. But he appears to view new polls as a last resort. In a brief address earlier on Monday he told politicians they had a responsibility that could not just be handed back to voters. ""Inside our country, but also outside, in particular in our European neighbourhood, there would be concern and a lack of understanding if politicians in the biggest and economically strongest country [in Europe] did not live up to their responsibilities,"" he said in a statement. Mrs Merkel's bloc won September's poll, but many voters deserted the mainstream parties. Negotiations between the pro-market FDP, the Greens and the conservative CDU/CSU bloc had gone on for four weeks before the FDP's surprise withdrawal late on Sunday. Mrs Merkel blamed the FDP for the collapse, saying that the parties were on the ""home straight"" when the liberals pulled out. But FDP leader Christian Lindner has defended his party, saying it ""did not take such a decision lightly"". Despite Mrs Merkel's words about a fresh poll, analysts say the new elections would be likely to benefit the anti-Islam, anti-immigrant AfD most, so other parties would probably try to avoid them.

"President Mugabe's party said his wife ""has no right to run government"" Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party is set to begin impeachment proceedings against President Robert Mugabe on charges that include allowing his wife ""to usurp constitutional power"". The motion is now due to be presented to parliament on Tuesday. Senior party member Paul Mangwana said the process could take as little as two days to complete, and President Mugabe could be removed by Wednesday. A deadline set by Zanu-PF for his resignation passed on Monday. Separately, military leaders said they had planned a ""roadmap"" for Mr Mugabe's future, and that the ousted former vice-president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, would return to the country soon. Grace Mugabe and Mr Mnangagwa had both been seen as potential successors to the ageing president. But earlier this month, Mr Mugabe fired his deputy - widely seen as an endorsement of his wife - prompting a military intervention. The country's top general said Mr Mugabe and his former deputy had been in contact, and would hold in-person talks soon. Zimbabwe's constitution allows for impeachment on grounds of ""serious misconduct"", ""violation"" of the constitution or ""failure to obey, uphold or defend"" it, or ""incapacity"". ""The main charge is that he has allowed his wife to usurp constitutional power when she has no right to run government. But she is insulting civil servants, the vice president, at public rallies. They are denigrating the army - those are the charges,"" Paul Mangwana said, emerging from a party meeting. ""He has refused to implement the constitution of Zimbabwe - particularly we had elections for the provincial councils, but up to now they have not been put into office. ""He is of advanced age, that he no longer has the physical capacity to run government,"" he added. ""He is a stubborn man, he can hear the voices of the people, but is refusing to listen."" Monday's developments as they happened Grace Mugabe: Zimbabwe's polarising first lady Impeachment proceedings are now expected to be launched on Tuesday, with votes in both the National Assembly and the Senate. Both chambers must then appoint a joint committee to investigate removing the president. If the committee recommends impeachment, the president can then be removed if both houses back it with two-thirds majorities. ""We are expecting the motion to be moved tomorrow... and hopefully by Wednesday - because the charges are so clear - we expect that by Wednesday, we should be able to vote in parliament,"" Mr Mangwana said. This video can not be played Zimbabwe reacts: ""We need him to resign... our lives are terrible right now"" The opposition MDC-T party has tried unsuccessfully to impeach Mr Mugabe in the past. But with the support of Mr Mugabe's own Zanu-PF party, which has an overwhelming majority in both houses, the vote is now likely to go against him. If the impeachment goes ahead, the military can claim that he was removed legally, and not by armed force. If that happens, current vice-president Phelekezela Mphoko should assume the role. But Mr Mphoko is a known supporter of Grace Mugabe, and the generals would prefer to install Emmerson Mnangagwa, the former vice-president who was named the new Zanu-PF party chief on Sunday. What next for Robert and Grace Mugabe? Zimbabwe's next likely leader, the ""crocodile"" This video can not be played Zimbabwe's week of upheaval in two minutes The crisis began two weeks ago when the 93-year-old leader sacked Mr Mnangagwa, angering army commanders who saw it as an attempt to position his wife as the next president. With Zimbabwe embroiled in a deep economic crisis, the president had already seen some of his support wane. Last week, soldiers seized control of the state broadcaster and placed the president under house arrest - but denied their actions amounted to a military coup. Since then, he has been held at his ""blue roof"" mansion near the capital. On Sunday, Mr Mugabe gave a televised address which surprised many Zimbabweans because it made no mention of the pressure from his party and the public to quit. Surrounded by generals, he declared that the military had done nothing wrong by seizing power and placing him under house arrest. He then vowed to preside over the Zanu-PF party congress, due in a few weeks. Zimbabwe in 10 numbers The army chief who took power from Mugabe Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? Five things about Zimbabwe crisis The BBC's Africa editor, Fergal Keane, said his understanding of the situation was that Mr Mugabe had agreed to resign, but then changed his mind. Mr Mugabe is now opposed by his own party as well as the political opposition, the military and the powerful War Veterans Association. The public has also poured on to the streets in protest, calling for the end of Mr Mugabe's 37-year presidency. Why China matters to Zimbabwe's leaders Robert Mugabe - hero or villain?

"Brexit supporters in the cabinet have agreed the UK should offer to pay more money to the EU as it leaves. But no formal offer will be made until the EU agrees to begin talking about a new trade deal with the UK. No new figure has been given - but it is thought it could be up to Â£40bn, which would be double what the UK's offers so far add up to. The UK and the EU have yet to agree on the so-called ""divorce bill"" with the UK due to leave the EU in March 2019. Some Conservative MPs have reacted angrily to the possibility of the UK agreeing to pay more - yesterday one, Nigel Evans, said it would be like a ""ransom payment"" to the EU while another, Robert Halfon, said it would make voters ""go bananas"". But despite this, BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said leading Brexiteers in Theresa May's cabinet, like Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, had agreed to support her in paying a ""much larger sum"" - as long as the EU agrees to begin trade talks, which it has refused to do so far. And no final figure will be agreed until a trade deal is agreed, he added. Laura Kuenssberg: How May got cabinet onside Brexit divorce bill: Reality Check asks what's happening Flashback to 24 June 2016 as Leave campaigners celebrated the Brexit result The UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016, and served the EU with formal notice of Brexit in March 2017. This began a two-year countdown to the UK's departure day which will be in March 2019. Before that the two sides have to agree all sorts of things - including what happens to EU citizens living in the UK and British people living in the EU, and how the Northern Ireland border will work. So the two teams of negotiators have been meeting in Brussels every month. But there has not been much of a breakthrough so far, with the ""divorce bill"" proving to be one of the key sticking points. Part of the problem for Theresa May is that while the EU wants the UK to offer more money, some of her MPs say this would be unacceptable and that the UK should just walk away and leave. EU leaders are due to decide at a summit on 14 and 15 December whether to allow talks on a future trade relationship to begin. All you need to know about Brexit David Davis and Liam Fox leave Number 10 after the meeting It was billed as a key meeting where Theresa May would try to get her ministers on side to support her in negotiating cash with the EU. Downing Street has been tight-lipped about what was actually discussed at the Cabinet Exit and Trade (Strategy and Negotiations) sub-committee, chaired by Prime Minister Theresa May. But the BBC understands ministers concluded there is the possibility that talks with the EU will move on to the next phase in December but ""we are not going to move on our own"". There were also tensions over the future role of the European Court of Justice. Some believe the court will need to supervise the trading rules between the UK and EU during a period of transition after Britain leaves. Chancellor Philip Hammond has floated the idea of a tribunal, similar to the arrangements in place in European Economic Area countries such as Norway, to settle any disputes. But the EU may insist on a continued role for the European Court of Justice. Poland is one of the largest recipients of EU development funding The EU says the UK needs to settle its accounts before it leaves. It says the UK has made financial commitments that have to be settled as part of an overall withdrawal agreement. The UK accepts that it has some obligations. And it has promised not to leave any other country out of pocket in the current EU budget period from 2014-20. But the devil is in the detail. There are also issues like pensions for EU staff, and how the UK's contribution to these is calculated for years to come, and the question of what happens to building projects - for instance in Spain - that had funding agreed by all EU members including the UK but which will only begin construction after the UK has left. Large amounts of the EU's budget are spent in two areas - agriculture and fisheries, and development of poorer areas. Projects include business start-ups, roads and railways, education and health programmes and many others. Reality Check: What's happening with the divorce bill? Reality Check: Where does EU money go?

Norman Smith on the Brexit divorce bill Glum CDU faces: After three weeks of talks Mrs Merkel said no deal had been reached While Theresa May is battling to get her party onside, over in Germany there's more upheaval, where coalition talks have broken down, plunging Chancellor Angela Merkel into a political crisis. This has raised the prospect of more elections in Germany, the EU's largest economy. How might this affect Brexit? Tory backbencher Andrew Bridgen told the BBC there could be ""no meaningful negotiations"" with the EU until it was resolved, adding: ""Why would we want to make concessions now when we don't have to?"" Tory MPs Jacob Rees-Mogg and Iain Duncan Smith agree - Mr Duncan Smith told The Times the UK should ""sit tight"". But on the BBC's Today programme, German minister Christian Schmidt warned Tory Brexiteers not to try to take advantage of the political turmoil in his country to drive a harder bargain. ""I would suggest to all not to count on such a scenario,"" he said, adding that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal it will be a ""disaster"" for its economy.

"Robert Mugabe has led Zimbabwe for 37 years Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party is planning to support impeachment proceedings against Robert Mugabe, after he ignored a deadline to stand down as president. Zimbabweans - and many watching around the world - were astounded on Sunday night when Mr Mugabe addressed the nation and said that far from stepping down, he was going to stay on and preside over the ruling party's congress in December. So with Mr Mugabe defiant, and the army insisting that it has not carried out a a coup, what are the options for getting him to vacate his position? Here are five possible scenarios: Zanu-PF members sang and danced as they sacked Mr Mugabe as leader Zanu-PF says it will launch impeachment proceedings against Mr Mugabe when parliament convenes on Tuesday. Impeachment is the process of removing a president via parliament. Both the National Assembly and the Senate can begin proceedings to remove the president if both pass simple majority votes against him. A two-thirds majority is needed in both houses in order for impeachment to succeed. Zanu-PF has a two-thirds majority in the House of Assembly, but not the Senate. The formal process is expected to start on Tuesday but it is not clear how long it would take. The benefit of this process for the military is that it allows the generals to say the removal of the president was done in accordance with the constitution, in keeping with their statement that this is not a coup. The downside for them is that it does not guarantee that the man widely thought to be their favourite for president will get the top job straight away. People in Harare celebrated Zanu-PF sacked Robert Mugabe as their leader Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose sacking prompted the military's action, could not immediately take over from Mr Mugabe, because constitutionally it is the current vice-president who should fill the vacancy. At the moment that person is Phelekezela Mphoko - a man whose sympathies are known to lie with Grace Mugabe, and who was expelled by Zanu-PF on Sunday. Whether the army can persuade Mr Mugabe to appoint their preferred candidate as vice-president before stepping down remains to be seen. Some analysts have argued that this may be what the generals were discussing with him - and it may also be his trump card. But given how difficult it has been to get Mr Mugabe to step down, the chances of getting him to concede further ground look increasingly slim. Five things you should know about Zimbabwe This video can not be played Robert Mugabe: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"" President Mugabe was defiant when he made his televised address on Sunday. Despite having been sacked by Zanu-PF, he said ""the party congress is due in a few weeks and I will preside over its processes"". He suggested that he was willing to forgive the military action, and said ""whatever the pros and cons of how they [the army] went about their operation, I, as commander-in-chief, do acknowledge their concerns"". It had been reported that Mr Mugabe had agreed to resign. It is unclear whether he changed his mind, or if these reports were incorrect. But BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane says it makes the military look weak. Some suggest that there may be grounds within Zanu-PF's own rules which might allow Mr Mugabe to reject his sacking by the party. President Mugabe is known for both being shrewd and stubborn. So he may well have another ace up his sleeve. Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? There is growing speculation over the whereabouts of Grace Mugabe Initially it had been thought that the military was trying to reach a deal which would allow President Mugabe to stay in Zimbabwe once he had stood down. But the current stalemate makes that look less likely. From the point of view of Mr Mugabe, and his wife, there is a fear that even if he were to be promised immunity from prosecution now, that could be removed by a future government. So it might mean that Mr Mugabe is forced into exile. Until recently, neighbouring South Africa would have been a natural place for him to go. Mr Mugabe enjoys a high level of respect there, in large part because of his support for the fight against apartheid rule. Indeed, the opposition EFF party has called on the government to ""prepare to welcome President Mugabe for political asylum"". Allow Twitter content?

The Mugabes are reported to have a number of properties in South Africa. The sticking point would be what happens to Grace. She was granted diplomatic immunity after allegedly assaulting a model in a hotel room in Johannesburg in August. But model Gabriella Engels is trying to get the diplomatic immunity order set aside. If successful, it would mean Mrs Mugabe could face prosecution should she go to South Africa. So if not South Africa, then where? Other possible options are Singapore and Malaysia, where the Mugabes also have properties. 'Gucci Grace' The leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai (MDC-T) party is back in Harare after receiving treatment for cancer in South Africa, fuelling speculation about negotiations for a unity government. Morgan Tsvangirai is back in Harare This is the scenario that many in the West, and of course the opposition, would prefer. Another opposition leader, Tendai Biti, has said that he would join a national unity government if Mr Tsvangirai was also in it. But the military takeover was not a change of regime. It was an internal dispute within Zanu-PF, and that party is still very much in power. The military is to a large extent the armed wing of Zanu-PF. And the man it supports as leader - Emmerson Mnangagwa - helped Robert Mugabe carry out some of his most controversial policies. Emmerson Mnangagwa is the man the military wants to take over He is also, some say, more ruthless. So it is far from clear that the ousting of Mr Mugabe would improve the lives of ordinary Zimbabweans. Zimbabwe's next president?

"Paris has won a battle to host the European Banking Authority (EBA), which will relocate from London after the UK leaves the European Union. The French capital's victory follows a win earlier for Amsterdam, which will host the London-based European Medicines Agency (EMA). Paris was picked after lots were drawn when three rounds of voting failed to produce a winner. The EMA and the EBA currently employ about 1,000 people in London. French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that the win for Paris was ""a recognition of France's attractiveness and European commitment"". Ministers from the 27 EU countries remaining in the bloc after the UK departs in 2019 took part in a secret ballot to pick the victors.

Frankfurt, which is home to the European Central Bank, lost out early in the voting. The EMA is the more alluring of the two bodies, as it promises to make its new host into a hub for Europe's medical industry.

"Shoppers should be wary of Black Friday deals which are often not as good as they seem, says consumer group Which? More than half of last year's Black Friday deals were cheaper or the same price at other times of year, according to the consumer group.

Around Â£2.6bn is expected to be spent this Black Friday which marks the day after Thanksgiving, when shops try to tempt people with big discounts. ""It's easy to get swept along by the hype and excitement on the day, so we recommend  doing some preparation and research to help make sure you really are getting a good deal,"" said Alex Neill, the group's managing director of home products and services.

"Muslim campaigners have condemned ""discriminatory"" plans for schoolinspectors to question girlswho wear hijab in primary school. Head of Ofsted Amanda Spielman said pupils would be asked why they wear the headscarf, which ""could be interpreted as sexualisation of young girls"". But some have asked why the pupils and not the schools will be challenged. Ofsted said the move was in line with its current practice of assessing whether a school promotes equality. The hijab is traditionally worn as a sign of modesty once a girl reaches puberty. Research by the National Secular Society in September suggested 59 of 142 Islamic schools, including 27 primary schools, in England have a uniform policy which states a head-covering is compulsory. ""The hijab in primary schools should be something that is dealt with via the schools uniform policy,"" said Sajda Mughal, head of JAN Trust, a charity working with BAME and Muslim women. She called the move by Ofsted ""nonsense and discriminatory"" and said it will be used by extremists to advance their narrative of ""them and us'"" and could fuel marginalisation. ""I know as a Muslim mother of young girls, I'd be alarmed and horrified if I found that my daughters were questioned if they wore the hijab,"" she said. Inspectors to quiz schoolgirls in hijabs Why wear a hijab? This was echoed by human rights campaigner Aisha Ali-Khan, who said the primary schools should be held to account ""rather than quizzing little girls"". Oftsed should instead ask ""why are primary school uniform policies allowing hijab for girls under the age of puberty when Islamic laws state otherwise,"" she added. Allow Twitter content?

But Amina Lone, from the Social Action and Research Foundation, was one of those who lobbied Ofsted to take action. ""As a second generation Muslim woman and a parent, I have huge concerns about the increasing encroachment of gender inequality in public spaces for women of faith,"" she told the BBC's Asian Network. ""The hijab is absolutely not required for children. ""Gender equality was hard fought for in this country and we shouldn't be diluting that."" She said it was ""absurd"" to be having this debate in 2017 and stressed this was not about secondary school children or adults. The Muslim cosplayer who uses the hijab in her outfits What's the difference between a hijab, niqab and burka? There is no ban on Islamic dress in the UK, but schools are allowed to decide their own dress code. Currentgovernment advice,externalstates: ""Pupils have the right to manifest a religion or belief, but not necessarily at all times, places or in a particular manner."" Shereen, a hijabi, said the choice should be between the parents and the child. The mother-of two, whose own daughters do not wear a hijab, said the headscarf has been misrepresented. ""It has nothing to do with sexualising children. That claim is ridiculous,"" she told the BBC Asian Network. Vlogger and mother, Nilly Dahlia agreed. She started wearing hijab aged 22. ""Hijab is not about sexualisation. It is a sign of submission to our faith,"" she said. ""I do feel like the government are trying to control Muslims."" But blogger Hifsa Haroon-Iqbal said the issue was simply a school uniform one. ""If schools do not want young children in primary education to wear hijabs in school, this needs to be made explicitly clear within the school uniform policy. ""This is not about racism, being islamophobic or discriminatory. It is common sense,"" the mother-of-threewrote,external.

"An open letter calls for chief executive of the South West Ambulance Service to resign Ambulance staff have called for their boss to quit as they ""struggle to maintain a crumbling service"". GMB union members from South West Ambulance Service (SWASFT) have written a letter ""apologising"" to the public for ""potentially putting them at risk"". They have told chief executive Ken Wenman government cuts have led to ""despair and frustration"" among staff. Mr Wenman said SWASFT was working to ""improve resource levels"" and ""urged"" GMB to ""re-engage and talk to us"". He has not commented publicly on the call for him to resign. The open letter was addressed as an ""apology to our families, friends and the community"". To the public, they said they were ""sorry for not getting to you or your loved ones quick enough because there are just not enough of us"". They also apologised to family and friends for times when they missed ""yet another family occasion"". They also wrote that they felt ""unsupported"" by their employer SWASFT. This dispute is all about changes to rotas as well as concern from members that they are having to work for longer than their usual 12-hour shift. But it must be remembered the GMB is not recognised by SWASFT, and part of their mission is to recruit more members to take them above the 25% figure that would help that come about. Having said that, the main union Unison is also concerned about work load, especially with the extra demands on their service due to problems with the out of hours service in Somerset, and closure at night of Weston A&E unit. But Unison has not gone as far as to call for any heads to roll. Gary Palmer, from the GMB, said: ""We felt this recent letter on behalf of a group of GMB members particularly summoned up the general despair and frustration many staff currently feel from working within a service and role they love."" Tony Fox, from SWASFT, said: ""We accept that there is always more to be done and we will continue to work closely with our colleagues and listen and respond to their needs.""

"This video can not be played A woman from West Yorkshire has taken part in the study about maternal sleeping positions. Women are being advised to sleep on their side in the last three months of pregnancy to help prevent stillbirth. A study of just over 1,000 women found the risk doubles if women go to sleep on their backs in the third trimester. The study looked into 291 pregnancies that ended in stillbirth and 735 women who had a live birth. Researchers say the position which women fall asleep in is most important - and they should not worry if they are on their back when they wake up. About one in 225 pregnancies in the UK ends in stillbirth and the study authors estimate that about 130 babies' lives a year could be saved if women went to sleep on their side. The MiNESS study, published in theBritish Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (BJOG),externalis the biggest of its kind, and confirms findings fromsmaller studiesin New Zealand and Australia. Prof Alexander Heazell, clinical director at the Tommy's Stillbirth Research Centre at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester, who led the research, advises women in their third trimester to sleep on their side for any episode of sleep, including daytime naps. ""What I don't want is for women to wake up flat on their back and think 'oh my goodness I've done something awful to my baby'. ""The question that we asked was very specifically what position people went to sleep in and that's important as you spend longer in that position than you do in any other. ""And also you can't do anything about the position that you wake up in but you can do something about the position you go to sleep."" Put a pillow or pillows behind your back to encourage side-sleeping If you wake during the night, check your position and go back to sleep on your side Pay the same attention to sleep position during the day as you would during the night If you wake on your back during the night, don't worry, just roll on to your side The study didn't find a difference in risk between right or left side Source: Tommy's charity,external Researchers can't say for certain why the risk of stillbirth is increased - but there is a lot of data that suggests when a woman is lying on her back, the combined weight of the baby and womb puts pressure on blood vessels which can then restrict blood flow and oxygen to the baby. Edward Morris, from the BJOG, said the new research was ""extremely welcome"" . ""This is an important study which adds to the growing body of evidence that sleep position in late pregnancy is a modifiable risk factor for stillbirth."" The pregnancy charity Tommy's has starteda campaign,externalto raise awareness of the study and to encourage women to sleep on their side.

"This video can not be played Trump: ""N Korea supported acts of international terrorism"" President Trump has announced that the US is re-designating North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism, nine years after it was removed from the list. In a cabinet meeting, he said the move would trigger ""very large"" additional sanctions to be announced on Tuesday. But Secretary of State Rex Tillerson later admitted that ""the practical effects may be limited"". Mr Trump blamed the country's nuclear programme, and support for what he called international acts of terrorism. While announcing the decision at the White House, the US president said it ""should have happened a long time ago"". North Korea crisis explained in 300 words How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? How should Trump handle North Korea? In September, the US proposed a range of United Nations sanctions against North Korea, including an oil ban and a freeze on leader Kim Jong-un's assets. It followed the North's sixth nuclear test and repeated missile launches. North Korea joins Iran, Sudan and Syria on a list of countries that are deemed to have repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism. The country has been on the list before but was removed in 2008 by the administration of George W Bush as part of negotiations on the North's nuclear programme. The campaign to reinstate it intensified after the American college student Otto Warmbier died shortly after he was released from North Korean custody. By Barbara Plett Usher, State Department correspondent, BBC News Secretary Tillerson hasn't given up on a negotiated solution to the stand-off with North Korea. He told journalists he still hoped for diplomacy. But the decision to put Pyongyang back on the list of state sponsors of terrorism will almost certainly set back the possibility of any opening for talks, at least in the short term. The chances of that happening were slim anyway. And it might prompt a backlash from North Korea, perhaps by way of another missile test. The Americans have had some success in getting other countries to tighten the noose on Pyongyang, including from China. Mr Tillerson's goal remains to eventually force the regime to back down and agree to negotiations aimed at giving up its nuclear weapons programme, something Pyongyang has refused to do. China on the other hand, is pushing for talks now, alongside the pressure. It won't be happy about anything that makes that less likely Speaking to reporters at a White House press briefing, Mr Tillerson, the top US diplomat, said the designation was meant to hold North Korea accountable for recent actions it has taken ""including assassinations outside of their country"" and ""using banned chemical weapons"". He admitted that given existing sanctions it was ""very symbolic"" but also said new measures could ""disrupt and dissuade some third parties from undertaking certain activities with North Korea"". ""The practical effects may be limited but hopefully we're closing off a few loopholes with this,"" he said. Will we ever know what happened to Otto Warmbier? Warmbier coroner queries torture claim Mr Kim continues to pursue nuclear weapons and missile programmes in defiance of UN Security Council sanctions.

He has made no secret of Pyongyang's plans to develop a missile capable of reaching the US mainland and has claimed to have developed a hydrogen bomb.

"Origins of teeth traced back to primitive fish scales Teeth grew from the scales of primitive shark-like fish millions of years ago, research by scientists suggests. Old lineage cartilaginous fish like sharks, skates and rays that have skin which contained small spiky scales or ""dermal denticles"" may be the key, scientists say. Cambridge University said their tooth-like appearance is no accident. Researchers suggest it may be a direct link between us and marine ancestors from up to 400 million years ago. During early evolution of jawed vertebrates, dermal denticles were transferred from the skins of primitive fish to their mouth. In the millennia that followed, the tiny appendages went on to produce the flesh-tearing six-inch long teeth of dinosaur Tyrannosaurus rex and the fangs of the sabre-toothed cat, the team said. A close-up of a fish scale Lead scientist Dr Andrew Gillis, from the Department of Zoology, said: ""Stroke a shark and you'll find it feels rougher than other fish, as shark skin is covered entirely in dermal denticles. ""By labelling the different types of cells in the embryos of skate, we were able to trace their fates. ""We show that... the denticle scales of sharks and skate develop from neural crest cells, just like teeth."" Neural crest cells are central to the process of tooth development in mammals said Dr Gillis, adding their finding suggest a deep evolutionary relationship between the primitive fish scales and the teeth of vertebrates. The fact teeth and sharks' denticle scales both arise from the same kind of embryonic cell suggests a common evolutionary origin, the team reported in the journalProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,external. The skins of sharks are all that remains of amour plating that clad their jawless forbears some 400 million years ago to protect against predators such as sea scorpions.

"Gen Constantino Chiwenga, 61, is being hailed as a political saviour after he led the military takeover in Zimbabwe, however he is under sanctions from the European Union and the US - for his role in a brutal crackdown on the opposition, and over the seizure of white-owned farms. Zimbabweans took to the streets on Saturday to demand President Robert Mugabe's resignation, holding aloft placards which declared: ""Zimbabwe army - the voice of the people."" Pastor Patrick Mugadza, hounded by the police in January this year for predicting that the 93-year-old leader would die in nine months' time, went as far as to announce that he intended to name his son after the general. ""My wife is very, very pregnant. When the boy comes, I will be naming him after you, General Chiwenga,"" Zimbabwe's privately owned NewsDay newspaperquoted him as saying in an audio message,external. Gen Chiwenga says he stepped in to end the economic suffering of Zimbabweans Yet, Gen Chiwenga played a central role in keeping Mr Mugabe in power after he lost elections to his main rival, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), in 2008, amid reports that Mr Mugabe was going to accept defeat. ""He told Mugabe: 'We can't lose elections. We can't hand power to the MDC. We are going to obliterate them,"" UK-based Africa confidential magazine editor Patrick Smith told the BBC, adding that he carried out the operation with Emmerson Mnangagwa, the man Gen Chiwenga is trying to install as Mr Mugabe's successor as president. ""They are joined at the hip, with Mnangagwa the senior partner,"" Mr Smith said. After a long delay, the official results were announced, saying that Mr Tsvangirai had not gained the 50% required for victory and so a second round was needed. Before the run-off, pro-Zanu-PF militias backed by the security forces attacked opposition supporters around the country, beating, raping and killing. Mr Tsvangirai pulled out of the second round and Mr Mugabe remained in power. This opposition supporter was one of thousands who said their homes were attacked by pro-Zanu-PF militias Gen Chiwenga joined the guerrilla war against white minority rule in the then Rhodesia as a teenager and got military training in Mozambique and Tanzania. After independence, he received British training, as a new army, made up of ex-guerrillas and soldiers of the former white minority regime, was formed. Power in Zimbabwe is monopolised by those who fought the 1970s war of independence Recalling his ex-student in an interview with the UK-basedSunday Times newspaper, retired Lt-Col Zach Freeth, 76, said Gen Chiwenga  was once caught cheating,external, and while he was deciding what to do with him the next morning, he received news that that the ex-guerrilla fighter, then in his 20s, had shot himself in the chest twice but had miraculously survived. Lt-Col Freeth said the incident was forgotten, but when Gen Chiwenga was appointed defence chief in 2003 he invited him to his home. ""He gave me his card and said: 'If you ever need anything...' We both knew what he was referring to."" Lt-Col Freeth was quoted as saying: ""I knew him very well. I probably did too good a job."" Many Zimbabweans are hoping that the army's intervention will lead to the downfall of Mr Mugabe A Zimbabwean lawyer, who has met Gen Chiwenga on several occasions, offered a different perspective of the army chief. ""He is fearless, and as tough as nails,"" the lawyer, who asked not to be identified, told the BBC. ""In terms of his political outlook, he is a Pan-Africanist at heart. He abhors the notion that Western values are superior. He believes in equal recognition, and that comes from the heart,"" the lawyer added. Now married to Mary Chiwenga - a former model and ex-wife of footballer Shingi Kazwondera - Gen Chiwenga was involved in a messy divorce about five years ago when he ended his marriage to his then-wife, Jocelyn. At the time, the privately owned NewZimbabwe.com news site reported that it had seen court papers in which Gen Chiwenga alleged that his wife used to beat him up, and even thrashed his office at military headquarters. She hit back, alleging that she was, in fact, the victim, and their marriage ran into trouble because he was having an affair with his current wife. President Mugabe's plan to anoint his wife, Grace, as his successor caused the crisis Gen Chiwenga's messy divorce enhanced, rather than damaged, his reputation among his troops. As one soldier told the BBC: ""The general is a very patient man. Look at how his relationship with Jocelyn was, but he waited for the right time to call it off."" His second wife obtained a degree from a university where Mr Mugabe is the chancellor just two days after the general took power. Mr Mugabe conferred degrees on more than 3,000 students, in his first public appearance since being put under house arrest. However, Mrs Chiwenga failed to attend. President Robert Mugabe was to have conferred a degree on the general's wife The veteran leader's appearance in public was intended to show that the general was treating him kindly. Said the soldier: ""Gen Chiwenga is a man of the people, a hard-working person who stands for the truth. He is an achiever.... No matter what is happening, the president will never win."" The army chief put Mr Mugabe under house arrest after the president had sacked the general's close ally Vice-President Mnangagwa, in a move seen as an attempt to install the Mr Mugabe's wife, Grace, as his successor. Days earlier, Gen Chiwenga had warned that ""the current purging, which is clearly targeting members of the party with a liberation background, must stop forthwith"". Gen Chiwenga then went to China, and Mr Mugabe's allies in the security forces planned to arrest him on his return, Mr Smith said. But the general got wind of the plot, and a strong contingent of  loyalist troops arrived at the airport, to prevent his detention. Shortly afterwards, the army chief took power, but insisted that he was not staging a coup. Zimbabwe's army says the worsening economic crisis threatens national security The army said it had intervened to arrest the ""criminals"" around Mr Mugabe, a reference to the political faction headed by Mrs Mugabe, and to end the economic suffering of Zimbabweans. His intervention caught Zimbabweans by surprise but, as the lawyer who has observed his career closely, said: ""Once you cross a certain path, he does not hesitate to act. However, he respects Mugabe and will want him to go out in the most dignified way possible. ""He is genuinely worried about the economic crisis and sees it as a threat to national security. So, he wants the politicians to start dealing with it, and he did not think the G40 faction [headed by Mrs Mugabe] would,"" said the lawyer. Gen Chiwenga flanked Mr Mugabe when he addressed the nation on Sunday night, vowing to remain in office despite the intense pressure on him to leave office. The army chief helped the president with his papers, as he struggled to read his long speech, and his officers saluted Mr Mugabe, still their commander-in-chief. ""It was theatre intended to show that the military are not bully boys picking on a nonagenarian. They want this to be sorted out as amicably as possible,"" Africa Confidential's Mr Smith said.

"Laura Plummer is in police custody in the resort of Hurghada The sister of a British woman facing drug smuggling charges in Egypt has apologised to the country's officials. Laura Plummer, 33, faces a trial accused of entering the country with 300 Tramadol tablets, a painkiller legal in the UK but not in Egypt. She is in police custody in Hurghada awaiting a hearing date. Her sister Rachel told officials she had ""unintentionally done wrong"" and apologised for ""bringing such trouble to your country"". It is not clear whether the apology has been seen by the authorities, who have not commented. But in response to the apology, Ms Plummer's MP Karl Turner, described her as a ""decent, law-abiding"" citizen who had ""done something really silly"". Laura Plummer said the prescription pills were for her partner Omar Caboo Ms Plummer, a shop assistant from Hull, claims she was carrying the pills for her Egyptian partner, Omar Caboo, who suffers from back pain. She has been held in a cell, which she has to share with 25 other women. Rachel Plummer said her sister had carried out ""a totally innocent action"" In a statement, Rachel said she ""would like to place on record our gratitude for the fairness and just manner the Egyptian justice system has shown towards Laura"". ""We realise Laura has unintentionally done wrong in the eyes of the Egyptian authorities; a totally innocent action that has resulted in her being held in custody by the police in Hurghada,"" she said. ""Laura, along with all of us, loves Egypt and upon visits to see Laura we have been happy with the professional and fair way the police officers have been with Laura and we would like to apologise for bringing such trouble to your country."" Other family members have made no further comment. Laura Plummer said she had ""no idea"" the painkillers she was carrying were banned in the country He said he met Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson last week and was reassured ""the government is doing all it can"" to support Laura and her family.  The UK Foreign Office has not publicly commented. Ms Plummer said earlier this month she had ""no idea"" the painkillers she was carrying were banned in the country. But local police said ignorance of the law was no excuse. Tramadol is the most abused drug in Egypt, according to Ghada Wali, the country's Minister of Social Solidarity.

"Gen Constantino Chiwenga, 61, is being hailed as a political saviour after he led the military takeover in Zimbabwe, however he is under sanctions from the European Union and the US - for his role in a brutal crackdown on the opposition, and over the seizure of white-owned farms. Zimbabweans took to the streets on Saturday to demand President Robert Mugabe's resignation, holding aloft placards which declared: ""Zimbabwe army - the voice of the people."" Pastor Patrick Mugadza, hounded by the police in January this year for predicting that the 93-year-old leader would die in nine months' time, went as far as to announce that he intended to name his son after the general. ""My wife is very, very pregnant. When the boy comes, I will be naming him after you, General Chiwenga,"" Zimbabwe's privately owned NewsDay newspaperquoted him as saying in an audio message,external. Gen Chiwenga says he stepped in to end the economic suffering of Zimbabweans Yet, Gen Chiwenga played a central role in keeping Mr Mugabe in power after he lost elections to his main rival, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), in 2008, amid reports that Mr Mugabe was going to accept defeat. ""He told Mugabe: 'We can't lose elections. We can't hand power to the MDC. We are going to obliterate them,"" UK-based Africa confidential magazine editor Patrick Smith told the BBC, adding that he carried out the operation with Emmerson Mnangagwa, the man Gen Chiwenga is trying to install as Mr Mugabe's successor as president. ""They are joined at the hip, with Mnangagwa the senior partner,"" Mr Smith said. After a long delay, the official results were announced, saying that Mr Tsvangirai had not gained the 50% required for victory and so a second round was needed. Before the run-off, pro-Zanu-PF militias backed by the security forces attacked opposition supporters around the country, beating, raping and killing. Mr Tsvangirai pulled out of the second round and Mr Mugabe remained in power. This opposition supporter was one of thousands who said their homes were attacked by pro-Zanu-PF militias Gen Chiwenga joined the guerrilla war against white minority rule in the then Rhodesia as a teenager and got military training in Mozambique and Tanzania.

"Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, the man known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political cunning, achieved a long-held ambition to succeed Robert Mugabe as Zimbabwe's president in November last year. He has now won a disputed presidential election to legitimise his rule, promising voters his efforts to woo foreign investors will bring back the economy from the brink of collapse. Mr Mugabe resigned following a military takeover and mass demonstrations - all sparked by his sacking of Mr Mnangagwa as his vice-president. ""The crocodile"", who lived up to his name and snapped back, may have unseated Zimbabwe's only ruler, but he is also associated with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since independence in 1980. One veteran of the liberation struggle, who worked with him for many years, once put it simply: ""He's a very cruel man, very cruel."" But his children see him as a principled, if unemotional, man. His daughter, Farai Mlotshwa - a property developer and the eldest of his nine children by two wives - told BBC Radio 4 that he was a ""softie"". As if to reinforce this softer image of the new leader, a cuddly crocodile soft toy was passed among the Zanu-PF supporters who welcomed him back to the country after Mr Mugabe's resignation. Emmerson Mnangagwa is known as ""Ngwena"", the Shona word for crocodile And what he lacks in charisma and oratory prowess, he makes up for in pragmatism, says close friend and Zanu-PF politician Josiah Hungwe. ""Mnangagwa is a practical person. He is a person who recognises that politics is politics but people must eat,"" he told the BBC, adding that reforming Zimbabwe's disastrous economy will be the focus of his leadership. This video can not be played Emmerson Mnangagwa: Who is the man known as the âcrocodileâ? Known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his Zanu-PF faction is ""Lacoste"" Received military training in China and Egypt Tortured by Rhodesian forces after his ""crocodile gang"" staged attacks Helped direct Zimbabwe's war of independence in the 1960s and 1970s Became the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed, but has denied any role in the massacres Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after 2008 election Says he will deliver jobs, and seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on Mugabe supporters Find out more on BBC Radio 4's Profile. The exact year of Mr Mnangagwa's birth is not known - but he is thought to be 75, which would make him nearly 20 years younger than his predecessor who left power aged 93. Born in the central region of Zvishavane, he is a Karanga - the largest clan of Zimbabwe's majority Shona community. Some Karangas felt it was their turn for power, following 37 years of domination by Mr Mugabe's Zezuru clan, though Mr Mnangagwa was accused of profiting while under Mr Mugabe. According to a United Nations report in 2001, he was seen as ""the architect of the commercial activities of Zanu-PF"". This largely related to the operations of the Zimbabwean army and businessmen in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Zimbabwean troops intervened in the DR Congo conflict on the side of the government and, like those of other countries, were accused of using the conflict to loot some of its rich natural resources such as diamonds, gold and other minerals. More recently military officials - many behind his rise to power -have been accused of benefiting from the rich Marange diamond fields in eastern Zimbabwe, with reports of killings and human rights abuses there. Despite his money-raising role, Mr Mnangagwa, a lawyer who grew up in Zambia, was not always well-loved by the rank and file of his own party. A Zanu-PF official posed an interesting question when asked about Mr Mnangagwa's prospects: ""You think Mugabe is bad, but have you thought that whoever comes after him could be even worse?"" The opposition candidate who defeated Mr Mnangagwa in the 2000 parliamentary campaign in Kwekwe Central, Blessing Chebundo, might agree. During a bitter campaign, Mr Chebundo escaped death by a whisker when the Zanu-PF youths who had abducted him and doused him with petrol were unable to light a match. Those who fought in Zimbabwe's war of independence have long monopolised power Mr Mnangagwa's fearsome reputation was made during the civil war which broke out in the 1980s between Mr Mugabe's Zanu party and the Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo. As national security minister, he was in charge of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), which worked hand in glove with the army to suppress Zapu. Thousands of civilians - mainly ethnic Ndebeles, seen as Zapu supporters - were killed in a campaign known as Gukurahundi, before the two parties merged to form Zanu-PF. Among countless other atrocities carried out by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade of the army, villagers were forced at gunpoint to dance on the freshly dug graves of their relatives and chant pro-Mugabe slogans. Mr Mnangagwa has denied any role in the massacres, but the wounds are still painful and many party officials, not to mention voters, in Matabeleland might find it hard to back Mr Mnangagwa. He does enjoy the support of many of the war veterans who led the campaign of violence against the white farmers and the opposition from 2000. They remember him as one of the men who, following his military training in China and Egypt, directed the fight for independence in the 1960s and 1970s. He also attended the Beijing School of Ideology, run by the Chinese Communist Party. Mr Mnangagwa's official profile says he was the victim of state violence after being arrested by the white-minority government in the former Rhodesia in 1965, when the ""crocodile gang"" he led helped blow up a train near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo). ""He was tortured, severely resulting in him losing his sense of hearing in one ear,"" the profile says. ""Part of the torture techniques involved being hanged with his feet on the ceiling and the head down. The severity of the torture made him unconscious for days."" As he said he was under 21 at the time, he was not executed but instead sentenced to 10 years in prison. ""He has scars from that period. He was young and brave,"" a close friend of Mr Mnangagwa once said, asking not to be named. ""Perhaps that explains why he is indifferent. Horrible things happened to him when he was young."" Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? The crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Zimbabwe's exiled white farmers return Snapping at the heels of Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' The age factor His ruthlessness, which it could be argued he learnt from his Rhodesian torturers, is said to have been seen again in 2008 when he reportedly masterminded Zanu-PF's response to Mr Mugabe losing the first round of the president election to long-time rival Morgan Tsvangirai. The military and state security organisations unleashed a campaign of violence against opposition supporters, leaving hundreds dead and forcing thousands from their homes. Mr Tsvangirai then pulled out of the second round and Mr Mugabe was re-elected. Mr Mnangagwa has not commented on allegations he was involved in planning the violence, but an insider in the party's security department later confirmed that he was the political link between the army, intelligence and Zanu-PF. He was seen as Mr Mugabe's right-hand man - that is until the former first lady Grace Mugabe became politically ambitious and tried to edge him out. Their rivalry took a bizarre turn when he fell ill in August 2017 at a political rally led by former President Mugabe and had to be airlifted to South Africa. Grace Mugabe (right) bit off more than she could chew by taking on Mr Mnangagwa His supporters suggested that a rival group within Zanu-PF had poisoned him and appeared to blame ice cream from Mrs Mugabe's dairy firm. In his first words to cheering supporters after Mr Mugabe's resignation, he spoke about this plot and another plan to ""eliminate"" him. He has also blamed a group linked to the former first lady for an explosion in June at a Zanu-PF rally in Bulawayo in which two people died. But in a BBC interview, he said the country was safe, told foreign investors not to worry and sought to dispel his ruthless reputation: ""I am as soft as wool. I am a very soft person in life."" This video can not be played Mnangagwa: Criminal will be hounded down, but Zimbabwe is safe His youngest son, a Harare DJ known as St Emmo, blames his reticence for his fearsome reputation. ""He was a good father, very very strict. He doesn't say much and I think that's what frightens people - like: 'What is he thinking?'"" Nick Mangwana, Zanu-PF representative in the UK, accepts that the Zimbabwe's new leader is ""not the most eloquent"". ""He's not pally-pally but more of a do-er, more of a technocrat."" But in his six months in power he has fully embraced Twitter and Facebook - after the Bulawayo blast he posted a message reiterating the strength his Christian faith gives him.

Fixing the economy is what is paramount now. Zimbabweans are on average 15% poorer now than they were in the 1980s.

"Paris has won a battle to host the European Banking Authority (EBA), which will relocate from London after the UK leaves the European Union. The French capital's victory follows a win earlier for Amsterdam, which will host the London-based European Medicines Agency (EMA). Paris was picked after lots were drawn when three rounds of voting failed to produce a winner. The EMA and the EBA currently employ about 1,000 people in London. French President Emmanuel Macron tweeted that the win for Paris was ""a recognition of France's attractiveness and European commitment"". Ministers from the 27 EU countries remaining in the bloc after the UK departs in 2019 took part in a secret ballot to pick the victors. Some 16 cities bid for the EMA, while eight wanted to host the EBA - Brussels, Dublin, Frankfurt, Paris, Prague, Luxembourg City, Vienna and Warsaw. The final vote pitched Paris against Dublin. Frankfurt, which is home to the European Central Bank, lost out early in the voting. The EMA is the more alluring of the two bodies, as it promises to make its new host into a hub for Europe's medical industry. Commenting on the decision to award the EMA to Amsterdam, Italy's Europe Minister Sandro Gozi said: ""It's like losing a final on penalties.""

"Stationery company Paperchase has apologised for a promotional giveaway in the Daily Mail after it was criticised for working with the paper. The chain offered two free rolls of wrapping paper in Saturday's newspaper. It said it was ""truly sorry"" after hundreds of people - encouraged by campaign group Stop Funding Hate - urged the chain to end the partnership. A Daily Mail statement said it was ""deeply worrying"" Paperchase had let itself ""be bullied into apologising"". Stop Funding Hate lobbies firms to stop advertising with certain newspapers which it claims promote divisive views. The group has previously been involved ingetting companies such as Lego to pull advertising. It tweeted on Saturday: ""After a torrid few weeks of divisive stories about trans people, is a Daily Mail promotion what customers want to see from @FromPaperchase?"" Paperchase responded a few hours later by asking for customers' views and received hundreds of replies on Twitter.

"'Don't play Santa to the EU', a Tory MP is warning the government The UK government cannot afford to ""play Santa Claus"" to EU bosses by handing over billions of pounds, a Conservative MP says. Nigel Evans accused the EU of demanding ""ransom money"" from Theresa May to move Brexit negotiations forwards. He was speaking ahead of a meeting between Mrs May and senior ministers to try to make progress on the stalled talks. Downing Street has dismissed reports the UK could double its Â£20bn offer. After the meeting, a Downing Street source said: ""It remains our position that nothing's agreed until everything's agreed in negotiations with the EU. ""As the prime minister said this morning, the UK and the EU should step forward together."" This ""divorce bill"" is one of the main reasons for the logjam in negotiations between the UK and the EU. One ex-minister warned voters would ""go bananas"" if Â£40bn was offered, while Mr Evans told the BBC only cash the UK is ""absolutely contracted for"" should be handed over. ""Yes we will have obligations, but we're not going to pay ransom money simply to leave the European Union,"" he said, adding that the money saved by leaving the EU should be ""spent on British nurses not on Brussels bureaucrats"". Poland is one of the largest recipients of EU development funding The EU says the UK needs to settle its accounts before it leaves. It says the UK has made financial commitments that have to be settled as part of an overall withdrawal agreement. The UK accepts that it has some obligations. And it has promised not to leave any other country out of pocket in the current EU budget period from 2014-20. But the devil is in the detail. There are also issues like pensions for EU staff, and how the UK's contribution to these is calculated for years to come, and the question of what happens to building projects - for instance in Spain - that had funding agreed by all EU members including the UK but which will only begin construction after the UK has left. Large amounts of the EU's budget are spent in two areas - agriculture and fisheries, and development of poorer areas. Projects include business start-ups, roads and railways, education and health programmes and many others. Reality Check: What's happening with the divorce bill? Reality Check: Where does EU money go? The EU says it will not discuss a new trade deal with the UK until issues like the ""divorce bill"" have been settled, and has given Mrs May a deadline of early December to increase the UK's offer. The issue of the Irish border and what happens to EU and UK citizens living in each other's countries also needs to be settled. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Business Secretary Greg Clark said the amount the UK was prepared to offer should only be discussed in private because the UK had to ""exercise discipline"" in the negotiations. On Sunday Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK would come up with proposals in time for the crunch summit in mid-December, where the EU will decide whether to move the negotiations on to talking about future issues like trade. He promised Britain would honour its debts but also ""negotiate hard"" on the various aspects of the financial settlement. Theresa May is to meet some of her senior ministers to discuss the logjam in the Brexit talks Several government sources say the meeting of the Brexit strategy group today could change the course of our departure. The question to be answered could be profound. One source told me: ""People have to decide if they really want to make progress and support this prime minister, or not."" For some in government that tight group of cabinet ministers must take a decision as vital as that - do they want to do a deal with the EU, or not? Of course there is bravado on both sides. As ever, whether thinking of talks on the continent, or in government, take every utterance with a pinch of salt. Read the rest of Laura's blog on the Brexit money question Flashback to 24 June 2016 as Leave campaigners celebrated the Brexit result The UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016, and served the EU with formal notice of Brexit in March 2017. This began a two-year countdown to the UK's departure day which will be in March 2019. Before that the two sides have to agree all sorts of things - including what happens to people living in different countries, how the UK will trade with the EU in future and how the borders will be managed. So the two teams of negotiators have been meeting in Brussels every month. But there has not been much of a breakthrough so far, with the ""divorce bill"" proving to be one of the key sticking points. Part of the problem for Theresa May is that while the EU wants the UK to offer more money, some of her MPs say this would be unacceptable and that the UK should just walk away and leave. All you need to know about Brexit There are plenty of reports about what might happen in today's meeting in Monday's newspapers (although Downing Street has said it is just speculation). According to theDaily Telegraph,external, Brexiteers in the cabinet are expected to ""demand that Mrs May sets out exactly what Britain expects to get for its money before a penny more is promised"". TheMail,externalrejects any offer to pay a significantly larger divorce bill in the Brexit negotiations than what it calls the generous sum already pledged by Prime Minister Theresa May. It's not as if the EU has made a single concession to justify an improved offer, it declares. The paper resents the EU's insistence on the UK coming up with more money before trade talks can start and asks: ""Why should we surrender to blackmail?"" But the Timesaccepts that,externalBritain will have to pay more money - and says it would come with the expectation that the EU, in return, would place a meaningful trade deal on the table. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour, former minister Robert Halfon said people would not accept a ""huge"" sum not being spent on schools and hospitals. The Tory MP said that with austerity on the agenda ahead of Wednesday's Budget, ""if we start saying that we're going to give Â£40 to Â£50bn to the EU, I think the public will go bananas, absolutely spare"". Mr Halfon said he had backed Remain in the EU referendum, but added ""we voted to leave, the public want to leave, and I cannot believe that the public would accept such a huge amount when we need money for our schools, our hospitals, our housing, and many other things"". On Sunday Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK would honour its debts but also ""negotiate hard"" on the various aspects of the financial settlement. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been speaking today, saying he wanted the UK to ""settle the accounts accurately"" before beginning trade talks. The UK is currently in the EU's single market, which allows companies to sell goods across borders without fees being charged. After Brexit it wants to draw up a new free trade deal in its place. Mr Barnier said the UK would lose the benefits of the single market as a result of its desire for new controls over EU migration. In his speech, he attacked what he described as ""ardent Brexiteers"" for thinking Britain can be freed from EU rules and still participate in the single market.

Theresa May is to meet some of her senior ministers to discuss the logjam in the Brexit talks Several government sources say the meeting of the Brexit strategy group today could change the course of our departure. The question to be answered could be profound. One source told me: ""People have to decide if they really want to make progress and support this prime minister, or not."" For some in government that tight group of cabinet ministers must take a decision as vital as that - do they want to do a deal with the EU, or not? Of course there is bravado on both sides. As ever, whether thinking of talks on the continent, or in government, take every utterance with a pinch of salt. Read the rest of Laura's blog on the Brexit money question Flashback to 24 June 2016 as Leave campaigners celebrated the Brexit result The UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016, and served the EU with formal notice of Brexit in March 2017. This began a two-year countdown to the UK's departure day which will be in March 2019. Before that the two sides have to agree all sorts of things - including what happens to people living in different countries, how the UK will trade with the EU in future and how the borders will be managed. So the two teams of negotiators have been meeting in Brussels every month. But there has not been much of a breakthrough so far, with the ""divorce bill"" proving to be one of the key sticking points. Part of the problem for Theresa May is that while the EU wants the UK to offer more money, some of her MPs say this would be unacceptable and that the UK should just walk away and leave. All you need to know about Brexit There are plenty of reports about what might happen in today's meeting in Monday's newspapers (although Downing Street has said it is just speculation). According to theDaily Telegraph,external, Brexiteers in the cabinet are expected to ""demand that Mrs May sets out exactly what Britain expects to get for its money before a penny more is promised"". TheMail,externalrejects any offer to pay a significantly larger divorce bill in the Brexit negotiations than what it calls the generous sum already pledged by Prime Minister Theresa May. It's not as if the EU has made a single concession to justify an improved offer, it declares. The paper resents the EU's insistence on the UK coming up with more money before trade talks can start and asks: ""Why should we surrender to blackmail?"" But the Timesaccepts that,externalBritain will have to pay more money - and says it would come with the expectation that the EU, in return, would place a meaningful trade deal on the table. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour, former minister Robert Halfon said people would not accept a ""huge"" sum not being spent on schools and hospitals. The Tory MP said that with austerity on the agenda ahead of Wednesday's Budget, ""if we start saying that we're going to give Â£40 to Â£50bn to the EU, I think the public will go bananas, absolutely spare"". Mr Halfon said he had backed Remain in the EU referendum, but added ""we voted to leave, the public want to leave, and I cannot believe that the public would accept such a huge amount when we need money for our schools, our hospitals, our housing, and many other things"". On Sunday Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK would honour its debts but also ""negotiate hard"" on the various aspects of the financial settlement. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been speaking today, saying he wanted the UK to ""settle the accounts accurately"" before beginning trade talks. The UK is currently in the EU's single market, which allows companies to sell goods across borders without fees being charged. After Brexit it wants to draw up a new free trade deal in its place. Mr Barnier said the UK would lose the benefits of the single market as a result of its desire for new controls over EU migration. In his speech, he attacked what he described as ""ardent Brexiteers"" for thinking Britain can be freed from EU rules and still participate in the single market.

"The vessel is the newest of the three submarines in the Argentine navy's fleet Argentina's navy says its ARA San Juan submarine, which has been missing since Wednesday, reported a mechanical breakdown in its last communication. The submarine, with 44 crew on board, disappeared 430km (270 miles) off the Argentine coast. ""The vessel surfaced and it reported a breakdown,"" naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi said. Argentina's navy said a ""noise"" picked up by sonar on Monday during the search did not come from the vessel. It is the second false alarm in the hunt for the submarine. Capt Galeazzi, who heads the naval base in Mar del Plata, south of Buenos Aires, said that the fault reported earlier related to a ""short circuit"" in the sub's batteries. What happens when a sub vanishes The brother of a crew member earlier told local media that in a message before communications were lost his sibling had mentioned that the vessel was having problems with its batteries. This is the first time that an official has mentioned the sub encountering mechanical problems. However Capt Galeazzi said that mechanical problems were not uncommon and rarely posed a risk. ""A warship has a lot of backup systems, to allow it to move from one to another when there is a breakdown,"" he said. The naval commander said that the submarine had been asked to cut short its mission, which was originally due to last until Monday, and go directly to Mar del Plata. According to local media, the captain of the ARA San Juan contacted the naval base again after reporting the mechanical problem. In the message, he reportedly said the sub was heading towards Mar del Plata with all 44 crew members in perfect health. The navy also announced on Monday that seven signals picked up at the weekend were not from the missing submarine's satellite phone. The failed calls, lasting between four and 36 seconds, had been received on Saturday. They had raised hopes that the crew members were alive. A huge search and rescue operation is continuing in the South Atlantic. Specialist underwater rescue equipment has arrived in Argentina from the United States and more boats and planes have also joined the search, which has been hampered by heavy winds and high waves. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, towards Mar del Plata.

"This video can not be played Charles Manson's followers carried out murders on his orders Charles Manson, the notorious cult leader who directed his followers to commit a string of brutal murders, and who became a symbol of the dark side of 1960s counterculture, has died aged 83. Manson was admitted to Bakersfield hospital, California earlier this month and died of natural causes on Sunday. In 1969, his followers, known as the Manson Family, killed nine people. Among the victims of the killing spree was heavily pregnant Hollywood actress Sharon Tate, wife of Roman Polanski. One of Manson's young followers, Susan Atkins, stabbed Tate to death and scrawled ""PIG"" on the home's front door with the actress's blood. Four other people at Tate's home were brutally stabbed to death. The next day, a wealthy couple in Los Angeles, Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, were also killed by the clan. The killings became known collectively as the Tate-LaBianca murders. Charles Manson: Messianic leader of a death cult Where are the rest of the Manson Family now? The terrible charisma of Charles Manson Manson's music was a macabre sidenote Separately Donald Shea, a Hollywood stuntman, and Gary Hinman, an acquaintance of the group, were killed by members of the Manson Family. Manson was not at the scene of the killings, but was nonetheless convicted of murder for directing his followers in seven of the killings. He was sentenced to death in 1971. Sharon Tate, here with husband Roman Polanski, was eight and a half months pregnant when she was murdered Manson ""died of natural causes at 8:13 pm (04:13 GMT Monday) on Sunday"" at a hospital in Kern County, the California Department of Corrections said in a statement. He had been in custody for more than 40 years. Tate's sister, Debra told the TMZ website that she had received a phone call from prison officials shortly after Manson's death. Gathering young followers around him in the late 1960s, Manson claimed to believe in a coming race war in America. He planned to hasten the war and emerge as the leader of a new social order - a vision he nicknamed ""Helter Skelter"", after a Beatles song Manson became obsessed with. Prosecutors argued that Manson hoped black Americans would be blamed for the Tate-LaBianca killings, heightening racial tensions. Manson believed in a coming race war in America Manson convinced a number of his followers that he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, using a combination of drugs and genuine charisma to bring the ""Family"" - mainly young, middle-class women - under his control. Before Manson's death sentence could be carried out, California outlawed capital punishment and his sentence was reduced to nine life sentences. Over the course of his four decades in prison, Manson applied for parole 12 times. The last attempt was turned down by the parole board in 2012. In 2014, Manson was granted a marriage licence to wed a 26-year-old woman who said she loved him, but the licence expired and the marriage did not go ahead. Almost half a century on, the Manson Family's killing spree continues to fascinate many Americans, and has been retold through books, films and music.

"British Airways is introducing a boarding policy that means those buying the cheapest seats will be called last. From 12 December, passengers will be assigned a number between 1-5 printed on boarding passes, with the highest figure reserved for economy fares. BA said the move is about simplifying the boarding process, and bringing it into line with other carriers, including American Airlines and Iberia. But BA was accused of operating a class system and further eroding perks. The number ""one"" will be given to first class passengers, with others assigned to other segments such as Executive Club or World Traveller Plus. Passengers who are travelling with children or have mobility issues will still be able to board ahead of everyone else. A BA spokeswoman said: ""We are always looking at ways to improve and simplify the airport experience for our customers... Next month we are introducing new boarding procedures to speed up the process and make it simpler for customers to understand. ""This method has been used by airlines around the world for a number of years, including by our partners American Airlines, Iberia and Qatar.""

"Darren Grimes ran a pro-Brexit campaign for young people The Electoral Commission has reopened an investigation into Vote Leave's EU referendum spending. The campaign paid Â£625,000 to clear bills allegedly run up by university student Darren Grimes with a digital agency days ahead of last June's vote. A separate group, Veterans for Britain, received Â£100,000 from Vote Leave. The campaign denies attempting to get round spending limits - the Electoral Commission initially accepted this but now says it has new information. A group of campaigning lawyers, The Good Law Project,has started legal action against the commission,externalover its original decision to drop the investigation, claiming the watchdog was not doing its job properly. Jo Maugham QC, of the Good Law Project, said: ""We are 18 months after the referendum vote. It is extraordinary that only now is the Electoral Commission taking a serious look at whether the rules were complied with. And only in response to legal action."" He added: ""The Electoral Commission has urged us to agree to drop our High Court case. We will consider this question carefully in the coming days."" A former senior Vote Leave source accused the watchdog of giving in to pressure from the Good Law project - something the watchdog has denied. ""The Electoral Commission is an utter joke,"" the source told BBC News. ""They investigated the last time there was a spurious complaint and found Vote Leave followed the rules and donations were within the law. ""Now they've given in to peer pressure from a bunch of die-hard Remainers who would rather believe in some vast conspiracy rather than respect the democratic vote of the British people. ""This is in contrast to the Electoral Commission's repeated failures to call out dodgy Remain behaviour, which exploited the full weight of the government during the campaign. It reeks of double standards."" The row centres around Darren Grimes, at the time a fashion student at the University of Brighton, who set up a group called BeLeave, to give young pro-Brexit campaigners a voice during last year's referendum. As a registered campaigner, he was allowed to spend up to Â£700,000. He initially spent very little but in the 10 days leading up to the 23 June vote he ran up a Â£675,315 bill with AggregateIQ Data, a Canadian marketing firm that specialises in political campaigns. Money to clear the bill was not given to Mr Grimes but sent directly to Aggregate IQ by Vote Leave, which separately spent Â£2.7m with the same firm, more than a third of its Â£6.8m budget. Mr Grimes also received Â£50,000 from an individual Vote Leave donor in the final 10 days, making the previously obscure campaigner's group one of the best-funded at the referendum. Vote Leave Campaign director Dominic Cummings was quoted on AggregateIQ's website as saying ""we couldn't have done it without them"". In total, AIQ was given Â£3.5m by groups campaigning for Brexit, including Vote Leave, the Democratic Unionist Party and Veterans for Britain. Vote Leave would have gone over its campaign spending limit if it had spent the money it donated on behalf of Mr Grimes itself. The campaign group said it made the donation to Mr Grimes because it was coming up to its Â£7m spending limit and wanted a way of using Â£9.2m it had raised from individuals and companies on campaigning activities. The Electoral Commission said in March this was an ""acceptable method of donating under the rules"" and after a ""detailed look"" at the case it did not find reasonable grounds to suspect an offence had been committed. The new probe will look at whether the spending returns delivered by Mr Grimes, Veterans for Britain and Vote Leave were correct - and whether or not Vote Leave exceeded its spending limit. Bob Posner, the Electoral Commission's director of political finance and regulation, said: ""There is significant public interest in being satisfied that the facts are known about Vote Leave's spending on the campaign, particularly as it was a lead campaigner with a greater spending limit than any other campaigners on the Leave side. ""Legitimate questions over the funding provided to campaigners risks causing harm to voters' confidence in the referendum and it is therefore right that we investigate."" In April, the Electoral Commission launched a separate investigation into spending during the referendum by Leave.EU, the campaign backed by then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage and donor Arron Banks. It is also investigating spending by the anti-Brexit campaign Britain Stronger in Europe.

But she's insulting civil servants, the vice-president at public rallies.  They are denigrating the army.  One of the major charges are that he refused to implement the constitution of Zimbabwe.

The tweet has however been deleted but we manged to get a screengrab of it: Mr Moyo, who is also the minister for higher education, is among party officials that were pushing for Mrs Mugabe to take over from her husband. Mr Mnangagwa was last seen on 4 November during a public rally There is uncertainty over the whereabouts of Emmerson Mnangagwa whose sacking as vice-president triggered the military takeover in Zimbabwe. Several media reports say he returned to Zimbabwe last week having fled the country after he was fired. The263Chat news site,externalis reporting that his handlers are keeping him away from the public to guarantee his security. The site quotes a Zanu-PF official Patrick Chinamasa saying Mr Mnangagwa, who is nicknamed the crocodile, will be seen in public when his security is guaranteed. âWe have mapped a clear road map for the smooth transfer of power and Mnangagwa will come back to assume that leading role. We donât know where his is but he is on his way back,â Mr Chinamasa said. Another party official Obert Mpofu told a media briefing yesterday that Mr Mnangagwa's absence shows he has self control: âHe is a disciplined cadre and has been under attack from negative forces but kept quiet, traits he got from the war. it is that quietness that has bore some good fruits into all this saga"". Mr Mnangagwa was last seen on 4 November during a public rally, 263Chat reports. Read:Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Mr Mugabe defied expectations that he would resign in his TV speech One curious part of Robert Mugabe's speech yesterday was his declaration that he planned to preside over the Zanu-PF congress next month. Zimbabwean constitutional lawyer Alex Magaisa told BBC Focus on Africa that maybe he knew that the process of impeachment could take a long time: People underestimate that old man. He thinks far more than the people dealing with him. He already knows what is coming. He will delay this process as much as possible to ensure it gets to congress.""  We reported earlieron the complex process that lies ahead. Zanu-PF's
representative in the UK has been talking to the BBC, giving some insight into why Robert Mugabe has not resigned yet: As we all know, President Mugabe is a very stubborn man. In his mindset he believes that the British came for him, and he defied them. The Americans tried through sanctions and he defied, the European Union he defied.  So he has defied everybody and he believes his own, as he calls them, boys, would not be able to make him to do what superpowers have failed to do.""  Nick Mangwana was speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World At One: This video can not be played Zanu-PF's UK representative says the case to impeach the President is a 'fait accompli' MPs from Zimbabwe's main opposition party, MDC, will meet to decide on whether to support a push to impeach President Robert Mugabe. The party's chief whip told Reuters news agency that lawmakers will meet on Tuesday to discuss the plan. Reuters reports that the governing Zanu-PF has the requisite two-thirds needed to trigger impeachment, but that opposition support would boost the process of removing Mr Mugabe. People anticipated a resignation One of the key questions today is: Why has Robert Mugabe not resigned as president of Zimbabwe? There is one theory that the plan was for Mr Mugabe to resign in a televised speech last night but there was a last minute change-of-heart. We reported earlier that people are sharing video which they claimappears to show the speech being switched. Two political sources told Reuters news agency that Mr Mugabe had actually agreed to resign but the ruling party Zanu-PF did not want him to quit in front of the military because that would have made its intervention on Wednesday look like a coup. We said earlier that Reuters was reporting that the ex-Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda has been sent to Zimbabwe to convince President Robert Mugabe to resign. So we looked into it. Our colleague talked to Mr Kaunda's son who told her he was next to him watching the events unfold on TV and had not been asked to go to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF has shared its draft impeachment motion with Reuters news agency. The draft motion reportedly says President Robert Mugabe is a ""source of instability"", has shown disrespect for
the rule of law and is to blame for an unprecedented economic
tailspin over the past 15 years. Parliament is expected to debate impeaching Mr Mugabe when it next meets, on Tuesday. Zimbabwe's dollar became worthless under Mr Mugabe's rule An official of the governing Zanu-PF has called on Zimbabweans to join another planned protest against President Robert Mugabe. Nick Mangwana, who heads the party's office in the UK, has shared a poster for Wednesday's planned march. He says that people should march to Mr Mugabe's residence in the capital which is known as Blue Roof: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Despite a show of public defiance against President Mugabe people are still afraid The BBC's Andrew Harding has been speaking to Zimbabweans on the streets of the capital Harare. He reports that there is a feeling of growing frustration after President Robert Mugabe failed to resign last night as had been expected. He says people feel confused and impatient. A taxi driver told him that he had expected Mr Mugabe to leave office last night: He was supposed to be looking after his family... [he should] stay in Singapore, Malaysia where he has assets.""  Others said that despite Saturday's public show of defiance as people rallied to urge President Mugabe to go, they were still afraid. Harare resident Lydia Gombe told our reporter that after years of repressive rule, many Zimbabweans still fear that they might get into trouble if they speak out against the government: The level of fear that these people have instilled in us as a nation is unbelievable. And it is just simple things. WhatsApp texts can get you arrested. A conversation in the bus can get you arrested.""  She adds that it would take time for people to lose their fear of speaking out. The deadline set by the governing Zanu-PF party for President Robert Mugabe to resign has passed without any significant development. As we all wait to see what happens next in Zimbabwe, here's a look back at the extraordinary events of the past week, in this two-minute-long video: This video can not be played We are getting reports in that the governing Zanu-PF party will proceed to discuss the impeachment of President Robert Mugabe after his resignation deadline lapsed. The party's chief whip Lovemore Matuke told Reuters news agency the party's MPs had planned to meet today. Our previous post points out that legal advisers to Zimbabwe's parliament say the impeachment could take several days to complete. Reuters has a faster estimate - saying that, because of the overwhelming support for the removal of Mr Mugabe, it could take a day. It quotes John Makamure from the Southern African Parliamentary Support Trust saying the move could take 24 hours: ""They can fast-track it. It can be done in a matter of a
day."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.0006354168

"Endris Mohammed carried out the killings during a ""sleepover"" in the lounge A man who murdered his two young children by smothering them with a petrol-soaked rag has been sentenced to at least 33 years in jail. Endris Mohammed, 47, was convicted of killing his son Saros and daughter Leanor Endris, aged eight and six, at their home in Birmingham last October. He also tried to kill his wife in an attempted gas blast at the house, Birmingham Crown Court heard. He was also given a 10-year concurrent sentence for her attempted murder. Midlands Live: Victims 'told not to report' Jehovah's Witness child abuse; tourist attraction hit by false child exploitation rumours On Friday, jurorstook less than 30 minutes to find Mohammed guiltyof the killings of his children and the attempt to murder his wife, Penil Teklehaimanot. Jurors had heard that after trying to blow up the house by tampering with a gas valve Mohammed, a taxi driver, had started a fire near the front door. Saros and Leanor died from airway obstruction after suffering chemical burns to their faces, the court was told. Mohammed was told his children ""trusted him implicitly"" On the night they were murdered, Mrs Teklehaimanot was woken by a smoke alarm at their home in Holland Road, Great Barr, but had thought her children were asleep. But, they had been killed by their father during a ""sleepover"" downstairs with him, and were found dead at about 03.30 BST on 28 October, 2016. Passing sentence on Mohammed, Mr Justice Gilbart described the murders as a ""terrible criminal enterprise"" and told Mohammed: ""You have deliberately snuffed out their young lives"". ""They trusted you implicitly and were enjoying your company even on the night of their murder,"" he said.  ""You repaid their trust in you by killing them."" This video can not be played Mohammed captured buying petrol on CCTV less than 12 hours before killing his children CCTV footage showed Mohammed buying a fuel can and three litres of petrol the day before the murders. Speaking after his conviction, Mrs Teklehaimanot said the pain of losing her children was ""indescribable"". ""There is no bigger pain in this world than this experience,"" she said.  ""I cannot comprehend how anyone could be so cold-hearted."" Endris Mohammed suffered burns when he set his car on fire The Uber driver claimed to have a depressive disorder, citing debts and failed hopes for ""a good life in England"". He murdered his children after deciding they ""would be better off dead"", the court heard. He was later found sitting in his car in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, with severe burns, after setting fire to himself. Police said Mohammed had no history of mental illness and contrary to claims of financial difficulties, his account was not overdrawn and Mrs Teklehaimanot was ""bringing good money into the house"". Judge Gilbart accepted Mohammed was suffering a depressive illness but said it fell short of diminished responsibility. Det Insp Justin Spanner, from West Midlands Police, said ""evidence of the pre-planning"" made this ""one of the worst cases I've dealt with"". Mohammed's defence barrister Timothy Raggatt, said the defendant was a man of ""previous good character... who has done something unspeakable"". ""He is at a loss to understand it himself,"" he added.

"The vessel is the newest of the three submarines in the Argentine navy's fleet Specialist underwater rescue equipment has arrived in Argentina from the United States to help hunt for an Argentine submarine which vanished last Wednesday with 44 crew on board. More boats and planes have also joined the search, which has been hampered by heavy winds and high waves. The Argentina navy says ARA San Juan has enough supplies for at least two weeks. The vessel disappeared 430km (267 miles) off the Argentine coast. On Saturday, satellite signals believed to have come from the sub were detected near the Valdez peninsula. But the secretary general of the Argentine navy, Rear Admiral Jorge Lorenzo Cisneros, warned that the signals had been ""very weak and of short intensity"". The seven satellite messages lasted from 4 to 36 seconds but failed to connect. He said the navy had not yet been able to confirm that the failed calls had come from the missing vessel. US satellite company Iridium said in a statement,externalthat while one of its satellite phones was on board the submarine, the seven signals detected on Saturday did not come through its network Iridium said the last call made from its satellite phone on board the submarine was on 15 November, the day the vessel vanished. Teams from several countries have intensified their efforts in the South Atlantic to find ARA San Juan. Maria Krawczyk is one of the officers on board the sub People have been hanging flags and messages in support of the missing crew on the fence at the Mar del Plata naval base The US Navy has sent a second ship with special tracking equipment and deep-sea rescue modules to join the search. Chile and the UK have sent extra aircraft to scour the area. Argentine navy spokesman Capt Enrique Balbi said 11 boats and 10 planes from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, South Africa, Uruguay, the UK and the US were currently taking part in the search. On Saturday, a Nasa research plane equipped with magnetometers, infrared cameras and other sensors that can detect submerged submarines flew over the search area but did not detect the missing vessel. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, to its base at Mar del Plata, south of Buenos Aires. Its last contact with navy command was on Wednesday morning. It is thought that the submarine may have had communication difficulties caused by a power cut. Navy protocol dictates that a vessel should come to the surface if communication has been lost.

"The vessel is the newest of the three submarines in the Argentine navy's fleet Argentina's navy says its ARA San Juan submarine, which has been missing since Wednesday, reported a mechanical breakdown in its last communication. The submarine, with 44 crew on board, disappeared 430km (270 miles) off the Argentine coast. ""The vessel surfaced and it reported a breakdown,"" naval commander Gabriel Galeazzi said. Argentina's navy said a ""noise"" picked up by sonar on Monday during the search did not come from the vessel. It is the second false alarm in the hunt for the submarine. Capt Galeazzi, who heads the naval base in Mar del Plata, south of Buenos Aires, said that the fault reported earlier related to a ""short circuit"" in the sub's batteries. What happens when a sub vanishes The brother of a crew member earlier told local media that in a message before communications were lost his sibling had mentioned that the vessel was having problems with its batteries. This is the first time that an official has mentioned the sub encountering mechanical problems. However Capt Galeazzi said that mechanical problems were not uncommon and rarely posed a risk. ""A warship has a lot of backup systems, to allow it to move from one to another when there is a breakdown,"" he said. The naval commander said that the submarine had been asked to cut short its mission, which was originally due to last until Monday, and go directly to Mar del Plata. According to local media, the captain of the ARA San Juan contacted the naval base again after reporting the mechanical problem. In the message, he reportedly said the sub was heading towards Mar del Plata with all 44 crew members in perfect health. The navy also announced on Monday that seven signals picked up at the weekend were not from the missing submarine's satellite phone. The failed calls, lasting between four and 36 seconds, had been received on Saturday. They had raised hopes that the crew members were alive. A huge search and rescue operation is continuing in the South Atlantic. Specialist underwater rescue equipment has arrived in Argentina from the United States and more boats and planes have also joined the search, which has been hampered by heavy winds and high waves. The ARA San Juan was returning from a routine mission to Ushuaia, near the southern-most tip of South America, towards Mar del Plata.

"Young people are taking part in a wider range of sexual practices, including anal sex, with opposite sex partners, research reveals. Experts looked at responses to a national sex survey that has been carried out every 10 years since 1990 in the UK. More than one in 10 millennial teenagers said they had tried anal sex by the age of 18. By the age of 22 to 24, three in every 10 said they had tried it. Vaginal and oral sex are still the most common types of sexual activity between young men and women, however. The age that young people start having sex - vaginal, anal or oral - has not changed much in recent decades. In the most recent survey, it was 16. While the study in theJournal of Adolescent Health,externalshows what types of sex people are having, it doesn't shed light on why preferences are changing. Experts can only speculate, but say society has become more accepting and less judgemental about sexual experimentation. Kaye Wellings, senior author and professor of sexual and reproductive health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said: ""The changes in practices we see here are consistent with the widening of other aspects of young people's sexual experience, and are perhaps not surprising given the rapidly changing social context and the ever-increasing number of influences on sexual behaviour."" Prof Cynthia Graham is a professor in sexual and reproductive health at the University of Southampton. She said the internet and media might have played a role in breaking down sexual taboos. ""The internet means people can easily find and see things that they would not have been able to in the past. ""Anal sex is still pretty stigmatised, but attitudes appear to be changing. We know society has become more accepting of things like same sex behaviour overall. But there's very little research out there about anal sex and motivation."" She said more studies were needed to inform sex education and equip young people with the information they need for their sexual health.

"This video can not be played Jehovah's Witnesses sexual abuse 'covered up' Children who were sexually abused by Jehovah's Witnesses were allegedly told by the organisation not to report it. Victims from across the UK told the BBC they were routinely abused and that the religion's own rules protected perpetrators. One child abuse lawyer believes there could be thousands of victims across the country who have not come forward. The organisation said it did not ""shield"" abusers and any suggestion of a cover-up was ""absolutely false"". BBC Hereford and Worcesterspoke to victims - men and women - from Birmingham, Cheltenham, Leicester, Worcestershire and Glasgow, one of whom waived her right to anonymity. Louise Palmer, who now lives in Evesham, Worcestershire, was born into the organisation along with her brother Richard Davenport, who started raping her when she was four. He is serving a 10-year prison sentence for the abuse. The 41-year-old, formerly of Halesowen, West Midlands, said she was told not to go to police. Midlands Live: Christmas attraction hit by false child exploitation rumours; Market town named among Europe's elite Former Jehovah's Witnesses have been speaking to the BBC about abuse ""I asked [the organisation], 'what should I do? Do you report it to the police, [or] do I report it to the police'? ""And their words were that they strongly advised me not to go to the police because it would bring reproach on Jehovah."" Another woman, from Worcestershire, said she was sexually abused as a child by a friend of her brother. She said she told her parents and elders in the congregation what happened and they advised her not to report it. ""It started off just being very cuddly and I was always a very tactile little girl, but it gradually got worse and worse. ""It escalated until... he started raping me."" Jehovah's Witnesses movement at a glance Jehovah's Witnesses are members of a movement best known for their door-to-door evangelistic work. Child abuse lawyer Kathleen Hallisey said there were concerns that the organisation's procedures compromised child safety. ""[For example] in order for [victims] to take allegations of sexual abuse further, they have to have two witnesses to the abuse,"" she said. I've spoken to multiple victims who have told me of the abuse they have suffered while in the Jehovah's Witnesses organisation. What most of them keep coming back to is something known as the ""two witness rule"". It is a procedure set by the main governing body of the religion and means for any sin committed, there must be two witnesses to it in order for the elders of the congregation to take any action. The problem with this is it can be rare to have witnesses in cases of abuse. The victims I've spoken to said the organisation  self-polices and teaches members to avoid interaction with outside authorities or to take another member of the religion to court. To do so, they say, could lead to expulsion from the religion. In a statement the organisation said ""any suggestion that Jehovah's Witnesses covered up child abuse was absolutely false"". It said victims and their parents had ""the absolute right to report the matter to the governmental authorities"" and reporting so was ""not contingent on the number of witnesses to the offence"". It described child abuse as a ""heinous crime and sin"" and said the congregation did not ""shield abusers from the authorities of the consequences of their actions"". The statement added ""loving and protective parents"" were the ""best deterrent to child abuse"" and elders provided ""abuse victims and their families with spiritual comfort from the Bible"". In 2013 the Charity Commission started aninquiry into safeguarding issuesin the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Britain - the UK's main Jehovah's Witnesses organisation which the commission regulates. Its inquiry continues.

Mr Mnangagwa was last seen on 4 November during a public rally There is uncertainty over the whereabouts of Emmerson Mnangagwa whose sacking as vice-president triggered the military takeover in Zimbabwe. Several media reports say he returned to Zimbabwe last week having fled the country after he was fired. The263Chat news site,externalis reporting that his handlers are keeping him away from the public to guarantee his security. The site quotes a Zanu-PF official Patrick Chinamasa saying Mr Mnangagwa, who is nicknamed the crocodile, will be seen in public when his security is guaranteed. âWe have mapped a clear road map for the smooth transfer of power and Mnangagwa will come back to assume that leading role. We donât know where his is but he is on his way back,â Mr Chinamasa said. Another party official Obert Mpofu told a media briefing yesterday that Mr Mnangagwa's absence shows he has self control: âHe is a disciplined cadre and has been under attack from negative forces but kept quiet, traits he got from the war. it is that quietness that has bore some good fruits into all this saga"". Mr Mnangagwa was last seen on 4 November during a public rally, 263Chat reports. Read:Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Mr Mugabe defied expectations that he would resign in his TV speech One curious part of Robert Mugabe's speech yesterday was his declaration that he planned to preside over the Zanu-PF congress next month. Zimbabwean constitutional lawyer Alex Magaisa told BBC Focus on Africa that maybe he knew that the process of impeachment could take a long time: People underestimate that old man. He thinks far more than the people dealing with him. He already knows what is coming. He will delay this process as much as possible to ensure it gets to congress.""  We reported earlieron the complex process that lies ahead. Zanu-PF's
representative in the UK has been talking to the BBC, giving some insight into why Robert Mugabe has not resigned yet: As we all know, President Mugabe is a very stubborn man. In his mindset he believes that the British came for him, and he defied them. The Americans tried through sanctions and he defied, the European Union he defied.  So he has defied everybody and he believes his own, as he calls them, boys, would not be able to make him to do what superpowers have failed to do.""  Nick Mangwana was speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World At One: This video can not be played Zanu-PF's UK representative says the case to impeach the President is a 'fait accompli' MPs from Zimbabwe's main opposition party, MDC, will meet to decide on whether to support a push to impeach President Robert Mugabe. The party's chief whip told Reuters news agency that lawmakers will meet on Tuesday to discuss the plan. Reuters reports that the governing Zanu-PF has the requisite two-thirds needed to trigger impeachment, but that opposition support would boost the process of removing Mr Mugabe. People anticipated a resignation One of the key questions today is: Why has Robert Mugabe not resigned as president of Zimbabwe? There is one theory that the plan was for Mr Mugabe to resign in a televised speech last night but there was a last minute change-of-heart. We reported earlier that people are sharing video which they claimappears to show the speech being switched. Two political sources told Reuters news agency that Mr Mugabe had actually agreed to resign but the ruling party Zanu-PF did not want him to quit in front of the military because that would have made its intervention on Wednesday look like a coup. We said earlier that Reuters was reporting that the ex-Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda has been sent to Zimbabwe to convince President Robert Mugabe to resign. So we looked into it. Our colleague talked to Mr Kaunda's son who told her he was next to him watching the events unfold on TV and had not been asked to go to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF has shared its draft impeachment motion with Reuters news agency. The draft motion reportedly says President Robert Mugabe is a ""source of instability"", has shown disrespect for
the rule of law and is to blame for an unprecedented economic
tailspin over the past 15 years. Parliament is expected to debate impeaching Mr Mugabe when it next meets, on Tuesday. Zimbabwe's dollar became worthless under Mr Mugabe's rule An official of the governing Zanu-PF has called on Zimbabweans to join another planned protest against President Robert Mugabe.

Despite a show of public defiance against President Mugabe people are still afraid The BBC's Andrew Harding has been speaking to Zimbabweans on the streets of the capital Harare. He reports that there is a feeling of growing frustration after President Robert Mugabe failed to resign last night as had been expected. He says people feel confused and impatient. A taxi driver told him that he had expected Mr Mugabe to leave office last night: He was supposed to be looking after his family... [he should] stay in Singapore, Malaysia where he has assets.""  Others said that despite Saturday's public show of defiance as people rallied to urge President Mugabe to go, they were still afraid. Harare resident Lydia Gombe told our reporter that after years of repressive rule, many Zimbabweans still fear that they might get into trouble if they speak out against the government: The level of fear that these people have instilled in us as a nation is unbelievable. And it is just simple things. WhatsApp texts can get you arrested. A conversation in the bus can get you arrested.""  She adds that it would take time for people to lose their fear of speaking out. The deadline set by the governing Zanu-PF party for President Robert Mugabe to resign has passed without any significant development. As we all wait to see what happens next in Zimbabwe, here's a look back at the extraordinary events of the past week, in this two-minute-long video: This video can not be played We are getting reports in that the governing Zanu-PF party will proceed to discuss the impeachment of President Robert Mugabe after his resignation deadline lapsed. The party's chief whip Lovemore Matuke told Reuters news agency the party's MPs had planned to meet today. Our previous post points out that legal advisers to Zimbabwe's parliament say the impeachment could take several days to complete. Reuters has a faster estimate - saying that, because of the overwhelming support for the removal of Mr Mugabe, it could take a day. It quotes John Makamure from the Southern African Parliamentary Support Trust saying the move could take 24 hours: ""They can fast-track it. It can be done in a matter of a
day."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.6665971
"This video can not be played Zimbabwe's week of upheaval in two minutes Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party has summoned its MPs to discuss the future of its leader, President Robert Mugabe, after a deadline for his resignation came and went on Monday. The deadline was set by Mr Mugabe's own party, Zanu-PF. The embattled leader surprised Zimbabweans on Sunday, declaring on TV that he planned to remain as president. Zanu-PF says it backs impeachment, and proceedings could begin as soon as Tuesday when parliament meets. In a draft motion seen by Reuters news agency, the party blamed the president for an ""unprecedented economic tailspin"". Mr Mugabe's grip on power has weakened considerably since the country's army intervened last Wednesday in a row over who should succeed him. Mugabe misses deadline - latest updates Five things about Zimbabwe crisis Zimbabwe's next likely leader Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? The crisis began two weeks ago when the 93-year-old leader sacked his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa, angering army commanders who saw it as an attempt to position his wife Grace as next president. Zimbabwe has since then seen huge street rallies demanding his immediate resignation. The protests have been backed by the influential war veterans - who fought in the conflict that led to independence from Britain in 1980. The group's leader, Chris Mutsvangwa, on Monday called for more demonstrations. ""Mugabe, your rule is over,"" Mr Mutsvangwa said. ""The emperor has no clothes."" Andrew Harding in Harare The city is swirling with rumours that Mr Mugabe is planning his resignation and that he may go back on television to announce it at any stage, and that Sunday's speech was simply about giving carte blanche to the military for what they've done. But we just don't know at this stage if he will give in to the pressure from the war veterans, his own party, and the public. Mr Mugabe said in his speech that he planned to preside over the Zanu-PF congress next month, a statement people here found baffling after the party voted to strip him of his leadership and kick out his wife. What is clear is that everyone here believes that the Mugabe era is over. Saturday's protests unleashed something and people believe that a line has been crossed. Now it is really about negotiating the time, the process, the choreography of Mr Mugabe's departure. The fear of Zanu-PF and of the security services will not go away overnight. People here grew up with that fear. In the meantime, the streets are calm, but Tuesday may bring more demonstrations. This video can not be played Robert Mugabe: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"" During the 20-minute address, the president, who was flanked by generals, made no mention of the pressure from his party and the public to quit. Instead, he declared that the military had done nothing wrong by seizing power and placing him under house arrest. ""Whatever the pros and cons of how they [the army] went about their operation, I, as commander-in-chief, do acknowledge their concerns,"" he said, in reference to the army's move last week to take over the state broadcaster in the capital Harare. He also said ""the [Zanu-PF] party congress is due in a few weeks and I will preside over its processes"". Before Mr Mugabe's speech, Mr Mnangagwa was named as Zanu-PF's new leader and candidate for the 2018 general elections, while Mr Mugabe's wife was expelled. BBC Africa Editor Fergal Keane said his understanding was that Mr Mugabe had agreed to resign, but then changed his mind. Our correspondent says the generals have no intention of forcing Mr Mugabe out by the barrel of a gun, and are happy to let the Zanu-PF carry out its procedures, working through impeachment if necessary. After the Mugabes, which African dynasties remain? Zimbabwe in 10 numbers Impeachment proceedings could be launched on Tuesday in parliament - but it is not clear how long this would take. Both the National Assembly and the Senate need to pass a vote by simple majority to begin the process, which is laid out in the constitution. This can either be on grounds of ""serious misconduct"", ""violation"" of the constitution or ""failure to obey, uphold or defend"" it, or ""incapacity"". The chambers must then appoint a joint committee to investigate removing the president. If the committee recommends impeachment, the president can then be removed if both houses back it with two-thirds majorities. The opposition MDC-T party has tried unsuccessfully to impeach Mr Mugabe in the past, but this time the ruling party - which has an overwhelming majority in both houses - is likely to go against him. This video can not be played Zimbabwe reacts: ""We need him to resign... our lives are terrible right now"" The advantage for the military is that if Mr Mugabe is impeached, it can claim that he was removed legally, and not by force. The problem for the generals is that the current vice-president would then take power. That is Phelekezela Mphoko, a supporter of Mr Mugabe's wife Grace. The military would prefer to install Emmerson Mnangagwa, the former vice-president who was briefly exiled. And it is still possible that Mr Mugabe could delay the process or cling to power by refusing to resign - and be forced into exile himself. The War Veterans Association, which used to back Mr Mugabe, now says it is time for him to step down. ""Thirty-seven years, you have had your time, you are toast now politically,"" Mr Mutsvangwa told the BBC. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said he was ""baffled"" by the president's address. ""He's playing a game. He has let the whole nation down,"" he told Reuters news agency. Mr Mugabe has led the country since it gained independence from Britain in 1980.

"Manson, pictured here in 1989, sent his followers to commit murder on his behalf Charles Manson's messianic influence inspired his followers to commit murder. Members of his so-called Family were responsible for a series of high-profile killings that shattered the peace and love of the Californian summer of 1969. Over a period of five weeks, nine people, including the actress Sharon Tate, died in barbaric circumstances. Despite not committing any of the murders himself, Manson narrowly escaped the death penalty and spent the rest of his life in jail. Charles Manson dies after decades in jail The terrible charisma of Charles Manson He was born Charles Milles Maddox in Cincinnati, Ohio, on 12 November 1934, the illegitimate son of 16-year-old Kathleen Maddox. Shortly after his birth, his mother married William Manson and her son took his stepfather's name. He endured a miserable childhood. His mother was an alcoholic and when, in 1939, she was jailed after robbing a petrol station, Manson was placed in the care of his aunt and uncle. When his mother was paroled in 1942 she lived with her eight-year-old son in a series of dilapidated rooms before unsuccessfully applying to a court to have him fostered. Instead he was placed in a Catholic boys' home from which he ran away after just 10 months. By the time he was a teenager he was a habitual criminal Manson's robbery of an off-licence marked the beginning of a series of crimes, including armed robbery, and subsequent incarcerations in a number of institutions. By the time he was 17 he had a string of convictions, with one prison case worker reporting that he was ""aggressively antisocial"". After rebelling against the prison authorities, he was classified as dangerous. However, by 1954, after a period of good behaviour, he was allowed parole. He moved to West Virginia to be with his mother and, in 1955, married Rosalie Jean Willis, who worked as a waitress in a hospital. This brief settled period came to an end when he was sentenced to five years' probation for car theft, which was changed to three years in prison after he failed to appear in court to answer another charge. His wife went off with another man and the couple divorced. Manson took up with a prostitute named Leona ""Candy"" Stevens, whose tearful plea to a court that she and Manson would marry if he stayed out of jail saw the judge suspend a 10-year jail sentence on Manson for passing a stolen Treasury cheque. However, in 1960 he again broke probation and was ordered to serve his suspended sentence. In 1967 he was released from prison despite pleading with the authorities to let him stay. Having spent half his life in institutions, he did not feel capable of facing the world outside. Three of his Family - Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten - arrive in court He moved to San Francisco where he met a library assistant called Mary Bunning, eventually persuading her to allow other women to move in with them. According to one account, there were at least 18 women resident in the apartment in the first incarnation of what would be dubbed the Manson Family. Fuelled by considerable quantities of drugs, notably LSD, Manson set himself up as something of a guru, peddling a mixture of beliefs and the teachings of numerous cults. He convinced a series of adoring female followers that he was in fact Christ. Before the end of 1967, Manson and some of his followers set off to tour the country in an old bus, covered in hippie regalia. In a bizarre interlude, the Family moved into a plush house owned by the Beach Boys drummer, Dennis Wilson, where the musician found himself subsidising Manson's growing entourage. He introduced Manson to a number of friends working in music and show business. After being evicted by Wilson's manager, the Family relocated to a rundown ranch where Manson became obsessed by the track Helter Skelter on the Beatles' White Album, released in November 1968. Lennon and McCartney's innocent lyrics about a children's playground slide were interpreted by Manson as signifying the beginning of a race war between black and white. In Manson's fevered mind, black people would emerge victorious but would have to rely on the guidance of the Family to help them to build a new social order. The first killing took place on 25 July 1969, when Manson sent three members to the house of an acquaintance, Gary Hinman, who, Manson believed, had a stash of money. After being held hostage for two days, Hinman was stabbed to death by a Family member, Bobby Beausoleil. On 8 August, Manson sent four members of the Family to the rented house of record producer Terry Melcher, with instructions to kill everyone they found. Melcher had previously turned down Manson's request for a recording contract. However, Melcher had moved, and the house had been rented to the film director Roman Polanski and his actress wife Sharon Tate. The gang first shot an 18-year-old youth they encountered outside the house before bursting in and killing the four occupants, hairstylist Jay Sebring, Polanski's friend and aspiring screenwriter Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski's girlfriend Abigail Folger. Polanski himself was in London on business. Tate, who was eight and a half months pregnant, died from stab wounds and her blood was used to write the word ""pig"" on the outside of the house. Sharon Tate, 26, and Roman Polanski had only married the year before The following night Manson, who had not attended the previous killings, went with six members of the Family to the house of a supermarket executive, Leno LaBianca, and his wife Rosemary. The couple were stabbed to death although, after tying them up, Manson left the house before the attacks began. The final victim was Donald Shea. Manson instructed Steve Grogan, a member of the Family, to kill the former film stuntman, who he believed had passed information to the police. Shea's remains were not found until 1977, when Grogan led police to where he had buried him eight years previously. The police initially ruled out any connection between the Tate and LaBianca killings. The breakthrough only came when Manson and some Family members were arrested after allegations they had vandalised part of the Death Valley National Park by burning stolen vehicles. While being held in custody, Family member Susan Atkins confided her involvement in the murders to two other prisoners who informed the authorities. The trial was marked by a series of disruptions by Family members and a rambling speech in his own defence by Manson. Manson and the three other defendants from the Family were sentenced to death. An appeal process delayed the executions and the sentences were commuted to life imprisonment when California abolished the death penalty in 1972. The publicity surrounding Charles Manson and his Family failed to go away. In 1975, one of his followers, Lynette ""Squeaky"" Fromme, was jailed for life after attempting to assassinate President Ford. Manson himself remained in the public eye. He gave four TV interviews from prison in the 1980s, most notably with Dan Snyder from NBC News and Charlie Rose for CBS, the latter interview winning an Emmy award. His marriage to Elaine ""Star"" Burton did not go ahead By the turn of the century, Manson and his followers had become something of a cult, with websites dedicated to him by people not even born when the Family committed murder. One of these admirers was Afton Elaine ""Star"" Burton, who had begun corresponding with Manson in 2007 when she was just 17. She later announced that she and Manson had become engaged. A marriage licence was issued but it expired without any wedding taking place. The singer Marilyn Manson took his surname, while the British band Kasabian are named after Linda Kasabian, the Family member who escaped prosecution by giving evidence against her former associates. Vincent Bugliosi, the prosecutor at his trial, and the author of Helter Skelter, an account of the case, summed it up thus. ""The very name Manson has become a metaphor for evil, and evil has its allure."" Manson made 12 applications for parole, all of which were refused. Neither the court hearings, nor a positive avalanche of subsequent writings, have given any definitive explanation for Manson's motivation or, perhaps more puzzling, the motivation of those who decided to follow him and commit murder on his behalf.

"Ant (left) and Dec returned to screens on Sunday night The latest series of I'm A Celebrity has kicked off - with presenter Dec Donnelly joking Ant McPartlin had been replaced following his stint in rehab. The presenting duo were reunited on screen for the first time since McPartlin's treatment for drug addiction over the summer. Donnelly joked that he would have a new co-host on the show, saying: ""It's me and the gorgeous Holly Willoughby!"" McPartlin replied: ""I'm back, my friend... it's good to be back."" Ant McPartlin 'overwhelmed' by fans' support over addiction No permission for Kezia Dugdale to appear in I'm A Celebrity This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons McPartlin entered rehab in June, having become addicted to alcohol and prescription painkillers following a knee operation in 2015. Later in the programme, Donnelly presented a model of the camp and said he'd made it himself - but with no help from McPartlin. He asked his friend: ""Where were you all summer anyway, what were you doing?"" ""Just stuff... just dead busy,"" McPartlin replied with a smile, before swiftly trying to change the subject. The celebs looking fresh-faced before entering the jungle This year's contestants on I'm A Celebrity include boxer Amir Khan, ex-footballer Dennis Wise, Made in Chelsea's Georgia Toffolo and Stanley Johnson - father of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. They are joined by Coronation Street actress Jennie McAlpine and Hollyoaks actor Jamie Lomas, along with comedian Shappi Khorsandi, footballer Jamie Vardy's wife Rebekah, Saturdays singer Vanessa White and YouTube personality Jack Maynard. This year's show opener attracted 10.3 million viewers as it was aired, beating its nearest rival in the same time slot, BBC One's Howards End, which was watched by 9.9 million. It wasn't the highest viewed programme on Sunday evening overall though, with both Strictly Come Dancing's results show and Blue Planet II seen by 10.8 million each on BBC One. Maynard has apologised for offensive tweets Maynard, 22, found himself in hot water over the weekend for some old Tweets he had posted in 2012. He was accused of using homophobic and racist terms, as well as the term ""retards"". A spokesman for Maynard said: ""Jack is ashamed of what he said in these tweets, many of which were deleted a long time ago and were sent in response to a neighbour who was bullying him. ""Jack was a lot younger when he posted them in 2012 but realises that age is no defence. He would never use that language now and realises that, as someone who was bullied himself, this kind of retaliatory, inflammatory, insulting language is completely unacceptable."" An ITV spokesperson added: ""Jack has deleted these tweets and has since issued a full apology."" Johnson had to rummage in creature-filled holes to gain rewards Sunday night's show saw some of the contestants tackling a walk the plank challenge on the roof of a hotel in Australia, 334 feet up in the air. Other tasks included one which saw Johnson, 77, and Vardy putting their hands into holes cut into the side of a wrecked wooden boat that were filled with rats, spiders and crabs.

"British Airways is introducing a boarding policy that means those buying the cheapest seats will be called last. From 12 December, passengers will be assigned a number between 1-5 printed on boarding passes, with the highest figure reserved for economy fares. BA said the move is about simplifying the boarding process, and bringing it into line with other carriers, including American Airlines and Iberia. But BA was accused of operating a class system and further eroding perks. The number ""one"" will be given to first class passengers, with others assigned to other segments such as Executive Club or World Traveller Plus. Passengers who are travelling with children or have mobility issues will still be able to board ahead of everyone else. A BA spokeswoman said: ""We are always looking at ways to improve and simplify the airport experience for our customers... Next month we are introducing new boarding procedures to speed up the process and make it simpler for customers to understand. ""This method has been used by airlines around the world for a number of years, including by our partners American Airlines, Iberia and Qatar.""

"This video can not be played A woman from West Yorkshire has taken part in the study about maternal sleeping positions. Women are being advised to sleep on their side in the last three months of pregnancy to help prevent stillbirth. A study of just over 1,000 women found the risk doubles if women go to sleep on their backs in the third trimester. The study looked into 291 pregnancies that ended in stillbirth and 735 women who had a live birth. Researchers say the position which women fall asleep in is most important - and they should not worry if they are on their back when they wake up. About one in 225 pregnancies in the UK ends in stillbirth and the study authors estimate that about 130 babies' lives a year could be saved if women went to sleep on their side. The MiNESS study, published in theBritish Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (BJOG),externalis the biggest of its kind, and confirms findings fromsmaller studiesin New Zealand and Australia. Prof Alexander Heazell, clinical director at the Tommy's Stillbirth Research Centre at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester, who led the research, advises women in their third trimester to sleep on their side for any episode of sleep, including daytime naps. ""What I don't want is for women to wake up flat on their back and think 'oh my goodness I've done something awful to my baby'. ""The question that we asked was very specifically what position people went to sleep in and that's important as you spend longer in that position than you do in any other. ""And also you can't do anything about the position that you wake up in but you can do something about the position you go to sleep."" Put a pillow or pillows behind your back to encourage side-sleeping If you wake during the night, check your position and go back to sleep on your side Pay the same attention to sleep position during the day as you would during the night If you wake on your back during the night, don't worry, just roll on to your side The study didn't find a difference in risk between right or left side Source: Tommy's charity,external Researchers can't say for certain why the risk of stillbirth is increased - but there is a lot of data that suggests when a woman is lying on her back, the combined weight of the baby and womb puts pressure on blood vessels which can then restrict blood flow and oxygen to the baby. Edward Morris, from the BJOG, said the new research was ""extremely welcome"" . ""This is an important study which adds to the growing body of evidence that sleep position in late pregnancy is a modifiable risk factor for stillbirth."" The pregnancy charity Tommy's has starteda campaign,externalto raise awareness of the study and to encourage women to sleep on their side. Michelle Cottle is 36 and lives in London - she is a clinical psychologist and writes an award-winning blog Dear Orla Michelle Cottle's baby Orla was stillborn at 37 weeks in 2016 after a healthy pregnancy where there were no signs that anything was wrong. She writes a blog ""Dear Orla"" and hears from women who have been through the same experience. Michelle, whose daughter Esme was born a year later, says practical advice like this for mothers is important to make them feel more in control. ""I really think it helps to empower people, as it feels like something you can go away and do with the hope of having a more healthy pregnancy and a better outcome than sadly lots of people do have. ""I look back now and I actually feel quite traumatised by my (second) pregnancy because it was a bit like living your worst nightmare every single day. ""Every time there's maybe a quiet moment and you don't know whether your baby is alive or not is absolutely terrifying. ""Night-time is the worst as well because a lot of people would say they believe that their baby died maybe when they were sleeping. I think that's really scary because you have to sleep.

"Winston Churchill described the royal couple's wedding in 1947 as 'a flash of colour on the hard road we travel' Three more portraits of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been released to commemorate their platinum wedding anniversary. On Monday it will be 70 years since their marriage at Westminster Abbey. The church's bells will ring for more than three hours to mark the occasion. The couple will celebrate at a private dinner in Windsor Castle. Queen Elizabeth is the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary. The images are part of a seriesby celebrity photographer Matt Holyoak, whose first portrait of them was revealed on Saturday. The Queen wears a cream dress designed by Angela Kelly, her dressmaker for the last 15 years. Her golden ""Scarab"" brooch was a gift from Prince Philip in 1966. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh are the first royal couple to celebrate the milestone When they married, the monarch was 21 and the Duke a 26-year-old sailor who had served in the Royal Navy. Winston Churchill summed up the occasion in 1947 as ""a flash of colour on the hard road we travel"". Prince Philip is the nation's longest serving consort and the Queen its most enduring monarch. The pair will welcome their sixth great-grandchild in April. Although the Queen continues with many of her duties as head of state, Prince Philip, 96, has retired from royal duties. The Royal Mail has issued a set of six commemorative stamps for the occasion that feature the couple's engagement and wedding.

"Endris Mohammed carried out the killings during a ""sleepover"" in the lounge A man who murdered his two young children by smothering them with a petrol-soaked rag has been sentenced to at least 33 years in jail. Endris Mohammed, 47, was convicted of killing his son Saros and daughter Leanor Endris, aged eight and six, at their home in Birmingham last October. He also tried to kill his wife in an attempted gas blast at the house, Birmingham Crown Court heard. He was also given a 10-year concurrent sentence for her attempted murder. Midlands Live: Victims 'told not to report' Jehovah's Witness child abuse; tourist attraction hit by false child exploitation rumours On Friday, jurorstook less than 30 minutes to find Mohammed guiltyof the killings of his children and the attempt to murder his wife, Penil Teklehaimanot. Jurors had heard that after trying to blow up the house by tampering with a gas valve Mohammed, a taxi driver, had started a fire near the front door. Saros and Leanor died from airway obstruction after suffering chemical burns to their faces, the court was told. Mohammed was told his children ""trusted him implicitly"" On the night they were murdered, Mrs Teklehaimanot was woken by a smoke alarm at their home in Holland Road, Great Barr, but had thought her children were asleep. But, they had been killed by their father during a ""sleepover"" downstairs with him, and were found dead at about 03.30 BST on 28 October, 2016. Passing sentence on Mohammed, Mr Justice Gilbart described the murders as a ""terrible criminal enterprise"" and told Mohammed: ""You have deliberately snuffed out their young lives"". ""They trusted you implicitly and were enjoying your company even on the night of their murder,"" he said.  ""You repaid their trust in you by killing them."" This video can not be played Mohammed captured buying petrol on CCTV less than 12 hours before killing his children CCTV footage showed Mohammed buying a fuel can and three litres of petrol the day before the murders. Speaking after his conviction, Mrs Teklehaimanot said the pain of losing her children was ""indescribable"". ""There is no bigger pain in this world than this experience,"" she said.  ""I cannot comprehend how anyone could be so cold-hearted."" Endris Mohammed suffered burns when he set his car on fire The Uber driver claimed to have a depressive disorder, citing debts and failed hopes for ""a good life in England"". He murdered his children after deciding they ""would be better off dead"", the court heard. He was later found sitting in his car in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, with severe burns, after setting fire to himself. Police said Mohammed had no history of mental illness and contrary to claims of financial difficulties, his account was not overdrawn and Mrs Teklehaimanot was ""bringing good money into the house"". Judge Gilbart accepted Mohammed was suffering a depressive illness but said it fell short of diminished responsibility. Det Insp Justin Spanner, from West Midlands Police, said ""evidence of the pre-planning"" made this ""one of the worst cases I've dealt with"". Mohammed's defence barrister Timothy Raggatt, said the defendant was a man of ""previous good character... who has done something unspeakable"".

"Energy giant British Gas will scrap its expensive standard variable tariffs (SVTs) by April for new customers. It says this will lower average bills. Similar moves have already been announced by both E.On and Scottish Power. British Gas said it would also do more to persuade its customers currently on SVTs to move to cheaper deals. Those already on fixed-term contracts who fail to opt for a replacement will be put on a default tariff. Earlier this year, draft legislation designed to lower the cost of energy bills was published by the government. The legislation will give energy regulator Ofgem the power to cap default tariffs. However, British Gas said its announcement was not prompted by the plans for a cap, which is not due to take effect for at least a year. No price cap this winter, says Ofgem Consumers paying 'too much' for energy Announcing the change, Iain Conn, chief executive of British Gas parent firm Centrica, said: ""We have long advocated that the end of the Standard Variable Tariff is the best way to encourage customers to shop around for the best energy deal."" British Gas has five million customers on an SVT, accounting for some 67% of its customers. These consumers will be allowed to continue on this expensive tariff if they want to. The company said it had contacted all such customers in the first half of 2017, to try to persuade them to move on to cheaper deals. Despite this, only 10% had moved to a better tariff. Such customers will now be prompted to move twice a year, British Gas said. However, no one switching to British Gas from another supplier after 1 April will be able to take out an SVT. If you are on fixed-price contract with British Gas, you will be offered a choice of similar offers when your deal expires. If you fail to make a choice, you will be put onto a default contract for 12 months. However, British Gas has not said whether the default contract will be any cheaper than an SVT. Indeed it could even be a variable contract. Some comparison websites questioned the detail, or lack of it, in what British Gas was proposing. Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at Uswitch.com, said: ""These initiatives by British Gas have the potential to effect positive change for its customers, if it makes it easier for them to make choices about their energy. ""However, what remains to be seen is if customers rolled onto a new fixed deal with British Gas end up finding themselves on another poor value standard tariff by another name."" In other words until we know the details of these tariffs there are no guarantees that prices will go down. According to Ofgem, British Gas already has one of the lowest SVTs in the industry, with a relatively small difference between that and its average fixed-price deal. British Gas also wants to see additional charges for social and environmental policies taken off energy bills. These include things like the Warm Home Discount and the Energy Company Obligation. According to arecent reportby energy expert Professor Dieter Helm, such charges account for 20% of the average energy bill. ""We need a fairer way to pay for the changing energy system by removing government policy costs from energy bills,"" said Mr Conn. He would like the costs paid for out of general taxation - an idea unlikely to appeal to the government.

"Charles Manson has died, aged 83. But what is it about the murderous cult leader, who committed his crimes almost 50 years ago, that continues to fascinate? The brown eyes. The beard. The swastika tattooed between his eyes. It was impossible not to look at Charles Manson, however much you wanted to turn away. During his years in prison, photographs of Manson were issued only periodically, so he seemed to age in chunks, unable to appear before the public but always remaining at the back of its consciousness. More than 30 books about his life and crimes have been published. One, by the prosecuting attorney at his trial, Vincent Bugliosi, has sold more than seven million copies. Netflix has made a comedy film - Manson Family Vacation - showing how his macabre crimes affect a modern middle-class American family, and two documentaries on his life and crimes have come out this year alone. Obituary: Charles Manson Manson's music was a macabre sidenote Dilemma over Charles Manson's funeral In life, everything Manson did was news, the most recent example being the media frenzy in 2014 when it was announced he had been granted a licence to marry 26-year-old Afton Elaine Burton. Actress Sharon Tate, the most high-profile victim of the ""Manson Family"" From behind bars, Manson courted publicity, setting himself up as a counter-cultural icon. He once told the American public: ""My father is your system... I am only what you made me. I am only a reflection of you."" It's 48 years since Manson sent a group of his indoctrinated followers - known as the Family - to the home of heavily pregnant Hollywood actress Sharon Tate to ""totally destroy everyone in it"". They stabbed Tate and four others to death. False clues were left to dress the scene as an attack by the Black Panthers, a militant African-American group which used violence in its battle against white racism. Manson's hope was that these murders, and the killing of two shop owners the next night, would start an apocalyptic race war, after which he would emerge as America's ruler. Manson was found guilty of conspiracy to murder in 1971 and given a life sentence. Yet something in his life story resonated. Born in Ohio, he had an impoverished and troubled childhood, moving between reform schools. When he was five his mother and uncle went to prison for holding up a service station. By the age of 13, Manson was robbing casinos and shops at gunpoint. He had ""a tendency towards moodiness and a persecution complex"", according to a psychologist who described him as ""aggressively anti-social"", partly due to ""an unfavourable family life, if it can be called family life at all"". When he couldn't afford bills or support his pregnant wife, he became a thief. After six years in prison, he was released in 1967, the year of the so-called ""summer of love"". Manson developed a fixation with the Beatles song Helter Skelter. Ostensibly about the difficulties of a love life told through a metaphor of a fairground ride, he instead thought it predicted a race war after which he and his followers, taking refuge in an underground city in California's Death Valley, would be the only white survivors. Black people, he thought, would be unable to organise themselves and then beg him to be their leader. A track from The Beatles' 1968 White Album - one of several songs that Manson told his followers prophesied an apocalyptic race war; the words were scrawled in blood on the refrigerator at the home of two of the murder victims The association between Manson and the song persisted after his conviction - it provided the title of a 1974 memoir by the prosecutor in Manson's trial, Vincent Bugliosi U2 covered the song on the live album Rattle and Hum. Singer Bono introduces it with the words: ""This is a song Charles Manson stole from The Beatles. We're stealing it back"" Manson set up a commune at the Spahn ranch in the Californian desert, surrounded by disused sets from 1950s Westerns. He recruited followers, mainly middle-class and female, with whom he took LSD and participated in orgies. ""He managed to exploit the hippy subculture brilliantly,"" Daniel Kane, professor of American literature and culture at Sussex University, says. ""Hippies, after all, proposed themselves as disaffiliated from the political and social mainstream, committed to creating their own independent utopias marked by sex, drugs and rock and roll. ""Manson took on all those signs - LSD, music, free love, communal lifestyles - and reframed them as tools for apocalyptic mass murder. Totally bizarre, totally evil, and very, very seductive."" With his long brown hair and beard, Manson's followers likened his appearance to that of Jesus. The appearance of Charles Manson, shown here in 1969, was likened by his followers to that of Jesus ""There are thousands of evil, polished conmen out there, and we've had more brutal murders than the Manson murders,"" Mr Bugliosi, the prosecuting attorney at Manson's trial,told Rolling Stone magazine in 2012,external, ""so why are we still talking about Charles Manson? ""He had a quality about him that one thousandth of 1% of people have. An aura. 'Vibes,' the kids called it in the '60s. Wherever he went, kids gravitated toward him."" Psychopaths are ""incredibly charming and persuasive"", David Wilson, professor of criminology at Birmingham City University, told the BBC in 2014, when Manson's intention to marry was announced. ""To get you under control, to court you, they appear to give their complete and utter attention."" The Manson case involved drugs, orgies and cults, three concerns shared by parents of children growing up in the ""free love"" atmosphere of the late 1960s. It also came at a time divisions in the US over civil rights, race and the Vietnam War. ""He is iconic because he was the person who brought the swinging sixties to an end,"" Prof Wilson says. ""His strange and bizarre thinking appeared perfectly in tune with the damaged side of drug culture. It wasn't flower power any more. Youth culture was far darker and more disturbing than people had previously thought."" In death, Manson is leading TV and radio bulletins and news websites. ""There's another feeding frenzy around him since he passed on,"" says Prof Kane. ""The aura around Charles Manson is continuing and it shows no sign of dying off.""

"A recent photo of Charles Manson, now aged 80 What is it about the murderous cult leader Charles Manson, who committed his crimes more than 40 years ago, that continues to fascinate? The stare is still the same. The hair may have greyed but the beard remains. With a swastika etched between his eyes, Charles Manson maintains an aura. It is almost 45 years since he sent a group of his indoctrinated followers - known as the Family - to the home of heavily pregnant Hollywood actress Sharon Tate to ""totally destroy everyone in it"".  She and four others were stabbed to death. False clues were left to dress the scene as an attack by the Black Panthers, a militant African-American group which used violence in its battle against white racism. Manson's hope was that these murders, and the killing of two shop owners the next night, would start a race war, after which he would emerge as America's ruler. It did not happen. Amid public revulsion at his crimes, Manson was found guilty of conspiracy to murder in 1971 and given a life sentence. Now aged 80, Manson has been granted a licence to marry Afton Elaine Burton, a 26-year-old who moved from the Mid West to live near the prison where he is an inmate in Corcoran, California. ""I love him,"" she declares. ""I'm with him."" But that closeness is unlikely to extend to living with Manson, who isn't eligible for parole until 2027. ""Why does a 26-year-old woman want to marry him?"" asks Daniel Kane, a lecturer on American literature and culture at Sussex University. ""It shows the continuing attraction that he has for a counter-culture to this day. Manson the rebel, the outlaw, the radical vegetarian willing to kill to make his point. ""That's disgusting and demented, but it's also fundamentally political, in the same way a contemporary terrorist is political."" Actress Sharon Tate, the most high-profile victim of the ""Manson family"" Sharon Tate's sister Debra, who acts as a spokeswoman for the families of Manson's victims, has called the impending marriage ""ludicrous''. But this and other stories about Manson still get reported across the world's media. More than 30 books about his life and crimes have been published. One, by the prosecuting attorney at his trial, Vincent Bugliosi, has sold more than seven million copies since 1974. Manson's comments are widely quoted. He insists he is a ""political prisoner"" and that the US government is holding him hostage, proclaiming: ""My father is your system... I am only what you made me. I am only a reflection of you."" Born in Ohio, Manson had an impoverished and troubled childhood. With a reportedly high IQ, but unable to read or write properly, he moved between reform schools. When he was five his mother and uncle went to prison after they held up a service station. By the age of 13 Manson was robbing casinos and shops at gunpoint. He had ""a tendency towards moodiness and a persecution complex"", according to a psychologist who described him as ""aggressively anti-social"" partly due to ""an unfavourable family life, if it can be called family life at all"".

We're stealing it back."" There was a sense of bewilderment and terror at Manson's crimes - how an ex-convict from a poor background had managed to style himself as a guru and persuaded middle-class youngsters to do his bidding. The Manson case involved drugs, orgies and cults, three concerns shared by parents of children growing up in the ""free love"" atmosphere of the era. It also came at a time of intense divisions in the US over civil rights, race and the Vietnam War. Rioting had affected several cities in 1968. Wilson thinks Manson's persistence as a cultural figure is because he seemed to be teaching Americans about their own negligence to threats they apparently faced. This, plus his personal charisma, made his impact greater than that of most murderers. ""He is iconic because he was the person who brought the swinging sixties to an end,"" he says. ""His strange and bizarre thinking appeared perfectly in tune with the damaged side of drug culture. It wasn't flower power any more. Youth culture was far darker and more disturbing than people had previously thought."" Subscribe to theBBC News Magazine's email newsletterto get articles sent to your inbox.

"Winston Churchill described the royal couple's wedding in 1947 as 'a flash of colour on the hard road we travel' Three more portraits of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been released to commemorate their platinum wedding anniversary. On Monday it will be 70 years since their marriage at Westminster Abbey. The church's bells will ring for more than three hours to mark the occasion. The couple will celebrate at a private dinner in Windsor Castle. Queen Elizabeth is the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum wedding anniversary. The images are part of a seriesby celebrity photographer Matt Holyoak, whose first portrait of them was revealed on Saturday. The Queen wears a cream dress designed by Angela Kelly, her dressmaker for the last 15 years. Her golden ""Scarab"" brooch was a gift from Prince Philip in 1966. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh are the first royal couple to celebrate the milestone When they married, the monarch was 21 and the Duke a 26-year-old sailor who had served in the Royal Navy. Winston Churchill summed up the occasion in 1947 as ""a flash of colour on the hard road we travel"". Prince Philip is the nation's longest serving consort and the Queen its most enduring monarch. The pair will welcome their sixth great-grandchild in April. Although the Queen continues with many of her duties as head of state, Prince Philip, 96, has retired from royal duties. The Royal Mail has issued a set of six commemorative stamps for the occasion that feature the couple's engagement and wedding.

"Firms in the ""gig economy"" are exploiting loopholes in employment law leaving workers worse off, say MPs. Minicab drivers and delivery riders face an ""unacceptable burden"" of having to prove they are ""workers"" not self-employed, two Commons committees say. They suggest that companies should be fined if they falsely classify workers and deny them benefits. A spokeswoman said the government recognised the ""labour market is not working for everyone"". She said that was why the government had commissioned Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the Royal Society of the Arts, to review employment practices. The Work and Pensions Committee and the Business Select Committee have drawn up a draft bill which would assume ""worker by default"", to make firms pay holiday and sick pay. Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, said the draft bill would ""end the mass exploitation of ordinary, hard-working people in the gig economy"". ""It is time to close the loopholes that allow irresponsible companies to underpay workers, avoid taxes and free ride on our welfare system,"" he said. The committees said that fines levied against firms would make sure that ""the risks of being caught outweigh the gains companies stand to make from illegal practices"". Mr Taylor's report, published in July, called for reform of the law so that gig workers are reclassified as dependent contractors who could then maintain flexibility whilst receiving statutory benefits. ""We are considering his report carefully and will respond in due course,"" a government spokeswoman said. Uber says its workers are self-employed Gig economy businesses like Uber and Deliveroo insist their workers are self-employed, although Uber has lost several legal cases on the issue. ""Self-employed"" workers who log on to the gig-business technology platform to find work do not automatically receive statutory benefits. The firms say gig workers value the flexibility such ""on-demand"" working provides. In the gig economy, instead of a regular wage, workers get paid for the ""gigs"" they do, such as a food delivery or a car journey. In the UK, it is estimated that one million people are employed in this type of capacity. Jobs include couriers, ride-hailing drivers andvideo producers. Workers in the gig economy are classed as independent contractors. That means they have no protection against unfair dismissal, no right to redundancy payments, and no right to receive the national minimum wage, paid holiday or sickness pay. Rachel Reeves, the Labour chairwoman of the Business Select Committee, said that workers rights should not be sacrificed for flexibility. ""Uber, Deliveroo and others like to bang the drum for the benefits of flexibility for their workforce but currently all the burden of this flexibility is picked up by taxpayers and workers,"" she said, referring to the fact that gig firms do not have to pay the same rates of tax as businesses which employ staff on full-time or part-time contracts. ""This must change. We say that companies should pay higher wages when they are asking people to work extra hours or on zero-hours contracts. ""Recent cases demonstrate a need for greater clarity in the law to protect workers."" Ms Reeves also said that employment tribunals should consider higher fines for any firm found to have breached the law. Companies like Deliveroo,which recently won a case on the self-employed status of its ridersbefore the Central Arbitration Committee, said that the law on self-employment prevented them offering statutory rights. ""Deliveroo riders are self-employed for one reason only, it allows them to work flexibly, which riders tell us is exactly what they want,"" a spokesman said. ""Riders make on average Â£9.50 an hour with Deliveroo, well above the National Living Wage. ""Alongside this flexibility and good pay, we want to offer riders more security - such as injury pay and sick pay. At the moment the law prevents us from doing so. Mr Taylor has urged the government to act. ""The government should note that there is now cross party support for legislation in key areas like extra pay for non-guaranteed hours, a day one statement of rights and conditions and making it much easier for all workers to have independent representation,"" he told me.

"This video can not be played Robert Mugabe: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"" Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has defied calls from the public, the army and his own party to resign, vowing to stay in power for several weeks. His televised address on Sunday triggered an avalanche of comments across social media. Responding to another user's comments, constitutional lawyer and human rights activist Tendai Biti argued that Mr Mugabe, who has ruled Zimbabwe since 1980, would never quit. Allow Twitter content?

"General Chiwenga was welcomed to China by military leaders A trip to Beijing by Zimbabwe's military chief was a ""normal military exchange"", China's foreign ministry said after the army seized power in Harare. How deep are relations between China and Zimbabwe really? The news that General Constantino Chiwenga had visited China only a few days before the military takeover in Zimbabwe was a coincidence that did not go unnoticed. There was also speculation after China said it was closely watching developments, but stopped short of condemning President Mugabe's apparent removal from power. China is Zimbabwe's fourth largest trading partner and its largest source of investment - with stakes worth many billions of pounds in everything from agriculture to construction. Zimbabwe is the dependent partner - with China providing the largest market for its exports and much needed support to its fragile economy. China's relations with Zimbabwe are deep, starting during the Rhodesian Bush War. Robert Mugabe failed in 1979 to get Soviet backing, so turned to China, which provided his guerrilla fighters with weapons and training. Both countries formally established diplomatic relations atZimbabwean independence in 1980and Robert Mugabe visited Beijing as prime minister the following year. He has been a regular visitor since. Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has met Chinese leaders a number of times For years, Zimbabwe's officials have tried to play off China against the West, advocating the country's ""Look East"" strategy, particularly following the introduction of EU sanctions in 2002. Indeed, a decade ago, Mr Mugabe told a packed rally at the Chinese-built national sports stadium in Harare: 'We have turned east, where the sun rises, and given our back to the west, where the sun sets."" China's military engagement also deepened during Zimbabwe's ""Look East"" era. Significant purchases were made, including Hongdu JL-8 jet aircraft, JF-17 Thunder fighter aircraft, vehicles, radar and weapons. However, following acontroversy about a shipment of arms in 2008,external, Beijing decided to list Zimbabwe for ""limited level"" military trading. Despite Zimbabwe's efforts, the ""Look East"" strategy did not bring the investment flood hoped for and a decade later, in August 2015, Mr Mugabe openly asked for Western re-engagement in his ""state of the nation"" address. Five things you should know about Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? How can you tell a coup is happening? Now, the reality is that increasingly Chinese and Western interests - particularly those of the UK - have become aligned. Not far from each other in the outer suburbs of Harare, two of the biggest embassies in Zimbabwe are the British and the Chinese. As other embassies scaled down or closed, Beijing's expanded. Whereas British diplomats were well connected with business, civil society and opposition figures, the Chinese invested in ""technical support"" of the party of government Zanu-PF, including state security and the presidency. When it came to Zanu-PF politics and factionalism, Chinese diplomats were well connected and insightful and, like their Western colleagues, concerned about  stability, a better investment climate and adherence to the rule of law. President Xi Jinping visited Zimbabwe in 2015 and President Mugabe visited Beijing in January 2017. In public, the Chinese leader said his country is willing to encourage capable companies to invest in Zimbabwe. But in private, the message was that there would be no more loans until Zimbabwe stabilised its economy. Maj Gen Sibusiso Moyo said the military was not staging a coup In 2016 trade between the two countries amounted to $1.1bn (Â£0.8bn), with China the biggest buyer of Zimbabwean tobacco and also importing cotton and various minerals. In return Zimbabwe imported electronics, clothing and other finished products. Chinese state construction firms have also been active, building infrastructure including Zimbabwe's $100m (Â£75m) National Defence College. And last year China agreed to finance a new 650-seat parliament in Harare. But Chinese diplomats and many businesses are waiting for better days in Zimbabwe. Some companies have found the investment climate challenging - being burned on diamonds, for example - and have looked for alternative markets. A couple of weeks ago I was in China, attending a meeting on China-Africa relations and Zimbabwe was not mentioned once. Unlike Ethiopia, Sudan, or Angola that are strategic partners, or big markets like Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa, Zimbabwe is far from being Beijing's new priority. So, Beijing's interest is in a better investment climate in Zimbabwe. A clear transitional arrangement resulting in elections for a legitimate government in Harare is as much in Beijing's interest as London's. The ""Look East"" and the ""Re-engagement with the West"" strategies have not brought about the confidence and investment that Zimbabwe needs. What Zimbabwe requires is stable and accountable government - then investors from Asia, America and Europe will seriously consider that Zimbabwe has an investment future. This was the message that Mr Mugabe received in Beijing in January. And the one which Zimbabwe's military chief also was given last week.

"Gaia Pope was last seen in Swanage on 7 November There were no injuries to suggest ""any other person was involved"" in the death of missing teenager Gaia Pope, police have said. The 19-year-old's body was found on Saturday in a field near Swanage, 11 days after she was last seen. Dorset Police is treating her death as ""unexplained"" pending toxicology results. Three people were arrested on suspicion of murder as part of the investigation and released under investigation. Det Supt Paul Kessell said: ""The post-mortem examination has not identified any injuries to suggest any other person was involved in her death. ""The cause of death is undetermined, pending toxicology. The coroner is involved in the oversight of these examinations but at this time this remains an investigation into an unexplained death."" Some items of clothing that Miss Pope was wearing on the day she went missing were found on Thursday Miss Pope, who had severe epilepsy, had not been seen since 7 November. Her disappearance prompted a massive campaign from family and friends who spent days scouring the town. Items of clothing she was wearing on the day she went missing were found on Thursday, close to where her remains were found near a coastal path. Police thanked volunteers for their help in searching for the teenager, but have asked people to stay away from the site due to safety concerns. Det Supt Kessell added: ""I reiterate this area is steep and slippery in an exposed area close to sea cliffs. The area is covered in dense undergrowth and gorse and can present a hazard. ""The area where the body was located is likely to remain cordoned off for some time while forensic examinations and searches are concluded."" Miss Pope went missing in Swanage on 7 November Flowers have been left in Miss Pope's memory at a Swanage monument Earlier, Miss Pope's twin sister, Maya, spoke of her heartbreak and vowed to ""make her [sister] so proud"". On Facebook, she added: ""Can't find any words right now. Gaia is my everything and I am heartbroken. I thank everyone who was involved in searching for my beautiful twin."" Her elder sister, Clara Pope-Sutherland, said the 19-year-old was the ""light of my life"" and ""intelligent, beautiful and emotionally wise"". People in the town came together at the church to say prayers and light candles on Sunday night A church service was held at St Mary's Church in Swanage with candles lit in memory of Miss Pope on Sunday night. Team rector, the Very Reverend John Mann, said: ""When you see the candles together it brings that sense of unity. ""There were police and people who had been out searching at the service - that added to the sense this was a community together, we were there together."" Floral tributes have begun to be left on the Alfred Monument, next to the sea front. Family friend Sheri Carr, who organised the Find Gaia social media campaign thanked the public for its support. ""We are absolutely devastated, and unable to put into words our feeling of loss,"" she wrote on social media. The public has been asked to stay away from the site due to safety concerns On the day she went missing, Miss Pope was seen at about 15:00 GMT buying an ice cream at St Michael's Garage, having been driven there by a relative. She was then spotted an hour later on CCTV in Manor Gardens, off Morrison Road. Rosemary Dinch, 71; her 49-year-old son Paul Elsey; and 19-year-old grandson Nathan Elsey - all of whom were known to Miss Pope - were questioned by detectives and released under investigation.

The tweet has however been deleted but we manged to get a screengrab of it: Mr Moyo, who is also the minister for higher education, is among party officials that were pushing for Mrs Mugabe to take over from her husband. Mr Mnangagwa was last seen on 4 November during a public rally There is uncertainty over the whereabouts of Emmerson Mnangagwa whose sacking as vice-president triggered the military takeover in Zimbabwe. Several media reports say he returned to Zimbabwe last week having fled the country after he was fired. The263Chat news site,externalis reporting that his handlers are keeping him away from the public to guarantee his security. The site quotes a Zanu-PF official Patrick Chinamasa saying Mr Mnangagwa, who is nicknamed the crocodile, will be seen in public when his security is guaranteed. âWe have mapped a clear road map for the smooth transfer of power and Mnangagwa will come back to assume that leading role. We donât know where his is but he is on his way back,â Mr Chinamasa said. Another party official Obert Mpofu told a media briefing yesterday that Mr Mnangagwa's absence shows he has self control: âHe is a disciplined cadre and has been under attack from negative forces but kept quiet, traits he got from the war. it is that quietness that has bore some good fruits into all this saga"". Mr Mnangagwa was last seen on 4 November during a public rally, 263Chat reports. Read:Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back Mr Mugabe defied expectations that he would resign in his TV speech One curious part of Robert Mugabe's speech yesterday was his declaration that he planned to preside over the Zanu-PF congress next month. Zimbabwean constitutional lawyer Alex Magaisa told BBC Focus on Africa that maybe he knew that the process of impeachment could take a long time: People underestimate that old man. He thinks far more than the people dealing with him. He already knows what is coming. He will delay this process as much as possible to ensure it gets to congress.""  We reported earlieron the complex process that lies ahead. Zanu-PF's
representative in the UK has been talking to the BBC, giving some insight into why Robert Mugabe has not resigned yet: As we all know, President Mugabe is a very stubborn man. In his mindset he believes that the British came for him, and he defied them. The Americans tried through sanctions and he defied, the European Union he defied.  So he has defied everybody and he believes his own, as he calls them, boys, would not be able to make him to do what superpowers have failed to do.""  Nick Mangwana was speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World At One: This video can not be played Zanu-PF's UK representative says the case to impeach the President is a 'fait accompli' MPs from Zimbabwe's main opposition party, MDC, will meet to decide on whether to support a push to impeach President Robert Mugabe. The party's chief whip told Reuters news agency that lawmakers will meet on Tuesday to discuss the plan. Reuters reports that the governing Zanu-PF has the requisite two-thirds needed to trigger impeachment, but that opposition support would boost the process of removing Mr Mugabe. People anticipated a resignation One of the key questions today is: Why has Robert Mugabe not resigned as president of Zimbabwe? There is one theory that the plan was for Mr Mugabe to resign in a televised speech last night but there was a last minute change-of-heart. We reported earlier that people are sharing video which they claimappears to show the speech being switched. Two political sources told Reuters news agency that Mr Mugabe had actually agreed to resign but the ruling party Zanu-PF did not want him to quit in front of the military because that would have made its intervention on Wednesday look like a coup. We said earlier that Reuters was reporting that the ex-Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda has been sent to Zimbabwe to convince President Robert Mugabe to resign. So we looked into it. Our colleague talked to Mr Kaunda's son who told her he was next to him watching the events unfold on TV and had not been asked to go to Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe's ruling party Zanu-PF has shared its draft impeachment motion with Reuters news agency. The draft motion reportedly says President Robert Mugabe is a ""source of instability"", has shown disrespect for
the rule of law and is to blame for an unprecedented economic
tailspin over the past 15 years. Parliament is expected to debate impeaching Mr Mugabe when it next meets, on Tuesday. Zimbabwe's dollar became worthless under Mr Mugabe's rule An official of the governing Zanu-PF has called on Zimbabweans to join another planned protest against President Robert Mugabe.

Despite a show of public defiance against President Mugabe people are still afraid The BBC's Andrew Harding has been speaking to Zimbabweans on the streets of the capital Harare. He reports that there is a feeling of growing frustration after President Robert Mugabe failed to resign last night as had been expected. He says people feel confused and impatient. A taxi driver told him that he had expected Mr Mugabe to leave office last night: He was supposed to be looking after his family... [he should] stay in Singapore, Malaysia where he has assets.""  Others said that despite Saturday's public show of defiance as people rallied to urge President Mugabe to go, they were still afraid. Harare resident Lydia Gombe told our reporter that after years of repressive rule, many Zimbabweans still fear that they might get into trouble if they speak out against the government: The level of fear that these people have instilled in us as a nation is unbelievable. And it is just simple things. WhatsApp texts can get you arrested. A conversation in the bus can get you arrested.""  She adds that it would take time for people to lose their fear of speaking out. The deadline set by the governing Zanu-PF party for President Robert Mugabe to resign has passed without any significant development. As we all wait to see what happens next in Zimbabwe, here's a look back at the extraordinary events of the past week, in this two-minute-long video: This video can not be played We are getting reports in that the governing Zanu-PF party will proceed to discuss the impeachment of President Robert Mugabe after his resignation deadline lapsed. The party's chief whip Lovemore Matuke told Reuters news agency the party's MPs had planned to meet today. Our previous post points out that legal advisers to Zimbabwe's parliament say the impeachment could take several days to complete. Reuters has a faster estimate - saying that, because of the overwhelming support for the removal of Mr Mugabe, it could take a day. It quotes John Makamure from the Southern African Parliamentary Support Trust saying the move could take 24 hours: ""They can fast-track it. It can be done in a matter of a
day."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.014273101
"Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe resigned last year after almost four decades in power. Now, the country is approaching its first post-Mugabe election, with his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa and MDC Alliance candidate Nelson Chamisa the two front-runners in a field of 23 candidates. Here are 10 numbers that will help you understand how the country got to where it is now. Robert Mugabe, who led the country's liberation movement, was in power from independence in 1980 until he was ousted in November last year at the age of 93. His years in office, first as prime minister until the switch to a presidential system in 1987, were marked by economic turmoil and the crushing of dissent. Both Robert Mugabe (L) and Emmerson Mnangagwa (R) are from the ruling Zanu-PF party Emmerson Mnangagwa is his successor - nicknamed the ""crocodile"" because of political cunning. Once a Mugabe loyalist, he promises to revive the shattered economy and hopes to win elections on 30 July to legitimise his presidency. Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? The 'crocodile' who snapped back Zimbabwe's political crusader Zimbabwe's economy has struggled since a controversial land reform programme was introduced in 2000. The programme that saw white-owned farms redistributed to landless black Zimbabweans - and those with good political connections - led to sharp falls in production. As the country's central bank printed money to try to get out of the crisis, rampant inflation took hold. Although the World Bank does not have figures for 2008 and 2009, numbers from Zimbabwe's central bank showed annual inflation reached 231 million % in July 2008. Officials gave up reporting monthly statistics when it peaked at just under 80 billion % in mid-November 2008. The country was forced to abandon its own currency a year later at a rate of Z$35 quadrillion to US$1. More on post-Mugabe Zimbabwe: The political crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? The political and economic crises between 2000 and 2008 nearly halved Zimbabwe's GDP -the biggest contraction in a peacetime economy, according to the World Bank.,external A brief period of recovery between 2009 and 2012 has now faltered and the economy faces serious challenges, says the World Bank. Growth has slowed sharply from an average 8% from 2009 to 2012, caused by shifts in trade and a series of major droughts. Mr Mugabe always blamed Zimbabwe's economic problems on a plot by Western countries, led by the UK, to oust him because of his seizure of white-owned farms. Zimbabwe's exiled white farmers return The country's political and economic crises have resulted in high poverty rates. The hard years between 2000 and 2008 saw poverty rates increase tomore than 72%, according to the World Bank.,externalIt also left a fifth of the population in extreme poverty. Extreme poverty, estimated to have fallen from 2009 to 2014, is now projected to have risen again substantially. About 27% of children under the age of five suffer stunted growth, with 9% severely stunted because of poor nutrition, the2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey report revealed.,external But poverty in Zimbabwe is still lower than in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, where about41% of the population were living on less than $1.90 a day,externalin 2013, World Bank data suggests. Estimates of the country's unemployment levels vary wildly. The World Bank's modelled estimates, based on International Labour Organisation data, puts the figureas low as 5% in 2016,external, while Zimbabwe's biggest trade union claimedthe jobless rate was as high as 90% last year.,external Many people try to make a living by vending as they cannot find employment However, the World Bank's definition only covers those actively seeking work. Many of those not counted may not seek a job despite wanting one because they ""view job opportunities as limited, or because they have restricted labour mobility, or face discrimination, or structural, social or cultural barriers"". The CIA World Factbook estimates the rate was95% in 2009, but says current figures are not known.,external Thanks to large investments in education since independence, Zimbabwe has one of the highest adult literacy rates in Africa, with89% of the adult population literate,external, according to World Bank data from 2014. Globally, the literacy rate stood at 86% in 2016, while in sub-Saharan Africa it was 64%. Almost all women and men aged 15-49 have had at least some primary education,according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey.,externalMore than 70% of people aged 15-49 have also attended secondary school. Zimbabwe has the sixth highest HIV prevalence rate in sub-Saharan Africa, with 1.3 million people living with HIV in 2016,according to UNAids.,external However, after a peak in 1997, rates are declining. According to the UN, this is a result of successful campaigns encouraging condom use as well as programmes preventing the transmission of infection from mother to child. Treatment and support services have also improved. Making decent burials affordable Life expectancy fell in the 1990s, with the HIV/Aids epidemic a major killer. It dropped from a high of just under 61 years in 1986 to 44.1 years in 2003. It is now steadily improving again, but with unemployment and poverty endemic and HIV/Aids rates still high, it remained at just 60 in 2015, according to World Bank data. Will age be a factor in Zimbabwe's poll? Mobile devices are the leading communication tool for Zimbabweans. But while most have a mobile phone, only 43% of households have a radio, 37% have a television and 10% have a computer,according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey.,external After a growth spurt after independence in 1980, a decline in birth rates and a rise in death rates saw population growth slide downwards. With high outward migration rates also high, the population has not recovered its post-independence growth. Written and produced by Lucy Rodgers. Robert Mugabe - hero or villain?

"Becki McGuinness suffers from PTSD after her cancer treatment left her infertile A fifth of cancer patients experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a Malaysian study has found. About one-third of these still had consistent or worsening PTSD four years after diagnosis. The researchers said PTSD needed to be identified, monitored and treated early. Becki McGuinness, who was diagnosed with bone cancer, said the resulting PTSD and depression were the biggest challenges for her. Becki was treated with chemotherapy after being diagnosed at the age of 21. When it didn't work, she was told she would need radiotherapy. ""By the time I'd finished radiotherapy, and a few months passed, my periods were stopping. ""It wasn't until I was 23 that I found out that I'd gone through the menopause and was infertile,"" she said. Becki was devastated - even more so when she found out it could have been prevented. ""I was waiting a whole month for my treatment. I later saw a gynaecologist who said, 'If you'd only been sent to me I could have saved your fertility.'"" It left her with depression and PTSD, which she still lives with seven years on. ""I could take all the physical stuff. I could take even that I might die but when something's taken away and it's not your choice, that's what I find quite stressful. ""If you take that person's choice away, it's like saying you're not worth picking for yourself what you want for your future."" The team followed 469 patients with various types of cancer,externalat one referral centre in Malaysia. They tested them for PTSD after six months and then again four years after they'd been diagnosed.  At six months, 21% had PTSD. This dropped to 6% four years on. ""Many cancer patients believe they need to adopt a 'warrior mentality', and remain positive and optimistic from diagnosis through treatment to stand a better chance of beating their cancer,"" said the study's lead author, Caryn Mei Hsien Chan. ""To these patients, seeking help for the emotional issues they face is akin to admitting weakness. ""There needs to be greater awareness that there is nothing wrong with getting help to manage the emotional upheaval - particularly depression, anxiety, and PTSD post-cancer."" While the association between PTSD and cancer hasn't been studied in the UK, government data showsone in five people with cancer,externalreport having moderate to severe mental health issues.  Macmillan Cancer Support estimates this to be about 530,000 people with cancer in the UK. Dr Chan also stressed that many patients lived in fear that their cancer may return. The fear and depression can cause them to skip appointments as they trigger negative memories, which can be detrimental to their health. The study also found patients with breast cancer - who received special dedicated support and counselling at the centre studied - were almost four times less likely to develop PTSD in the short term. Dr Chan said: ""We need psychological evaluation and support services for patients with cancer at an initial stage and at continued follow-ups because psychological well-being and mental health - and by extension, quality of life - are just as important as physical health."" Dany Bell from Macmillan Cancer Support said: ""It is tragic, but sadly not surprising, that so many people with cancer suffer from PTSD. ""While a common perception is that people should feel 'lucky' to have survived cancer, we often hear from people who felt that the support they received 'dropped away' when their treatment ended. The health and care system has a long way to go in terms of supporting people after cancer treatment."" Becki couldn't agree more. She said her mental health support  was inadequate and the consequences remain with her. ""You see children and you try and block it out but realise the depression is something that will keep popping up,"" she said. Her cancer is now in remission but she stills lives in a lot of pain that prevents her from working. She devotes time to campaigning for awareness for fertility preservation, to make sure others don't have to go through what she has. Becki said: ""That's given me the empowerment to deal with it a lot better than if I'd been sitting at home, thinking about it. ""I'll keep raising the issue to make sure young people get their needs met.""

"Ant (left) and Dec returned to screens on Sunday night The latest series of I'm A Celebrity has kicked off - with presenter Dec Donnelly joking Ant McPartlin had been replaced following his stint in rehab. The presenting duo were reunited on screen for the first time since McPartlin's treatment for drug addiction over the summer. Donnelly joked that he would have a new co-host on the show, saying: ""It's me and the gorgeous Holly Willoughby!"" McPartlin replied: ""I'm back, my friend... it's good to be back."" Ant McPartlin 'overwhelmed' by fans' support over addiction No permission for Kezia Dugdale to appear in I'm A Celebrity This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons McPartlin entered rehab in June, having become addicted to alcohol and prescription painkillers following a knee operation in 2015. Later in the programme, Donnelly presented a model of the camp and said he'd made it himself - but with no help from McPartlin. He asked his friend: ""Where were you all summer anyway, what were you doing?"" ""Just stuff... just dead busy,"" McPartlin replied with a smile, before swiftly trying to change the subject. The celebs looking fresh-faced before entering the jungle This year's contestants on I'm A Celebrity include boxer Amir Khan, ex-footballer Dennis Wise, Made in Chelsea's Georgia Toffolo and Stanley Johnson - father of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. They are joined by Coronation Street actress Jennie McAlpine and Hollyoaks actor Jamie Lomas, along with comedian Shappi Khorsandi, footballer Jamie Vardy's wife Rebekah, Saturdays singer Vanessa White and YouTube personality Jack Maynard. This year's show opener attracted 10.3 million viewers as it was aired, beating its nearest rival in the same time slot, BBC One's Howards End, which was watched by 9.9 million. It wasn't the highest viewed programme on Sunday evening overall though, with both Strictly Come Dancing's results show and Blue Planet II seen by 10.8 million each on BBC One. Maynard has apologised for offensive tweets Maynard, 22, found himself in hot water over the weekend for some old Tweets he had posted in 2012. He was accused of using homophobic and racist terms, as well as the term ""retards"". A spokesman for Maynard said: ""Jack is ashamed of what he said in these tweets, many of which were deleted a long time ago and were sent in response to a neighbour who was bullying him. ""Jack was a lot younger when he posted them in 2012 but realises that age is no defence. He would never use that language now and realises that, as someone who was bullied himself, this kind of retaliatory, inflammatory, insulting language is completely unacceptable."" An ITV spokesperson added: ""Jack has deleted these tweets and has since issued a full apology."" Johnson had to rummage in creature-filled holes to gain rewards Sunday night's show saw some of the contestants tackling a walk the plank challenge on the roof of a hotel in Australia, 334 feet up in the air. Other tasks included one which saw Johnson, 77, and Vardy putting their hands into holes cut into the side of a wrecked wooden boat that were filled with rats, spiders and crabs.

"Energy giant British Gas will scrap its expensive standard variable tariffs (SVTs) by April for new customers. It says this will lower average bills. Similar moves have already been announced by both E.On and Scottish Power. British Gas said it would also do more to persuade its customers currently on SVTs to move to cheaper deals. Those already on fixed-term contracts who fail to opt for a replacement will be put on a default tariff. Earlier this year, draft legislation designed to lower the cost of energy bills was published by the government. The legislation will give energy regulator Ofgem the power to cap default tariffs. However, British Gas said its announcement was not prompted by the plans for a cap, which is not due to take effect for at least a year. No price cap this winter, says Ofgem Consumers paying 'too much' for energy Announcing the change, Iain Conn, chief executive of British Gas parent firm Centrica, said: ""We have long advocated that the end of the Standard Variable Tariff is the best way to encourage customers to shop around for the best energy deal."" British Gas has five million customers on an SVT, accounting for some 67% of its customers. These consumers will be allowed to continue on this expensive tariff if they want to. The company said it had contacted all such customers in the first half of 2017, to try to persuade them to move on to cheaper deals. Despite this, only 10% had moved to a better tariff. Such customers will now be prompted to move twice a year, British Gas said. However, no one switching to British Gas from another supplier after 1 April will be able to take out an SVT. If you are on fixed-price contract with British Gas, you will be offered a choice of similar offers when your deal expires. If you fail to make a choice, you will be put onto a default contract for 12 months. However, British Gas has not said whether the default contract will be any cheaper than an SVT. Indeed it could even be a variable contract. Some comparison websites questioned the detail, or lack of it, in what British Gas was proposing. Richard Neudegg, head of regulation at Uswitch.com, said: ""These initiatives by British Gas have the potential to effect positive change for its customers, if it makes it easier for them to make choices about their energy. ""However, what remains to be seen is if customers rolled onto a new fixed deal with British Gas end up finding themselves on another poor value standard tariff by another name."" In other words until we know the details of these tariffs there are no guarantees that prices will go down. According to Ofgem, British Gas already has one of the lowest SVTs in the industry, with a relatively small difference between that and its average fixed-price deal. British Gas also wants to see additional charges for social and environmental policies taken off energy bills. These include things like the Warm Home Discount and the Energy Company Obligation. According to arecent reportby energy expert Professor Dieter Helm, such charges account for 20% of the average energy bill. ""We need a fairer way to pay for the changing energy system by removing government policy costs from energy bills,"" said Mr Conn. He would like the costs paid for out of general taxation - an idea unlikely to appeal to the government.

"The US base in Okinawa houses tens of thousands of troops The US military has banned all soldiers stationed in Japan from drinking alcohol after one of its servicemen was involved in a deadly crash on Okinawa island linked to drink driving. US troops on Okinawa have also been told to stay on base or at home. The Marine crashed his truck into a minivan on Sunday, killing the local driver of the other vehicle. Okinawa hosts more than half of the US troops in Japan - locals have longresented the military presence. In a statement, the US military confirmed,externalthat one its service members had been involved in the accident and said that ""alcohol may have been a factor"". The military also announced ""mandatory training to address responsible alcohol use, risk management and acceptable behaviour"" for all its troops across Japan. Trump vows US resolve to Asian allies Japanese police said the Marine was three times over the legal blood alcohol limit, Reuters reports. He is under arrest charged with negligent driving resulting in death, police say. In 2016, tens of thousands of people joined protests against the US troops The US presence on Okinawa in southern Japan is a key part of the security alliance between the two countries. The base houses about 26,000 US troops. There are plans to relocate part of it to a less-populated area of the island, but many Okinawans want the air base removed altogether. They object to the allegedcrimes and accidents attributed to the troops. Resentment at the US presence has been growing among many locals, particularly since the 1995 gang-rape of a 12-year-old girl by US troops. In 2016, the murder of a woman was linked to an ex-Marine employed at one of the bases, also leading to a temporaryban on alcohol as well as a midnight curfew.

"'Don't play Santa to the EU', a Tory MP is warning the government The UK government cannot afford to ""play Santa Claus"" to EU bosses by handing over billions of pounds, a Conservative MP says. Nigel Evans accused the EU of demanding ""ransom money"" from Theresa May to move Brexit negotiations forwards. He was speaking ahead of a meeting between Mrs May and senior ministers to try to make progress on the stalled talks. Downing Street has dismissed reports the UK could double its Â£20bn offer. After the meeting, a Downing Street source said: ""It remains our position that nothing's agreed until everything's agreed in negotiations with the EU. ""As the prime minister said this morning, the UK and the EU should step forward together."" This ""divorce bill"" is one of the main reasons for the logjam in negotiations between the UK and the EU. One ex-minister warned voters would ""go bananas"" if Â£40bn was offered, while Mr Evans told the BBC only cash the UK is ""absolutely contracted for"" should be handed over. ""Yes we will have obligations, but we're not going to pay ransom money simply to leave the European Union,"" he said, adding that the money saved by leaving the EU should be ""spent on British nurses not on Brussels bureaucrats"". Poland is one of the largest recipients of EU development funding The EU says the UK needs to settle its accounts before it leaves. It says the UK has made financial commitments that have to be settled as part of an overall withdrawal agreement. The UK accepts that it has some obligations. And it has promised not to leave any other country out of pocket in the current EU budget period from 2014-20. But the devil is in the detail. There are also issues like pensions for EU staff, and how the UK's contribution to these is calculated for years to come, and the question of what happens to building projects - for instance in Spain - that had funding agreed by all EU members including the UK but which will only begin construction after the UK has left. Large amounts of the EU's budget are spent in two areas - agriculture and fisheries, and development of poorer areas. Projects include business start-ups, roads and railways, education and health programmes and many others. Reality Check: What's happening with the divorce bill? Reality Check: Where does EU money go? The EU says it will not discuss a new trade deal with the UK until issues like the ""divorce bill"" have been settled, and has given Mrs May a deadline of early December to increase the UK's offer. The issue of the Irish border and what happens to EU and UK citizens living in each other's countries also needs to be settled. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Business Secretary Greg Clark said the amount the UK was prepared to offer should only be discussed in private because the UK had to ""exercise discipline"" in the negotiations. On Sunday Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK would come up with proposals in time for the crunch summit in mid-December, where the EU will decide whether to move the negotiations on to talking about future issues like trade. He promised Britain would honour its debts but also ""negotiate hard"" on the various aspects of the financial settlement. Theresa May is to meet some of her senior ministers to discuss the logjam in the Brexit talks Several government sources say the meeting of the Brexit strategy group today could change the course of our departure. The question to be answered could be profound. One source told me: ""People have to decide if they really want to make progress and support this prime minister, or not."" For some in government that tight group of cabinet ministers must take a decision as vital as that - do they want to do a deal with the EU, or not? Of course there is bravado on both sides. As ever, whether thinking of talks on the continent, or in government, take every utterance with a pinch of salt. Read the rest of Laura's blog on the Brexit money question Flashback to 24 June 2016 as Leave campaigners celebrated the Brexit result The UK voted to leave the EU in June 2016, and served the EU with formal notice of Brexit in March 2017. This began a two-year countdown to the UK's departure day which will be in March 2019. Before that the two sides have to agree all sorts of things - including what happens to people living in different countries, how the UK will trade with the EU in future and how the borders will be managed. So the two teams of negotiators have been meeting in Brussels every month. But there has not been much of a breakthrough so far, with the ""divorce bill"" proving to be one of the key sticking points. Part of the problem for Theresa May is that while the EU wants the UK to offer more money, some of her MPs say this would be unacceptable and that the UK should just walk away and leave. All you need to know about Brexit There are plenty of reports about what might happen in today's meeting in Monday's newspapers (although Downing Street has said it is just speculation). According to theDaily Telegraph,external, Brexiteers in the cabinet are expected to ""demand that Mrs May sets out exactly what Britain expects to get for its money before a penny more is promised"". TheMail,externalrejects any offer to pay a significantly larger divorce bill in the Brexit negotiations than what it calls the generous sum already pledged by Prime Minister Theresa May. It's not as if the EU has made a single concession to justify an improved offer, it declares. The paper resents the EU's insistence on the UK coming up with more money before trade talks can start and asks: ""Why should we surrender to blackmail?"" But the Timesaccepts that,externalBritain will have to pay more money - and says it would come with the expectation that the EU, in return, would place a meaningful trade deal on the table. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour, former minister Robert Halfon said people would not accept a ""huge"" sum not being spent on schools and hospitals. The Tory MP said that with austerity on the agenda ahead of Wednesday's Budget, ""if we start saying that we're going to give Â£40 to Â£50bn to the EU, I think the public will go bananas, absolutely spare"". Mr Halfon said he had backed Remain in the EU referendum, but added ""we voted to leave, the public want to leave, and I cannot believe that the public would accept such a huge amount when we need money for our schools, our hospitals, our housing, and many other things"". On Sunday Chancellor Philip Hammond said the UK would honour its debts but also ""negotiate hard"" on the various aspects of the financial settlement. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has been speaking today, saying he wanted the UK to ""settle the accounts accurately"" before beginning trade talks. The UK is currently in the EU's single market, which allows companies to sell goods across borders without fees being charged. After Brexit it wants to draw up a new free trade deal in its place. Mr Barnier said the UK would lose the benefits of the single market as a result of its desire for new controls over EU migration. In his speech, he attacked what he described as ""ardent Brexiteers"" for thinking Britain can be freed from EU rules and still participate in the single market.

"This video can not be played A woman from West Yorkshire has taken part in the study about maternal sleeping positions. Women are being advised to sleep on their side in the last three months of pregnancy to help prevent stillbirth. A study of just over 1,000 women found the risk doubles if women go to sleep on their backs in the third trimester. The study looked into 291 pregnancies that ended in stillbirth and 735 women who had a live birth. Researchers say the position which women fall asleep in is most important - and they should not worry if they are on their back when they wake up. About one in 225 pregnancies in the UK ends in stillbirth and the study authors estimate that about 130 babies' lives a year could be saved if women went to sleep on their side. The MiNESS study, published in theBritish Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology (BJOG),externalis the biggest of its kind, and confirms findings fromsmaller studiesin New Zealand and Australia. Prof Alexander Heazell, clinical director at the Tommy's Stillbirth Research Centre at St Mary's Hospital in Manchester, who led the research, advises women in their third trimester to sleep on their side for any episode of sleep, including daytime naps. ""What I don't want is for women to wake up flat on their back and think 'oh my goodness I've done something awful to my baby'. ""The question that we asked was very specifically what position people went to sleep in and that's important as you spend longer in that position than you do in any other. ""And also you can't do anything about the position that you wake up in but you can do something about the position you go to sleep."" Put a pillow or pillows behind your back to encourage side-sleeping If you wake during the night, check your position and go back to sleep on your side Pay the same attention to sleep position during the day as you would during the night If you wake on your back during the night, don't worry, just roll on to your side The study didn't find a difference in risk between right or left side Source: Tommy's charity,external Researchers can't say for certain why the risk of stillbirth is increased - but there is a lot of data that suggests when a woman is lying on her back, the combined weight of the baby and womb puts pressure on blood vessels which can then restrict blood flow and oxygen to the baby. Edward Morris, from the BJOG, said the new research was ""extremely welcome"" . ""This is an important study which adds to the growing body of evidence that sleep position in late pregnancy is a modifiable risk factor for stillbirth."" The pregnancy charity Tommy's has starteda campaign,externalto raise awareness of the study and to encourage women to sleep on their side. Michelle Cottle is 36 and lives in London - she is a clinical psychologist and writes an award-winning blog Dear Orla Michelle Cottle's baby Orla was stillborn at 37 weeks in 2016 after a healthy pregnancy where there were no signs that anything was wrong. She writes a blog ""Dear Orla"" and hears from women who have been through the same experience. Michelle, whose daughter Esme was born a year later, says practical advice like this for mothers is important to make them feel more in control. ""I really think it helps to empower people, as it feels like something you can go away and do with the hope of having a more healthy pregnancy and a better outcome than sadly lots of people do have. ""I look back now and I actually feel quite traumatised by my (second) pregnancy because it was a bit like living your worst nightmare every single day. ""Every time there's maybe a quiet moment and you don't know whether your baby is alive or not is absolutely terrifying. ""Night-time is the worst as well because a lot of people would say they believe that their baby died maybe when they were sleeping. I think that's really scary because you have to sleep.

"This video can not be played Zimbabwe's week of upheaval in two minutes Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party has summoned its MPs to discuss the future of its leader, President Robert Mugabe, after a deadline for his resignation came and went on Monday. The deadline was set by Mr Mugabe's own party, Zanu-PF. The embattled leader surprised Zimbabweans on Sunday, declaring on TV that he planned to remain as president. Zanu-PF says it backs impeachment, and proceedings could begin as soon as Tuesday when parliament meets. In a draft motion seen by Reuters news agency, the party blamed the president for an ""unprecedented economic tailspin"". Mr Mugabe's grip on power has weakened considerably since the country's army intervened last Wednesday in a row over who should succeed him. Mugabe misses deadline - latest updates Five things about Zimbabwe crisis Zimbabwe's next likely leader Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? The crisis began two weeks ago when the 93-year-old leader sacked his deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa, angering army commanders who saw it as an attempt to position his wife Grace as next president. Zimbabwe has since then seen huge street rallies demanding his immediate resignation. The protests have been backed by the influential war veterans - who fought in the conflict that led to independence from Britain in 1980. The group's leader, Chris Mutsvangwa, on Monday called for more demonstrations. ""Mugabe, your rule is over,"" Mr Mutsvangwa said. ""The emperor has no clothes."" Andrew Harding in Harare The city is swirling with rumours that Mr Mugabe is planning his resignation and that he may go back on television to announce it at any stage, and that Sunday's speech was simply about giving carte blanche to the military for what they've done. But we just don't know at this stage if he will give in to the pressure from the war veterans, his own party, and the public. Mr Mugabe said in his speech that he planned to preside over the Zanu-PF congress next month, a statement people here found baffling after the party voted to strip him of his leadership and kick out his wife. What is clear is that everyone here believes that the Mugabe era is over. Saturday's protests unleashed something and people believe that a line has been crossed. Now it is really about negotiating the time, the process, the choreography of Mr Mugabe's departure. The fear of Zanu-PF and of the security services will not go away overnight. People here grew up with that fear. In the meantime, the streets are calm, but Tuesday may bring more demonstrations. This video can not be played Robert Mugabe: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"" During the 20-minute address, the president, who was flanked by generals, made no mention of the pressure from his party and the public to quit. Instead, he declared that the military had done nothing wrong by seizing power and placing him under house arrest. ""Whatever the pros and cons of how they [the army] went about their operation, I, as commander-in-chief, do acknowledge their concerns,"" he said, in reference to the army's move last week to take over the state broadcaster in the capital Harare. He also said ""the [Zanu-PF] party congress is due in a few weeks and I will preside over its processes"". Before Mr Mugabe's speech, Mr Mnangagwa was named as Zanu-PF's new leader and candidate for the 2018 general elections, while Mr Mugabe's wife was expelled. BBC Africa Editor Fergal Keane said his understanding was that Mr Mugabe had agreed to resign, but then changed his mind. Our correspondent says the generals have no intention of forcing Mr Mugabe out by the barrel of a gun, and are happy to let the Zanu-PF carry out its procedures, working through impeachment if necessary. After the Mugabes, which African dynasties remain? Zimbabwe in 10 numbers Impeachment proceedings could be launched on Tuesday in parliament - but it is not clear how long this would take. Both the National Assembly and the Senate need to pass a vote by simple majority to begin the process, which is laid out in the constitution. This can either be on grounds of ""serious misconduct"", ""violation"" of the constitution or ""failure to obey, uphold or defend"" it, or ""incapacity"". The chambers must then appoint a joint committee to investigate removing the president. If the committee recommends impeachment, the president can then be removed if both houses back it with two-thirds majorities. The opposition MDC-T party has tried unsuccessfully to impeach Mr Mugabe in the past, but this time the ruling party - which has an overwhelming majority in both houses - is likely to go against him. This video can not be played Zimbabwe reacts: ""We need him to resign... our lives are terrible right now"" The advantage for the military is that if Mr Mugabe is impeached, it can claim that he was removed legally, and not by force. The problem for the generals is that the current vice-president would then take power. That is Phelekezela Mphoko, a supporter of Mr Mugabe's wife Grace. The military would prefer to install Emmerson Mnangagwa, the former vice-president who was briefly exiled. And it is still possible that Mr Mugabe could delay the process or cling to power by refusing to resign - and be forced into exile himself. The War Veterans Association, which used to back Mr Mugabe, now says it is time for him to step down. ""Thirty-seven years, you have had your time, you are toast now politically,"" Mr Mutsvangwa told the BBC. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said he was ""baffled"" by the president's address. ""He's playing a game. He has let the whole nation down,"" he told Reuters news agency. Mr Mugabe has led the country since it gained independence from Britain in 1980.

"Manson, pictured here in 1989, sent his followers to commit murder on his behalf Charles Manson's messianic influence inspired his followers to commit murder. Members of his so-called Family were responsible for a series of high-profile killings that shattered the peace and love of the Californian summer of 1969. Over a period of five weeks, nine people, including the actress Sharon Tate, died in barbaric circumstances. Despite not committing any of the murders himself, Manson narrowly escaped the death penalty and spent the rest of his life in jail. Charles Manson dies after decades in jail The terrible charisma of Charles Manson He was born Charles Milles Maddox in Cincinnati, Ohio, on 12 November 1934, the illegitimate son of 16-year-old Kathleen Maddox. Shortly after his birth, his mother married William Manson and her son took his stepfather's name. He endured a miserable childhood. His mother was an alcoholic and when, in 1939, she was jailed after robbing a petrol station, Manson was placed in the care of his aunt and uncle. When his mother was paroled in 1942 she lived with her eight-year-old son in a series of dilapidated rooms before unsuccessfully applying to a court to have him fostered. Instead he was placed in a Catholic boys' home from which he ran away after just 10 months. By the time he was a teenager he was a habitual criminal Manson's robbery of an off-licence marked the beginning of a series of crimes, including armed robbery, and subsequent incarcerations in a number of institutions. By the time he was 17 he had a string of convictions, with one prison case worker reporting that he was ""aggressively antisocial"". After rebelling against the prison authorities, he was classified as dangerous. However, by 1954, after a period of good behaviour, he was allowed parole. He moved to West Virginia to be with his mother and, in 1955, married Rosalie Jean Willis, who worked as a waitress in a hospital. This brief settled period came to an end when he was sentenced to five years' probation for car theft, which was changed to three years in prison after he failed to appear in court to answer another charge. His wife went off with another man and the couple divorced. Manson took up with a prostitute named Leona ""Candy"" Stevens, whose tearful plea to a court that she and Manson would marry if he stayed out of jail saw the judge suspend a 10-year jail sentence on Manson for passing a stolen Treasury cheque. However, in 1960 he again broke probation and was ordered to serve his suspended sentence. In 1967 he was released from prison despite pleading with the authorities to let him stay. Having spent half his life in institutions, he did not feel capable of facing the world outside. Three of his Family - Susan Atkins, Patricia Krenwinkel and Leslie Van Houten - arrive in court He moved to San Francisco where he met a library assistant called Mary Bunning, eventually persuading her to allow other women to move in with them. According to one account, there were at least 18 women resident in the apartment in the first incarnation of what would be dubbed the Manson Family. Fuelled by considerable quantities of drugs, notably LSD, Manson set himself up as something of a guru, peddling a mixture of beliefs and the teachings of numerous cults. He convinced a series of adoring female followers that he was in fact Christ. Before the end of 1967, Manson and some of his followers set off to tour the country in an old bus, covered in hippie regalia. In a bizarre interlude, the Family moved into a plush house owned by the Beach Boys drummer, Dennis Wilson, where the musician found himself subsidising Manson's growing entourage. He introduced Manson to a number of friends working in music and show business. After being evicted by Wilson's manager, the Family relocated to a rundown ranch where Manson became obsessed by the track Helter Skelter on the Beatles' White Album, released in November 1968. Lennon and McCartney's innocent lyrics about a children's playground slide were interpreted by Manson as signifying the beginning of a race war between black and white. In Manson's fevered mind, black people would emerge victorious but would have to rely on the guidance of the Family to help them to build a new social order. The first killing took place on 25 July 1969, when Manson sent three members to the house of an acquaintance, Gary Hinman, who, Manson believed, had a stash of money. After being held hostage for two days, Hinman was stabbed to death by a Family member, Bobby Beausoleil. On 8 August, Manson sent four members of the Family to the rented house of record producer Terry Melcher, with instructions to kill everyone they found. Melcher had previously turned down Manson's request for a recording contract. However, Melcher had moved, and the house had been rented to the film director Roman Polanski and his actress wife Sharon Tate. The gang first shot an 18-year-old youth they encountered outside the house before bursting in and killing the four occupants, hairstylist Jay Sebring, Polanski's friend and aspiring screenwriter Wojciech Frykowski and Frykowski's girlfriend Abigail Folger. Polanski himself was in London on business. Tate, who was eight and a half months pregnant, died from stab wounds and her blood was used to write the word ""pig"" on the outside of the house. Sharon Tate, 26, and Roman Polanski had only married the year before The following night Manson, who had not attended the previous killings, went with six members of the Family to the house of a supermarket executive, Leno LaBianca, and his wife Rosemary. The couple were stabbed to death although, after tying them up, Manson left the house before the attacks began. The final victim was Donald Shea. Manson instructed Steve Grogan, a member of the Family, to kill the former film stuntman, who he believed had passed information to the police. Shea's remains were not found until 1977, when Grogan led police to where he had buried him eight years previously. The police initially ruled out any connection between the Tate and LaBianca killings. The breakthrough only came when Manson and some Family members were arrested after allegations they had vandalised part of the Death Valley National Park by burning stolen vehicles. While being held in custody, Family member Susan Atkins confided her involvement in the murders to two other prisoners who informed the authorities. The trial was marked by a series of disruptions by Family members and a rambling speech in his own defence by Manson. Manson and the three other defendants from the Family were sentenced to death. An appeal process delayed the executions and the sentences were commuted to life imprisonment when California abolished the death penalty in 1972. The publicity surrounding Charles Manson and his Family failed to go away. In 1975, one of his followers, Lynette ""Squeaky"" Fromme, was jailed for life after attempting to assassinate President Ford. Manson himself remained in the public eye. He gave four TV interviews from prison in the 1980s, most notably with Dan Snyder from NBC News and Charlie Rose for CBS, the latter interview winning an Emmy award. His marriage to Elaine ""Star"" Burton did not go ahead By the turn of the century, Manson and his followers had become something of a cult, with websites dedicated to him by people not even born when the Family committed murder. One of these admirers was Afton Elaine ""Star"" Burton, who had begun corresponding with Manson in 2007 when she was just 17. She later announced that she and Manson had become engaged. A marriage licence was issued but it expired without any wedding taking place. The singer Marilyn Manson took his surname, while the British band Kasabian are named after Linda Kasabian, the Family member who escaped prosecution by giving evidence against her former associates. Vincent Bugliosi, the prosecutor at his trial, and the author of Helter Skelter, an account of the case, summed it up thus. ""The very name Manson has become a metaphor for evil, and evil has its allure."" Manson made 12 applications for parole, all of which were refused. Neither the court hearings, nor a positive avalanche of subsequent writings, have given any definitive explanation for Manson's motivation or, perhaps more puzzling, the motivation of those who decided to follow him and commit murder on his behalf.

Andrew Harding in Harare The city is swirling with rumours that Mr Mugabe is planning his resignation and that he may go back on television to announce it at any stage, and that Sunday's speech was simply about giving carte blanche to the military for what they've done. But we just don't know at this stage if he will give in to the pressure from the war veterans, his own party, and the public. Mr Mugabe said in his speech that he planned to preside over the Zanu-PF congress next month, a statement people here found baffling after the party voted to strip him of his leadership and kick out his wife. What is clear is that everyone here believes that the Mugabe era is over. Saturday's protests unleashed something and people believe that a line has been crossed. Now it is really about negotiating the time, the process, the choreography of Mr Mugabe's departure. The fear of Zanu-PF and of the security services will not go away overnight. People here grew up with that fear. In the meantime, the streets are calm, but Tuesday may bring more demonstrations. This video can not be played Robert Mugabe: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"" During the 20-minute address, the president, who was flanked by generals, made no mention of the pressure from his party and the public to quit. Instead, he declared that the military had done nothing wrong by seizing power and placing him under house arrest. ""Whatever the pros and cons of how they [the army] went about their operation, I, as commander-in-chief, do acknowledge their concerns,"" he said, in reference to the army's move last week to take over the state broadcaster in the capital Harare. He also said ""the [Zanu-PF] party congress is due in a few weeks and I will preside over its processes"". Before Mr Mugabe's speech, Mr Mnangagwa was named as Zanu-PF's new leader and candidate for the 2018 general elections, while Mr Mugabe's wife was expelled. BBC Africa Editor Fergal Keane said his understanding was that Mr Mugabe had agreed to resign, but then changed his mind. Our correspondent says the generals have no intention of forcing Mr Mugabe out by the barrel of a gun, and are happy to let the Zanu-PF carry out its procedures, working through impeachment if necessary. After the Mugabes, which African dynasties remain? Zimbabwe in 10 numbers Impeachment proceedings could be launched on Tuesday in parliament - but it is not clear how long this would take. Both the National Assembly and the Senate need to pass a vote by simple majority to begin the process, which is laid out in the constitution. This can either be on grounds of ""serious misconduct"", ""violation"" of the constitution or ""failure to obey, uphold or defend"" it, or ""incapacity"". The chambers must then appoint a joint committee to investigate removing the president. If the committee recommends impeachment, the president can then be removed if both houses back it with two-thirds majorities. The opposition MDC-T party has tried unsuccessfully to impeach Mr Mugabe in the past, but this time the ruling party - which has an overwhelming majority in both houses - is likely to go against him. This video can not be played Zimbabwe reacts: ""We need him to resign... our lives are terrible right now"" The advantage for the military is that if Mr Mugabe is impeached, it can claim that he was removed legally, and not by force. The problem for the generals is that the current vice-president would then take power. That is Phelekezela Mphoko, a supporter of Mr Mugabe's wife Grace. The military would prefer to install Emmerson Mnangagwa, the former vice-president who was briefly exiled. And it is still possible that Mr Mugabe could delay the process or cling to power by refusing to resign - and be forced into exile himself. The War Veterans Association, which used to back Mr Mugabe, now says it is time for him to step down. ""Thirty-seven years, you have had your time, you are toast now politically,"" Mr Mutsvangwa told the BBC. Opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said he was ""baffled"" by the president's address. ""He's playing a game. He has let the whole nation down,"" he told Reuters news agency. Mr Mugabe has led the country since it gained independence from Britain in 1980.

"Ex-Tory minister Anna Soubry says her office has received 13 death threats since a newspaper front page named her as one of 15 ""Brexit mutineers"". The pro-EU Remain supporter said the police took the threats seriously and had passed two cases to prosecutors. She said she had been ""really quite frightened"" and blamed the threats on Wednesday's Daily Telegraph front page. The paper's editor defended what he called ""the legitimate actions and language of a free press"". The story concerned Conservative MPs planning to rebel against the government's bid to enshrine the precise date of Brexit in law. May hopes MPs can 'come together' on Brexit Labour attacks Brexit date 'gimmick' Speaking on Broadcasting House on BBC Radio 4, Ms Soubry said her office had told her of the 13 death threats. ""That's just astonishing, isn't it?"" she said. ""The police take it seriously - it's not nice, it's not acceptable and it's not necessary.""

The government lost its majority at the general election and risks defeat when the Commons votes next month on the Brexit date issue. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Chancellor Philip Hammond said the government would not be withdrawing its plans to press ahead with the move, adding that Parliament was ""quite rightly"" debating the proposals as part of the EU (Withdrawal) Bill. The BBC has contacted the Daily Telegraph for a formal response.

It added: ""The individuals may disagree with that observation, but we were entitled to make it and we will see during the course of the next year whether there is any merit in it. ""But the accusations of bullying are absurd and shrill."" The article also pointed out that Ms Soubry had described her inclusion in the front page as a ""badge of honour"".

"Most of the victims were women and elderly people At least 15 people have been killed and five others wounded in a stampede in Morocco while food aid was distributed. The incident occurred in the town of Sidi Boulaalam in Essaouira province. The aid was being handed out by a private local charity. Some reports indicate that up to 40 people were injured in the crush. Local media reported that most of the victims were women and elderly people. Pictures on social media showed bodies of women laid out on the ground. Witnesses told local media that this year's annual food aid distribution at a local market in Sidi Boulaalam, an impoverished town with just over 8,000 inhabitants, attracted a larger crowd than usual. ""This year there were lots of people, several hundred people,"" a witness who asked to remain anonymous told AFP news agency. ""People shoved, they broke down the barriers,"" he said, adding that the injured had been evacuated to a hospital in Marrakesh. Morocco's interior ministry said that King Muhammed VI had instructed the local authorities to help those affected, adding that he would personally cover all medical and funeral costs. An unverified video shot by a bystander before the incident showed a large crowd gathered at the open-air market, waiting for the food distribution.

"This video can not be played German chancellor Angela Merkel said it was a day of ""deep reflection"" for Germany Talks on forming a coalition government in Germany have collapsed, leaving Angela Merkel facing her biggest challenge in 12 years as chancellor. The free-market liberal FDP pulled out after four weeks of talks with Mrs Merkel's CDU/CSU bloc and the Greens. FDP leader Christian Lindner said there was ""no basis of trust"" between them. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Germany was facing an unprecedented situation and that he would hold talks with all parties. He said this would include parties that not had been involved in the talks so far and called on politicians to work together and make compromises for the ""well-being"" of the country. He acknowledged rising concern in neighbouring countries about the situation. Earlier Mrs Merkel said she regretted the collapse. CDU deputy chairman Armin Laschet told journalists that Mrs Merkel had held a conference call on Monday morning with the party leadership and had retained its support. What are the options now? Why German election was a turning point Meanwhile, the Social Democrats, led by Martin Schulz, have again ruled out joining another grand coalition with Mrs Merkel's bloc. ""We are not afraid of new elections,"" Mr Schulz said. Mrs Merkel's bloc won September's poll, but many voters deserted the mainstream parties. ""As chancellor, I will do everything to ensure that this country is well managed in the difficult weeks to come,"" she said. Analysis by the BBC's Jenny Hill in Berlin This is - for post-war Germany - an unprecedented political crisis that could spell the end of the Merkel era. Weakened by a poor election result in September, the proposed coalition was Mrs Merkel's only shot at forming a new government. Germany will now - in all probability - have to go back to the ballot box. But it's not at all certain that Mrs Merkel's party will want her to lead them into a fresh election. The ensuing uncertainty has consequences beyond Germany. Mrs Merkel - who did not attend a summit of EU leaders in Sweden last week - will remain preoccupied with domestic affairs for some time yet. This was, she said last night, a time for deep reflection. Mrs Merkel must now fight for political survival. The leader who for so many people has represented stability now is fast becoming a symbol of crisis in the heart of Europe. It is not quite clear. The parties involved in the talks are reported to be deeply divided over tax, asylum and environmental policies. Although rumours had spread that a deal was close, the FDP's leader emerged from the venue in the middle of the night surrounded by his party colleagues and told reporters that the party was leaving the process. Christian Lindner outlined a string of problems his party had with the others He said that while the FDP knew it could not steer the course of the entire republic with just 11% of the vote, the parties involved in talks had ""no shared vision"" of how the country should be modernised, and four weeks of talks had left them with ""many inconsistencies, unanswered questions and conflicts"". ""It is better not to rule than to rule badly. Goodbye!"" Mr Lindner said. The co-leader of the Greens, Simone Peter, said the FDP had been ""irresponsible, dubious and calculating"". Her party colleague Katrin GÃ¶ring-Eckardt said the Greens had been ""ready to talk"" and found a ""much greater understanding"" with the CDU and FDP through the talks, especially over migration politics, climate change and agriculture. Mrs Merkel blamed differing cultures and styles for the collapse but said: ""We think we were on a path to finding a solution."" But a spokesman for her party, Stephan Mayer, told the BBC he did not think the FDP ever intended to join the coalition. ""I have the impression that... it was planned for a long time to quit the negotiations and not to form this coalition,"" he said. One of the sticking points is reported to be whether Syrian refugees should be allowed to bring family members to join them in Germany. Mrs Merkel's conservatives, mindful of the electoral success of the anti-Islam, anti-immigrant AfD, are cautious and want to extend a moratorium on allowing migrants to be reunited with their families. The FDP agree with them but the Greens say that the current freeze should be allowed to expire next year. Just how far to the right is AfD? Why so many voters in Germany's east chose AfD After winning its first parliamentary seats, AfD (Alternative for Germany) vowed to fight ""an invasion of foreigners"". There are a few options. Mrs Merkel could form a minority government, for instance with the Greens. But this would leave her having to patch together support for every vote - a big change for a leader who has been used to ruling as part of a grand coalition Some hope that despite Social Democrat (SPD) leader Martin Schulz again ruling it out, another grand coalition could still be agreed between Mrs Merkel's CDU/CSU block and the SPD, the second-largest party in parliament Or there could be fresh elections. These would need to be called by President Steinmeier, after a long drawn-out process that would take months. Analysts say new elections would be likely to benefit the AfD most, so other parties would probably try to avoid them France's President Emmanuel Macron, who alongside Mrs Merkel is a key player in the EU, said: ""It is not in our interest that the situation becomes tense."" A spokesman for his office said France was hoping for a ""strong and stable"" Germany. A spokesman for the UK Prime Minister Theresa May said the talks were a matter for German politicians. Margaritas Schinas, a spokeswoman for the European Commission, told reporters that she was confident Germany would keep having ""stability and continuity"" as provided for by the constitution. ""Uncertainty is poison for the economy,"" said JÃ¶rg KrÃ¤mer, the chief economist at Commerzbank. ""But the collapse of the talks can hardly be a shock for businesses after four agonising weeks of negotiations."" Merkel vows to win back right-wing voters German election: Why this is a turning point Why so many voters in Germany's east chose AfD Just how far to the right is AfD?

"Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, the man known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political cunning, achieved a long-held ambition to succeed Robert Mugabe as Zimbabwe's president in November last year. He has now won a disputed presidential election to legitimise his rule, promising voters his efforts to woo foreign investors will bring back the economy from the brink of collapse. Mr Mugabe resigned following a military takeover and mass demonstrations - all sparked by his sacking of Mr Mnangagwa as his vice-president. ""The crocodile"", who lived up to his name and snapped back, may have unseated Zimbabwe's only ruler, but he is also associated with some of the worst atrocities committed under the ruling Zanu-PF party since independence in 1980. One veteran of the liberation struggle, who worked with him for many years, once put it simply: ""He's a very cruel man, very cruel."" But his children see him as a principled, if unemotional, man. His daughter, Farai Mlotshwa - a property developer and the eldest of his nine children by two wives - told BBC Radio 4 that he was a ""softie"". As if to reinforce this softer image of the new leader, a cuddly crocodile soft toy was passed among the Zanu-PF supporters who welcomed him back to the country after Mr Mugabe's resignation. Emmerson Mnangagwa is known as ""Ngwena"", the Shona word for crocodile And what he lacks in charisma and oratory prowess, he makes up for in pragmatism, says close friend and Zanu-PF politician Josiah Hungwe. ""Mnangagwa is a practical person. He is a person who recognises that politics is politics but people must eat,"" he told the BBC, adding that reforming Zimbabwe's disastrous economy will be the focus of his leadership. This video can not be played Emmerson Mnangagwa: Who is the man known as the âcrocodileâ? Known as ""the crocodile"" because of his political shrewdness - his Zanu-PF faction is ""Lacoste"" Received military training in China and Egypt Tortured by Rhodesian forces after his ""crocodile gang"" staged attacks Helped direct Zimbabwe's war of independence in the 1960s and 1970s Became the country's spymaster during the 1980s civil conflict, in which thousands of civilians were killed, but has denied any role in the massacres Accused of masterminding attacks on opposition supporters after 2008 election Says he will deliver jobs, and seen as open to economic reforms Survived several alleged assassination attempts, blamed on Mugabe supporters Find out more on BBC Radio 4's Profile. The exact year of Mr Mnangagwa's birth is not known - but he is thought to be 75, which would make him nearly 20 years younger than his predecessor who left power aged 93. Born in the central region of Zvishavane, he is a Karanga - the largest clan of Zimbabwe's majority Shona community. Some Karangas felt it was their turn for power, following 37 years of domination by Mr Mugabe's Zezuru clan, though Mr Mnangagwa was accused of profiting while under Mr Mugabe. According to a United Nations report in 2001, he was seen as ""the architect of the commercial activities of Zanu-PF"". This largely related to the operations of the Zimbabwean army and businessmen in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Zimbabwean troops intervened in the DR Congo conflict on the side of the government and, like those of other countries, were accused of using the conflict to loot some of its rich natural resources such as diamonds, gold and other minerals. More recently military officials - many behind his rise to power -have been accused of benefiting from the rich Marange diamond fields in eastern Zimbabwe, with reports of killings and human rights abuses there. Despite his money-raising role, Mr Mnangagwa, a lawyer who grew up in Zambia, was not always well-loved by the rank and file of his own party. A Zanu-PF official posed an interesting question when asked about Mr Mnangagwa's prospects: ""You think Mugabe is bad, but have you thought that whoever comes after him could be even worse?"" The opposition candidate who defeated Mr Mnangagwa in the 2000 parliamentary campaign in Kwekwe Central, Blessing Chebundo, might agree. During a bitter campaign, Mr Chebundo escaped death by a whisker when the Zanu-PF youths who had abducted him and doused him with petrol were unable to light a match. Those who fought in Zimbabwe's war of independence have long monopolised power Mr Mnangagwa's fearsome reputation was made during the civil war which broke out in the 1980s between Mr Mugabe's Zanu party and the Zapu party of Joshua Nkomo. As national security minister, he was in charge of the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), which worked hand in glove with the army to suppress Zapu. Thousands of civilians - mainly ethnic Ndebeles, seen as Zapu supporters - were killed in a campaign known as Gukurahundi, before the two parties merged to form Zanu-PF. Among countless other atrocities carried out by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade of the army, villagers were forced at gunpoint to dance on the freshly dug graves of their relatives and chant pro-Mugabe slogans. Mr Mnangagwa has denied any role in the massacres, but the wounds are still painful and many party officials, not to mention voters, in Matabeleland might find it hard to back Mr Mnangagwa. He does enjoy the support of many of the war veterans who led the campaign of violence against the white farmers and the opposition from 2000. They remember him as one of the men who, following his military training in China and Egypt, directed the fight for independence in the 1960s and 1970s. He also attended the Beijing School of Ideology, run by the Chinese Communist Party. Mr Mnangagwa's official profile says he was the victim of state violence after being arrested by the white-minority government in the former Rhodesia in 1965, when the ""crocodile gang"" he led helped blow up a train near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo). ""He was tortured, severely resulting in him losing his sense of hearing in one ear,"" the profile says. ""Part of the torture techniques involved being hanged with his feet on the ceiling and the head down. The severity of the torture made him unconscious for days."" As he said he was under 21 at the time, he was not executed but instead sentenced to 10 years in prison. ""He has scars from that period. He was young and brave,"" a close friend of Mr Mnangagwa once said, asking not to be named. ""Perhaps that explains why he is indifferent. Horrible things happened to him when he was young."" Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? The crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Zimbabwe's exiled white farmers return Snapping at the heels of Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' The age factor His ruthlessness, which it could be argued he learnt from his Rhodesian torturers, is said to have been seen again in 2008 when he reportedly masterminded Zanu-PF's response to Mr Mugabe losing the first round of the president election to long-time rival Morgan Tsvangirai. The military and state security organisations unleashed a campaign of violence against opposition supporters, leaving hundreds dead and forcing thousands from their homes. Mr Tsvangirai then pulled out of the second round and Mr Mugabe was re-elected. Mr Mnangagwa has not commented on allegations he was involved in planning the violence, but an insider in the party's security department later confirmed that he was the political link between the army, intelligence and Zanu-PF. He was seen as Mr Mugabe's right-hand man - that is until the former first lady Grace Mugabe became politically ambitious and tried to edge him out. Their rivalry took a bizarre turn when he fell ill in August 2017 at a political rally led by former President Mugabe and had to be airlifted to South Africa. Grace Mugabe (right) bit off more than she could chew by taking on Mr Mnangagwa His supporters suggested that a rival group within Zanu-PF had poisoned him and appeared to blame ice cream from Mrs Mugabe's dairy firm. In his first words to cheering supporters after Mr Mugabe's resignation, he spoke about this plot and another plan to ""eliminate"" him. He has also blamed a group linked to the former first lady for an explosion in June at a Zanu-PF rally in Bulawayo in which two people died. But in a BBC interview, he said the country was safe, told foreign investors not to worry and sought to dispel his ruthless reputation: ""I am as soft as wool. I am a very soft person in life."" This video can not be played Mnangagwa: Criminal will be hounded down, but Zimbabwe is safe His youngest son, a Harare DJ known as St Emmo, blames his reticence for his fearsome reputation. ""He was a good father, very very strict. He doesn't say much and I think that's what frightens people - like: 'What is he thinking?'"" Nick Mangwana, Zanu-PF representative in the UK, accepts that the Zimbabwe's new leader is ""not the most eloquent"". ""He's not pally-pally but more of a do-er, more of a technocrat."" But in his six months in power he has fully embraced Twitter and Facebook - after the Bulawayo blast he posted a message reiterating the strength his Christian faith gives him.

Fixing the economy is what is paramount now. Zimbabweans are on average 15% poorer now than they were in the 1980s.

"Schoolchildren formed this mosaic of Robert Mugabe at independence day celebrations in April President Robert Mugabe's non-resignation speech will have puzzled many - why didn't the army just force him to resign at the barrel of a gun, or arrest him? It tells us two things. Firstly, this was political theatre. Everyone involved is desperate to preserve a veneer of constitutionality about the whole process, so they want him to step down and hand power to his successor, presumablyEmmerson Mnangagwa. But it was also more than spectacle. President Mugabe's opponents want to treat the elder statesman with dignity. This video can not be played Robert Mugabe: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"" As in much of Africa, respecting your elders is ingrained in Zimbabwe's culture. And 93-year-old Robert Mugabe, a liberation fighter who became the country's leader at independence in 1980, is seen as the father of the nation. It explains the respectful tone used by opposition leader and bitter rival Morgan Tsvangirai when calling for President Mugabe's resignation. He said Mr Mugabe should step down ""in line with the national expectation and sentiment, taking full regard of his legacy and contribution to Zimbabwe pre and post-independence"". By Kim Chakanetsa, BBC Focus on Africa There is a great weight placed on respecting your elders in Shona culture, which is Zimbabwe's biggest ethnic group.  It is one of the fundamental values. At a young age you are taught to greet, speak and interact with elders in a particular manner. For example, when arriving at someone's house, an exchange of greetings will be led by the younger party, who must enquire about the health of every adult present. For girls or women, this could involve kneeling and clapping, then asking each individual in turn about their health. Boys and men will do much the same, but crouching. Failing to do so is frowned upon, and taken as a sign of a poor upbringing or lack of respect. Within the household, grandparents wield considerable influence. This reverence for elders extends beyond your family. Any older woman or man is to be treated in the same way. President Mugabe still commands the respect of the army leadership because of his liberation war credentials in the fight against white-minority rule in the 1960s and 1970s. His government's early achievements in improving access to healthcare and raising literacy rates were feted in the 1980s. But in recent years the collapse of Zimbabwe's economy, the violent crackdowns on political opposition and raids on white-owned farms have severely damaged Mr Mugabe's reputation. This is especially true in the international community, where some see him as nothing more than a despot. But while Zimbabweans have been the ones to suffer first-hand, many still feel a lingering respect for the man who delivered them independence.

"Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe resigned last year after almost four decades in power. Now, the country is approaching its first post-Mugabe election, with his successor Emmerson Mnangagwa and MDC Alliance candidate Nelson Chamisa the two front-runners in a field of 23 candidates. Here are 10 numbers that will help you understand how the country got to where it is now. Robert Mugabe, who led the country's liberation movement, was in power from independence in 1980 until he was ousted in November last year at the age of 93. His years in office, first as prime minister until the switch to a presidential system in 1987, were marked by economic turmoil and the crushing of dissent. Both Robert Mugabe (L) and Emmerson Mnangagwa (R) are from the ruling Zanu-PF party Emmerson Mnangagwa is his successor - nicknamed the ""crocodile"" because of political cunning. Once a Mugabe loyalist, he promises to revive the shattered economy and hopes to win elections on 30 July to legitimise his presidency. Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? The 'crocodile' who snapped back Zimbabwe's political crusader Zimbabwe's economy has struggled since a controversial land reform programme was introduced in 2000. The programme that saw white-owned farms redistributed to landless black Zimbabweans - and those with good political connections - led to sharp falls in production. As the country's central bank printed money to try to get out of the crisis, rampant inflation took hold. Although the World Bank does not have figures for 2008 and 2009, numbers from Zimbabwe's central bank showed annual inflation reached 231 million % in July 2008. Officials gave up reporting monthly statistics when it peaked at just under 80 billion % in mid-November 2008. The country was forced to abandon its own currency a year later at a rate of Z$35 quadrillion to US$1. More on post-Mugabe Zimbabwe: The political crusader taking on Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? The political and economic crises between 2000 and 2008 nearly halved Zimbabwe's GDP -the biggest contraction in a peacetime economy, according to the World Bank.,external A brief period of recovery between 2009 and 2012 has now faltered and the economy faces serious challenges, says the World Bank. Growth has slowed sharply from an average 8% from 2009 to 2012, caused by shifts in trade and a series of major droughts. Mr Mugabe always blamed Zimbabwe's economic problems on a plot by Western countries, led by the UK, to oust him because of his seizure of white-owned farms. Zimbabwe's exiled white farmers return The country's political and economic crises have resulted in high poverty rates. The hard years between 2000 and 2008 saw poverty rates increase tomore than 72%, according to the World Bank.,externalIt also left a fifth of the population in extreme poverty. Extreme poverty, estimated to have fallen from 2009 to 2014, is now projected to have risen again substantially. About 27% of children under the age of five suffer stunted growth, with 9% severely stunted because of poor nutrition, the2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey report revealed.,external But poverty in Zimbabwe is still lower than in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, where about41% of the population were living on less than $1.90 a day,externalin 2013, World Bank data suggests. Estimates of the country's unemployment levels vary wildly. The World Bank's modelled estimates, based on International Labour Organisation data, puts the figureas low as 5% in 2016,external, while Zimbabwe's biggest trade union claimedthe jobless rate was as high as 90% last year.,external Many people try to make a living by vending as they cannot find employment However, the World Bank's definition only covers those actively seeking work. Many of those not counted may not seek a job despite wanting one because they ""view job opportunities as limited, or because they have restricted labour mobility, or face discrimination, or structural, social or cultural barriers"". The CIA World Factbook estimates the rate was95% in 2009, but says current figures are not known.,external Thanks to large investments in education since independence, Zimbabwe has one of the highest adult literacy rates in Africa, with89% of the adult population literate,external, according to World Bank data from 2014. Globally, the literacy rate stood at 86% in 2016, while in sub-Saharan Africa it was 64%. Almost all women and men aged 15-49 have had at least some primary education,according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey.,externalMore than 70% of people aged 15-49 have also attended secondary school. Zimbabwe has the sixth highest HIV prevalence rate in sub-Saharan Africa, with 1.3 million people living with HIV in 2016,according to UNAids.,external However, after a peak in 1997, rates are declining. According to the UN, this is a result of successful campaigns encouraging condom use as well as programmes preventing the transmission of infection from mother to child. Treatment and support services have also improved. Making decent burials affordable Life expectancy fell in the 1990s, with the HIV/Aids epidemic a major killer. It dropped from a high of just under 61 years in 1986 to 44.1 years in 2003. It is now steadily improving again, but with unemployment and poverty endemic and HIV/Aids rates still high, it remained at just 60 in 2015, according to World Bank data. Will age be a factor in Zimbabwe's poll? Mobile devices are the leading communication tool for Zimbabweans. But while most have a mobile phone, only 43% of households have a radio, 37% have a television and 10% have a computer,according to the 2015 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey.,external After a growth spurt after independence in 1980, a decline in birth rates and a rise in death rates saw population growth slide downwards. With high outward migration rates also high, the population has not recovered its post-independence growth. Written and produced by Lucy Rodgers. Robert Mugabe - hero or villain?
