"There are many indicators against which patients can judge the performance of the NHS. But historically, the totemic benchmark of the quality of service provided by hospitals is the number of people waiting for surgery and how long they have to wait. Waiting times for non-urgent surgery were the subject of fierce political debate for much of the last two decades, but recently they faded in importance as targets have been met. That could now be changing as waiting lists grow longer in the different health systems across the UK and the human cost of delayed surgery becomes more apparent. Media and political attention has focused on the four-hour benchmark for being treated or assessed in A&E. The King's Fund think tank believes the number of patients waiting for operations in England will soon top four million - for the first time in nearly a decade -  and that could prove to be the tipping point for public and political opinion. Cutting waiting lists was a key promise by New Labour ahead of its election victory in 1997.  Remember the pledge card brandished by Tony Blair and his colleagues? Labour delivered its policy of reducing numbers waiting for operations by 100,000, and then, in 2008, went further by introducing the 18-week target. That established a right for patients to start consultant-led treatment within 18 weeks of being referred by a GP, with a benchmark of 92% of patients seen in that time. The 18-week target and fines regime, which was refined in 2012, was widely seen as an effective incentive to hospitals to cut waiting times for patients. Tony Blair pledged to cut waiting lists during the 1997 election campaign Hospitals on average managed to hit and exceed the 92% standard, but that all changed in early 2016 when performance slipped below that target. Analysis of NHS England data reveals that the number of patients waiting more than 18 weeks for non-urgent surgery has more than doubled in the four years to November 2016. That is a much faster rate of increase that the number who start treatment in under 18 weeks and faster still than the rate of growth of NHS operations across the board. Hospital chiefs and health experts say increasing waiting times are an inevitable consequence of NHS budgets lagging behind increases in patient demand. When emergency admissions are rising, and with a finite number of beds, something has to give. Delayed transfers of care make the task of finding beds even harder. Patients waiting for routine surgery and procedures are the ones who lose out. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have different target regimes for waiting lists. All have seen sharp increases in the number of long waits between 2012 and 2016. Wales has not hit its target since 2010 and the NHS in Scotland has been adrift since June 2014. The pressures on resources and the ability to deliver timely routine treatment are similar across the UK. Without an injection of more cash it is hard to see how the waiting list situation will improve, given the stresses and strains on all forms of care across the NHS. Cancellations of routine surgery over Christmas and early January will contribute to the deterioration. Waiting lists are still a lot shorter than at the worst points in the 1990s and at times over the following decade. But the question now is whether patients begin to feel that what they get from their local hospital, unless they are seriously ill, is falling well short of their expectations.

"This video can not be played ""I remember... looking at Roger Dodds with his big bunch of keys, locking the door, and that was horrifying"", one victim said Predatory sex offender Roger Dodds was left free to abuse his victims by Sheffield City Council despite bosses having known about his offending for years, BBC News has found. Dodds, who was jailed earlier for 16 years after pleading guilty to four counts of indecent assault, was allowed to operate as an employee of the council ""without sufficient challenge, accountability or consequences"", a council-commissioned report found. Council officials not only knew about his behaviour, but also failed to report his activities to police and gave him early retirement with an enhanced pension. Kenny Dale, who was abused by Dodds in the early 1990s and has waived his right to anonymity, said: ""I was the victim of a horrible man and the council are to blame for that."" Sheffield City Council said it ""accepted responsibility"" and was ""deeply sorry"" Dodds had been allowed to commit these offences while in its employment. Dodds abused at least one man while heading up the council's Grants and Awards Department Dodds, now 81, was employed in 1975 to head the council's Grants and Awards Department. The unit was responsible for providing financial support to students attending college or university. However, Dodds used his position to sexually abuse young men, typically in their late teens. One victim, who did not want to be named, said he was assaulted during their very first meeting. He told the BBC: ""Dodds was asking me things about my studies, and, very gradually, his left hand started to feel its way into my right jeans pocket. When that started to happen, I just became frozen and unable to move."" According to former colleagues, Dodds was part of a club that operated within the council swapping hardcore pornographic magazines in internal envelopes and screening adult films in a basement room. He was first investigated by Sheffield City Council in the early 1980s after a series of allegations were made against him. The complaints gave one employee the courage to tell managers about the abuse he had been subjected to. Richard Rowe said he grew to fear turning up for work as a result of his abuse at the hands of Dodds Richard Rowe, who has also waived his legal right to anonymity, said he was subjected to ""terrifying"" assaults over an 18-month period. However, he said when he told bosses what was happening, he was told to stay quiet. ""They asked for specifics and I gave them as much details as I could bring myself to voice. But they knew, they knew exactly,"" he said. ""At the end of the interview it was, 'there is nothing more to tell us, so go back to the office and you do not speak about this inside or outside the building'.  I clearly remember that warning."" Following the investigation, Dodds was moved to a position working with schools. An investigation carried out for Sheffield City Council, and seen by the BBC, said he was given ""substantial unregulated and unsupervised access to schools"". The report continues that ""there appears to have been no disciplinary consequences to his behaviour at the time"". Nor was his transfer a chastening experience for Dodds. Kenny Dale said he blamed the council for failing to stop Dodds Mr Dale began working at the council in the early 1990s and, despite warnings from colleagues, applied for a post working alongside Dodds. ""Everyone told me not to go for it,"" he said, ""[but] I didn't think that kind of behaviour would be allowed"". He said Dodds began touching him inappropriately almost immediately and continued to do so despite his objections and the lack of challenge from managers. Another investigation by the local authority was launched and in 1993 Roger Dodds left the council. However, despite Mr Dale's insistence Dodds should not be given a payoff, he was given an early retirement package that included an enhanced pension. Mr Dale said he blames the council for the abuse he suffered. ""The council are so responsible, more responsible than he was,"" he said. Roger Dodds was the subject of two internal investigations while working for Sheffield City Council Following the second internal investigation officials concluded a criminal investigation should have been launched. In 2008, one of Dodds' victims went to South Yorkshire Police with his allegations. However, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to prosecute at the time - a CPS spokesman said its files did not contain details on why that decision was taken. Dodds was eventually charged in 2016 after another complainant came forward in 2014. The police investigation prompted the council to commission consultants to investigate how it had handled Dodds. The 2008 review concluded: ""It was clearly wrong that Dodds should receive early retirement. He was not subject to any official sanction by the council for his alleged behaviour."" The 28-page dossier also revealed repeated failures by the council, describing the authority's action as clearly unacceptable not just by present-day standards but by the policies and legislation in place at the time. It conceded the council did not know how many other victims there might be. Its conclusion was damning, stating: ""The actions of Roger Dodds have caused enormous distress to his victims, and the city council has been complicit in allowing Dodds to operate apparently without sufficient challenge, accountability or consequences.""

"Eddie Jones is a lucky coach. He is lucky with the talent he has in key positions, he is lucky with the funds and facilities created for him and he is lucky that no other nation save New Zealand has the same strength in depth sitting on their replacements' bench. But there is nothing lucky at all about how he utilises all of those to forge an England team that has already set new records and may yet set more impressive ones still. It wasn't hard to see where England were going wrong in the first half against France. It was everywhere you looked. A first line-out so bad it hit the back of Dan Cole's head. A yellow card for a tackle that was unnecessary and illegal. An inability to dent the blue defensive wall with ball in hand, a problem stopping the waves of French runners coming at them from deep and wide and fast. The difficulty lay in working out what to do about it and how to make that plan work. Report: England 19-16 France Relive Saturday's Six Nations action Ugly display, beautiful result - Jones No Vunipolas to add muscle and metres made. No Chris Robshaw to slow the progress of a French back row charging and offloading like a French back row of old. An opposition liberated from the stylistic straightjacket of recent torpid years, and a Twickenham crowd silenced by unexpected uncertainty and fear. Any coach could have torn into their team after a first 40 minutes as scrambled as that. Not so many could have sent them out again after half-time clear of mind and confident in their ability to turn that slump into success. Fewer still could have made not just the right changes to personnel but customised the positional and tactical ones so shrewdly too. With 18 minutes to go, England were much improved but still four points down, Rabah Slimani's offload-inspired try threatening to end France's 12-year wait for a win in south-west London and mark the Six Nations' opening day with a second shock to match that ofScotland's thrilling win over Ireland. Off came Joe Launchbury. On came James Haskell into the back row, forward went Maro Itoje into the second row. More pace. More power. Five minutes later, George Ford and Jonathan Joseph off, Ben Te'o and Jack Nowell on, Owen Farrell to fly-half, Elliot Daly to inside centre. More power still, now pace spilling out everywhere, now a dynamism and drive and the sound from the stands of belief and excitement too. Quick ball, sharper minds. Farrell found Te'o, Te'o found a soft opposition shoulder and the try-line opened up in front of him. This video can not be played Jones salutes 'ugly' England win ""I always thought we were going to win,"" said Jones afterwards. ""I thought we were awful, but I always thought we were going to win."" There were not many others so sure in the moment, fewer yet who could have prevented even subconscious anxiety and anger from transmitting itself to the players on the pitch. France had three men - Scott Spedding, Virimi Vakatawa and Louis Picamoles - who all made over 120 metres with ball in hand. Northampton number eight Picamoles, not content with being as hard and lumpy and slippery to stop as an iceberg, also carried the ball 15 times, beat seven defenders, made five tackles, offloaded four times and won a turnover too. France made 591 metres to England's 383, made 10 line breaks to their opponents' five and beat 24 defenders to England's 13. Those are hard numbers to turn your way. Tough too was the blocking tackle Farrell put in on Picamoles as the number eight thundered into the England half with the game still in the balance, and harder still does it become with each passing performance not to see Farrell as not just Jones' epitome on the pitch but his skipper in waiting too. Jamie George is putting his own pressure on Dylan Hartley, even if the incumbent captain and hooker is still understandably rusty after his most recent lengthy suspension. Farrell, four from five from the tee on Saturday, hitting the post with his other pot, is increasingly making an unarguable case either way. The best coaches have a leader on the pitch who shares their outlook, intensity and approach. Legendary Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson had it best in outstanding midfielder Roy Keane: never a backward step, always pushing for better, intimidated by no-one and no situation. Jones loves Hartley's obduracy. He appreciates his aggression, when it is focused and snarling just the right side of illegality. Roy Keane captained Sir Alex Ferguson's Manchester United side to a historic treble in 1999 In Farrell's goal-kicking he sees a weapon that keeps better teams within reach and turns tight games his way. In the 25-year-old's youth he sees a man who will be at his physical peak at the next World Cup. In the apparent absence of self-doubt he sees a reflection of his own confident character. Farrell is not as instinctive with ball in hand as his childhood friend and team-mate George Ford. He is not infallible with the boot, although he can sometimes make it look mighty close. In a match like this, described afterwards by Jones asan ugly performance but a beautiful result,he is the backbone and the brains too: implacable, unshakeable, the on-field general who drags others along with him. Jones isn't perfect. ""I take full responsibility,"" he told the BBC on Saturday after the sub-par performance. ""I didn't prepare them well enough."" Neither are his team, even if they have won more matches in a row - 15 - than any other England side in history. If he can solve problems, he must also be growing sick of the slow starts that cause them. And he is certainly lucky. But so too are England, to have a coach who can take what he has been given and turn it into something better, who has set new standards and is still nowhere close to being satisfied.

Referee Craig Thomson has been criticised by St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright FT: St Johnstone 2-5 Celtic Brendan Rodgerswas short and sweet. Those dastardly stole him for so long. But the Celtic manager was obviously delighted with the win. ""I thought we played well in the first half, but I thought we could have defended better,"" he said. ""However, I knew we had won 4-2 here earlier in the season and our fitness always come through late in games and we scored some wonderful goals. ""Tommy will be disappointed. We got a bit of a rub of the green, but after that we were really fast and clinical - the last goal was sensational."" FT: St Johnstone 2-5 Celtic  Brendan Rodgers: what can you say about him? He got close to the Premier League title a few years ago with Liverpool and you can see why he got close Mark Burchill, Former Celtic striker on BBC Radio Scotland @bbcsportscot & facebook.com/bbcsportscotland Colm Kilbane: Thomson had a shocker. As a Celtic fan, I prefer when my team wins fair and square. That wasn't fair on the Saints. Ryan Kenny: Craig Thompson, get him dropped - worst decision ever. Handed Celtic that the day shockingÂ Gee McCabe: Fantastic second half. Unstoppable!!! Â Stephen Stockman: That lad Dembele, quite good at football. Â FT: St Johnstone 2-5 Celtic St Johnstone manager Tommy WrightÂ has been measured in his response but has been highly critical of referee Craig Thomson. ""We should have had two penalties,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""I am not going to sit on the fence. ""When he (Scott Brown) makes contact with the player (Danny Swanson) and not a ball, that's a penalty, and he doesn't give it. ""Then Joe Shaughnessy is dragged down when the ball is in the air in the penalty box. ""As for Celtic's penalty, I genuinely don't know how he could give it. It has hit his hip and could have touched his elbow, but I don't know how he could have seen it. ""That should not happen at this level of football. And that has happened twice now - when Brown pushed Anderson the other week. ""Granted, Celtic could go on to win the game without that decision as they have so much talent. ""But the decision changes the whole dynamics of the game. ""Regarding my players, I don't think they could have given me any more, but regarding the officials they could have."" FT: St Johnstone 2-5 Celtic We are now waiting for the managers. St Johnstone's Tommy Wright is no doubt taking his time to calm down. You can now read Chris McLaughlin's impressions of the match at McDiarmid Park. Moussa Dembele scores a hat-trick as Celtic beat St Johnstone and go 27 points clear at the top of the Premiership. FT: St Johnstone 2-5 Celtic Moussa Dembele was only on the park for the final 30 minutes after his return from injury. However, his clinical hat-trick takes the French striker's tally for the season to 23 goals. Moussa Dembele (right) scored a hat-trick after coming on as a sub FT: St Johnstone 2-5 Celtic  We don't want to be talking about penalties when a team like Celtic are playing so well, but the referee has made a couple of bad mistakes Mark Burchill, Former Celtic striker on BBC Radio Scotland FT: St Johnstone 2-5 Celtic  Craig Thomson should be embarrassed about his performance after two critical decisions, but it is a sign of a good team to be ruthless Willie Miller, BBC Radio Scotland pundit FT: St Johnstone 2-5 Celtic Chris McLaughlinBBC Sport Scotland at McDiarmid Park  Dembele and Sinclair are so clinical when it counts.  FT: St Johnstone 2-5 Celtic Celtic stretch their lead at the top of the table to 27 points over Aberdeen. That's their 23rd straight domestic victory and they are six short of their club record of 25 consecutive wins in the league. Brendan Rodgers' side have now gone 29 domestic games unbeaten since the start of the season, stretching that new club record. FT: St Johnstone 2-5 Celtic There's a bit of afters as Mikael Lustig confronts St Johnstone midfielder Liam Craig forehead to forehead and the Celtic defender goes into the referee's book. Meanwhile, referee Craig Thomson is booed off the park by the home support, angry at that penalty decision.  St Johnstone 2-5 Celtic  St Johnstone will have a sense of grievance, but Celtic have been wonderful in this second half Willie Miller, BBC Radio Scotland pundit St Johnstone 2-5 Celtic Nadir Ciftci has come on for Celtic - the Turkish striker's first appearance since an early-season Champions League qualifier - and replaces Patrick Roberts. Liam Craig is on for St Johnstone, replacing Danny Swanson. Moussa Dembele Celtic are showboating now and two back-heels inside the penalty box from Mikael Lustig and Callum McGregor and Moussa Dembele fires home from 14 yards for a quick-fire hat-trick.Â The Frenchman has only been on the park for 20 minutes. St Johnstone 2-4 Celtic That unbeaten run - indeed, their winning run - looks likely to keep rolling on unless there is a major upset in the dying minutes. @bbcsportscot & facebook.com/bbcsportscotland  Allow Twitter content?

"James Bond director Guy Hamilton, pictured here on the set of Goldfinger, was a secret agent during World War Two That James Bond creator Ian Fleming drew literary inspiration from his wartime work in espionage is relatively well known. But the heroic World War Two exploits of the director of Bond films including Goldfinger and Live and Let Die are less well documented. Guy Hamilton, who grew up in France but was sent to boarding school to England, made an early foray into the film industry in the late 1930s, but after fleeing France at the outbreak of war his film-making career had to be put on hold while he joined the effort to defeat Nazi Germany. In June 1944, he found himself in the sort of dire straits that would have challenged Bond himself. On a mission to drop French secret agents in Brittany, Lt Hamilton and his crew of two sailors became stranded in a place crawling with German soldiers. Under cover of darkness, Hamilton and his crew had rowed to shore from his navy ship in a small surfboat to drop off the agents. But when he headed back the ship had gone. There was no way of returning home. Hamilton ran covert high-speed motor gun and torpedo boats out of Dartmouth for the Royal Navy's 15th Flotilla Hamilton used the Shelburne Line, one of a series of crucial Allied escape routes that crisscrossed occupied France Plymouth's Honorary French Consul Alain Sibril, who was born in Brittany and whose grandfather was part of the local Resistance, said: ""This was shortly after D-Day, it was extremely, extremely dangerous. ""You can imagine it was a terrible place to be stuck."" Who will be the next 007?,external Train like James Bond Did a woman inspire Ian Fleming's James Bond? Speaking to BBC Inside Out before hisdeath last year, Hamilton said the events of that time were still etched on his memory: ""My worries were to get rid of the surfboat and to try and get as far away form the beach as possible."" He spent several days on the run with two other sailors, evading German patrols and navigating minefields. They were eventually rescued by the French Resistance and sheltered in a safe house run by Anne Ropers. Hamilton (right) spent a month in Brittany pretending to be a Frenchman to avoid detection Anne Ropers hid Hamilton and two other agents for about a month In an interview before she died last year Mrs Ropers, then 97, said: ""They stayed in my parents' room. At night, Guy was in one bed and the sailors in the other. ""By day, all three of them spent their time lying on their beds, so that they did not make any noise."" Mr Sibril said: ""Had the Germans discovered Guy Hamilton and his fellow sailors, this would have been extremely dangerous. Not only for them, but also for the whole network of Resistance fighters."" Marguerite Pierre, 92, was another Resistance member who helped Lt Hamilton. She said: ""We were told by our commander that we risked either deportation or being shot in the field. We knew what the risks were."" Hamilton managed to send a message back to his naval crew in Dartmouth telling them he was safe One night Hamilton's cover was almost blown, when members of the Resistance took him for a boozy game of boules. He said: ""They took me down the road to a cafe that had a bowling alley in the back. ""Well that was alright except that it was full of Germans all in uniform, having a drink. And the lads said 'can we have the bowling alley after you Fritz?', and they said 'yes, yes'â¦ I was appalled and horrified."" Mrs Ropers said: ""Each team bought the other a jug of cider. The Germans bought a jug of cider for the Englishman and vice versa."" Sir Roger Moore said Hamilton ""was very much a James Bond character himself"" Hamilton would recall these experiences while directing James Bond films, as 007 actor Sir Roger Moore recalls. He said: ""He did tell me that he was once dropped into Nazi-occupied France and, being separated from his squad, found himself in a fairly sticky situation in a French village teeming with German soldiers. ""By virtue of speaking fluent French he was able to pull the wool over the Germans' eyes in a bar by pretending to be a local, and he was obviously very convincing."" For nearly a month Hamilton managed to avoid detection before escaping back to safety in England. Ten days later the escape route used by the Resistance was uncovered by the Nazis. After the war Guy Hamilton worked in the film industry training under Carol Reed The first Bond film he directed was Goldfinger in 1964 Hamilton directed a series of war films including Battle of Britain in 1969 He lived in Majorca until his death last year, aged 93 Hamilton would be awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his gallantry. After the war he returned to the film industry, training under legendary director Carol Reed on movies such as The Third Man, later directing blockbusters including The Colditz Story and Battle of Britain, as well as four Bond movies - Goldfinger, Diamonds are Forever, The Man with the Golden Gun and Live and Let Die. And for Moore, Hamilton's experiences in the Royal Navy informed the way he helped to bring Bond to life on the silver screen. ""Guy was very much a James Bond character himself,"" the actor said. ""He always knew what was believable and how far he could take audiences - and that was based on both his film-making experience and real wartime exploits.""

"In Cambodia's capital, motorbike taxis are everywhere - but it's extremely rare to see women drivers transporting tourists. Those who do are judged harshly. Katya Cengel meets the young entrepreneur trying to change that. When they show up at a Phnom Penh hotel in their tight red T-shirts and skinny jeans, people tend to get the wrong idea about Renou Chea and her fellow Moto Girl Tour guides. ""They think we're not 'good girls',"" says Renou, a slight 26-year-old with long dark hair. ""They think we're 'bad girls'."" It is an important distinction to make in Cambodia, where women who associate with foreigners are often assumed to be ""bad girls"" - or women who work in the sex trade. ""Sometimes they think that when we hang out with the men, it's just like for sex or something like that,"" adds her sister, Raksmey Chea, 23. The Moto Girl Tour website doesn't help, offering motorbike tours of Cambodia's capital by ""young and beautiful lady drivers"". Because theyareall young and beautiful, Renou doesn't understand why advertising this might seem strange. What is strange, at least in this South East Asian country, is women driving tourists. It just isn't done, says Siv Cheng, owner of Phnom Penh-based CS Travel. ""Mostly, you see, all moto (taxi) drivers are male,"" says Cheng. Left to right: Sreynich Horm, Raksmey Chea and Renou Chea Many women drive the little Vespa scooters and Hyundai motorbikes that zip around the city - everyone does - but they don't usually carry tourists. Renou got the idea after an aunt told her about schoolgirls offering a moto taxi service in Thailand. Having ridden a motorbike since high school, and having studied English in college, Renou figured showing tourists around her city would be a fun way to earn money. Having also studied accounting, she no doubt saw a good business opportunity as well. In 2015 almost five million tourists travelled to Cambodia, according to the Cambodian Ministry of Tourism. Renou recruited her younger sister and Sreynich Horm, 22 - both as petite and pretty as Renou - and occasionally a fourth woman to be Moto Girl Tour guides. But before they took their first tourists on board their bikes in early 2016, they had to convince their families that they would be safe. Horm's father worried that a foreigner riding behind her could touch her and do other things to her - things ""good"" virgin girls should not have done to them. To make sure they kept their reputations safe, the women established a rule - no holding on to the guide, hold the handlebar on the seat behind you instead. When they have night tours and tours outside the city they team up. Still, friends and family often worry about the women carrying around large foreigners. At 4ft 9in (1.45m) and 6st 5lb (40kg), Renou is the ""tall"" Moto Girl. Her Vespa is more than twice her weight, but she gets upset when people think she can't handle it or heavy loads. For years she has been helping her father with his grocery store by making deliveries on her Vespa. Plus, as a woman, she believes she is actually a safer driver, something Hong Ly, guest relations' manager at Mito Hotel agrees with. Renou would like to see more female travellers in Cambodia ""Tourists like girls who drive slow, not weave in and out of traffic,"" said Ly, who keeps a stack of Moto Girl Tour brochures on her desk. The Moto Girls may be on to something. In early 2016 Vespa Adventures motorbike tour-company opened a branch in Phnom Penh and began hiring both male and female drivers, says Alex Meldrum, manager of the Phnom Penh branch. An American man founded the original Vespa Adventures in Vietnam. But a Cambodian woman who plans to hire mainly female drivers in the group's other Cambodian location of Siem Reap runs Cambodian Vespa Adventures. Chanel Sinclair, a 31-year-old lawyer from Australia, was both thrilled and comforted to find female tour guides when travelling solo in Phnom Penh for the first time in spring 2016. She was so pleased with the attentive service she received from the Moto Girls, including regular cold water deliveries and help with bartering, that she went on three tours with the group. Renou would like to see more women travellers like Sinclair, but so far the majority of the company's 50 or so customers have been male. Scottish photographer Ross Kennedy, 44, took a custom tour with the Moto Girls in March 2016. To find more authentic scenes for Kennedy to shoot, Horm went to a region outside the city where her father has family and asked locals' advice. Kennedy's tour began with crashing a wedding in the morning and ended with a Buddhist blessing ceremony in the afternoon. ""Those are the memories that make a trip special,"" Kennedy wrote in an email. In addition to being female, the Moto Girls try to differentiate themselves as well-informed guides who can discuss Cambodian art, history and culture. Finding the right spots are not the only challenges they face. There are the cultural differences as well, like the Indian customer who said ""Yes"" while shaking his head in a fashion Renou mistook for ""No"", or the man from New Zealand who screamed when he saw a chicken on the road. On one occasion Renou and her client were so absorbed in their tour of the National Museum that neither heard the alarm sounding the museum's closing. Renou finally glanced at her watch at 17:30, half an hour after closing time. As they raced to the gate, her client promised to book another tour - if she could get them out of the museum. ""OK. Fantastic,"" Renou thought. The locked gate proved a dead end, but some workers were able to find a security guard who let them out. Renou's customer proved true to his word and booked another tour. Other difficulties are in the driving itself. Passengers unfamiliar with riding motorbikes sometimes lean to the left when they should lean right, says Horm. Then there was the tourist who got the wrong idea and asked her out on a date. She turned him down, not wanting to confuse her work with her social life. Plus, she didn't fancy him.

"Some of the most famous English phrases use people's names to convey a meaning, from the Bob of ""Bob's your uncle"" to the Gordon Bennett we call upon when we must not swear. But are these expressions, and others like them, based on real people? And if so, how did they become household names? The phrase ""all my eye and Betty Martin"" is used to declare something as nonsense. There are a number of theories as to who the mystery woman - or indeed man - was, says Benjamin Norris, assistant editor of theOxford English Dictionary.,external ""One idea is that it stems from Latin words used to call on the goddess of Crete 'O mihi Britomartis', or St Martin of Porres 'O mihi, beate Martinehe',"" he said. Eric Scaife from theYorkshire Dialect Society,externalsaid: ""St Martin was the patron saint of innkeepers, so if you had had a few it may sound different - you would be talking rubbish!"" Could it be that British soldiers or sailors abroad heard locals uttering these Latin words in disbelief and anglicized them? Could Betty Martin be versions of the Latin for St Martin or the goddess of Crete Britomartis? ""I suspect she was a character of the lusty London of 1770s and no record of her exists,""wrote lexicographer Eric Partridge,externalin his Dictionary of Catchphrases (1977). Mr Norris said in northern England the phrase is sometimes uttered as ""all my eye and Peggy Martin"". ""It seems relatively unlikely that we will be able to discover the identity of the individual in question for sure,"" said Mr Norris. The term is used to mean ""and there you have it"" or the equivalent of the French ""et voilÃ "". Its origin could have been a satirical swipe at Conservative prime minister Lord Salisbury's controversial decision in 1887 to appoint his nephew Arthur Balfour as chief secretary for Ireland, wrote journalist Fraser McAlpine, in hisBBC America Anglophenia blog.,external Mr Norris agreed: ""In light of Lord Salisbury's Christian name being Robert - 'Bob', of course, being a familiar form of this name - and the appointment being seen by many at the time as nepotistic this theory is an appealing one. ""Though, if it is true, it does not easily explain why the phrase is first recorded in the 1930s."" Is Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, the third Marquess of Salisbury the inspiration for the phrase ""Bob's your uncle""? McApline and Mr Scaife have also both questioned whether the phrase could have something to do with Sir Robert Peel, who created the Metropolitan Police Force - where officers were commonly known as ""bobbies"". ""Perhaps he had a roguish nephew who was believed to have been kept from prison by his uncle,"" McAlpine wrote. ""Then there's the name itself, which appears to have been used as a catch-all name for someone you don't know, in much the same way that Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and that lot constantly referred to, well, anyone, as Clyde,"" he wrote. This expression conveys the sense that ""if anything can go wrong it will go wrong"". It was created by aerospace engineer Captain Edward A Murphy while he was working on a series of US Air Force studies to test human tolerance to acceleration and deceleration, according toBrewer's Dictionary of Irish Phrase & Fable,external. He coined the phrase after he observed someone setting up an experiment that required the attachment of 16 accelerometers, according to Brewers. Captain Edward A Murphy is thought to be behind his eponymous ""law"" Each consisted of a sensor that could be attached to its mount in two different ways - and the subject had attached all of them the wrong way round. ""It is quite widely accepted as true and it also fits the chronology of our evidence for the phrase, with the earliest recorded use of Murphy's law in Genetic Psychology Monographs: 1951,"" said Mr Norris. The expression ""to go to Davy Jones's locker"" means to be drowned at sea. ""This item of nautical slang is shrouded in mystery, though we do know that the figure of Davy Jones was seen to represent the spirit of the ocean, sometimes even being interpreted as essentially a sea-devil,"" said Mr Norris. Davey Jones's locker is a nautical phrase meaning to drown at sea The use of Davy Jones's locker to refer to the depths of the sea, frequently considered as the graveyard of those who have drowned, has been around since 18th Century, he said. For instance, in his 1751 work Peregrine Pickle, Tobias Smollett refers to Davy Jones as ""the fiend that presides over all the evil spirits of the deep"". This man's name is often used in place of a swear word when making an exclamation of anger, surprise or frustration. There weretwo famous Gordon Bennetts who might have been the source,external- a father and son. James Gordon Bennett senior (1795-1872) was a Scottish-born journalist, famous in the US for founding the New York Herald and conducting the first ever newspaper interview. His son, of the same name, was something of an international playboy. Mr Scaife described him as ""a dandy... known for driving fast cars and causing consternation and surprise"". James Gordon Bennett junior (1841-1918) had a reputation for outrageous antics Gordon Bennett used his inheritance to sponsor the Bennett Trophy in motor racing from 1900 to 1905, and in 1906 established a hot-air balloon race that is still held today. He holds the Guinness Book of Records entry for ""Greatest Engagement Faux Pas"". One very drunken evening he turned up late to a posh party held by his future in-laws, and ended up urinating into a fireplace in full view of everyone. The engagement, unsurprisingly, was broken off. However Mr Norris said of the Gordon Bennett expression: ""It seems most likely to be a euphemistic substitution for 'gorblimey', which is itself a phonetic rendering of a colloquial or regional pronunciation of 'God blind me'.""

"Luis was 16 when he tried to kill himself. He now wants to go back to his studies Ciudad Juarez, the border city in northern Mexico which between 2008 and 2011 had the dubious reputation of being the murder capital of the world, has seen its homicide rate fall since 2012. But as Irene Caselli reports, the city's high levels of violence have had long-term psychological effects on its residents, especially its youth. Luis Mercado was 16 when he had his first panic attack. It was during a school break. He just felt the urge to run away and hide. It was at this point that he went to the school bathroom and started cutting himself. Self-harming became a habit he felt he could control... until he had another panic attack. ""It was like a balloon. You can fill it with water but it has a limit. When it fills up too much, it bursts,"" he says of his feelings at the time. ""Once it has exploded into pieces, it is not a balloon anymore,"" Luis says speaking slowly, sitting on a sofa in his home. ""I feel that this is what happened to me. So many years went by with me filling up the balloon that it eventually burst."" Luis' family was not directly affected by the drug-related violence, which accounted for many of the 10,000 murders committed in Ciudad Juarez between 2008 and 2011. And yet from his earliest years he has been a witness to violence. Luis' father was killed when Luis was just one year old. It was Luis' mother who murdered him. She was convicted and jailed. After her release, she died in what the coroner said were suspicious circumstances. Luis was 11 at the time. One night five years on, Luis tried to kill himself. But in the end he did not go through with it. He says he does not know what stopped him. ""Sometimes I ask myself why I did not keep going if I felt so scared. I wonder why I did not do it,"" he recalls. Luis is part of a growing number of people in Ciudad Juarez who attempt to take their own lives. One out of four residents has thought about taking his or her own life, and one out of ten has tried to do so, a study carried out by the Family Centre for Integration and Growth (CFIC) with the support of the Autonomous University of Ciudad Juarez (UACJ) suggests. Suicide among young people is on the rise in Mexico and there are murals in Ciudad Juarez remembering those who died by suicide Young people between the age of 15 and 29 make up the biggest number of those who die by suicide,figures from Mexico's National Institute of Statistics and Geography suggest,external. Experts say that while each case is different, the violence prevalent in Ciudad Juarez is a significant contributing factor. Prof Oscar Armando Esparza Del Villar is in charge of a psychology doctoral programme analysing problems related to violence. ""There is a sense that life does not have the same value as before,"" he says. ""When you live within this culture where life is not valued as before, suicide can seem like one of the options for those who have symptoms of depression or problems in their lives,"" he explains. Luis says in his case it was a gradual process. ""It's like when you turn off the lights in a house. You start from the upstairs, then the downstairs, then the outside lights,"" he recalls. Luis' great-uncle Ruben saw the warning signs and took him to a centre where Luis got help ""Internally I felt as if something was shutting down inside me. Like when they say that you are dying inside."" He says he also showed noticeable external symptoms such as ""the way I dressed, the cuts on my arms, my sad expression"". His teachers detected the symptoms and alerted Luis's great-uncle and guardian, Ruben. Ruben took Luis to CFIC, one of the leading centres providing support to people with suicidal thoughts and their families. The centre was able to help Luis, who now works as a waiter and who hopes to go back to studying. Its director, Silvia Aguirre, says it is as if violence has permeated the entire city. ""Violence has two ways of manifesting itself. The highest degree of external violence is homicide, the highest degree of internal violence is suicide,"" she says. And she argues that Mexicans have not yet learned how to process the pain that comes with both. The CFIC helped produce a suicide-prevention video aimed at educating people about the danger signs She says that Mexican culture and its celebration of death during the traditional Day of the Dead in November sometimes give outsiders the wrong idea. ""We show the world that death to us is a matter of Catrinas [the name given to the figure of the female skeleton often seen at Day of the Dead celebrations], meeting with the family and eating food to celebrate our dead."" Catrinas are popular figures at Day of the Dead celebrations, but Silvia Aguirre thinks despite this joyous portrayal of skeletons, Mexicans are failing to face pain ""That is part of our culture. But there is another hidden part, where we swallow our pain. ""Mexico is asleep. It prefers sleeping than facing pain,"" she adds. The CFIC has tried to make people more aware of the warning signs. It was the driving force behind a public campaign to prevent suicides and a new telephone hotline which was started last year. The centre also runs workshops for bereaved families which have not yet mourned properly. Miguel Angel Esparza and his wife Patricia attended such a workshop. The couple says they have learned valuable lessons about how to deal with the pain of losing their son Their son, Eduardo, was 21 when he killed himself. He left no note and they say they have no idea why he did it. Eduardo was a month away from completing his nursing degree. During the graduation ceremony, his classmates put an image of Eduardo on a chair for the official photo. His parents well up when they proudly show his degree. Patricia proudly shows off her late son's nursing diploma ""At the workshop they taught us that he was going to be with us forever. They teach us how to see him in a flower, in a garden, in a butterfly, in anything that inspires us,"" Patricia says. ""It has helped me a lot. I remember him with pain, but nicely.""

"The second week of the Trump Administration was dominated by the fallout from his order on immigration President Trump's first week in office was widely regarded as a whirlwind. His second week has been no less hectic. Despite the mass protests of week one andfalling approval ratings,external, the administration appears to be doubling down on its pledge to shake up the Washington playbook. In a divided America, many people are repelled by the agenda and tone of this administration, while many others are pleased that their president is taking a bold stand and getting things done. Here are five key things from week two in Trumpland. On Friday, a week after his inauguration, President Trump issued an executive order suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days, banning Syrian refugees indefinitely and suspending arrivals from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. The immediacy of the announcement, which Mr Trump said was necessary to not allow any lag time for ""bad dudes"" to sneak in, caused widespread confusion at airports around the world. Families were separated, and even Green Card holders from the affected countries were initially included in the ban. An Iraqi who put his life at risk as an interpreter for the US army was among hundreds of people detained at airports. Around the world, travellers were prevented from boarding planes, and in some cases, were pulled off flights. Vetted refugees waiting to travel to the US despaired. An Iran-born BBC reporter with British citizenshipwas among those temporarily detained. Demonstrators flocked to airports in protest, with many lawyers offering their services for free and filing emergency motions to have people released. Mr Trump said the restrictions were required so new security measures could be put in place to protect America from possible terrorist attacks. Things were working out ""very nicely"", he said. This video can not be played President Trump: ""A very good day"" Steve Gruber, a popular talk-show host in Michigan, summed up the mood among many Trump voters. Listeners,he said, ""are encouraged that a politician, albeit a new one, is actually doing the things he said he would do"". This video can not be played Protesters gather at Dulles airport: ""Welcome to the USA!"" Several courts moved to block parts of the order being implemented, but reports said that border officers in some places were not complying with the rulings. As condemnation grew, including from a few top Republicans,many foreign governmentsandmajor US companies, the White House insisted it was not a Muslim ban, pointing to the many Muslim-majority countries not involved. Thousands join protests across UK But former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani undermined that claim,admitting to Fox News,externalthat Mr Trump had previously asked him how to legally implement a ban on Muslims. He said, however, that the ban implemented was based on ""danger"", not religion. Sean Spicer, the White House's combative press secretary, blasted journalists for reporting it as a travel ""ban"", even though his boss used that very wording on Twitter. Meanwhile, the world tried to figure out the unique language on displayat protests in Scotland. The immigration order's fallout dominated headlines for most of this week. ""This has proven to be an embarrassing episode in what looks like a not-ready-for-primetime White House,"" our correspondent Anthony Zurcher wrote. Amateur hour at the White House? But President Trump's supporters think he's doing a great job. This video can not be played Trump voters say US president is 'doing a fabulous job' The former reality TV star now in the White House was this week finally given a chance to fire someone. In the middle of the furore over the immigration ban, acting attorney general Sally Yates ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce President Trump's executive order. Within hours, she was dismissed and accused by President Trump of ""betraying"" her department and being ""weak on borders"". Sally Yates refused to enforce Donald Trump's controversial travel ban Some observers and journalists asked whether the dismissal would have a chilling effect across government. But the White House said justice department lawyers had deemed the order legal and thus Ms Yates was not fulfilling her duty. This video can not be played White House spokesman Sean Spicer spars with journalists over attorney general sacking The move came on the heels of other comments from the administration suggesting that dissent from officials would not be tolerated. As news spread on Monday thathundreds of US diplomats around the worldwere planning to use a ""dissent channel"" to argue that the immigration restrictions would not make the US safer, Sean Spicer said ""they should either get with the programme or they can go"". That seemed like a pretty direct message to US government employees with independent views. On Tuesday evening at a White House ceremony, Donald Trump unveiled his pick to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court - Judge Neil Gorsuch, of Colorado. The Democrats, whom the administration has chastised for seeking to stymie them at every opportunity, have hinted they will use all means at their disposal to block his confirmation in the Senate. The Supreme Court has the final say on such divisive issues such as abortion, gun control and gay rights. Since Judge Antonin Scalia died a year ago, the court has been split equally between liberal and conservative justices, at four each. This video can not be played Donald Trump picks Neil Gorsuch as US Supreme Court nominee Whoever holds the ninth seat is thus pretty significant, though justices don't always split on clear ideological lines. Barack Obama tried to replace Mr Scalia with a nominee of his choice, but the Republicans didn't allow it given an election was forthcoming. Like the late Mr Scalia, the Ivy-League educated Mr Gorsuch is known to support textualism, or the interpretation of law according to its plain text. He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution, or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers. Who is Neil Gorsuch? Why is the US Supreme Court so important? House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee ""a very hostile appointment"" and ""a very bad decision, well outside the mainstream of American legal thought"". And of course, there were more protests. This video can not be played Labor union leader Mary Kay Henry: ""This judge is a step backwards"" Stephen Bannon, Donald Trump's chief strategist, is a man who many people believe is behind much of what has come out of the White House in the past two weeks. The former executive chairman of populist, conservative news website Breitbart has been described as a ""rumpled right-wing agitator"" by the New York Times. On Saturday night, he wasgiven a seaton the National Security Council's inner circle, or principals' committee. Under the restructuring, the Joint Chiefs and director of national intelligence have been told only to attend when discussions pertain to their areas. The move shocked many Washington veterans. ""It's completely unprecedented to have a political adviser as a member of that group,"" Eliot Cohen, director of the Strategic Studies Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies,told the BBC. Stephen Bannon has President's Trump ear Mr Bannon has a ""destructive"" world view and has accumulated an ""unhealthy"" level of power, he said, describing it as an ""ominous"" move. What exactly is his destructive world view? Well,according to the Daily Beast,external, in 2013 Bannon said he wanted ""to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today's establishment"". The White House tried to brush the changes off, pointing to the fact that Obama adviser David Axelrodhad been included in some council meetings,external. Mr Bannon jokingly referred to himself as ""Darth Vader"" ina recent interview,externalwhere he described US media as ""the opposition party"". Steve Bannon will now sit at a table where issues pertaining to US national security, and thus global stability, are discussed at a very, very senior level. President Trump was said to have described the call with Mr Turnbull as ""the worst"" Refugees are very much on President Trump's radar at the moment and it is well known that he likes to talk about deals. But a phone call on the subject on Saturday between the US president and the Australian PM, which was scheduled to last for an hour, was cut short from the White House after just 25 minutes. President Trump said the conversation with Malcolm Turnbull, in which they discussed a refugee resettlement deal between the two nations, was not a favourite among calls he had taken with world leaders. In fact, theWashington Post reported,externalthat Mr Trump described the conversation as ""the worst by far"". He appeared to be somewhat irritated by the subject matter - adeal struck with the Obama administrationwhich would see up to 1,250 asylum seekers to Australia resettled in the US. What next? President Trump was so worked up after discussing ""the worst deal ever"" that he decided to issue a statement in his preferred manner - via Twitter. Mr Trump tweeted that he would ""study this dumb deal"". Mr Trump's tweet wrongly referenced ""thousands of illegal immigrants"" - only 1,250 migrants would be accepted by the US, legally Later, Mr Spicer gave an official version of his boss's 25-minute call with Mr Turnbull. He said that both leaders had ""emphasised the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship"". Mr Turnbull later thanked President Trump for agreeing to uphold the deal.

"Kale is used as an alternative to iceberg lettuce in Riverford's Caesar salad Some supermarkets are rationing iceberg lettuces, with experts warning it could be the, er, tip of the iceberg. Bad weather in Europe has already caused a#courgette crisis, alongside a shortage of broccoli, tomatoes, salad peppers and aubergines. Withvegetable shortagesexpected to continue until April, what alternatives are there for shoppers? During the UK's winter months of December, January and February, UK farmers produce beetroot, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, celeriac, chicory, fennel, Jerusalem artichokes, kale, leeks, parsnips, potatoes, red cabbage, swede and turnips. We've become a ""slightly strange group"", expecting all-year-round produce, according to Lord Haskins, the former chairman of Northern Foods, which supplies Tesco. Riverford founder Guy Watson with the January King cabbage ""Thirty years ago you'd never have worried about buying lettuce in the middle of the winter - lettuces were things that grew in the summer and you ate them in the summer - you ate cauliflowers and Brussels sprouts in the winter,"" he says. Why is there a vegetable shortage? As for courgettes, they are actually ""very, very out of season"", says organic vegetable retailer Riverford.  We have just got used to supermarkets supplying them all year round. Eating British produce that's in season is often cheaper, as it is produced locally - and it can be healthier too. According to food industry campaign group Love British Food, fruit and vegetables that are in season contain the nutrients, minerals and trace elements that our bodies need at particular times of year. Apples, for example, are packed with vitamin C to boost our resistance to winter colds. Beetroot is ""terrific in soups"" says Alexia Robinson from Love British Food The group's Alexia Robinson recommends beetroot, kale, cabbages, broccoli and traditional root vegetables for their health-giving properties. Riverford says a slaw made with cabbage, beetroot or swede will offer ""10 times more nutrients"" than an iceberg lettuce - which it says aren't known for their nutritional value. If you are really keen on iceberg lettuces, you can probably pay a bit more for one from Peru or South Africa, says Lord Haskins. But imported vegetables can clock up a lot of air miles before they land on your plate - making them worse for the environment. Hatty Richards, from the Community Farm in Chew Magna, Somerset, says buying local is better. ""We have such a range on our doorsteps already, it's fresher, it's really good for the environment - it reduces air miles - and it supports local business which is crucial."" Lord Haskins agrees, and suggests your tastebuds may also be grateful: ""We all buy stuff from far parts. They don't taste nearly as good: strawberries at this time of year from Egypt don't taste anything like as good as a British strawberry in May, June, July."" Kale is a hardy winter leaf that can withstand frosty weather A leafy salad is nice - but there are plenty of alternative dishes to try. Riverford's Guy Watson thinks the UK's more bitter winter salad leaves and root vegetables can provide ""a far superior substitute"" which will easily make up for a lack of lettuce. Vibrant winter coleslaws and cauliflower salads ""bring British veg to life"", he says, adding that one of the Riverford Field Kitchen's most popular winter dishes is a kale caesar salad. Kale, which was originally used to feed cows, is a robust, hardy winder leaf that can withstand frosty weather. It can also be used in soups, stews, stir fries, gratins or just wilted with butter. Ms Robinson suggests embracing winter comfort food with a ""good old fashioned winter stew with plenty of root vegetables with tender meat"". If you're still not convinced you can do without leafy salads, try growing your own. Those who do want to eat lettuce need not despair. According to the campaign group Eat Seasonably, lettuce, rocket and other crunchy salad leaves are some of the easiest things to grow at home, all year around - on a seed tray indoors, on your window sill or in the garden. Spinach is easily grown, even in window boxes, says Ms Robinson Ms Robinson says: ""As well as the cress there are many great veg that can be easily grown in window boxes such as leaf lettuce, radishes, spinach, green onions and of course a good selection of herbs."" Another easy win is beetroot, Eat Seasonably says, which can be grown in a big pot. Though beetroot is harvested in October, Riverford says it can last up to four months if it's kept in a cold storage. ""Carrots are not too hard to grow either,"" Riverford's Emily Muddeman said, ""Leeks, kale - you could plant just four or five stalks of kale and it will go on sprouting."" Any budding gardeners could start with planting onions later this month - Eat Seasonably says they are ""not even slightly difficult to grow"".

" A secret network of wildlife traffickers selling baby chimpanzees has been exposed by a year-long BBC News investigation. The tiny animals are seized from the wild and sold as pets. The BBC’s research uncovered a notorious West African hub for wildlife trafficking, known as the “blue room”, and led to the rescue of a one-year-old chimp. In a dusty back street of Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s largest city, a tiny chimpanzee cries out for comfort. His black hair is ruffled and his dirty nappy scrapes the concrete floor as he crawls towards the familiar figures of the men who have been holding him captive. The baby chimp, ripped away from his family in the wild, is the victim of a lucrative and brutal smuggling operation, exposed by a 12-month-long BBC News investigation spanning half a dozen countries. In demand as pets in wealthy homes or as performers in commercial zoos, baby chimpanzees command a price tag of $12,500, a little under £10,000, but sometimes more. Each capture of a live infant like this one exacts a terrible cost on chimp populations. The usual tactic used by poachers is to shoot as many of the adults in a family as possible. This prevents them from resisting the capture of the baby and their bodies can then be sold as bushmeat. To obtain one infant alive, up to 10 adults are typically slaughtered. “One has to kill the mother, one has to kill the father,” explained Colonel Assoumou Assoumou, an expert in wildlife crime with Ivory Coast Police. “If our ancestors had killed them, nowadays we wouldn't even know about chimpanzees.” Once captured, these baby chimps then enter a sophisticated chain that stretches from the poachers in the jungles to middlemen, who arrange false export permits and transport, and ultimately to the buyers. The animals are in high demand in the Gulf states, south-east Asia and China, with buyers prepared to pay high prices and additional fees to help bypass international controls. And while they may be well looked-after while they are young, chimpanzees soon become too strong and potentially violent to be kept in a home. Karl Ammann, a Swiss wildlife activist who campaigns against chimp trafficking, describes it as a “kind of slavery” and warns that when chimps cease being cute infants, they face a terrible fate. “They still have 90% of their life ahead of them,” he said. “They get locked in some cage and maybe even killed in some cases because they have outlived their useful pet stage. That for me is just impossible to accept.” The baby chimp discovered by the BBC had been bought from a poacher, according to one account, for 300 Euros (£257). But it was rescued en route as a result of our research - leading Interpol officials and Ivorian detectives to expose a major trafficking ring. After months of work building relationships with dealers across a number of countries, our team tracked down the smuggling ringleaders to a house in Abidjan. Posing as prospective buyers, undercover reporters confirmed the infant chimp was at the property before alerting Interpol and local police who were waiting nearby. During the police operation, a small room about the size of a shower cubicle was discovered, decorated with small blue tiles. Inside it, they found a tiny chimp cowering in a wooden crate. The discovery was not only a moment of liberation for the little animal, but also a crucial turning point in a long search by wildlife campaigners to track down a notorious “blue room”, known to be used as a holding pen by traffickers and constantly restocked. For years, when dealers had circulated videos showing captive baby chimpanzees ready for sale, the same distinctive blue tiles were visible. Understood to be in West Africa, no-one knew which country it might be in, let alone which city, until our research led police to it. This revelation provides new insight into the potential scale of loss suffered by great apes, including chimpanzees. An estimated 3,000great apes, including orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees, are lost from the wild every yearas a result of illegal trade, according to the UN Environment Programme. They are either sold, killed during the hunt or die in captivity. About two thirds of the apes lost are chimpanzees - an endangered species. Western chimpanzees, like the one freed in Abidjan, are judged to be especially vulnerable, so are categorised as critically endangered. There are no more than 65,000 left and probably far fewer. Some1,800 apes were seized by authorities in 23 countries while being traffickedbetween 2005 and 2011, according to the Great Ape Survival Partnership, an alliance of more than 100 governments and other organisations. A quarter of those apes rescued were chimps. Although it is unknown how many smuggled apes reach their destinations undetected, the BBC’s investigation suggests the total is almost certain to be higher than previously thought. The illegal trade in great apes is made possible by the determination of the smugglers and the ease with which international laws on buying and selling endangered species can be evaded. Trading of endangered wild animals and plants is tightly controlled under the Cites agreement - theConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora- which aims to protect all wildlife under threat. Under the convention, chimpanzees, which are awarded the highest level of protection (a listing under what is known as Appendix 1), can only be exported under a very limited number of exemptions. For example, the animals need to have been bred in captivity (which is not known to happen in West Africa) and exporting and importing organisations need to be registered with Cites. Despite this, the BBC’s investigation revealed that with the right money and the right connections the smuggling networks can evade these controls. In fact, our team was able to buy two permits to export chimps for $4,000 each. Posing as buyers for a client in Thailand, the team obtained their first permit in the Egyptian capital Cairo, which has long been known as a centre for animal trafficking. Our undercover reporter began negotiations over a secure messaging service with two pet traders, Mahmoud Khaled and Ramadan Abdelnaiem. The pair shared videos of infant chimps held inside the infamous blue-tiled room and offered to secure Cites permits allowing the animals to be exported. Khaled even promised to provide video footage of the chimp’s progress en route to its destination. “When [the] thing is shipped and put in boxes, you will receive a video,” he said. “When it goes to the airport, you receive a video, when it lands at the airport, you will receive a video. [When] it is shipped, you will receive a video. When it is put in the airplane, you receive a video...” While Khaled offered to obtain a Cites Appendix 1 permit, enabling the export of chimps, Ramadan suggested an alternative technique: getting permits for less endangered animals and then hiding the chimps among them. Both these methods are recognised by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime as “wildlife laundering”, when smugglers use fraudulent paperwork or mix protected species with legal shipments of wildlife. A video sent to the BBC’s undercover team by a dealer in West Africa shows how chimps and other endangered animals are smuggled in secret compartments in specially-designed crates. Here, this baby chimpanzee was hidden below animals including parrots, civet cats and mongoose which have less protection in international law. The shipment was made from West Africa and destined for Nepal. The chimp shown in this video, however, never made it. Messages found on the dealer’s mobile phone revealed that the chimpanzee had died, still hidden in the crate in transit at Istanbul airport. The BBC undercover team accepted Khaled’s offer and picked up the Appendix 1 permit two weeks later. Clumsily filled-in, with spelling mistakes and other inaccuracies, it appeared to be signed and stamped by a Jordanian government official. It showed our fake address and a simple internet search would have revealed it was not a Cites-registered institution. The next step was to see if we could arrange to buy the chimps, but at this point Khaled, called the deal off, afraid of being exposed. With the Egyptian deal fallen through, the team decided to deal directly with the source of the chimpanzees in West Africa. This time pretending to be an Indonesian pet shop acting for wealthy clients, our team made contact with a young dealer in Guinea called Ibrahima Traore. Again communicating over a secure messaging service, the team built up a relationship with Traore, aged just 22, who began to send us videos of chimpanzees -  once more in the setting of the blue room. It became clear that the room was being constantly re-stocked. Traore said he could sell us one or two baby chimps as well as a Cites permit. This time, the document the BBC team received looked genuine, though it was falsely filled in, and was signed and stamped by the national parks of Liberia. As the relationship with Traore developed, he began to reveal the scale of his illegal operation. He said he held chimpanzees at farms in Guinea, his home country, as well as in Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ivory Coast. In a conversation filmed secretly, Traore boasted of being able to circumvent international controls and having “someone important on the inside”. “I’m not afraid - you can import everywhere you want - send everywhere you want,” he said. Traore also told of how he shipped chimpanzees without any Cites documentation at all - by hiding them amongst other less-protected animals. One of his videos demonstrated how to smuggle chimps in secret compartments. Confronted with the BBC’s evidence, the secretary-general of Cites, John Scanlon, said that while he wasn’t shocked by the ease with which fraudulent permits for the export of baby chimps were purchased, he was “dismayed”. Although he believed the permit system was “sound and secure” overall, he said there were instances, particularly in West and Central Africa, where there was “an abuse of permits”. “There is corruption in the system,” he told the BBC. “We’ve brought it to the attention of our governments at a standing committee meeting several months ago. We said if we can’t get a handle on corruption, we are not going to stop illegal trade in wildlife.” For this reason, Cites was pushing to introduce an electronic system of permissions that would be harder to fake, he explained. “These things are not easy, but we are onto it, we are seeing it and we are doing our best.” But, despite this, Mr Scanlon said he did not believe there was a surge in the illegal trade in great apes, including chimpanzees. “If we did, I can assure you there would be a rush of attention to this issue and a rush of resources to stop it, but we are not seeing it,” he said. He stressed that wherever the abuse of permits was observed, the governments of those countries implicated were warned and punished. There were about 30 trade suspensions currently in place, he confirmed. Law enforcement efforts, however, appear to lag far behind the rates of illegal trade. Just 27 arrests were made in Africa and Asia in connection with the great ape trade between 2005 and 2011, and one-quarter of the arrests never led to prosecutions prosecuted, according to the UN Environment Programme. At Interpol, which facilitates international law enforcement cooperation, wildlife smuggling is a priority, but national governments have stipulated that the funding and investigative effort should be focused on the highest-profile threats, such as the slaughter of elephants and rhinos. David Higgins, manager of Interpol’s Environmental Security Unit, admitted the region of West Africa had not been a priority - and nor had the smuggling of great apes. Because such crimes did not threaten the economic well-being of a country, or its political stability, they did not compel governments to respond, he said, and the resources were simply not there. “Without the funding, we can’t do anything,” he said. “So with primates, unfortunately, our information is not as strong as it could be.” He urged states to step up and offer the required financial investment. “Yes, we need the global community’s attention on this and we call upon that level of support.” Back in Ivory Coast, it was the trafficking ringleader, Ibrahima Traore, who eventually led our reporters - and Interpol - to the blue room. He sent a video of the baby chimp and himself inside the room holding a piece of paper showing the date at the time of the deal - to show that the footage was genuine and that the animal had previously been captured and was ready for sale. His face was clearly visible and he seemed not to worry about incriminating himself. Days later our undercover reporter visited the property - purportedly to discuss arrangements for buying the chimpanzee - where they confirmed its presence and tipped off police. Ibrahima Traore was arrested and, along with his uncle Mohamed, is facing charges related to wildlife trafficking. The data captured from his phones and laptops revealed a goldmine of information about a sprawling international network of great ape traffickers, working across Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Cites certificates found on Traore’s computer documented the possible illegal movement of dozens of different species of primates, as well as other endangered species. The evidence also implicated Traore’s brother, Aboubacar, who was named in a Cites document last year because of his smuggling of endangered birds including African grey parrots. Ibrahima Traore’s father, Alhassane, also appeared to be involved. Records showed his bank account in Guinea’s capital Conakry was used to deposit payments – and it was that account that the BBC team was told to use. The detective in charge in Ivory Coast, Colonel Assoumou Assoumou, pledged to delve into the entire illegal supply chain - from the hunters to the traffickers to the buyers. “In 10 years, in 20 years, we won’t have any more chimpanzees,” he warned. “This species will disappear. That’s the reason why this cause was taken up by Interpol. Personally I am committed to fight against this phenomenon. “These are rare species and it should not be us, in our generation, that wipes them out.” As for the baby male chimp discovered in the blue room, he was initially taken to the Interpol building in Abidjan, before being handed over to wildlife officials from the Ministry of Water and Forests. They took him to the zoo in Abidjan, where he was fed and comforted and given a name by keepers: Nemley junior. He was then shown an older female who acts as an adoptive mother to two other infant chimps. After being gradually introduced to this new family, Nemley junior may live with them. But caring for an infant chimp is a long-term and costly commitment so two wildlife organisations with experience of infant chimpanzees have offered him homes in specialists sanctuaries, including the Born Free Foundation. Will Travers, president of Born Free, described the exotic pet trade as “sickening and cruel” and promised to help relocate the baby chimp. “If given the opportunity, we will do all we can, with the help of our specialists and the full participation of the local government agencies, to try and relocate Nemley junior to a registered chimpanzee sanctuary, where this little victim of the illegal wildlife trade can be given a life worth living, in the company of other chimps, for the rest of his life.” But whatever happens next, the orphan has certainly been left traumatised, according to Dr Cleve Hicks of the University of Warsaw, a specialist in chimp behaviour who set up a chimp sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of Congo. “Mainly they have a broken heart - they’ve seen their mothers die,” he said. Dan Bucknall, of the wildlife charity Tusk, agreed that recovery could be “very difficult with such clever sentient animals” but added that chimpanzees were resilient creatures. “In the right hands, with good carers, and with constant attention, they can do OK and the prospects are good.”",Positive,0.9999893
