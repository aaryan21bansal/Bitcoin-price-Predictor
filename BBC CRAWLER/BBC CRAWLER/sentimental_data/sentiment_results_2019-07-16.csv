"This video can not be played Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib: ""I'm dealing with the biggest bully I've ever had to deal with"" The ongoing row between US President Donald Trump and four non-white Democratic congresswomen has continued to escalate following a controversial campaign rally. During a speech in North Carolina, Mr Trump took aim at Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley as well as Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born lawmaker who he focused much of his criticism on. His rhetoric prompted a chant of ""send her back"" from his supporters, which Mr Trump on Thursday claimed he disagreed with. The rally fallout follows debate over a series of vitriolic tweets and statements by the president that have been widely condemned as racist. All the women are US citizens. So what else do we know of the lawmakers known as ""the Squad""? All four were elected to the House of Representatives in last November's mid-term elections, each making history as a result. Known to be progressive, they have clashed in recent weeks with the more pragmatic Speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi - divisions with racial overtones that Mr Trump has tried to exploit with his tweets. Ms Omar speaks at a news conference in Washington DC in June First-term congresswoman Ilhan Omar won a Minnesota seat in the House of Representatives last November, becoming the first Somali-American legislator in the US. Her family first came to the US as refugees from Somalia, settling in Minneapolis in 1997 after fleeing the country's civil war. She became a citizen in 2000. The 37-year-old mother of three is one of the first two Muslim women ever elected to the US Congress. Before her election to Congress, she served in Minnesota's state legislature, making her the then highest elected Somali-American public official in the US. Ms Omar's precedent-setting tenure has earned both adoration and criticism. Shortly after her election, she drew praise for fighting to change a 181-year ban on headwear in the House, allowing her to wear a hijab for her oath of office. But Ms Omar has also faced repeated accusations of anti-Semitism. She was forced to apologise for a series of tweets in February that suggested that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) was buying influence for pro-Israel policies. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said the tweets stoked anti-Semitic tropes about Jews and money. Ms Omar later released a statement ""unequivocally"" apologising for her tweets. ""Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes,"" Ms Omar wrote. This video can not be played Ilhan Omar on her journey to becoming the first Somali-American lawmaker in the US She came under fire from conservatives again in April for comments on 9/11 that Democrats said were taken out of context. A clip of Ms Omar apparently describing 9/11 as ""some people did something"" began circulating online, and the president tweeted a video showing footage of the terrorist attacks spliced with Ms Omar's speech. The quote was from a speech Ms Omar gave to a civil rights group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), in March. The comments in Mr Trump's video were taken from a point she made about the treatment of US Muslims in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks: ""For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. Cair was founded after 9/11 because they recognised that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties."" The 9/11 row embroiling a US congresswoman In recent weeks, Mr Trump has focused his attacks on Ms Omar saying she ""hates Israel"" and ""hates Jews"", and suggesting she supports the jihadist group al-Qaeda. US media reported that Mr Trump's accusations probably reference a 2013 interview where Ms Omar was discussing a college terrorism class. She did not praise al-Quaeda in the interview. Ms Omar remarked that a professor said the names of terrorist groups with a different kind of ""intensity"" compared with the tone he used when he said ""America"" or ""England"". Ms Ocasio-Cortez and Ms Tlaib at a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, often referred to as AOC, made waves in the Democratic Party last June when she defeated political veteran and establishment favourite Joe Crowley in their party's primary in a new York district. The 29-year-old went on to beat Republican candidate Anthony Pappas in the November mid-terms, becoming the youngest ever US congresswoman. The freshman lawmaker was born in the Bronx, New York to parents of Puerto Rican descent. She has a degree in economics and international relations from Boston University, and worked as a community organiser, educator and bartender before deciding to run for office. Trump to congresswomen of colour: Leave the US Ocasio-Cortez: 'No question' Trump racist Since her election, the self-described democratic socialist has become a lightning rod for the political right. Ms Ocasio-Cortez has not shied away from the spotlight, frequently taking to social media to hit back at Republicans, members of the media and other critics on a range of issues including immigration, poverty and race. This video can not be played Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on detained migrants: 'The women were told to drink out of a toilet bowl' She has earned a reputation for her impassioned testimonies at congressional hearings, which are often re-circulated among her nearly five million Twitter followers. She has been particularly vocal in her push for environmental policy, serving as one of the sponsors of the Green New Deal resolution, which calls upon the US to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions along with other goals. Ms Ocasio-Cortez has also been outspoken in her criticism of the president, saying there is ""no question"" that Mr Trump is racist. And she recently accused Ms Pelosi of ""singling out"" new congresswomen of colour following a number of clashes over their policy stances. Social media savvy, Ms Ocasio-Cortez inadvertently coined the term ""the squad"" after suggesting they hashtag a photoshoot image of the four of them #squadgoals. Ms Tlaib and Ms Omar talk before Mr Trump's second State of the Union address Much like the other congresswomen, Rashida Tlaib's election this November made history. The Michigan Democrat is the first Palestinian-American woman to serve in Congress. Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Ms Tlaib is the daughter of Palestinian immigrant parents. Her grandmother still lives in the West Bank. Palestinian dress worn in new US Congress How women are changing the face of Congress She was sworn into office wearing a traditional Palestinian garment stitched by her mother. Ms Tlaib also joined Ms Omar as one of the first two Muslim women ever elected to serve in Congress. The eldest of 14 siblings, Ms Tlaib became the first member of her family to graduate from high school, and then from college and law school. Since assuming office, Ms Tlaib has been an outspoken critic of the president. She courted controversy when she used explicit language when calling for the president's impeachment.

Ms Tlaib was unapologetic about the furore incited by her remark, tweeting that she would ""always speak truth to power"". After his twitter storm, she said Mr Trump was ""biggest bully I've ever had to deal with in my lifetime"", and said his attacks were a ""distraction"" from her job of representing people in her congressional district. Ms Pressley at a House Financial Services Committee hearing Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, 45, is the first African-American woman to be elected to the US Congress from Massachusetts. Born in Cincinnati and raised in Ohio, Ms Pressley is the only child of a single mother. After attending Boston University, she served as a senior aide to Congressman Joseph P Kennedy II, and worked for Senator John Kerry for 13 years. Times when Americans were told to 'go back' Trump steps up attack on 'US-hating' congresswomen Her own political career began in 2009 when she waged a successful bid for a seat on Boston City Council, becoming the first woman of colour elected to the council in its 100-year history. Similar to Ms Ocasio-Cortez, Ms Pressley's election to the US Congress involved a major political upset: she unseated 10-term Democratic congressman Michael Capuano in their party's primary. Since assuming office in January, Ms Pressley has been a vocal advocate of abortion rights, pushing to repeal an amendment that prevents Medicaid from covering abortions for low-income Americans. A survivor of sexual violence, Ms Pressley has also spoken up for better protections for assault victims, writing on her website that ""the people closest to the pain should be closest to the power"". She said she could not call Mr Trump the president, only the ""occupant"" of the White House. ""He does not embody the principles, the responsibility, the grace, the integrity of a true president,"" she told CBS.

"This video can not be played BBC correspondent Daniel Sandford on the unseen footage of the London Bridge attacks The three London Bridge attackers, who killed eight people in 2017, were lawfully killed by police, an inquest has found. Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, ploughed into pedestrians on the bridge before stabbing people around Borough Market. They were shot dead by firearms officers less than 10 minutes after the attack began. Jurors concluded the attackers ""ignored clear warning shouts"" from the police. Chief coroner Mark Lucraft QC had directed them that the only ""safe"" conclusion was that the three men were lawfully killed. Chaos and killings: 10 minutes at London Bridge The partygoer who turned into a killer Could the London Bridge attack have been stopped? He told the court no-one during the inquest had criticised the officers involved and it was agreed using anything other than ""lethal force"" would not have been appropriate. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick welcomed the verdict and paid tribute to the ""tremendous courage and professionalism"" shown by armed officers on the night of the attack. ""Faced with an appalling and confused scene, they acted calmly, quickly, decisively, and in accordance with their training,"" she said. ""There is no greater responsibility for an officer than having to make the split-second decision whether or not to use lethal force."" This video can not be played Met Police Commissioner praises officers who stopped the ""murderous attack"" The police commissioner said both armed and unarmed police officers should take ""great pride"" in having saved lives on the night of the attack. ""These dreadful events showed us the very worst of humanity, but it also showed us the very best as well,"" she said. During the inquest, accounts of ""tremendous bravery and compassion"" by both the public and emergency services stood out ""head and shoulders above all else"", she added. Doctor 'ran from bar to save attack victims' Terror attack hero feels 'abandoned' Skateboard hero receives bravery award Previously unseen footage released on Tuesday showed many people approach the attackers, including two bakers who threw crates and a broom at the knifemen. City of London Police Commander Karen Baxter paid tribute to three armed officers from her force. ""They put themselves in the way of danger to protect and preserve life: a principle at the very core of policing,"" she said. The response to the attack showed ""how officers from all forces have the courage and dedication necessary to defeat the hatred and fear that terrorists seek to sow in our community"", she added. Downing Street also praised the emergency services and members of the public who ""showed unstinting courage in the face of such danger and terror"". Many more people could have suffered were it not for the ""professionalism, speed and bravery of those who responded and defended themselves and others"", the prime minister's official spokesperson said ""Our police and security services work tirelessly every day to keep us safe and when they are called upon in the most difficult of moments their skill and fortitude must be commended,"" they added. Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba During the inquest, jurors visited Stoney Street, where Butt, Redouane and Zaghba died, and heard accounts of their final moments. PC Bartek Tchorzewski, 36, one of the unarmed officers who tracked the attackers through Borough Market, said: ""We were just thinking about stopping them."" Before arriving at the scene of the attack, he said he had tried to anticipate what he may encounter,  ""but to be honest nothing can prepare you for that"". One armed officer who attended the scene, identified only as BX46, told jurors he shouted words to the effect of ""armed police, stand still, drop the knife"". He said he thought he was in immediate danger as Butt came towards him with a knife. ""I believe his intention was to use the knife and stab me, kill me and get hold of my weapons,"" he said. He said he then became aware of a belt around Butt's torso, which appeared to be a suicide vest. ""Now he was an even bigger threat, even with (a distance of) one or two metres, a detonation would be fatal to colleagues, members of the public, anyone in the location,"" he told the court. ""So I aimed my rifle towards the male and I was moving back quickly and I pulled the trigger."" Clockwise from top left: Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan His colleague BX44 also shot at Butt, but had to turn his attention to Redouane, who was moving towards another officer. BX44 said: ""I carried on firing until I had to deal with the third threat of Youssef Zaghba who was on top of me."" He said he was backing away from Zaghba when he fell backwards, and continued to fire from the floor through his legs up to the attackers' chest. ""I thought he was about to kill me,"" he added. PC Iian Rae, who went to handcuff Redouane as he moved on the ground, said: ""His arms and legs were moving and I knew he had an IED (improvised explosive device) strapped to him. ""I did not know they were fake. I had to make a split-second decision - if I don't go and do something there is going to be a lot more lives lost. ""I had to handcuff him and stop him from detonating that device, if they were real or not."" But firearms officers shouted at him to get away and he ran to safety. They then used ""lethal force"" to avert the danger that the terrorists would detonate explosive devices, jurors heard. An earlier inquest concluded the victims Xavier Thomas, 45, Chrissy Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, Sebastien Belanger, 36, and Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, were unlawfully killed.

"Labour is pledging to end in-work poverty within its first five years in office if it wins the next election. In a speech in London, John McDonnell promised to tackle the issue with a ""structurally different economy"", ""public services free at the point of use"" and a ""strong social safety net"". This includes a ""real living wage"" and stopping the Universal Credit roll-out. But the Conservatives said the policies would ""harm the people [Labour] claim they want to help the most"". Poverty among people who are working has risen since the mid-1990s. The Institute for Fiscal Studiessaid the proportion has gone up from 13% in 1994-95 to 18% in 2017, meaning about eight million people living in working households are in relative poverty. A household is defined as being in relative poverty when its income is less than 60% of the average - less than Â£17,040 a year, on the most recent figures. The IFS research said the rise had been partly driven by higher housing costs and lower earnings growth. What does Labour's poverty pledge mean? I'm in work 'but struggling to get by' UN expert criticises 'tragic' UK poverty In-work poverty hits 2.9 million children Speaking at the Resolution Foundation, the shadow chancellor said his goal was to eradicate poverty, since ""nothing less should be the aim of a socialist government"". While the next Labour government would re-distribute income between the richest and poorest, he said this would only ""paper over the cracks"" unless there were major changes in the way the economy worked to address inequalities in opportunities and productivity. He listed a number of policies -some which have been announced before- that he says will see a Labour government achieve their goal within a Parliamentary term of five years. They include: A network of regional public banks Expanded trade union rights Public services free at the point of use Free buses for young people Free childcare Restoring funding for public libraries, leisure centres and parks ""Behind the concept of social mobility is the belief that poverty is OK as long as some people are given the opportunity to climb out of it, leaving the others behind,"" he said. ""I reject that completely, and want to see a society with higher living standards for everyone as well as one in which nobody lacks the means to survive or has to choose between life's essentials."" Pledging to end the ""modern-day scourge"" of in-work poverty, he added. ""As chancellor in the next Labour government, I want you to judge me by how much we reduce poverty... how much we create a more equal society... by how much people's lives change for the better."" While immediately ending the most ""damaging"" aspects of Universal Credit, he said Labour would not seek to replicate the system of tax credits, designed to top up the incomes of the lowest-paid, introduced by Gordon Brown when he was chancellor. Instead, a future government would ""take a step back"" and looking at designing a welfare system that helped people ""find work and progress in work"". The main way poverty is assessed is by using a relative measure - ""relative poverty"". It's calculated by taking the median income in the country - that's the midpoint where half of the overall population have income more than that amount and half have less.It was Â£507 a week in 2017-18,external, or Â£437 after housing costs. Then you take 60% of this middle amount and anyone who has less income than this is considered to be living in relative poverty. In 1998-99, 34% of children in the UK were living in relative-poverty households. Today, this proportion is 30%, which represents about 4.1 million children. Statistics on income after housing costs and benefits received are more widely used as this gives a better idea of how much disposable income someone might have. But, some say relative poverty is flawed as a measure because the poverty line moves when average income changes. In times of recession, for example, when lots of people's wages decrease, relative poverty rates improve. Why child poverty targets were missed Campaigners say the benefit freeze in place for most of the past decade has been the biggest factor in exacerbating poverty levels among working families with children. Rather than rising each year in line with inflation, to reflect the rising cost of living, most working-age benefits and tax credits have been frozen in value each year. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation says this has pushed 200,000 people into poverty since 2016 and a further 200,000 could follow by 2020. Claire Ainsley, the organisation's executive director, said ending in-work poverty should be the government's ""number one priority after Brexit"". ""In-work poverty is the problem of our times as millions have been swept into poverty through low wages, low hours and rising costs,"" she said. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has said it is ""essential"" that the freeze is lifted next year although she had acknowledged it will be up to the next prime minister. But Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis dismissed Labour's wider pledge, saying its plans for the economy ""would lead to worse living standards"". He added: ""Just this week we have seenwages rise by their fastest in 11 years, giving people more money in their pockets, and record numbers of people getting the security of a wage. ""Thanks to (the Conservatives') balanced approach, we've also cut taxes for 32 million people, taking millions of the lowest paid out of paying income tax altogether, and taken action to reduce the cost of living.""

"Chimpanzees watching a video together get the same sense of bonding and closeness that humans can feel from watching a movie or TV show together, say US university researchers. Pairs of chimps were monitored as they watched videos - and psychologists found an increased sense of closeness between them in a way previously thought to be unique to humans. Researchers say it shows the ""deep evolutionary roots"" of the heightened emotional impact of watching something with someone else. It also raises questions about what is lost when there are fewer shared experiences - such as if families stop watching television together and are separately plugged into social media or using their own mobile phones. ""Experiences are richer watching together,"" says report co-author Wouter Wolf, from the department of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University in the US. There was closer bonding and touching after watching a video together The study, being published by the Royal Society, put chimpanzees and bonobos in front of a screen showing a video. Eye-trackers were used to make sure the apes were watching the film and fruit drinks were used to encourage them to stay relatively still and in the same place. Mr Wolf says the choice of video was decided by previous research revealing what apes most liked to watch - which was film of other apes. The end of watching TV as a family Loneliness most likely to affect young people Young like to watch Friends but on-demand and online Using data from 45 apes, mostly chimpanzees and some bonobos, the researchers studied changes in behaviour after they had watched a video of a family of chimps playing with a young chimp. Shared viewing is being challenged by online and social media services Watching the film together made them much more likely to bond afterwards - such as staying close together, touching or interacting with each other. The psychologist says the findings have challenged the idea that there was something ""uniquely human"" about such shared social experiences from watching an activity. The research concluded that this sense of feeling closer from watching something with someone is ""present in both humans and great apes and thus has deeper evolutionary roots than previously suspected"". Watching something together creates a deep-rooted sense of social bonding The psychologist says it might say something about how people in an audience or watching a sports event can feel a sense of bonding with people they otherwise do not know. Mr Wolf says there is something very distinctive about the enjoyment of shared watching - with a sense of irritation if this is interrupted. Chimps can be a tough audience - their favourite viewing is film of other chimps ""Experiencing and sharing something between two people creates common ground,"" he says. ""If you go to the movies together, you're sitting side by side, it's a really social phenomenon."" But he says ""you get really annoyed if the other person starts to play with their phone. It's annoying because you're no longer watching together"". The psychologist says part of the attraction of social media is that it taps into the human appetite for sharing moments - creating a sense of seeing something together. Humans are ""addicted to sharing"", he says. ""But do you get the deeper experience from social media? The quality of such a social network online is different,"" he says.

They include: A network of regional public banks Expanded trade union rights Public services free at the point of use Free buses for young people Free childcare Restoring funding for public libraries, leisure centres and parks ""Behind the concept of social mobility is the belief that poverty is OK as long as some people are given the opportunity to climb out of it, leaving the others behind,"" he said. ""I reject that completely, and want to see a society with higher living standards for everyone as well as one in which nobody lacks the means to survive or has to choose between life's essentials."" Pledging to end the ""modern-day scourge"" of in-work poverty, he added. ""As chancellor in the next Labour government, I want you to judge me by how much we reduce poverty... how much we create a more equal society... by how much people's lives change for the better."" While immediately ending the most ""damaging"" aspects of Universal Credit, he said Labour would not seek to replicate the system of tax credits, designed to top up the incomes of the lowest-paid, introduced by Gordon Brown when he was chancellor. Instead, a future government would ""take a step back"" and looking at designing a welfare system that helped people ""find work and progress in work"". The main way poverty is assessed is by using a relative measure - ""relative poverty"". It's calculated by taking the median income in the country - that's the midpoint where half of the overall population have income more than that amount and half have less.It was Â£507 a week in 2017-18,external, or Â£437 after housing costs. Then you take 60% of this middle amount and anyone who has less income than this is considered to be living in relative poverty. In 1998-99, 34% of children in the UK were living in relative-poverty households. Today, this proportion is 30%, which represents about 4.1 million children. Statistics on income after housing costs and benefits received are more widely used as this gives a better idea of how much disposable income someone might have. But, some say relative poverty is flawed as a measure because the poverty line moves when average income changes. In times of recession, for example, when lots of people's wages decrease, relative poverty rates improve. Why child poverty targets were missed Campaigners say the benefit freeze in place for most of the past decade has been the biggest factor in exacerbating poverty levels among working families with children. Rather than rising each year in line with inflation, to reflect the rising cost of living, most working-age benefits and tax credits have been frozen in value each year. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation says this has pushed 200,000 people into poverty since 2016 and a further 200,000 could follow by 2020. Claire Ainsley, the organisation's executive director, said ending in-work poverty should be the government's ""number one priority after Brexit"". ""In-work poverty is the problem of our times as millions have been swept into poverty through low wages, low hours and rising costs,"" she said. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd has said it is ""essential"" that the freeze is lifted next year although she had acknowledged it will be up to the next prime minister. But Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis dismissed Labour's wider pledge, saying its plans for the economy ""would lead to worse living standards"". He added: ""Just this week we have seenwages rise by their fastest in 11 years, giving people more money in their pockets, and record numbers of people getting the security of a wage. ""Thanks to (the Conservatives') balanced approach, we've also cut taxes for 32 million people, taking millions of the lowest paid out of paying income tax altogether, and taken action to reduce the cost of living.""

"Ursula von der Leyen is a close ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel ""For me, it's like coming home,"" said Ursula von der Leyen of her new job as president of the European Commission. Brussels born and bred, she is a former German defence minister, a long-term ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, and the first woman to head the EU's powerful executive. Mrs von der Leyen replaced Jean-Claude Juncker in the EU's top job on 1 December 2019 and part of her role is overseeing Brexit. She has warned that ending 2020 without a trade deal with the UK would be ""a cliff-edge situation"", which ""would clearly harm our interests"", but would ""impact more the UK than us"". ""We are not ready to put into question the integrity of our Single Market - the main safeguard for European prosperity and wealth,"" she said. This video can not be played EC President Ursula von der Leyen says Brexit will be ""new beginnings for old friends"" She was not the first choice for the EU's most powerful job. She was not especially popular in her previous role among Germany's armed forces, and only emerged from the shadows as a candidate for Commission chief when initial compromise deals collapsed. Eventually she was nominated by EU member states and then backed by the European Parliament, after a political stalemate over other contenders. Her responsibilities include proposing new EU laws, enforcing the bloc's rules and handling trade deals. Mrs von der Leyen has a reputation as a workaholic.Her decision to sleep in a bedsit adjoining her office at the Commission HQ,externalrather than making a home in Brussels has also raised eyebrows. She set out her values both before and after assuming office: Gender balance: Mrs von der Leyen, the first woman to serve as president, selected a team of 27 EU commissioners including 12 women at the top table. Climate change:Within days of taking office she promised a ""European Green Deal"",external, to set Europe on a path to ""climate neutrality"" - that is, net-zero greenhouse gas emissions - by 2050, and creating a transition fund for countries still dependent on fossil fuels. This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen said she wanted Europe to be the first ""climate-neutral"" continent Brexit: She warned the UK that the timetable to conclude an agreement - by the end of 2020 - was ""extremely challenging"", adding that whatever happened, the EU would remain united and continue to benefit from its single market and customs union. Migration: She said she was committed to reforming the EU's asylum system, which member states have been struggling with for years, with a reinforced border guard. She spoke in favour of enlarging the eurozone and the EU's open-border Schengen area, and said the bloc should be ready to take in Western Balkan countries. Defence: While backing Nato as the ""cornerstone of our collective defence"", she said the EU should invest in joint defence capacities that would complement those of the Western alliance. The EU should ""become more assertive"" towards the United States, she said. Ursula von der Leyen was born in Brussels in 1958, and attended the European School - a multilingual elite school for the children of diplomats and EU bureaucrats. A few years later, in the 1970s, Boris Johnson attended the European School, as his father was an official in the then European Economic Community (EEC). Mrs von der Leyen's father Ernst Albrecht was a senior Commission official in Brussels in the 1950s, before entering German domestic politics - he was in the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU), today led by Chancellor Merkel. He became premier of the state of Lower Saxony in 1976. He came from a privileged family of merchants. Her mother had a university doctorate and academic success was much encouraged,journalist Ben Judah has written,externalin a study of Ursula von der Leyen. With her parents and five siblings she moved to Germany aged 13. Family life was comfortable, on a farm near Hanover - Ursula came to love horse-riding - and the children performed in home plays and concerts, sometimes in front of politicians. Ursula (L) with her parents Ernst Albrecht and Heidi-Adele in April 1978 Later she studied economics at London's LSE and medicine in Hanover before going into politics. In London she went by the name Rose Ladson - at the time German politicians were being targeted by Red Army Faction leftist militants. Her family nickname had been RÃ¶schen - ""little rose"". She enjoyed partying and rock concerts. She told Germany's Die Zeit daily that ""London was for me then the epitome of modernity: freedom, the joy of life, trying everything"". Later in Germany she met Heiko von der Leyen, a doctor, at medical school and they got married in 1986. Fluent in English and French, she has been a member of the CDU since 2005. She said her father always told his children that when countries traded, they built friendships and did not shoot each other. Now 62, Mrs von der Leyen is the mother of seven children, highly unusual in a country where the average birth rate is 1.59 children per woman. Ursula von der Leyen with her children in October 2003 She is seen as a staunch integrationist, backing closer military co-operation in the EU and highlighting the ""potential Europe has to unify and to promote peace,external"". Her appointment as German defence minister in 2013 was unexpected and followed three months of coalition talks between the CDU and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). As defence minister in the EU's most industrialised and populous country, she argued for Germany to boost its military involvement in Nato. Why is Germany beefing up military? German defence minister attacks own army However, her tenure in the defence post was not without incident. In recent years, a litany of stories have exposed inadequacies in Germany's armed forces, from inoperable submarines and aircraft to shortages of personnel. A report published in 2018 highlighted the shortfalls,saying they were ""dramatically"" hindering Germany's readiness for combat. It said that no submarines or large transport planes were available for deployment at the end of 2017. While her appointment was initially seen as a fresh start for a German ministry beset by problems, Mrs von der Leyen was questioned as part of an investigation into spending irregularities. Her defence department was accused of awarding questionable private contracts to consultants that were said to be worth millions of euros. She later admitted that a number of errors were made in allocating contracts and that new measures were being implemented to prevent it happening again. That period of her career has not gone away. In December 2019, German MPs accused the defence ministry of deliberately deleting key data from her office mobile phone in an attempt to obstruct their investigation.

"Much-delayed figures for last year have shown a record number of deaths from drug misuse in Scotland for the sixth year in row. The figures for 2018 led to the crisis being called a public health emergency. The latest stats show a 6% rise on that figure to 1,264. The official figures for 2019 were delayed six months by a backlog of toxicology results and the Covid-19 pandemic. Scotland's drug-related death rate remains higher than all other EU countries but it needs to be said that there are recognised issues with under-reporting in some countries. While it seems likely that the problem in many countries is worse than official figures suggest, Scotland's drug-related death rate is by far the highest. It is more than three and a half times that of England and Wales. TheNational Record of Scotland report,externalcites research from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which says Scotland has the highest recorded drug death rate in Europe. According to the report, Scotland had 295 drug deaths per million of the population aged between 15 and 64 in 2018. The next highest was Sweden at 81 and the UK at 76. The vast majority of drug-related deaths in Scotland are of people who took more than one substance, so-called poly-drug use. Opiates such as heroin and methadone are implicated in the majority of deaths but users are often taking a lethal cocktail of drugs which increasingly includes benzodiazepines such as etizolam - pills which are often dealt as ""street valium"" or ""street blues"". Street benzos, which are sold for as little as 50p a pill, contributed to 814 deaths, of which 752 involved etizolam. Experts say high-risk opioid users typically misuse benzodiazepines to self-medicate or increase the effects of heroin or methadone. They also take benzos to treat symptoms of psychiatric disorders, negative emotional states and withdrawal symptoms. Benzodiazepines act as a sedative - slowing down the body's functions - and are often prescribed by doctors for sleeping troubles and anxiety. However, the big problem with mixing street benzos with heroin and alcohol is that they have a similar effect on the body, says Dr Saket Priyadarshi of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde addiction services. They depress the respiratory system and leave people more at risk of overdose death, he says. For years diazepam (valium) was the most common benzo and users often got hold of it through ""diverted"" NHS prescriptions. One of the biggest changes in the past seven years has been the massive increase use of non-prescribed benzodiazepines or ""street valium"", which can be much stronger than prescribed tablets. Etizolam first appeared in the figures for 2012 when it was related to one death. Between 2017 and 2019 it rose from 299 to 752 deaths, an increase of 150%. TheEuropean Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction,externalhighlighted the problem of benzos, saying: ""In Scotland, criminal groups are known to be involved in the large-scale illicit manufacture and distribution of fake benzodiazepine medicines."" It said the pills were typically made to look like 10mg diazepam tablets, and known as 'street Valium"", but these fakes often contained new or uncontrolled benzodiazepines which posed a ""high risk of severe poisoning"". Cocaine (365), Gabapentin and Pregabalin (438) have also seen a large rise in drug-related deaths. During the 1980s and 90s there was a significant increase in problem drug users in Scotland, which peaked about 20 years ago. There is now an ageing population of drug addicts, mainly men, who have been using heroin for decades. Last year, more than two-thirds (68%) of all drug-related deaths were of people aged between 35 and 54. According to Prof Catriona Matheson of Scotland's Drug Deaths Taskforce the older users develop multiple serious health issues, particularly around respiratory diseases, liver diseases and blood-borne viruses. This adds a further vulnerability with regards to overdose deaths. There was also an increase in 15-24 year old drug-related deaths, from 64 in 2018 to 76 in 2019 - 6% of all deaths. Problematic drug use is highest in areas of deprivation, where people are not getting opportunities in education and employment. Drug use is 17 times higher in Scotland's poorest areas compared to the wealthiest. Dundee City Council area has the worst drug death rate in Scotland at an average of 0.36 per 1,000 of the population over the past five years. This is closely followed by Glasgow City (0.35) and Inverclyde (0.29), which includes the towns of Greenock and Port Glasgow. The City of Edinburgh rate (0.17) is slightly lower than the average for the whole of Scotland but is still much higher than the UK average. The three local authorities with the lowest rates of drug-related deaths in mainland Scotland are Aberdeenshire, as well as East Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire which border Glasgow but contain the well-off suburbs of Bearsden, Milngavie, Newton Mearns and Giffnock. Rural areas such as Dumfries and Galloway, Highland and the Scottish Borders have pockets of problem drug users but their overall rate is much lower than the cities. Dundee overtook Glasgow as having the worst death rate in Scotland in 2017. Its drug problem has grown massively over the past decade. For a city of just 148,000 people to have 72 drug-related deaths in a year is startling. The city has large areas of deprivation and has had problem drug users for a long time, says Dave Barrie, who works for Addaction in Dundee. But in recent years, he says, there has been a ""perfect storm"" of cheap heroin, cocaine and the market being flooded by the illicit sale of prescription drugs. Mr Barrie says black market benzos could be the same strength as 10 prescribed tablets, causing opiate users to risk overdose.

"Chemicals tested in the liquids were found to contain the same chemicals found in Spice Nine young people have collapsed after unwittingly using a vaping liquid containing the synthetic drug Spice, it has emerged. Health agencies have warned people to avoid products sold as ""THC vape juice"", ""THC vape pens"" or ""THC oil"". Greater Manchester Drug Alerts Panel said it knew of six incidents since February where people had been taken to hospital after inhaling the drug. Greater Manchester Police is investigating. The vaping liquid, marketed as a ""natural cannabis"", has also been sold as ""cannabis oil"" or ""cannabis vape juice"", the panel said. It was sold as both a 10ml bottle and a ready-filled cartridge. Two incidents in the Oldham area led to five school-age children collapsing and being rushed to hospital. Michael Linnell, who coordinates Greater Manchester Drug Alerts Panel, said the liquids contained the same chemicals as found in Spice. Spice 'putting pressure' on police Police 'helpless' against drug Spice Child sick after 'spice sweets' sold The panel, which brings together police, NHS, local authorities and drug user support agencies, said incidents occurred in Rochdale, Oldham and Bury between February and June. Manchester has faced problems with the widespread use of the drug in recent years, with one MP describing the situation as a ""crisis"" andasking for government help. Also known as Mamba, Spice was formerly referred to as a ""legal high"", beforeit was outlawed in 2016. Manchester has faced problems with Spice, which is said to leave people in a ""zombie-like"" state None of the nine people affected suffered long-term health effects. But panel member Dr Prun Bijral described the incidents as ""very worrying"". ""Fortunately it does not seem likely they will suffer any long-term harm, but we don't want to see anyone else affected, particularly as we approach the school summer holidays,"" he said. ""Young people who buy this product thinking it will have an effect similar to natural cannabis are not only being ripped off, they are also putting themselves and their friends in real danger."" Mr Linell said: ""The risk of vaping spice is far more dangerous than from a natural cannabis product. ""It is difficult for even experienced Spice users to judge dosage. ""Severe poisoning is far more common with synthetic cannabinoids than with cannabis, and in some cases the poisoning may even be fatal."" Public Health England said it is not aware of any similar incidents in other parts of the country.

"This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen said she wanted Europe to be the first ""climate-neutral"" continent The woman nominated to head the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has pledged to launch a ""green deal for Europe"", in a bid for MEPs' support. Mrs von der Leyen spoke in the European Parliament ahead of a key vote on her candidacy, now taking place. The outgoing German defence minister needs a majority to take charge. On Brexit, she said ""I stand ready for a further extension of the [UK] withdrawal date, should more time be required for a good reason"". MEPs reacted with a mixture of applause and boos. ""In any case the UK will remain our ally, our partner and our friend,"" she said, defending the existing withdrawal deal, reached with Prime Minister Theresa May but rejected by the UK Parliament, which the EU has vowed not to reopen. The UK prime minister's successor is due to be revealed next week, while the country is currently scheduled to leave the EU on 31 October. Brexit: All you need to know EU Commission: What is it and what does it do? If Mrs von der Leyen wins the vote in Strasbourg on Tuesday evening, she will replace EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on 1 November. She is a centre-right politician close to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mrs von der Leyen, 60, has been criticised in Germany over the armed forces' persistent equipment shortages and what some consider to be her aloof management style. On climate change, she said ""I will propose a sustainable Europe investment bank"", to unlock substantially more investment in renewable energy and other measures over the next decade. What is climate change? The new ""green deal"" - promised within Mrs von der Leyen's first 100 days - would aim to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050, whereby carbon pollution is balanced by green measures such as planting trees. The UK has already set a 2050 deadline for becoming carbon neutral. ""It means change - all of us will have to contributeâ¦ in the way each of us travels and lives. Emissions must have a price that changes our behaviour,"" she said. The Merkel ally nominated for the EU's top job Nominee to head EU 'hopes UK abandons Brexit' She said the EU's current target of cutting carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 was not enough. The goal should be 50%, if not 55%, she said. The Commission drafts EU laws and enforces EU rules, with power to impose fines on member states if necessary. The MEPs' confirmation vote - a secret ballot - could be close, as many left-wingers and the Green group will oppose her. She was not one of the top candidates put before the European electorate in May. Significantly, she received the support of the centre-left Socialists and Democrats and the liberal Renew Europe bloc.

However, many MEPs still resent the fact that the parties' top candidates (""Spitzenkandidaten"") were rejected by EU government leaders. The German Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in Mrs Merkel's government, lobbied against Mrs von der Leyen, attacking her record as defence minister. The UK Brexit Party, who came top in the UK European election, poured scorn on her candidacy, while Italy's ruling coalition agreed to back her. She madethe bulk of her 43-minute speech in English,external, but there were passages in French and German too - part of her pitch to represent the whole of Europe. Born in Brussels, she has seven children and trained as a gynaecologist before entering politics. The BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Strasbourg writes: It's the scenario many in the EU simply don't want to contemplate. So there are no official plans in place for what to do if Ursula von der Leyen is rejected by MEPs. But if MEPs fail to confirm her there will be an unprecedented confrontation that could last all summer, between the European Parliament and the national leaders. It took the leaders 50 hours of tortuous negotiations and difficult compromises to come up with Mrs von der Leyen's name - a surprise choice, who hadn't been mentioned before. They'd have to meet again, likely at a new emergency summit in the coming weeks, to make a new choice for the four top jobs they have to fill: the European Commission, the European Council, the EU's foreign policy chief and head of the European Central Bank. It's far from clear if they have any other surprise candidates to call on. And they may not be keen to undo all the compromises they've already made, having found women candidates to lead both the Commission and the Bank, as well as a balance between the EU's main political groups. So the other option is to go back to names previously considered, such as German conservative Manfred Weber or Dutch socialist Frans Timmermans. But the same problems will still exist as before. A long hot summer of bargaining may await. She promised a big push for the EU to play a bigger role in social welfare, to tackle poverty, and stressed that she would stand up for women's rights. ""If not enough female commissioners are proposed I'll not hesitate to ask for new names,"" she said. Each of the 28 member states has a commissioner in Brussels. ""We want our fair share,"" she said, noting that of 183 EU commissioners in the past, just 35 were women. In Tuesday's vote she needs 374 MEPs to back her, out of 747 in total. In all, 751 were elected in May, but four MEPs are absent. Mrs von der Leyen made some other significant pledges in her wide-ranging speech: She would push to give the European Parliament ""the right of initiative"" - meaning the Commission would have to legislate on MEPs' resolutions; currently only the Commission can draft laws On irregular migration to the EU, she said she would boost the EU's border force Frontex to 10,000 staff by 2024, but said ""we need to preserve the right to asylum through humanitarian corridors"" She offered an EU ""reinsurance scheme"" to bolster national insurance schemes for the unemployed.

"Chemicals tested in the liquids were found to contain the same chemicals found in Spice Nine young people have collapsed after unwittingly using a vaping liquid containing the synthetic drug Spice, it has emerged. Health agencies have warned people to avoid products sold as ""THC vape juice"", ""THC vape pens"" or ""THC oil"". Greater Manchester Drug Alerts Panel said it knew of six incidents since February where people had been taken to hospital after inhaling the drug. Greater Manchester Police is investigating. The vaping liquid, marketed as a ""natural cannabis"", has also been sold as ""cannabis oil"" or ""cannabis vape juice"", the panel said. It was sold as both a 10ml bottle and a ready-filled cartridge. Two incidents in the Oldham area led to five school-age children collapsing and being rushed to hospital. Michael Linnell, who coordinates Greater Manchester Drug Alerts Panel, said the liquids contained the same chemicals as found in Spice. Spice 'putting pressure' on police Police 'helpless' against drug Spice Child sick after 'spice sweets' sold The panel, which brings together police, NHS, local authorities and drug user support agencies, said incidents occurred in Rochdale, Oldham and Bury between February and June. Manchester has faced problems with the widespread use of the drug in recent years, with one MP describing the situation as a ""crisis"" andasking for government help. Also known as Mamba, Spice was formerly referred to as a ""legal high"", beforeit was outlawed in 2016. Manchester has faced problems with Spice, which is said to leave people in a ""zombie-like"" state None of the nine people affected suffered long-term health effects. But panel member Dr Prun Bijral described the incidents as ""very worrying"". ""Fortunately it does not seem likely they will suffer any long-term harm, but we don't want to see anyone else affected, particularly as we approach the school summer holidays,"" he said. ""Young people who buy this product thinking it will have an effect similar to natural cannabis are not only being ripped off, they are also putting themselves and their friends in real danger."" Mr Linell said: ""The risk of vaping spice is far more dangerous than from a natural cannabis product. ""It is difficult for even experienced Spice users to judge dosage. ""Severe poisoning is far more common with synthetic cannabinoids than with cannabis, and in some cases the poisoning may even be fatal."" Public Health England said it is not aware of any similar incidents in other parts of the country.

"Irn-Bru maker AG Barr's share price fell sharply on Tuesday after the company issued a profit warning. The Cumbernauld-based said it expected sales to drop by 10% and profits by up to 20% as they struggle against a strong year in 2018. It cited poor weather and ""challenges"" facing some of its brands, particularly its Rockstar energy and Rubicon juice drinks. Barr's share price was down by more than 28%, at 623p, by 16:30. In a pre-close update, the company said trading so far this year had been below its expectations. It added: ""This has been exacerbated by some specific brand challenges, particularly in Rockstar energy and Rubicon juice drinks, as well as disappointing spring and early summer weather, most notably in Scotland and the north of England, and compounded further as we approach the half year when the prior year comparative weather was at its peak."" AG Barr's Rubicon division has faced challenges since the introduction of the sugar tax, with several drinks companies having to change their recipes to reduce sugar levels. This has led to a backlash among some customers, who have complained about the new tastes. The Rockstar energy division has also had to contend with a crackdown and awareness-raising by campaigners about teenagers drinking high-caffeine drinks. Several supermarkets have banned sales of the products to under-18s. Chief executive Roger White said it had been a ""challenging start to the year"" for the company AG Barr chief executive Roger White said that although the cocktail mixer division Funkin was growing well, it had been a challenging start to the year for the rest of the company. He added: ""Weather comparatives and trading, particularly in the impulse on-the-go market, have been even tougher than expected which, along with some brand-specific challenges, have led to a short-term impact on our financial performance. ""We are focused on returning to growth and will continue to take the actions we believe necessary to succeed in the dynamic environment within which we operate."" These actions include launching three new Rockstar drinks by the end of the summer and ""recipe improvement activity"" for Rubicon juice drinks. However, the company warned ""the benefit of these actions will not be felt until later in the second half of the financial year"". Sales for the 26 weeks to 27 July are now expected to be about Â£123m - down 10% on last year - and further one-off costs can be expected to be announced later in the year, the company added.

"The leadership candidates' hardening of position on the controversial Irish backstop is ""significant"", ex-attorney general Dominic Grieve says. The views of Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson expressed at a debate seem to rule out any compromise, the MP added. They both declared the backstop ""dead"" and rejected the idea of a time limit, which the BBC's Norman Smith said was a ""huge heave"" towards no deal. But Mr Grieve warned that a government seeking no deal would collapse. The Remain-supporting MP said he believed more Conservative colleagues, including current front benchers, would join him in attempts to prevent the UK leaving on 31 October without a deal. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said she was ""surprised"" by the contenders' comments on the backstop, but believed they would ""find they have to compromise"". The cabinet minister, who has been convinced by her preferred candidate Mr Hunt that no-deal should remain on the table, told Politico: ""I think their views will collide with the reality when, whichever one wins, starts negotiating and starts dealing with a Parliament which may be more difficult than they think to engage with."" The backstop, included in the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May and the EU, is designed as an insurance policy to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. But this deal was rejected three times by MPs in the Commons, with the backstop a key sticking point. Critics fear it would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals. Other MPs have said the backstop would only be acceptable if it had a strict time limit, or if the UK had a unilateral right to end the arrangement. This video can not be played Dominic Grieve has vowed to fight against a no-deal Brexit The EU has repeatedly said it will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and insisted the backstop must be part of any deal agreed. Ursula Von der Leyen - who MEPs have elected to be the next European Commission president - told MEPs on Tuesday: ""The Withdrawal Agreement provides certainty where Brexit created uncertainty, preserving the rights of citizens and in preserving peace and stability on the island of Ireland."" To groans from Brexit Party MEPs in the chamber, she added, ""However, I stand ready for further extension of the withdrawal date should more time be required for a good reason."" Backstop dismissal 'very dangerous step' Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Tory leadership: Compare the candidates Gove 'keeping shtum' over leadership choice At a head-to-head leadership debate run by the Sun on Monday, Mr Johnson said he would not be seeking a time limit to the backstop, insisting: ""It needs to come out."" He said the UK must say ""no to time limits or unilateral escape hatches or all those kind of elaborate devices, glosses, codicils and so on that you could apply to the backstop"". Mr Hunt also said the backstop was ""dead"" and rejected the idea of a time limit. ""The backstop, as it is, is dead, so I agree with Boris - I don't think tweaking it with a time limit will do the trick, we've got to find a new way,"" he said. ""But the thing that mustn't die... is a cast-iron commitment to the Republic of Ireland that we will not have border infrastructure."" By Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have given the UK another almighty heave in the direction of no deal. By ruling out any reworking of the backstop, they have closed off what some regarded as the best route to securing a Brexit deal. Even some leading Brexiteers had mooted the idea of trying to secure an end date for the backstop. A compromise, they argued, which it might have been possible to sell to Parliament. And which the EU - having already said the backstop would be temporary - might have been prepared to concede. Now, however, Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson have declared the backstop ""dead"". It means that whoever becomes PM will have to try and construct an entirely new Brexit deal in just three months. It also pre-supposes the EU will be willing to negotiate a fresh deal. Of course, it's possible this is all bluff, designed to force the EU to blink. If they don't, however, then it's hard to see a likely alternative to no deal. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, pro-EU Tory MP and People's Vote campaign co-chairman Mr Grieve said: ""I think it is significant because I have in the past heard it suggestedâ¦ that there might be some possibility of compromise by the backstop being tweaked and on the face of it, it entirely rules it out."" Hunt v Johnson: The business view PM candidates condemn Trump 'go back' tweets He said blocking no deal ""might be quite difficult"" on a technical level - meaning that bringing down the government could be the only option in a confidence vote. ""If a government persists in trying to carry out a no-deal Brexit, I think that administration is going to fall,"" he said. ""By the end of next week there are going to be more Conservatives who have indicated very clearly that no-deal is unacceptable and I notice that many of them will no longer be on the front bench."" This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue Meanwhile, Mr Grieve and Labour former foreign secretary Dame Margaret Beckett have launched a report that argues a series of possible Brexit outcomes will probably lead to further political deadlock, including renegotiating the backstop. Please upgrade your browser The report from the People's Vote campaign says that another referendum is the ""most popular way of resolving the Brexit crisis"" and the ""only legitimate and democratic solution available"".

"This video can not be played BBC correspondent Daniel Sandford on the unseen footage of the London Bridge attacks The three London Bridge attackers, who killed eight people in 2017, were lawfully killed by police, an inquest has found. Khuram Butt, 27, Rachid Redouane, 30, and Youssef Zaghba, 22, ploughed into pedestrians on the bridge before stabbing people around Borough Market. They were shot dead by firearms officers less than 10 minutes after the attack began. Jurors concluded the attackers ""ignored clear warning shouts"" from the police. Chief coroner Mark Lucraft QC had directed them that the only ""safe"" conclusion was that the three men were lawfully killed. Chaos and killings: 10 minutes at London Bridge The partygoer who turned into a killer Could the London Bridge attack have been stopped? He told the court no-one during the inquest had criticised the officers involved and it was agreed using anything other than ""lethal force"" would not have been appropriate. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick welcomed the verdict and paid tribute to the ""tremendous courage and professionalism"" shown by armed officers on the night of the attack. ""Faced with an appalling and confused scene, they acted calmly, quickly, decisively, and in accordance with their training,"" she said. ""There is no greater responsibility for an officer than having to make the split-second decision whether or not to use lethal force."" This video can not be played Met Police Commissioner praises officers who stopped the ""murderous attack"" The police commissioner said both armed and unarmed police officers should take ""great pride"" in having saved lives on the night of the attack. ""These dreadful events showed us the very worst of humanity, but it also showed us the very best as well,"" she said. During the inquest, accounts of ""tremendous bravery and compassion"" by both the public and emergency services stood out ""head and shoulders above all else"", she added. Doctor 'ran from bar to save attack victims' Terror attack hero feels 'abandoned' Skateboard hero receives bravery award Previously unseen footage released on Tuesday showed many people approach the attackers, including two bakers who threw crates and a broom at the knifemen. City of London Police Commander Karen Baxter paid tribute to three armed officers from her force. ""They put themselves in the way of danger to protect and preserve life: a principle at the very core of policing,"" she said. The response to the attack showed ""how officers from all forces have the courage and dedication necessary to defeat the hatred and fear that terrorists seek to sow in our community"", she added. Downing Street also praised the emergency services and members of the public who ""showed unstinting courage in the face of such danger and terror"". Many more people could have suffered were it not for the ""professionalism, speed and bravery of those who responded and defended themselves and others"", the prime minister's official spokesperson said ""Our police and security services work tirelessly every day to keep us safe and when they are called upon in the most difficult of moments their skill and fortitude must be commended,"" they added. Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba During the inquest, jurors visited Stoney Street, where Butt, Redouane and Zaghba died, and heard accounts of their final moments. PC Bartek Tchorzewski, 36, one of the unarmed officers who tracked the attackers through Borough Market, said: ""We were just thinking about stopping them."" Before arriving at the scene of the attack, he said he had tried to anticipate what he may encounter,  ""but to be honest nothing can prepare you for that"". One armed officer who attended the scene, identified only as BX46, told jurors he shouted words to the effect of ""armed police, stand still, drop the knife"". He said he thought he was in immediate danger as Butt came towards him with a knife. ""I believe his intention was to use the knife and stab me, kill me and get hold of my weapons,"" he said. He said he then became aware of a belt around Butt's torso, which appeared to be a suicide vest. ""Now he was an even bigger threat, even with (a distance of) one or two metres, a detonation would be fatal to colleagues, members of the public, anyone in the location,"" he told the court. ""So I aimed my rifle towards the male and I was moving back quickly and I pulled the trigger."" Clockwise from top left: Chrissy Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan His colleague BX44 also shot at Butt, but had to turn his attention to Redouane, who was moving towards another officer. BX44 said: ""I carried on firing until I had to deal with the third threat of Youssef Zaghba who was on top of me."" He said he was backing away from Zaghba when he fell backwards, and continued to fire from the floor through his legs up to the attackers' chest. ""I thought he was about to kill me,"" he added. PC Iian Rae, who went to handcuff Redouane as he moved on the ground, said: ""His arms and legs were moving and I knew he had an IED (improvised explosive device) strapped to him. ""I did not know they were fake. I had to make a split-second decision - if I don't go and do something there is going to be a lot more lives lost. ""I had to handcuff him and stop him from detonating that device, if they were real or not."" But firearms officers shouted at him to get away and he ran to safety. They then used ""lethal force"" to avert the danger that the terrorists would detonate explosive devices, jurors heard. An earlier inquest concluded the victims Xavier Thomas, 45, Chrissy Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, Sebastien Belanger, 36, and Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, were unlawfully killed.

"This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen said she wanted Europe to be the first ""climate-neutral"" continent The woman nominated to head the EU Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has pledged to launch a ""green deal for Europe"", in a bid for MEPs' support. Mrs von der Leyen spoke in the European Parliament ahead of a key vote on her candidacy, now taking place. The outgoing German defence minister needs a majority to take charge. On Brexit, she said ""I stand ready for a further extension of the [UK] withdrawal date, should more time be required for a good reason"". MEPs reacted with a mixture of applause and boos. ""In any case the UK will remain our ally, our partner and our friend,"" she said, defending the existing withdrawal deal, reached with Prime Minister Theresa May but rejected by the UK Parliament, which the EU has vowed not to reopen. The UK prime minister's successor is due to be revealed next week, while the country is currently scheduled to leave the EU on 31 October. Brexit: All you need to know EU Commission: What is it and what does it do? If Mrs von der Leyen wins the vote in Strasbourg on Tuesday evening, she will replace EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on 1 November. She is a centre-right politician close to German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mrs von der Leyen, 60, has been criticised in Germany over the armed forces' persistent equipment shortages and what some consider to be her aloof management style. On climate change, she said ""I will propose a sustainable Europe investment bank"", to unlock substantially more investment in renewable energy and other measures over the next decade. What is climate change? The new ""green deal"" - promised within Mrs von der Leyen's first 100 days - would aim to make the EU carbon neutral by 2050, whereby carbon pollution is balanced by green measures such as planting trees. The UK has already set a 2050 deadline for becoming carbon neutral. ""It means change - all of us will have to contributeâ¦ in the way each of us travels and lives. Emissions must have a price that changes our behaviour,"" she said. The Merkel ally nominated for the EU's top job Nominee to head EU 'hopes UK abandons Brexit' She said the EU's current target of cutting carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 was not enough. The goal should be 50%, if not 55%, she said. The Commission drafts EU laws and enforces EU rules, with power to impose fines on member states if necessary. The MEPs' confirmation vote - a secret ballot - could be close, as many left-wingers and the Green group will oppose her. She was not one of the top candidates put before the European electorate in May. Significantly, she received the support of the centre-left Socialists and Democrats and the liberal Renew Europe bloc.

The German Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in Mrs Merkel's government, lobbied against Mrs von der Leyen, attacking her record as defence minister. The UK Brexit Party, who came top in the UK European election, poured scorn on her candidacy, while Italy's ruling coalition agreed to back her. She madethe bulk of her 43-minute speech in English,external, but there were passages in French and German too - part of her pitch to represent the whole of Europe. Born in Brussels, she has seven children and trained as a gynaecologist before entering politics. The BBC's Damian Grammaticas in Strasbourg writes: It's the scenario many in the EU simply don't want to contemplate. So there are no official plans in place for what to do if Ursula von der Leyen is rejected by MEPs. But if MEPs fail to confirm her there will be an unprecedented confrontation that could last all summer, between the European Parliament and the national leaders. It took the leaders 50 hours of tortuous negotiations and difficult compromises to come up with Mrs von der Leyen's name - a surprise choice, who hadn't been mentioned before. They'd have to meet again, likely at a new emergency summit in the coming weeks, to make a new choice for the four top jobs they have to fill: the European Commission, the European Council, the EU's foreign policy chief and head of the European Central Bank. It's far from clear if they have any other surprise candidates to call on. And they may not be keen to undo all the compromises they've already made, having found women candidates to lead both the Commission and the Bank, as well as a balance between the EU's main political groups. So the other option is to go back to names previously considered, such as German conservative Manfred Weber or Dutch socialist Frans Timmermans. But the same problems will still exist as before. A long hot summer of bargaining may await. She promised a big push for the EU to play a bigger role in social welfare, to tackle poverty, and stressed that she would stand up for women's rights. ""If not enough female commissioners are proposed I'll not hesitate to ask for new names,"" she said. Each of the 28 member states has a commissioner in Brussels. ""We want our fair share,"" she said, noting that of 183 EU commissioners in the past, just 35 were women. In Tuesday's vote she needs 374 MEPs to back her, out of 747 in total. In all, 751 were elected in May, but four MEPs are absent. Mrs von der Leyen made some other significant pledges in her wide-ranging speech: She would push to give the European Parliament ""the right of initiative"" - meaning the Commission would have to legislate on MEPs' resolutions; currently only the Commission can draft laws On irregular migration to the EU, she said she would boost the EU's border force Frontex to 10,000 staff by 2024, but said ""we need to preserve the right to asylum through humanitarian corridors"" She offered an EU ""reinsurance scheme"" to bolster national insurance schemes for the unemployed.

"Much-delayed figures for last year have shown a record number of deaths from drug misuse in Scotland for the sixth year in row. The figures for 2018 led to the crisis being called a public health emergency. The latest stats show a 6% rise on that figure to 1,264. The official figures for 2019 were delayed six months by a backlog of toxicology results and the Covid-19 pandemic. Scotland's drug-related death rate remains higher than all other EU countries but it needs to be said that there are recognised issues with under-reporting in some countries. While it seems likely that the problem in many countries is worse than official figures suggest, Scotland's drug-related death rate is by far the highest. It is more than three and a half times that of England and Wales. TheNational Record of Scotland report,externalcites research from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, which says Scotland has the highest recorded drug death rate in Europe. According to the report, Scotland had 295 drug deaths per million of the population aged between 15 and 64 in 2018. The next highest was Sweden at 81 and the UK at 76. The vast majority of drug-related deaths in Scotland are of people who took more than one substance, so-called poly-drug use. Opiates such as heroin and methadone are implicated in the majority of deaths but users are often taking a lethal cocktail of drugs which increasingly includes benzodiazepines such as etizolam - pills which are often dealt as ""street valium"" or ""street blues"". Street benzos, which are sold for as little as 50p a pill, contributed to 814 deaths, of which 752 involved etizolam. Experts say high-risk opioid users typically misuse benzodiazepines to self-medicate or increase the effects of heroin or methadone. They also take benzos to treat symptoms of psychiatric disorders, negative emotional states and withdrawal symptoms. Benzodiazepines act as a sedative - slowing down the body's functions - and are often prescribed by doctors for sleeping troubles and anxiety. However, the big problem with mixing street benzos with heroin and alcohol is that they have a similar effect on the body, says Dr Saket Priyadarshi of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde addiction services. They depress the respiratory system and leave people more at risk of overdose death, he says. For years diazepam (valium) was the most common benzo and users often got hold of it through ""diverted"" NHS prescriptions. One of the biggest changes in the past seven years has been the massive increase use of non-prescribed benzodiazepines or ""street valium"", which can be much stronger than prescribed tablets. Etizolam first appeared in the figures for 2012 when it was related to one death. Between 2017 and 2019 it rose from 299 to 752 deaths, an increase of 150%. TheEuropean Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction,externalhighlighted the problem of benzos, saying: ""In Scotland, criminal groups are known to be involved in the large-scale illicit manufacture and distribution of fake benzodiazepine medicines."" It said the pills were typically made to look like 10mg diazepam tablets, and known as 'street Valium"", but these fakes often contained new or uncontrolled benzodiazepines which posed a ""high risk of severe poisoning"". Cocaine (365), Gabapentin and Pregabalin (438) have also seen a large rise in drug-related deaths. During the 1980s and 90s there was a significant increase in problem drug users in Scotland, which peaked about 20 years ago. There is now an ageing population of drug addicts, mainly men, who have been using heroin for decades. Last year, more than two-thirds (68%) of all drug-related deaths were of people aged between 35 and 54. According to Prof Catriona Matheson of Scotland's Drug Deaths Taskforce the older users develop multiple serious health issues, particularly around respiratory diseases, liver diseases and blood-borne viruses. This adds a further vulnerability with regards to overdose deaths. There was also an increase in 15-24 year old drug-related deaths, from 64 in 2018 to 76 in 2019 - 6% of all deaths. Problematic drug use is highest in areas of deprivation, where people are not getting opportunities in education and employment. Drug use is 17 times higher in Scotland's poorest areas compared to the wealthiest. Dundee City Council area has the worst drug death rate in Scotland at an average of 0.36 per 1,000 of the population over the past five years. This is closely followed by Glasgow City (0.35) and Inverclyde (0.29), which includes the towns of Greenock and Port Glasgow. The City of Edinburgh rate (0.17) is slightly lower than the average for the whole of Scotland but is still much higher than the UK average. The three local authorities with the lowest rates of drug-related deaths in mainland Scotland are Aberdeenshire, as well as East Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire which border Glasgow but contain the well-off suburbs of Bearsden, Milngavie, Newton Mearns and Giffnock. Rural areas such as Dumfries and Galloway, Highland and the Scottish Borders have pockets of problem drug users but their overall rate is much lower than the cities. Dundee overtook Glasgow as having the worst death rate in Scotland in 2017. Its drug problem has grown massively over the past decade. For a city of just 148,000 people to have 72 drug-related deaths in a year is startling. The city has large areas of deprivation and has had problem drug users for a long time, says Dave Barrie, who works for Addaction in Dundee. But in recent years, he says, there has been a ""perfect storm"" of cheap heroin, cocaine and the market being flooded by the illicit sale of prescription drugs. Mr Barrie says black market benzos could be the same strength as 10 prescribed tablets, causing opiate users to risk overdose.

"NCSC staff protect the UK from cyber-attacks from their office in central London An attempt to defraud thousands of people using a bogus email from a UK airport was one of a range of cyber-attacks prevented last year. The scam used a fake gov.uk address, but the messages were prevented from ever reaching their intended recipients. The details were revealed by GCHQ'sNational Cyber Security Centre in an annual report,external. In all, NCSC disclosed it had stopped 140,000 separate phishing attacks. This refers to the attempted online theft of bank details and other sensitive information by impersonating a trustworthy person or organisation. In addition, the agency said it had taken down 190,000 fraudulent sites. This often happened quickly. The centre said that 64% of illegal sites were offline within 24 hours of being discovered and 99.3% eventually went dark. This is the second time NCSC has published a progress report for its Active Cyber Defence programme. The effort - which uses a mix of automated processes to defeat internet-based threats to the UK - was launched in late-2016. One focus is to take down malware and phishing sites. This is normally done by finding out who hosts the websites involved and then telling them that their clients are running a criminal operation. Most providers take down the pages quickly, although there are some exceptions. NCSC has not shared the name of the airport the fraudsters attempted to impersonate last August. But it did say that the failed scheme involved sending 200,000 emails to members of the public asking them to pay a fee in order to receive a larger refund. Had the intended victims paid the sum, they would have got nothing in return. UK cyber-security efforts criticised by audit office UK cyber-centre thwarts hostile hackers UK moves to 'active cyber-defence' The security centre also took the criminals' real email address offline to ensure they could not receive any replies. Another success was an apparent reduction in the number of attacks in which fraudsters had posed as HM Revenue and Customs. Scammers often pretend to offer individuals tax refunds if victims provide bank accounts and a facilitation payment. At the start of January 2016, HMRC was the 16th most popular disguise used in phishing emails. By the end of 2019, a series of new measures had reduced its global ranking to 146th. Efforts were also made to prevent 1.4 million employees in the public sector from visiting malicious sites. This involved a serviceknown as PDNS (protective domain name system),external, which effectively refuses to query the internet's address book when appropriate. So, for example, if a user typed in a web address whose domain name had previously been linked to illegal activity -  eg dodgysite.com - the service would refuse to provide the related internet protocol address - eg 216.58.111.789 - required to connect to its computer servers. NCSC said that PDNS had handled a total of 68.7 billion queries in 2018, of which it had blocked 57.4 million. The PDNS system prevents connections to computer servers that are known to host ransomware, phishing attacks and malicious sites This included frustrating 450,000 queries related to WannaCry - the malware that took down parts of the NHS in 2018. A further 230,000 queries were obstructed relating to another piece of malware called BadRabbit. The system even found evidenceof attempts to spread the Conficker worm,external, which was released as far back as 2008. NCSC added that BT has been working on its own version of PDNS, and is blocking an average of 110 million malicious connections per month. Other incidents flagged by the report included: a primary school being involved in the spread of a large-scale malware infection because its anti-virus system was not working an unnamed public sector organisation that deals with sensitive information getting breached because its employees had downloaded unauthorised software at least 318 public sector networks still routinely using Windows XP despite Microsoft having pulled nearly all support for the operating system in 2014 In the future, the NCSC said it wanted to do more to map the UK's use of the internet, in a piece of research it calls the Internet Weather Centre. The aim is to understand questions like what are the most commonly used cloud services, and then use that knowledge to understand related vulnerabilities. It also wants to do more work to allow public sector users to scan and check how their infrastructure is exposed to the net to spot potential risks.

" By Rachael Buchanan It’s the rarest form of a rare condition - conjoined twins, fused at the head. The BBC has been granted exclusive access to a ground-breaking series of operations in a British hospital to separate two sisters. There is a crowd in the operating theatre. But the team of nearly 20 works as one. Moving smoothly, every motion calculated. No signs of stress or tension, just hands methodically performing tasks. But this is no routine operation. The shrouded shape of two small girls is picked out by the bright theatre lights. Safa and Marwa are joined at the head. Their brains are exposed as the surgeons work to separate a labyrinth of shared blood vessels. But then the calm and peace of the theatre disappears, as anaesthetists raise the alarm. The blood from Safa’s brain isn’t draining properly and she is shunting blood to her sister. This puts strain on Marwa’s heart and she becomes dangerously unstable.  The anaesthetists call out commands, report vital signs and busy themselves trying to stabilise the girls. ""I think we need to shock,"" says one of them. Pads are attached to Marwa’s chest in preparation. The lead surgeon raises both hands so they can be clearly seen, and steps back. Then everyone waits. If they lose her, they may also lose Safa.     Zainab Bibi has already given birth to seven children - all of them at home. So when she becomes pregnant with twins, the plan is to do the same thing. But after an ultrasound scan picks up a complication, she is advised to have them delivered in hospital. It’s a difficult time for the family. Two months before the birth, Zainab’s husband died of a heart attack. She is also told by the maternity team that the twins might be joined together. But there has been no mention of where on their bodies the join might be. No-one, it seems, realises the full extent of the complications to come.   On 7 January 2017, the twins are delivered by Caesarean section at Hayatabad hospital in Peshawar, some 31 miles (50km) from her home in northern Pakistan. The family are told that the girls are healthy. But Zainab doesn’t meet the newborns immediately, because she needs to recover from the surgery. It is the twins' grandfather Mohammad Sadat Hussain who finds out the truth first - the girls are what is called craniopagus twins, which means they are joined at the head. It is the rarest form of what is already a rare condition. Their grandfather arrives on the maternity ward bearing the traditional gift of sweets for the nurses. Still in mourning for the loss of his son, meeting his granddaughters is a bittersweet moment: “I was happy to see them, but I was thinking what am I going to do with them because of their joined heads?” It is five days before Zainab is well enough to be introduced to her daughters, and she is given a photo of the twins to prepare her. She says she instantly fell in love. “They were very beautiful and they had nice hair with white skin. I didn’t even think about the fact they were joined. They are God-given.” They are named Safa and Marwa, after the twin hills in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, that play a central role in the Islamic ritual pilgrimage of Hajj.   After a month, the twins are discharged from hospital and the family agree that if it can be done, they should be separated. A military hospital offers to perform the surgery but warns that one of the twins is likely to die. It is a risk their mother is unwilling to take. Other options are explored, and when the twins are three months old, the family are put in touch with Owase Jeelani, a paediatric neurosurgeon at one of the world's leading children's hospitals, Great Ormond Street in London (GOSH). By coincidence, he was born in the nearby region of Kashmir and immediately establishes a rapport with them. After seeing scans of the girls, the surgeon is convinced they can be safely separated, but he wants to do it before they reach 12 months old, to get the best outcome. The clock is ticking. It is August 2018. The visas for the UK have already come through, but funding for the operations has not. This is not something the NHS in the UK would fund and Jeelani has raised only a small amount of the money needed to pay for the hospital care. The girls are now 19 months old, well beyond the age that the GOSH team would like to operate. Any further delay might mean the separation becomes more dangerous, recovery more limited. Jeelani urges the family to come to England immediately.  He remembers the moment they arrived: “They turned up in early August and at this point we only had a small amount of the money we needed. The kids were here and I must say I was really stressed. At this stage it felt like a personal responsibility.” The twins’ uncle Mohammad Idrees and their grandfather are put up in a flat near the hospital. But Zainab will not be parted from her daughters, and prefers to sleep in their room. Despite being joined, the twins have distinct personalities, according to their mother. Safa, is “smart, happy and talks a lot”. Marwa, on the other hand, is shy. “She sometimes talked to herself but when we spoke to her she didn’t always reply,” says Zainab. Shortly after their arrival, while Jeelani is having lunch with a lawyer friend, a moment of pure serendipity changes everything. After he tells her the story of the twins, the lawyer picks up her mobile phone and makes a call. The surgeon is asked to tell the person on the line about the girls. He is speaking to a wealthy Pakistani businessman, Murtaza Lakhani. Within a few minutes, an offer has been made to meet the costs of their treatment. “The twins are from Pakistan which is where I am from originally,” says Lakhani. “However, the true reason for me helping them was because it was an operation that was going to save the lives of two children. For me it was an easy decision, it’s how you build the future.”    Conjoined twins develop from one fertilised egg and so are always identical. There are two theories about why they are fused together - either the split into two embryos happens later than usual, and the twins only partially divide, or, following the split, parts of the embryos remain in contact and those body parts merge as they grow. When it occurs, twins are more commonly connected at the chest, abdomen or pelvis. Safa and Marwa’s particular commingled physiology presents a unique set of challenges for the GOSH team. The girls are joined at the top of their heads - crown to crown - facing opposite directions. They have never seen each other’s faces. Their skull is like a stove pipe, a long straight tube. Scans show that the girls have two distinct brains but these are misshapen. The right hemisphere of each brain is sticking up 90 degrees, projecting into the other twin's brain cavity. This distorted shape will need correcting if the girls are to have near normal-shaped heads. The surgical team's biggest concern is how to separate the complex shared network of veins and arteries. Each twin supplies the other with blood. Severing these connections carries a risk of starving the brain of nourishment and causing a stroke. There are no official figures for the prevalence of craniopagus conjoined twins, but one estimate puts it at one in every 2.5 million births. Most do not survive beyond 24 hours. Each case is unique, and separations of craniopagus twins have only been reported about 60 times since the first attempt in 1952. Jeelani believes there could be up to six sets of craniopagus twins born worldwide each year who might be successfully separated. Great Ormond Street Hospital is a world leader in this kind of surgery. Safa and Marwa will be their third set of craniopagus twins, more than any other centre. The team knows from experience that the best outcomes happen when the separation is staged over several operations, to allow for recovery in between. As well as surgeons and nurses, the 100-strong team at GOSH involved with the care and separation of the twins includes bio-engineers, 3D modellers and a virtual reality designer.  Owase Jeelani and Prof David Dunaway Owase Jeelani and Prof David Dunaway Jeelani will take the lead in separating the girls' brains and blood vessels, but it will be plastic surgeon Prof David Dunaway who will be responsible for rebuilding the girls' heads, and giving each of them a top to their skulls.  It's 08:00 on Monday 15 October 2018, and a team of nearly 20 gathers in theatre 10 at GOSH. Each member of staff identifies themselves and what their role will be. ""We have one case for the list today. Safa and Marwa. Two kids, one case,"" says Jeelani. The twins’ slow journey to independence is about to begin. The aim of this surgery - the first of three major operations - is to separate the twins' shared arteries. Jeelani works his way through the plan one last time but everyone knows what they have to do. The team has been preparing for this day for months. ""We have been through everything in fine detail - rehearsed it repeatedly. This is the moment of truth and everything has to be perfect,"" says Dunaway. Meanwhile on Bumblebee ward, the twins are being readied for theatre. Wearing identical surgical gowns, Safa and Marwa cry and twist restlessly.  Separating conjoined twins carries huge risks. One or both could die during surgery or be left with brain damage. The family understand the dangers, and have complete trust in the team. “It is clearly very difficult to go through life when you are joined together like that, so it does make a persuasive case in favour of attempting the separation and the family are very clear on that,” says Jeelani. Dunaway says the team has carefully assessed the ethical issues. “Clearly I think life being separate is better than being joined together. If we felt there wasn't a very high chance that we could do it safely, we would think hard about whether we should do it at all. The whole team feels there's an excellent likelihood of a successful separation here.” As the twins’ trolley arrives at the theatre doors Zainab kisses her daughters. She knows the coming months will be hard on them and the emotion of parting is overwhelming. In tears, she is comforted by one of the many nurses she has come to look on as family. ""I am hopeful that everything will be okay and I have full trust in the doctors. I always look to God - he will make everything great,"" she says. In theatre, the first task is to remove three large segments of skull. Jeelani is wearing surgical loupes, glasses fitted with magnifying scopes. He follows the marks he traced on the girls' shared skull, now shaved, and cuts through skin and bone. Once the brains are exposed he swaps his surgical loupes for something far more powerful. Standing 7ft high, the operating microscope dominates the theatre. It allows the neurosurgeon to examine the microstructure of the twins’ blood vessels. It's now 14:30 and Jeelani announces: ""The artery from Safa going to supply Marwa's brain has been clamped. Now we wait."" It’s a dangerous moment. Every time a connection is cut, there is a risk of brain damage. After five minutes the surgeon says the brain ""doesn't look like it is too bothered"", and carries on. This painstaking procedure continues for several more hours as the shared arteries carrying oxygenated blood from one twin to the other are clamped and sealed. Meanwhile, a second team, led by Dunaway, has set up shop a few feet from the main action. Their task is to create a rigid frame from the three sections of skull, which can be detached in subsequent operations.  The curved bone pieces are held together with a network of metal mesh and screws. Dunaway says this is a particular challenge given the twins' age: “Being older they are pretty active and so whatever we do has to be strong enough to resist the twisting and bending forces they will be putting on their heads."" As the team patiently tease Safa’s and Marwa's brains apart, they feed in a sheet of soft medical plastic to stop them reconnecting in between operations. A pulley system has been secured to the plastic to counteract the way a part of each brain sticks up into the other twin's skull. This will gradually ease the brains back into place. Once the shared arteries are separated, the skull frame is re-attached. The operation has lasted 15 hours. The girls are taken to intensive care.  After two days, they are sent back to their usual home on Bumblebee ward - things are looking good. Jeelani and Dunaway were both involved in the separation of craniopagus twins at GOSH in 2006 and 2011.The latter involved Rital and Ritaj Gaboura, twin girls from Sudan who were 11 months old. Rital and Ritaj Gaboura Rital and Ritaj Gaboura Dunaway says the separation of Safa and Marwa is by far the hardest, not least because of their distorted brain shape.""The first two cases were much more straightforward and we were lucky. But with this set we underestimated the complexity of the oblique brain joining. Also, they are older and I think older is really bad news.""The surgeons believe the ideal time for separating craniopagus twins is when they are between six and 12 months old.""We put these twins through a lot,"" says Jeelani. ""Younger brains and younger circulations have better regeneration potential.""Dunaway agrees: ""Everything is easier. The skin stretches and heals better and the bone grows in better.""Safa and Marwa are nearly two, but while their age is against them, the team does have some elements working in their favour. Imaging and modelling technology have advanced significantly in the past eight years, which has helped them plan the separation in greater detail than ever before.In a narrow, cramped office dominated by a huge curved computer screen, sits craniofacial plastic surgeon Juling Ong. He is heading the modelling team for Safa and Marwa’s separation and demonstrates some of the cutting-edge systems they now have at their disposal.""These are really unique cases and it's not something that we get taught in medical school,” he says. “With this software, we can make a realistic computer model to look at the extraordinary anatomy of these children and plan our surgeries beforehand.""On the screen he displays some stunning 3D models of the girls’ skin, skulls and interlocked brains that have been made from traditional scans. ""It allows us to try out different strategies for operating, and the likely danger areas given the twins’ unique anatomical structures.”But these computer models don’t just stay on a screen, they can also take on a physical shape thanks to a 3D printer.Forty-eight hours later, the hospital’s 3D technician Kok Yean Chooi pulls out a shapeless looking lump of soft plastic. As he scrapes and washes the excess material away, a likeness emerges of one twin's skull cavity and skin envelope. This replica is to help plan how the layer of skin between the girls' shared skull will be divided.Many of these 3D models have been created, allowing the surgeons to explore the twins' unique anatomy, long before scalpel touches skin. ""To be able to see and visualise this and play with these models before the surgery makes an enormous difference to how we plan and do this operation,” says Jeelani.  “What we need to achieve is, in effect, to sort of untwist the brains. And that's pretty difficult to do just in your head."" Dunaway agrees: ""We've spent a lot of time just sitting looking at these models and going through the ‘what ifs’"".  But the team has gone beyond physical models. Wearing a virtual reality visor and gripping a pair of controllers, Jeelani sits in front of a computer screen, rocking from side to side. He keeps repeating the same word: ""Incredible."" The surgeon has been transported into a virtual world which allows him to explore the twins' intermingled vascular system. “This is clearly the way of the future,” he enthuses. “We are blessed here [at GOSH] in terms of the engineers and the software specialists - the skill sets they bring to the equation are skills that we as doctors with our medical training don't have.”   The second operation takes place one month after the first. While the first surgery sealed off the twins’ arterial connections, today's task is to divide the shared veins that drain blood from the girls' brains. Every severed connection runs the risk of causing a stroke in one of the twins. This time things are not going smoothly. As soon as the skull frame is detached, the girls start to bleed. Since the last operation clots have formed in Safa's neck veins. They are restricting drainage of blood from her brain so she is constantly shunting blood to Marwa instead. One twin’s blood pressure goes sky high, while the other’s dips dangerously low. The anaesthetists are struggling to keep them stable.That's when Marwa's heart rate plummets and they fear she may die on the table.There is suddenly quiet and stillness around the operating table as all eyes are on the instrument screens. The only sounds are the accelerated beeps of the heart monitors.The crisis passes, but not without serious consequences.It is clear to the surgical team that Marwa is the weaker twin. So they decide to give her a key shared vein. It will increase her chances of survival.It is a hugely difficult decision. Jeelani knows that it may have a serious impact on Safa, until now the stronger twin.But the team agrees that it is the right thing to do. The operation lasts more than 20 hours. Jeelani is exhausted and hands over to plastic surgeon Juling Ong to close.""I am relieved. We thought we might lose Marwa at one point,” he says. “But if they wake up as we hope they will, it's gone well.""The surgeons leave theatre at 06:30 the next morning. In the late afternoon, Jeelani telephones the hospital from home to check on the girls. He is told that Safa is in trouble, making no effort to breathe and her skin is mottled. ""I thought, ‘Safa is dead’,"" he says, and recounts how, emotionally exhausted and sleep-deprived, he collapsed on his kitchen floor and started to cry. ""My poor wife had never seen me like that before. She gave me my phone and said: 'Call David'. “You're invested so heavily in the twins and also so physically tired at this stage, you have very little reserves left,” he explains. “So it becomes much harder to deal with, with emotional ups and downs and complications."" Both surgeons return to intensive care and examine a CT scan of Safa's brain. What they feared has happened. She has had a stroke in the area of the brain where they gave the key vein to Marwa. Over the next two days, Safa is in a critical condition. Zainab, her brother and father-in-law, pray by the twins' bedside. Eventually, Safa shows signs of recovery. Both twins are weaned off ventilators and are able to breathe on their own.  The surgeons begin to relax. Nonetheless, as a result of the stroke Safa has some weakness in her left arm and leg. This weighs heavily on Jeelani’s conscience. ""For me the big moment is going to be when she walks and when she uses her left arm properly, because I know I've given her that weakness and for me that's a hard thing.""  Creating two round heads from the girls’ shared tubular anatomy presents a particular challenge. There isn’t enough surface area to cover the top of two heads once they have been split apart. It’s January 2019, just weeks from the final separation. Plastic surgeons David Dunaway and Juling Ong are by the twins’ bedside, trying to solve one part of the problem - the lack of skin to cover their heads when separated. Two weeks earlier, they had inserted four small plastic sacs under the skin of their foreheads and at the back of their shared skull, and these areas now look strangely lumpy.  The sacs are tissue expanders, and their role is to encourage skin growth. “They have a tiny little port attached to them through which we can inject saline,” explains Dunaway. “The idea is that we will gradually inject the tissue expanders and they will blow up like a balloon and the skin over the top of them will stretch.” They hope six weeks of skin expansion will give them enough extra surface to cover the tops of the girls’ heads. Dunaway admits that the last couple of months haven’t been easy. “It’s been a stormy time for Safa and Marwa,” he says. “They've had ups and downs with infections and temperatures, and Marwa's heart is having to work quite hard for both of them. That's causing her a few challenges. But they're hanging in there and are both reasonably well.”  David Dunaway fills the skin expanders with saline David Dunaway fills the skin expanders with saline Next for the girls will be the separation. For the first time in their lives they will be able to see each other. The day of separation is brought forward by four weeks because Marwa’s heart is still struggling. It’s February 2019 - four months since the first surgery. This is what the months of planning and preparation have been building towards. The twins have already endured 35 hours of surgery from the two previous operations. Over the next seven hours, the remaining connections of bone, brain and tissue are severed, until just one piece of dura, the membrane around the brain, links the sisters. Then, the final connection is cut. Several members of the surgical team step in to gently lift the two fragile bodies apart. Twins still, conjoined no more. “Fantastic,” says Dunaway. For the first time in their two years of life, the survival of each sister is no longer dependent on the other. That will make it easier for the two anaesthetic teams to regulate their heart rates, blood pressure and other vital signs. But separation is only the opening act of today’s surgery. The team now has to shape a rounded head for each child, from the remnants of their shared tubular skull, and hope the extra skin they managed to grow will cover them. Each twin now needs their own operating theatre.  Half of the surgical team will stay with Marwa under the guidance of Jeelani and Ong, while Dunaway will head up a second team next door to reconstruct Safa’s skull. Plastic film is used to wrap the top of her exposed head so she can be safely moved. As the parallel operating rooms are prepped for the final stage, the two lead surgeons, smiling broadly, shake hands in the corridor outside. “It was a very emotional moment,” says Dunaway. “We've been working a long time to get them here - they've been through so many operations and now it's worked.” Jeelani adds:  “We have taken the twins apart, but now we have to reconstruct their heads, and put each of them back together.” The separation could not have gone ahead if the twins’ brains had remained misshapen. By applying gentle pressure over the past four months, the surgeons have largely corrected the distortion, although the girls’ heads will always be slightly taller at the back. All that remains is to push the putty-like brains the last couple of centimetres into the newly divided skull cavities.  “Team Safa” and “Team Marwa” begin the painstaking task of skull reconstruction. “A piece for me, piece for you, piece for me, piece for you,"" says Dunaway, a veteran of 23 years in plastic and cranio-facial surgery, making two piles of skull fragments. To have enough skull to cover both heads, each fragment must be divided in two. “The skull is usefully designed in three layers: the inner and outer layers are very thick tough bone, but in between is like a honeycomb so you can split it. It is half the thickness but it means we should be able to cover nearly all the head with bone,” says Dunaway. With the girls’ brains enclosed in the watertight casing of dura, the skull fragments are jigsawed over the top of their now spherical heads. The individual pieces are secured in place with a lattice of disposable stitches, creating an archipelago of bone fragments. The gaps have been seeded with bone cells, and in the coming months these should slowly close up leaving each sister with a complete skull. The final task is to stretch the skin over the reconstructed skulls. There is just enough to make the join. Dunaway shakes his head in wonder. ""Pretty amazing day isn't it?” he says. At 01:30, after 17 hours in theatre, there is an emotional meeting between the two lead surgeons and the girls' family, who have been waiting in the hospital all day for news. Speaking in Urdu, Jeelani tells Zainab that her daughters are finally separate. Overcome, she kisses his hands and those of Dunaway.    While Safa and Marwa are slowly recovering in hospital in London, Jeelani and Dunaway take a trip to Ireland to visit Rital and Ritaj Gaboura, the craniopagus twins they separated in 2011, aged 11 months. They are excited about seeing the girls, who will be nine in September, for the first time, at the family home in Cavan. Their father Abdel-Majeed Gaboura is a doctor at a local hospital. His wife, Enas, trained as a psychiatrist in Sudan. A slight asymmetry in their head shape is the only evidence that their skulls were once joined together. The Gaboura sisters have had one of the most successful outcomes of any separated craniopagus twins. Born in 2010 in Sudan, the girls shared one long skull, but unlike Safa and Marwa their brains were not misshapen. They arrived at GOSH aged seven months in a very poor condition. Rital’s heart was failing because it was being overworked, supplying blood to much of her sister’s brain as well as her own.  Both twins would have died without surgery. Their four-stage separation took place over three months, and within a few weeks they were recovering well. Rital is on the autistic spectrum and goes to a special school, whereas Ritaj is showing typical development for her age and is in mainstream education. The twins have a strong relationship. Ritaj is “the boss” according to their parents, who say they often ask for her help when Rital is being unco-operative. Abdel-Majeed, says with pride: “I can’t even express my feelings that we are sitting here with two healthy twins,  just as I had hoped at that time.” Enas is pregnant again. “It’s just one child, not twins,” she says with a smile. “It was very different when I was pregnant before. I didn’t know if they would be born alive or dead.” For the two surgeons it is an emotional meeting. “To visit the girls in their own home, settled in the community here, going to school, seeing their enjoyment in life and the family - that's a really very special reward. It tells us something about the value of this very rare surgery,” says Dunaway. Rital and Ritaj are evidence of what can be achieved for craniopagus twins, if the surgery is done at a young age when the body’s regenerative powers are strongest. But the surgery is hugely expensive and that often means a delay in getting funding, which is what happened with Safa and Marwa. Jeelani first spoke to their family when the girls were just three months old, but it took another 16 months to find a donor. He is convinced that delay affected the outcome. “Had we been able to do them sooner, the results would have been better,” he says. “They will have some long-term deficits, we envision that they will have problems with movement and intellectual function possibly. But we take the cue from the mother. She is delighted that we are where we are. She feels that they would have had no life had we not given them the chance.”  When carrying out such unusual operations, surgeons will always reflect on whether they did the right thing. But Dunaway knows life would have been arduous for the twins if they hadn’t been separated. “It may have been difficult to provide the care to keep them fit and healthy. Clearly they are going to face some challenges but I think overall, it's a positive outcome for them. They have a chance of leading happy lives now.” The two surgeons have set up a charity namedGemini Untwinedto collate research and information on conjoined twins and help raise money for future operations. “What we would like to see is that we don't have this potentially damaging delay in treating children, and a research arm giving us much more information,” says Dunaway. “There is so much we don't know about conjoined twins, we think we're doing it the right way but we really need to understand that in a scientific way.”  The day of discharge has finally arrived for Safa and Marwa. It is nearly five months since they were separated and it’s been a long, slow recovery for the girls. Both needed skin grafts on the back of their heads. And they have been receiving daily physiotherapy to help them reach some basic milestones - learning to roll, sit and hold their heads up. Their mum has dressed them in eye-catching red-and-gold outfits to celebrate the occasion. While Zainab packs up the last of their things, Marwa giggles and squirms on the bed as her grandfather tickles her. Safa plays copycat with her uncle, taking turns to bang on a drum. There is still a long way to go but they are making progress and starting to regain their former playfulness. When the time comes to leave, there are hugs and tears from mum and the nurses and doctors who have cared for them. Dunaway pops in between cases to say a last goodbye, and Jeelani appears straight from the operating theatre just in time to walk them out. His strong bond with the family is evident and the pride he feels at seeing the girls recovered enough to be discharged is written on his face. Safa, Marwa and their family will stay in London for the next six months at least, while the girls have more physiotherapy and checkups but their plan is to return home to Pakistan in early 2020. As they leave the hospital that has been their home for the past 11 months, Zainab is clear that separating the girls was the right thing to do. “I am very happy. With God's grace I am able to hold one for an hour and then the other one. God has answered our prayers.”    Authors:Rachael Buchanan, Fergus Walsh Graphics:Joanne McDonald, Gerry Fletcher Videos and photography:Tony Fallshaw, Julius Peacock, Rob Magee Additional photos:Bibi family, Gaboura family, Alamy Producer:James Percy Editor:Kathryn Westcott Publication date: 15 July 2019",Negative,1.8999569e-06
"The world's largest education publisher has taken the first step towards phasing out print books by making all its learning resources ""digital first"". Pearson said students would only be able to rent physical textbooks from now on, and they would be updated much less frequently. The British firm hopes the move will make more students buy its e-textbooks which are updated continually. ""We are now over the digital tipping point,"" boss John Fallon told the BBC. ""Over half our annual revenues come from digital sales, so we've decided a little bit like in other industries like newspapers or music or in broadcast that it is time to flick the switch in how we primarily make and create our products."" How digital publishers are shaking up the book industry The firm currently makes 20% of its revenues from US courseware, but has been struggling as students increasingly opt to rent second-hand print textbooks to save money. To counter this Mr Fallon said Pearson would stop revising print books every three years, a model that has dominated the industry for 40 years. Mr Fallon at the 'Microsoft in Education Global Forum' in 2014 It means that next year the firm will only update 100 of its 1,500 titles in print - down from 500 in 2019. ""There will still be [print] textbooks in use for many years to come but I think they will become a progressively smaller part of the learning experience,"" Mr Fallon said. ""We learn by engaging and sharing with others, and a digital environment enables you to do that in a much more effective way."" Digital textbooks can be updated responsively and also incorporate videos and assessments that provide students with feedback. However, many of Pearson's digital products are sold on a subscription basis, raising fears that authors will lose out in the way musicians have to music streaming services. Mr Fallon denied this, saying the firm's plans would provide authors with ""a more sustainable income over time"". He added: ""For the Netflix and Spotify generation, they expect to rent not own."" Pearson has been going through a painful turnaround after years of falling sales and profits, but appeared to have turned a corner in 2018. Its underlying sales rose 2% in the first quarter of 2019, although the firm admitted revenue in its US business could fall by as much as 5% this year. Mr Fallon said its plans for textbooks would begin in the US, but in time be extended to other markets including the UK.

"Wage growth in the UK accelerated to 3.6% in the year to May 2019, the highest rate since 2008,according to Office for National Statistics figures.,external Wages have been outpacing inflation since March 2018. A record high of 32.75 million people were in employment up to the end of May, while 1.29 million were out of work, the lowest since at least 1992. ""The labour market continues to be strong,"" said ONS deputy head of labour market statistics Matt Hughes. ""The number of self-employed part-timers has passed one and a half million for the first time, well over double what it was 25 years ago,"" he added. ""Regular pay is growing at its fastest for nearly 11 years in cash terms, and its quickest for over three years after taking account of inflation."" Two factors which started in April have helped contribute to the acceleration in wage growth. Some NHS staff have had pay increases, while the new National Living Wage and National Minimum Wage rates have both been introduced. The new rates benefit the lowest-paid workers in industries such as wholesaling, retailing, hotels and restaurants. Average regular pay, before tax and other deductions, was estimated at Â£503 a week. However, when adjusted for the impact of rising prices, pay is still below levels seen before the 2008 financial crisis. Average pay was Â£468 a week when adjusted for inflation. This is still Â£5 less than the pre-recession peak of Â£473 a week recorded for April 2008. UK banks 'prepared for Brexit and trade war fall-out' UK returns to growth but slowdown fears persist The unemployment rate remained at 3.8% as expected, its joint-lowest since the three months to January 1975. But the growth in employment slowed to 28,000, the weakest increase since the three months to August last year. The employment rate for men was 80.2%, slightly higher than a year earlier, while the rate for women was 72%, the joint highest since records began in 1971. Vacancies fell to their lowest level in more than a year of 827,000 across the UK - 9,000 fewer than a year earlier and 19,000 fewer than the previous quarter. Some recent surveys of companies have suggested employers are becoming more cautious about hiring in the lead-up to the new Brexit deadline of 31 October. ""Despite signs that employment growth is tailing off, the labour market remains tight, with the unemployment rate at a multi-decade low,"" said Alpesh Paleja, principal economist of lobby group the CBI. ""It's encouraging that pay growth has picked up further, putting more money in people's pockets, but as recent data shows productivity remains in the doldrums."" Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, said: ""The jobs market seems to have defied gravity, with wages rising and unemployment falling even as growth has slowed. ""The big question is how long can that last. With job vacancies edging lower and firms more cautious on hiring, the pace of job creation could slow from here.""

"NCSC staff protect the UK from cyber-attacks from their office in central London An attempt to defraud thousands of people using a bogus email from a UK airport was one of a range of cyber-attacks prevented last year. The scam used a fake gov.uk address, but the messages were prevented from ever reaching their intended recipients. The details were revealed by GCHQ'sNational Cyber Security Centre in an annual report,external. In all, NCSC disclosed it had stopped 140,000 separate phishing attacks. This refers to the attempted online theft of bank details and other sensitive information by impersonating a trustworthy person or organisation. In addition, the agency said it had taken down 190,000 fraudulent sites. This often happened quickly. The centre said that 64% of illegal sites were offline within 24 hours of being discovered and 99.3% eventually went dark. This is the second time NCSC has published a progress report for its Active Cyber Defence programme. The effort - which uses a mix of automated processes to defeat internet-based threats to the UK - was launched in late-2016. One focus is to take down malware and phishing sites. This is normally done by finding out who hosts the websites involved and then telling them that their clients are running a criminal operation. Most providers take down the pages quickly, although there are some exceptions. NCSC has not shared the name of the airport the fraudsters attempted to impersonate last August. But it did say that the failed scheme involved sending 200,000 emails to members of the public asking them to pay a fee in order to receive a larger refund. Had the intended victims paid the sum, they would have got nothing in return. UK cyber-security efforts criticised by audit office UK cyber-centre thwarts hostile hackers UK moves to 'active cyber-defence' The security centre also took the criminals' real email address offline to ensure they could not receive any replies. Another success was an apparent reduction in the number of attacks in which fraudsters had posed as HM Revenue and Customs. Scammers often pretend to offer individuals tax refunds if victims provide bank accounts and a facilitation payment. At the start of January 2016, HMRC was the 16th most popular disguise used in phishing emails. By the end of 2019, a series of new measures had reduced its global ranking to 146th. Efforts were also made to prevent 1.4 million employees in the public sector from visiting malicious sites. This involved a serviceknown as PDNS (protective domain name system),external, which effectively refuses to query the internet's address book when appropriate. So, for example, if a user typed in a web address whose domain name had previously been linked to illegal activity -  eg dodgysite.com - the service would refuse to provide the related internet protocol address - eg 216.58.111.789 - required to connect to its computer servers. NCSC said that PDNS had handled a total of 68.7 billion queries in 2018, of which it had blocked 57.4 million. The PDNS system prevents connections to computer servers that are known to host ransomware, phishing attacks and malicious sites This included frustrating 450,000 queries related to WannaCry - the malware that took down parts of the NHS in 2018. A further 230,000 queries were obstructed relating to another piece of malware called BadRabbit. The system even found evidenceof attempts to spread the Conficker worm,external, which was released as far back as 2008. NCSC added that BT has been working on its own version of PDNS, and is blocking an average of 110 million malicious connections per month. Other incidents flagged by the report included: a primary school being involved in the spread of a large-scale malware infection because its anti-virus system was not working an unnamed public sector organisation that deals with sensitive information getting breached because its employees had downloaded unauthorised software at least 318 public sector networks still routinely using Windows XP despite Microsoft having pulled nearly all support for the operating system in 2014 In the future, the NCSC said it wanted to do more to map the UK's use of the internet, in a piece of research it calls the Internet Weather Centre. The aim is to understand questions like what are the most commonly used cloud services, and then use that knowledge to understand related vulnerabilities. It also wants to do more work to allow public sector users to scan and check how their infrastructure is exposed to the net to spot potential risks.

"Fishermen are continuing to illegally discard dead fish back into the sea, according to a House of Lords inquiry. The inquiry looked at the impact of the ban on fishing discards six months after new rules took effect. The committee's report said the new regulations have had ""little impact"", but industry leaders said this was the wrong conclusion. Fishing discards were prohibited after a campaign by the chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall. North Sea cod stocks fall to 'critical' level Fish discard ban 'can only harm industry' The EU regulations were designed to stop fishermen throwing unwanted fish back into the sea dead, instead obliging skippers to land them. But the inquiry report claimed little had changed since the ban came into force, with no indications of boats being forced to stop fishing or undersized fish being landed. This suggests illegal discarding is taking place, the report concludes. Lord Teverson, chairman of the House of Lords EU energy and environment sub-committee, said: ""Unless the discard ban is properly implemented and enforced the UK's fishing industry could in the future find itself with nothing left to fish."" Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said: ""The simple truth about the landings obligation is that it is a set of totally contradictory rules imposed by the EU which utterly fails to align fishing opportunity with the distribution of stocks. ""This has been pointed out by the industry to the European Commission and the UK and Scottish governments ad nauseam and they understand the predicament of fishermen. ""It will be up to those governments post-Brexit to devise a system of practicable regulations that achieve the objective of ending discards without tying the industry up in knots and the fishing fleet at the quayside."" River Cottage chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall began his campaign after making the TV show Hugh's Fish Fight in 2011. A public petition which followed attracted 870,000 signatures. He said the practice was a ""huge derogation of duty to protect our vulnerable oceans and sustainably manage our fisheries"".
