"BBC journalist Jennifer Meierhans, left, and friend Lucy Burn discovered the problem pricing when they happened to buy the same coat from different stores Online retailer Boohoo is investigating why the same items of clothing were sold for higher prices across a number of its fashion labels. The BBC discovered that Dorothy Perkins and Coast, which are both owned by Boohoo, sold exactly the same coat but it cost Â£34 more at Coast. There are price disparities across a range of Boohoo brands, which also include Oasis and Warehouse. Boohoo said the ""miscommunication was not intentional"". ""All Boohoo group brands work independently, and so this miscommunication was not intentional as teams are not privy to what's being bought and sold across the other group brands,"" a spokeswoman for Boohoo said. ""Our internal investigation continues and we will be re-pricing all the crossover stock to be aligned."" The price disparity was revealed after reporter Jennifer Meierhans bought a coat from Coast - as a friend happened to buy the exact same coat from Dorothy Perkins. The care label in the coat sold by Coast appears to have had the branding cut off The Dorothy Perkins branding appeared to have been cut from the care label in the coat sold by Coast. Boohoo said the coat was first sold by Coast and has now been re-priced at Â£17 on both brands' websites. Catherine Erdly, founder of The Resilient Retail Club consultancy, and a former senior merchandiser at Coast, said: ""If all Boohoo are going to do is buy the same stuff and slap different prices on it then it's destroying that brand's identity."" She said that while each brand will have its own ""architecture"" for setting prices, it is likely Coast and Dorothy Perkins had benefited from some kind of trading ""opportunity"", where a supplier had stock and both companies needed coats. ""But if they're going to do things like that, they didn't do it in a clever way,"" Ms Erdly said. ""The customer will sense that it's just trying to get as much as possible out of them."" She added: ""There's no way a Coast garment could have sold at Â£17 without losing money, a garment made for the Coast brand would cost more than that to make."" There are a number of instances where the same item of clothing is priced differently across Boohoo's brands. A long ""luxe"" padded coat in the colour mushroom was originally sold forÂ£89 at Oasis,externalandÂ£65 at Dorothy Perkins,external. The same coat in khaki was in the sale forÂ£30 in Warehouse,externalandÂ£66.75 in Coast,externaluntil the BBC brought the matter to Boohoo's attention. They are now both priced at Â£18. Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at consumer watchdog Which?, said loyal customers of these brands will be ""shocked and disappointed to see these stark price differences between seemingly identical items of clothing"". She said: ""People choose brands and stay loyal by expecting quality to match the prices they pay. ""Brands that offer a first-class customer experience and can be trusted are the ones that come out on top in our retailer surveys. This practice from Boohoo could risk undermining trust with customers."" Boohoo operates a number of different brands after buying up businesses when their owners fell into administration. Boohoobought Coast's online business in 2019along with sister brand Karen Millen. While in February, it acquired Dorothy Perkins, together with Wallis and Burton, from failed retail group Arcadia for Â£25.2m Boohoo said: ""Stock of the item in question was purchased and live on site by Coast prior to The Boohoo Group's acquisition of the Dorothy Perkins brand.""

"New rules to help pubs, cafes and restaurants reopen outdoors safely in England on 12 April have sparked anger from industry groups. All customers will have to sign in on entry, not just one member of the group like before. It is also unclear whether payment at the bar will be permitted. UK Hospitality said it would burden struggling pubs and staff and risk customers deciding not to go out. The government said it was providing as much flexibility as possible to venues. It also said it had removed other unpopular requirements such as drinking curfews. Under the new guidance,external, every customer aged 16 and over will have to check in to NHS test and trace before entering a venue, or give their contact details to staff. Lockdowns 'will waste 87 million pints of beer' Pubs and restaurants must take ""reasonable steps"" to stop people who won't comply from coming in, or they could face a Â£1,000 fine. Carl Ford does not like the new rules Carl Ford, an accountant based in Tamworth, told the BBC he was frustrated and confused by the rules. ""I feel like it's almost like going back to school where I have to sign in and out,"" he said. ""I don't understand why I have to do this in a restaurant or pub, but I don't need to do this in a supermarket where you have a free for all. People don't have to sign in and they can pick up fruit with their hands."" Others were supportive of the idea, however, saying it could reduce transmission. In a joint statement, UK Hospitality, the British Beer & Pub Association and the British Institute of Innkeeping said the rules would add ""more confusion and inconvenience for customers and staff"". They also warned if indoors payments were not permitted from 12 April, then some pubs, particularly in rural areas with poor broadband, would be unable to take payments at all. With the government also considering whether ""proof of immunity"" should be a requirement for entry, the groups warned that ""millions"" of people could be put off going to pubs and venues at a time when the hospitality industry is struggling. ""Pubs will already be trading at a loss when they reopen with all the existing restrictions and Covid-secure measures in place,"" they said. ""Adding further disproportionate and discriminatory measures threatens the very survival of thousands of businesses."" Hospitality businesses have been hit particularly hard by lockdown closures and restrictions. In the year to February,368,000 payroll jobs were lost in the accommodation and food service sectors,external. The next worst hit sector was retail where 123,000 jobs were lost. A government spokeswoman said: ""Public health rules are kept under constant review and we are providing as much flexibility for pubs and other hospitality businesses as possible. ""The roadmap [to reopening] set out that hospitality would open from step two, and removed any requirements for curfews or a substantial meal for customers."" She said no final decisions had been taken on whether Covid-status certification could play a role in reopening the economy. She added that the government continued to support the hospitality sector through the pandemic with its new Â£5bn Restart Grant scheme, the VAT cut, business rates relief, and by extending furlough.

"This video can not be played Who bought Lil Nas X $1,000 'Satan shoe'? Nike has won its lawsuit against Brooklyn art collective MSCHF over their controversial 'Satan Shoes' that contain a drop of real human blood in the soles. The $1,018 (Â£740) trainers are modified Nike Air Max 97s that feature an inverted cross, a pentagram and the words ""Luke 10:18"". MSCHF produced the shoes in collaboration with rapper Lil Nas X. It said only 666 pairs were made and all but one have already been shipped. Nike claimed trademark infringement, asking a federal court in New York to stop MSCHF from selling the shoes and prevent them from using its famous Swoosh. ""MSCHF and its unauthorised Satan Shoes are likely to cause confusion and dilution and create an erroneous association between MSCHF's products and Nike,"" the sports shoe giant said in the lawsuit. Nike, H&M face China fury over Xinjiang cotton New shoe tech is 'free time' in races Nike exec quits after son's resale firm revealed Lawyers for MSCHF countered that the 666 pairs it created were ""not typical sneakers, but rather individually-numbered works of art that were sold to collectors for $1,018 each"". Siding with Nike, a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order on Thursday. The impact of the ruling remains unclear as MSCHF had indicated it has no plans to produce any more pairs of the shoe. MSCHF ""dropped"" the black and red shoes on Monday, coinciding with the launch of Lil Nas X's latest song Montero (Call Me By Your Name), which debuted on YouTube last Friday. The song features the rapper, who came out as gay in 2019, celebrating his sexuality and rejecting attempts to shame him. In a heavily stylised music video, he slides down a pole from heaven to hell before dancing provocatively with Satan, then snaps his neck and steals his horns. The imagery and the shoes both reference the Bible verse Luke 10:18 - ""So He told them, 'I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven'."" Each shoe also features a signature Nike air bubble cushioning sole, containing 60 cubic centimetres (2.03 fluid ounces) of red ink and a single drop of human blood, donated by members of the MSCHF art collective. Lil Nas X and MSCHF's Satan Shoes sold out in less than a minute on Monday In its filing with the US District Court for the Eastern District of New York, Nike said it did not approve or authorise the customised Satan Shoes. ""There is already evidence of significant confusion and dilution occurring in the marketplace, including calls to boycott Nike in response to the launch of MSCHF's Satan Shoes, based on the mistaken belief that Nike has authorised or approved this product,"" it said. The lawsuit cited a tweet by popular shoe influencer @Saint from last Friday, which teased the upcoming release of the shoes and drummed up publicity over the weekend on social media and in the media in the US. Some conservatives, including South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, and some religious followers, took offence at the controversial design of the shoes and criticised Lil Nas X and MSCHF on Twitter.

Lil Nas X hit back at the governor and other critics on Twitter, tweeting several memes on his profile in response to the Nike lawsuit. Joseph Rasch of Tennessee, who paid $1,080 for the trainers, says he is worried the conflict means his money will be lost. ""I'm hoping I'll receive them since I paid for them,"" he told BBC OS on World Service radio, adding that he made the purchase not because he definitely planned to wear them but as a political statement.

"Not all energy marketed as green comes from renewable sources Energy suppliers offering environment-friendly tariffs are not always as green as they sound, experts say. Many ""100% renewable"" electricity tariffs use energy generated by fossil fuels, which is then ""offset"" for a small price. Sustainable energy think tank Regen complains of ""loose language and loose marketing"" around green energy tariffs. But industry body Energy UK says all renewable tariffs help to transform the grid for a low-carbon future. The vast majority of energy suppliers now offer green tariffs and many promise 100% renewable electricity as standard. However, some energy companies accuse others of ""greenwashing"" - using marketing spin to make ""dirty"" electricity seem clean. ""The sale of green tariffs increased remarkably in the period since 2015. In fact, it doubled between 2017 and 2018,"" says Rob Gross, the director of the UK Energy Research Centre. For many consumers, electricity which is environmentally friendly plays a role in which supplier they choose. That was the case for Su in Gainsborough, who told the Jeremy Vine Show on BBC Radio 2: ""The tariff we're on at the moment has 100% renewable electricity, so they source all their energy from renewables. So wind, solar, hydro."" We explained to Su that the supplier she was with sources the majority of its electricity from the wholesale market, which includes energy generated by gas and coal. Then it purchases cheap renewable energy certificates called REGOs to effectively ""offset"" this. That allows her supplier to legally call the electricity ""100% renewable"". Shift to green energy 'could cost oil states $13tn' Power companies 'hindering' move to green energy In response, Su said: ""I'm not very impressed with that at all. To claim that all your energy is sourced renewably and then to do that is very misleading. ""That's not giving consumers an informed choice about where they're getting their electric from."" Johnny Gowdy is a director at Regen, a not-for-profit organisation supporting the transition to a net-zero energy future. He says: ""The good news is, there's a lot of demand for green energy products and that's why the industry is responding to that. ""So there's a success story here which has been muddied somewhat by loose language and loose marketing around green energy tariffs."" REGO stands for Renewable Energy Guarantees of Origin. When an renewable unit of electricity is generated - for example, by a wind turbine - the regulator Ofgem issues a REGO to prove that this energy is green. The person who owns that wind turbine is now allowed to sell the electricity and the REGO separately. It means there is a marketplace where leftover REGOs are traded, and there are enough of them ""going spare"" that energy suppliers are able to purchase enough to cover the proportion of fossil fuels they sell to customers. Some industry experts are supportive of REGOs and many agree that they have a role to play in expanding and supporting the renewable energy market. The problem is how much they cost. They are cheap. An energy supplier can make electricity from the wholesale market, which includes fossil fuels, look entirely green for just Â£1 or Â£2 per customer per year. The majority of UK energy suppliers are doing this to some extent. The Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy says: ""We will be reviewing the REGO scheme this year. This will include ensuring people can make informed decisions over their energy supplier's green credentials."" For environmentally-conscious consumers, finding a truly ""green"" tariff is confusing. Many suppliers have contracts to buy electricity directly from renewable electricity generators and some invest directly in renewable energy infrastructure. These are arguably ""greener"", but tend to cost more. The regulator, Ofgem, acknowledged this when it exempted three suppliers from the UK-wide energy price cap. Ecotricity, Good Energy and Green Energy UK are allowed to charge more than their competitors because their electricity costs more to supply. Energy UK, the trade body representing all suppliers, says that the bigger picture is very promising. Its chief executive, Emma Pinchbeck, says: ""All renewable tariffs, including those with REGOs, are supporting renewables in some way. Over a third of our power now comes from renewables. ""The reason we're having this debate is everyone's so enthused about a low-carbon world and that's so exciting for us in the industry.""

"Lee Collins played 470 games in a career that began in 2007 on loan at Hereford United Yeovil Town captain Lee Collins has died at the age of 32. Collins began his career at Wolverhampton Wanderers and spent time at Port Vale, Barnsley, Northampton Town, Mansfield Town and Forest Green Rovers before joining Yeovil in 2019. He played his last game for the club on 6 February against Stockport. A spokesperson for Avon and Somerset Police said Collins' ""sudden"" death was not being treated as suspicious and had been referred to the coroner. Yeovil were due to play Altrincham in the National League on Friday but the game has been postponed. ""All at Yeovil Town Football Club are mourning the loss of club captain Lee Collins,"" a club statement read. ""Lee sadly passed away yesterday and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends. ""We ask everyone to respect the family's privacy at this time."" BBC Radio Somerset's Yeovil Town commentator Sheridan Robins told BBC Sport: ""The main thing that everyone will be feeling is a deep sense of shock. ""He was a real winner. I remember when he first joined the club we were at rock bottom having been relegated to the National League. ""In his interview he was said he wasn't there to make friends, he wanted to win. ""He wore his heart on his sleeve on the pitch and was known for his leadership, he was the epitome of a captain, he did everything he could in that 90 minutes to win the three points."" Collins had been out with injury for large parts of the season, but returned to the bench last week in the 3-1 win over Barnet. ""After the game I spoke to Yeovil manager Darren Sarll and he told me how pleased he was to have Lee back,"" added Robins. ""He was an old fashioned centre-half and we've not seen him play a lot this season because of injury."" Mansfield Town owner John Radford - for whom Collins played from 2015 to 2017 -tweeted he was ""shocked and saddened"",externalto learn of Collins' death. ""A no-nonsense, battling braveheart on the field and a gentleman off it. A man who always gave his all in Stags' colours,"" Radford added. Barnsley said they would pay tribute to Collins at Friday's home Championship game against Reading. Collins was part of the Wolves side, which included Wales keeper Wayne Hennessey and former Bolton midfielder Mark Davies, that reached the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup in 2005, losing on penalties to a Southampton team featuring Theo Walcott.

In 2017, on his application form to join the Metropolitan Police, Ben Hannam was asked if he had ever been in the far-right British National Party or any organisations whose aims ""may contradict the duty to promote race equality"". He ticked ""no"". Once accepted, he spent two years in the force, working among communities in north London, even interviewing suspects on his own. But, just two days before he applied to join the force, he had appeared in a neo-Nazi propaganda video. Deceit had become normal. Hannam in a NS131 propaganda video made the same month he applied to join the police At school he had a girlfriend of Mauritian and Muslim heritage, as well as friends from various ethnic backgrounds. Several gave evidence at his trial, saying he never showed any prejudice towards them. One grandparent is gay. Another step-grandparent is Jewish. Yet Hannam spent his weekends with neo-Nazis and collected a library of fascist literature. His beliefs were noticed by some. A teacher told the trial she had been unable to mark one essay submitted by Hannam - the first time this had happened in 20 years of teaching - because of ""concerning content"" and his ""intolerance"" towards Islam. He was also spoken to after students at his diverse school reacted to ""anti-immigration"" views he espoused during a debate. The Met never took a reference from the school. After he was charged, three experts agreed Hannam was autistic and that this was relevant to his interest in fascism, an ideology historically associated with order and structure. One said Hannam was well aware of what National Action stood for. The others said his autism meant it took him some time to realise the group was ""morally bad"". Hannam (second R) posing with a Celtic Cross flag Prosecutors said his diagnosis did not excuse his conduct or explain why he sought friends in a neo-Nazi group. Hannam had joined National Action (NA) in early 2016 while studying for his A-levels. He was active online, including on the image board 4Chan, and was attracted to NA after watching videos of co-founders Alex Davies and Ben Raymond. After writing to the group, Hannam was invited to meet older members in London and was soon travelling north to attend an annual conference in Liverpool, where he posed for a photo next to a man doing a Nazi salute which featured in a film of the event. Using an alias, he joined a neo-Nazi web forum called Iron March, which spawned several extremist groups around the world. Two neo-Nazi groups added to banned list The new parents and the UK's neo-Nazi terror threat In one forum thread started by Hannam, entitled ""Muslim shoots white man in London"", he asked for ""thoughts and advice"". When one user replied by discussing how to get a firearm, Hannam wrote: ""Care to help me out in this topic then? I don't know where to start with obtaining one besides a shotgun, and I don't think they'd be of much use"". He also used the website to help another student apply to NA. He suggested the teenager tone down his application, as otherwise ""you'll get the police knocking at your door"". During his trial, Hannam claimed ""there are no pictures of me doing a Nazi salute"". But the BBC has identified him at a fight training event, filmed for an NA propaganda video, which he arranged to attend in August 2016 with the other teenager. The film shows Hannam boxing with leading member Mark Jones, their faces blurred, with the whole group then saluting together for the camera. The BBC has identified Hannam (circled) saluting in a 2016 NA propaganda video That summer, NA - founded as a youth movement three years earlier - used social media to glorify the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox by a neo-Nazi. By the end of the year it was outlawed in the UK as a terrorist organisation, making it illegal to remain a member. The ban came as: Zack Davies was jailedfor attempting to behead a Sikh dentist in Wales a teenager was convicted of making explosivesin West Yorkshire and within months former NA spokesman Jack Renshaw was arrested for preparing to murder his MP in a terror attack and waslater jailed for life In 2017 the organisation re-emerged under new aliases, including NS131. Hannam continued to meet other members, pose for propaganda images to promote the new brand, and attend fight training. Another event, not attended by Hannam, saw members practise knife combat in a forest. Counter-terror police seized clear, raw footage of these events in September that year, when they arrested Mark Jones and the NA co-founder Alex Davies. But, despite the small numbers at each gathering, Hannam was not identified. Hannam (in white) boxing with Oskar Dunn-Koczorowski, watched by National Action co-founder Alex Davies (L) in spring 2017 Different counter-terror teams around the UK had responsibility for different group members, but some people - who may have appeared peripheral - were not a focus. Investigations had already revealed several soldiers were members of an NA chat group. One soldier, Mikko Vehvilainen, was stockpiling weapons and would later be convicted of membership During exchanges with other senior figures, Vehvilainen said members should focus on gaining ""military and key civil positions"". Hannam was only caught after anti-fascists leaked data online from the Iron March forum. Detectives reviewed IP addresses for British forum users, tracing the account used by Hannam to his north London home. The police investigation found no evidence he had been involved with NA after July 2017. However, there are hints that he did not break all contact with his past. Hannam at his passing out parade being reviewed by the Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick Even before his arrest, people involved in the group knew that one of their former members had joined the police, the BBC has established. Hannam also continued to access and save disturbing content, including an image glorifying the perpetrator of New Zealand's Christchurch massacre. In November 2018, he saved a photo to his phone of NA associateOskar Dunn-Koczorowski, who was arrested for terrorism offences the following month,but whose image was not yet public. In court, Hannam claimed he simply chanced across it online, but how it actually came into his possession is unclear. Commander Richard Smith, head of the Met's counter terrorism command, said he was ""hugely concerned"" that a serving officer had been a member of a banned group, but that he was identified at the ""earliest"" opportunity and officers then moved quickly to make an arrest.

"Officer Thao's police body camera showed witness bystanders Witnesses to the arrest of George Floyd have given emotional testimony about being at the scene of Mr Floyd's arrest. Mr Floyd's girlfriend, the teenager who filmed the viral video from the scene and a city fire-fighter who begged police to check Mr Floyd's pulse are among those who have testified they watched Mr Floyd under the knee of ex-police officer Derek Chauvin. The former officer denies charges of murder and manslaughter, and his defence team heard from a police officer who responded to the scene of Mr Floyd's arrest, a use-of-force expert and a forensic pathologist. Mr Chauvin has decided not to testify, invoking his Fifth Amendment right under the constitution to stay silent and avoid self-incrimination. Here's what we've heard so far. 'I had lost a lot of faith in God when I met George' Mr Floyd's girlfriend of the last three years, Courteney Ross, provided some of the most emotional testimony of the trial. She is, to date, the only witness to take the stand who personally knew Mr Floyd. She described their first meeting in the lobby of a Salvation Army homeless shelter, where Mr Floyd worked as a security guard. Ms Ross was waiting to see the father of her son, and she said Mr Floyd asked her to pray with him, a memorable and ""sweet"" gesture at a time when she ""had lost a lot of faith in God"". She said it was ""one of my favourite stories to tell"". The couple shared their first kiss that night, she said. Ms Ross also told the court they both suffered from chronic pain, which led to an off and on struggle with opioid addiction. ""We got addicted and tried really hard to break that addiction many times,"" she testified. She did not specifically address whether Mr Floyd was using opioids on the day he died. 'If I would have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided' The teenage store clerk who says he believes that Mr Floyd unknowingly paid for cigarettes with a fake $20 bill told the court he was grappling with feelings of guilt over Mr Floyd's death. Mr Martin, 19, said he had also been living in the building above Cup Foods, but moved after the incident and stopped working at the store. ""I didn't feel safe,"" the teen said. He said Mr Floyd ""appeared to be high"" that day because he struggled to respond to a simple question, but that he was lucid enough to hold a conversation. He described Mr Floyd as ""friendly and approachable"". Mr Martin, who witnessed the arrest, said he felt ""disbelief and guilt"" because ""if I'd have just not taken the bill, this could have been avoided"". 'I did call the police on the police' Among those to testify was a security guard and former wrestler trained in mixed martial arts who was heard in the viral video of Mr Floyd's arrest calling the officers ""punks"" and ""murderers"". Mr Williams, 33, had gone fishing with his son earlier that day, and had gone to Cup Foods to get a drink. ""I did call the police on the police. I believe I witnessed a murder. I felt the need to call the police on the police,"" he testified. ""That was bogus, what they just did,"" he told the 911 dispatcher, according to a recording of the call played in court. Mr Williams alleged he witnessed Mr Chauvin use a ""blood choke"" to cut off the airway, and a ""shimmy"" hold to keep up the pressure on Mr Floyd. He said he watched Mr Floyd's life ""fade away, like a fish in a bag"". Under cross-examination, he took issue with the notion that he and the crowd were growing ""angrier and angrier"". He said his words ""grew more and more pleading for life"", as Mr Floyd fell unconscious. When defence lawyer Eric Nelson repeated the question, Mr Williams again objected. ""I grew professional and professional,"" he said. ""I stayed in my body. You can't paint me out to be angry."" 'It's not part of our training and it's certainly not part of our ethics or values' The Minneapolis police chief, who oversees around 800 officers in the city, was one of the most high profile witnesses for the prosecution. Chief Arradondo, the city's first African-American police chief, fired Mr Chauvin one day after the arrest and previously condemned his actions as ""murder"". During the trial, he testified that Mr Chauvin violated police procedures. He said that Mr Chauvin had shown some ""initial reasonableness"" when he used force on Mr Floyd as he resisting getting in the back of the police car. But when Mr Floyd had stopped resisting and ""clearly when Mr Floyd was no longer responsive and even motionless, to continue to apply that level of force to a person prone out, hands cuffed behind their back - that in no way, shape or form is anything that is by policy,"" Chief Arradondo said. ""It's not part of our training and it's certainly not part of our ethics or values."" 'My instincts were telling me something is wrong' The first witness called to testify was a 911 dispatcher who had sent police to Cup Foods, where Mr Floyd had allegedly bought cigarettes with a counterfeit bill. Ms Scurry watched the arrest unfold on a live CCTV feed on a camera across the street from the shop, and thought that the video had ""frozen"" due to how long the three officers remained on top of Mr Floyd. ""They were still on the ground. That whole situation was still the same,"" she said, noting that she was also being distracted by other work matters at the time. ""My instincts were telling me something is wrong, something is not right. I don't know what, but something was not right,"" she said. ""It was an extended period of time."" She called a supervisory sergeant to report what she saw. ""Call me a snitch if you want to,"" she said according to audio of the call, adding ""all of them sat on this man"". 'We're lucky it was video-taped' The off-duty Minneapolis city fire-fighter was hoping to have ""a peaceful day"" and went for a walk, she testified. She noticed the lights of the police car, and wondered if her co-workers were responding to a fire. ""As I got closer there was a woman across the street screaming that they were killing him,"" said Ms Hansen, 27, who is also a trained emergency medical technician (EMT). ""I was concerned to see a handcuffed man who was not moving with officers with their whole body weight on his back and a crowd who was stressed out,"" she said. Ms Hansen described pleading with the officers to check Mr Floyd's pulse and to begin CPR. One officer, she said, told her that ""if you really are a Minneapolis fire-fighter you would know better than to get involved"". There were several heated moments during Ms Hansen's cross-examination by the defence. When Mr Chauvin's attorney asked her if the crowd had been ""upset or angry"", she replied: ""I don't know if you've seen anybody be killed, but it's upsetting."" In another testy response after she was challenged over her recollection of the incident, she said: ""We're lucky it was video taped."" This video can not be played New bodycam footage of George Floyd's arrest 'What I watched was wrong' The first bystander on the scene of George Floyd's arrest was 61-year-old Charles McMillian, a self-described ""nosy"" resident. He pled repeatedly with Mr Floyd to ""get up and get in the car"" and told him ""you can't win"". He also said the officers looked like they were trying to ""hogtie"" him. While viewing graphic footage of the arrest in court, Mr McMillian broke down in tears and was unable to continue his testimony for a while. In the video, the court heard him tell Mr Chauvin: ""Your knee on his neck - that's wrong man."" He described feeling ""helpless"" seeing the incident unfold. Mr McMillian said that he confronted officer Derek Chauvin after Mr Floyd was taken away in an ambulance because ""what I watched was wrong"". ""I think I said to him: 'Five days ago I told you at the end of the day go home to your family safe, and that the next person go home to their family safe, but today I gotta look at you as a maggot,'"" he said. 'I stay up apologising and apologising to George Floyd' ""When I look at George Floyd, I look at my dad. I look at my brothers, I look at my cousins, my uncles. Because they are all black,"" said the 18-year-old that filmed the viral video of the arrest. ""I look at that and I look at how that could have been one of them,"" said Darnella, the first of four witnesses who the judge permitted to speak off-camera because they were minors at the time of the incident. ""It's been nights I stay up apologising and apologising to George Floyd for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life,"" she continued. ""But it's not what I should have done. It's what he should have done,"" she said in a reference to Mr Chauvin. 'I was sad and kinda mad' Darnella's nine-year-old cousin testified that Mr Chauvin did not take his knee off Mr Floyd's neck even after ambulance workers had told him to. ""I was sad and kind of mad, and it felt like it was stopping his breathing and it was hurting him,"" she replied when asked how the event made her feel. ""It sounded like he was hurting,"" she added. 'I was failing to do anything' Another teenager present that day said she felt powerless to help as she saw Mr Chauvin work to maintain pressure on Mr Floyd. ""I kind of saw him move his knee down more,"" said the 18-year-old, ""down onto Mr Floyd's neck."" ""I felt like there wasn't really anything I could do,"" Alyssa continued. ""As a bystander I was powerless there, and I was failing to do anything."" Asked why she shouted to Mr Chauvin to release Mr Floyd, she said: ""I knew time was running out or it had already... That he was going to die."" 'I was scared of Chauvin' ""He was like digging his knee into George Floyd's neck,"" testified the 17-year-old. She added that Mr Chauvin ""did grab his Mace and started shaking it at us... I didn't know what was going to happen."" ""I was scared of Chauvin,"" she added. 'Derek Chauvin was justified and acting with objective reasonableness' The use-of-force expert, called by the Chauvin defence team, said ""the imminent threat"" posed by Mr Floyd was a major factor in his detention. ""I felt that Derek Chauvin was justified and acting with objective reasonableness following Minneapolis police department policy and current standards of law enforcement in his interaction with George Floyd,"" he said. ""From a police officer's standpoint, you don't have to wait for it to happen. You just have to have a reasonable fear that somebody is going to strike you, stab you, shoot you."" Mr Brodd added: ""It's easy to sit in an office and judge an officer's conduct. It's more of a challenge to put yourself in the officer's shoes, to try to make an evaluation through what they are feeling, what they're sensing, the fear they have, and then make a determination."" Defence lawyer Eric Nelson asked Mr Brodd: ""Was this a deadly use of force?"" ""No, it was not,"" Mr Brodd replied. Cross-examining Mr Brodd, the prosecution maintained that the dangers of positional asphyxia - not being able to breathe in a certain position - were well known. ""Would you agree that that's something commonly understood in law enforcement?"" prosecutor Steve Schleicher asked. ""Yes,"" Mr Brodd replied, confirming it was not new information. 'So many conflicting different potential mechanisms' The forensic pathologist who was chief medical examiner for the state of Maryland until his retirement in 2019 said the cause of Mr Floyd's death was not clear. He was questioned about the findings of the Hennepin County medical examiner, who ruled Mr Floyd's death a homicide. ""I would fall back to undetermined, in this particular case,"" Dr Fowler testified. He said, in his opinion, the cause of death was not clear because there were ""so many conflicting different potential mechanisms"". These complicating factors, he said, could be considered homicide in some cases, and accidental in others. Mr Floyd's consumption of fentanyl and methamphetamine, and his possible exposure to carbon monoxide poisoning from the police car's exhaust, were among the complicating factors cited by Dr Fowler. Asked about the cause of death, Dr Fowler said he believed Mr Floyd suffered ""a sudden cardiac arrest"" while struggling with the officers. Dr Fowler said Mr Floyd's health problems contributed to an erratic beating of his heart, known as sudden cardiac arrhythmia. 'Very aggressive crowd' The Minneapolis Park Police officer responded to the scene of Mr Floyd's arrest and said the crowd of bystanders was ""very aggressive to the officers"". ""Did that cause you any concern?"" Defence lawyer Eric Nelson asked him. ""Concern for the officers' safety, yes,"" Mr Chang replied.

"Pubs and restaurant owners had been keen to know when they could reopen Pubs, restaurants and hotels in Wales may reopen indoors in time for the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May. First Minister Mark Drakeford has set out a series of dates for easing lockdown, stretching into the next month. Under the plans two households could meet indoors from 10 May, if Covid cases remained low. Travel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK andCommon Travel Area,externalmay go ahead from 12 April. Restaurants and bars could reopen outdoors from 26 April and from 3 May, outdoor wedding receptions with up to 30 people may be permitted. But the changes could depend on the results ofthe Senedd election on 6 May, and whether the Welsh Labour leader is returned to power. The Welsh Conservatives' own plans would seemost rules on social contact scrapped by 17 May. Both the Tories and Plaid Cymru called forgyms to reopen now, while Plaid said the Senedd should be recalled to discuss more economic help for businesses. Under the Welsh plans gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities will also be able to reopen from 10 May. This will include individual or one-to-one training, but not exercise classes. Spring Bank Holiday Monday is 31 May, but the Welsh government has not specified an actual date for reopening hospitality indoors. It said after 17 May it would ""consider enabling indoor hospitality and remaining visitor accommodation to reopen in advance of the Spring Bank Holiday"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Delay to reopening gyms in Wales 'irresponsible' Cultural and sport events may welcome crowds back Only six people from two households will be able to meet in reopened beer gardens and should still socially distance. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the public emergency is not over. He toldClaire Summers on BBC Radio Wales: ""You see in the pattern a continuation of the step-by-step approach we've taken in Wales, doing the outdoor activities first because it's safer to be outdoors. ""But for the first time in the timetable we are now able to set out the first re-openings of indoor activities as well."" He added: ""The presence of the virus in Wales is the lowest in the United Kingdom, the rate of vaccination in Wales is the highest in the United Kingdom. ""On Saturday, we will complete the vaccination offerto everybody in the top nine priority groups, again the first country in the UK to get to that milestone."" Provided cases remain low, the following things will be permitted: Monday, 12 April Travel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK and Common Travel Area, dependant on restrictions where you are intending to travel to All non-essential retail and close contact services, like beauty salons, allowed to reopen Monday, 26 April Outdoor hospitality, including cafes, pubs and restaurants Outdoor attractions, including funfairs and theme parks End of 22:00 BST alcohol sale limit in shops Monday, 3 May Organised outdoor activities for up to 30 people Outdoor wedding receptions attended by no more than 30 people Monday, 10 May People will be allowed to form extended households again, allowing two households to meet and have contact indoors Gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities can reopen. Individual and one-to-one training will be allowed, but not exercise classes Monday, 17 May Children's indoor activities Community centres Organised indoor activities for adults, limited to a maximum of 15 people. This includes exercise classes Beyond that date, ministers would consider reopening indoor pubs and restaurants, and remaining visitor accommodation ahead of the Spring Bank Holiday. Lucy Hywel says throwing away stock has been painful Tracy Lawler, who owns The Dressing Room Boutique in Prestatyn, Denbighshire, said she cannot wait to reopen on 12 April. She said because her shop is ""is small and intimate I can keep it really ultra clean after each person has entered"". ""I'm probably one of the safest public places for people to come in and the government is saying to me that I can't open up [yet]â¦ very frustrating."" Lucy Hywel, who owns That's Lovely That giftshop in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, was also looking forward to reopening, but said: ""We're hurt and we're still hurting. ""I myself have thrown out loads of food, thousands of pounds worth of stock, even last week, stock I thought I may have sold in the lead up to Easter got chucked away and that pain is there every time you do something like that."" Victoria Hallimi says the past few months have been really tough Victoria Hallimi, who owns Victoria's Driving School in Swansea, gave her last lesson on 13 December but can now reopen on 12 April. She said: ""My phone was going a bit crazy last night as soon as the announcement was made. ""I was up until about 11, 11:30 last night scheduling everybody in."" She said the past few months had been ""really tough"" and her husband had been doing a lot of overtime to make up for her not being able to work. ""He can relax now,"" she added. Kelly John has not paid herself a wage since January Kelly John, owner of KMW Beauty in Maesteg, Bridgend county, said she has not paid herself a wage since January to ensure she had enough money in her business account to buy supplies when she was allowed to reopen. ""Luckily my husband is working, otherwise I wouldn't have a house,"" the mother-of-two said. ""But being an independent woman, it is really hard. I can't do anything - it's Easter this weekend and I haven't bought anything."" Meanwhile, the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective, which represents more than 400 Welsh hospitality firms, said it welcomed the move but ""continues to press for certainty and support"" about funding to support them while they remain closed. The plans will move Wales into the ""alert level three,external"" stage of the government's control plan by 17 May. While parts of Wales' lockdown have eased quicker than elsewhere in the UK, the Welsh government had been reluctant to set out a full schedule for when different sectors would reopen. Friday's announcement is the most detailed list of dates given by the government since the winter lockdown began to be eased. It does not go as far as England's tentative plans to scrap social contact restrictions by 21 June, although Mark Drakeford has previously said that's""very optimistic"". Mr Drakeford told a press conference the new ""indicative dates"" were are there ""to help businesses plan and prepare"". ""We have to remember that the pandemic isn't over - it's more important than ever that we continue to work together to keep this terrible virus under control so that we can go on unlocking Wales."" What can I do now... and what comes next? Some sectors like cinemas and theatres have not been given a date to reopen in Wales. Following criticism of his plans for gyms and leisure centres, Mr Drakeford said the sector will be the first able to reopen indoors. Pubs will be able to open outdoors two weeks after England. The first minister said he had considered bringing that forward, but ""the advice was very clear that that was not advisable on public health grounds"". First Minister Mark Drakeford has criticised Boris Johnson's roadmap out of lockdown in England as being optimistic The Welsh Conservatives' Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said Mr Drakeford's roadmap was ""very late in the day"". He said it was ""unfortunate"" that further funding had not been made available to hospitality sector - and said outdoor hospitality should be opening in line with England on 12 April. Mr Davies told Wales Today: ""What's really dumbfounding is that despite his mental health minister's assurances that gyms will be one of the first facilities to open, they are now not going to open until May."" Plaid Cymru Leader Adam Price said he would go faster on reopening gyms and indoor hospitality. ""We've also been calling for a much more accelerated timetable in terms of reopening gyms, because of their importance in terms of mental and physical well being. So I think it's disappointing to see that being delayed. ""There are dangers of course in moving too fast but there's an equal danger of being over cautious"". Leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats Jane Dodds said: ""Now that more and more of Wales is opening up and life is slowly returning to normal, it's time to put our recovery first. ""I want to see support for those individuals who will lose their jobs when furlough ends, those who are likely to lose their homes when the ban on evictions is lifted and those whose mental health has suffered as a result of this pandemic."" A UKIP spokesman said: ""With the success of the vaccine rollout, lockdowns no longer have any major impact on case numbers. ""The Welsh economy must be reopened now. Not in a month's time. This apathetic timeline will be the final nail in the coffin for many businesses that have been just about clinging on."" What are the stats in my area? The road out of the Welsh lockdown - key data to watch for The announcement comes as latest figures show admissions to hospitals of confirmed and suspected Covid-19 caseshit a record low- it stands at a daily seven-day average of 19. Covid hospital admissions are the lowest since the pandemic began with 17 confirmed and suspected Covid patients on Wednesday, with none at all in Swansea Bay hospitals.

Government's plans for the latest easing of lockdown restrictions. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said it was

physical well-being. ""So, I think it's disappointing to see that being delayed
until May the 10th,â he told Wales Today. âThere are dangers of course in moving too fast but thereâs an
equal danger of being over cautiousâ. 'Beer before exercise' Rodney Berman, of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: âI think
we are broadly satisfied with the pace.â He welcomed the planned move to alert level three. âThe fact that we've got a bit of a roadmap here, that we've got
a bit more clarity for various sectors - hospitality, gyms, I think, is to be
welcomed. â[But] youâll be able to go into a beer garden before you'll be
able to take part in even an outdoor exercise class. âThe important thing is that
we do now have a roadmap for when different things are going to open up, but we
maybe do need to look at the level of financial support to businesses that
aren't quite able to open yet.â  Financial support for businesses will not be interrupted and will continue throughout April, Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford told the press conference that Â£180m of funding was announced in the middle of March ""to make sure the businesses in Wales would have the help they need to see them through."" ""Businesses will see no interruption in the flow of financial support to them over that period"", he said. He added: ""Many businesses have already received the help that's available to them, and for others who are still in the process of applying, cash grants will continue to be paid during April as those applications are confirmed. ""And alongside the money that we announced and is already reaching businesses, we've also put Â£200m aside in the Welsh Government's budget for the next financial year."" Election rules mean the Welsh Government cannot make further decisions during the pre-elction period, Mr Drakeford added. Wales' first minister has warned the nation must ""work together""  to fight coronavirus. Mark Drakeford said: âToday, Wales has the lowest level of coronavirus of all four UK nations and the highest rates of vaccination. âThese are the reasons for us all to be hopeful and optimistic about the weeks ahead."" He added: ""We have to remember that the pandemic isnât over â it's more important than ever that we continue to work together to keep this terrible virus under control so that we can go on unlocking Wales."" Plaid
Cymru leader Adam Price has told the Welsh government that gyms should be being opened up as soon as possible. It comes as gym owners branded the delay in reopening their business in Wales as ""short-sighted and irresponsible."" Mr Price said ""gyms should be able to safely re-open now -
not least to help with people's wellbeing and mental health which has suffered
so much during the last few months"". The Welsh Liberal Democrats have called for help for people who could lose jobs with the end of furlough as lockdown eases. And party leader Jane Dodds called for support for those who could lose their homes when the eviction ban ends. Leader
of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds, said: ""Now that more and more of
Wales is opening up and life is slowly returning to normal, it's time to put
our recovery first. ""I
want to see support for those individuals who will lose their jobs when
furlough ends, those who are likely to lose their homes when the ban on
evictions is lifted and those whose mental health has suffered as a result of
this pandemic."" She was speaking as the Welsh Government announcedWales' pubs could reopen and families meet indoors in May. Wales' first minister has continued to set out his lockdown plans, into May. ""I want to see businesses open and trading,â he said. âWe all wantto see our pubs open, people celebrating getting married and Wales welcoming visitors again.â Plans after 6 May depend on the results of the Senedd election, and whether Mark Drakeford is re-elected. Mr Drakeford said if he returned as FM, on 17 May he would allow for: âBeyond that date our ambition will be for indoor hospitality and remaining visitor accommodation to be able to open ahead of the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May,â he added. âBut that as you will appreciate is many weeks from now, and the public health position at the time, will determine whether that is possible.â  Tory leader Andrew RT Davies has criticised the Welsh Government over changes to lockdown financial support for businesses. In a tweet, the Tory leader said that ""sadly"" it was not April Fools Day. ""Labour are keeping thousands of Welsh businesses shut until the end of April and cutting off vital support,"" he said. ""Itâs a dreadful decision that will put so many Welsh jobs at risk.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would  continue a âcareful, step-by-step approach, lifting restrictions week by week, provided the public health situation continues to remain favourable.â The focus for the next three weeks is to ensure all pupils and students return to schools and colleges from 12 April, he said. From that Monday, he explained:  Outdoor canvassing for elections can begin but within strict guidelines. At the same time the go ahead will be given for a ânumber of outdoor pilot eventsâ, including cultural and sports events. Mr Drakeford said his government will work with the Muslim council to consider how to help people to celebrate Eid. âThis is a significant package of measures, a series of steps forward in our journey back to normality and will give everybody a sense of life returning again,â he said. Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton said the overall public health situation in Wales was âremaining quite stableâ. âCommunity transmission is much reduced compared to a few weeks ago,â he said. Latest figures show the seven-day coronavirus rate for Wales has reduced to about 35 cases per 100,000 people, he said. The rate that tests are being returned positive has fallen to 2.5%.

However, he added there were âclusters of casesâ, which have been traced back to people meeting and mixing indoors. Dr Atherton said he did not want to have to advise the FM that lockdown restrictions need to be reintroduced, as seen elsewhere in Europe. By Sunday Wales will have offered a vaccine to everyone in the first nine priority groups, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. That includes everyone over 50, all adults with an underlying health condition and many unpaid carers. A minimum of 75% in each priority group will have received a first vaccination, Mr Drakeford said, describing it as a ""major milestone"". Latest figures show more than 57% of adults in Wales have had the vaccine, he told a press conference. He said Wales was âgetting closeâ to one-in-five adults having completed a two-dose course. He said this means the programme is âpowering aheadâ. Take up, he said, is excellent, with over half of the groups counted it is more than 90%. âThis is a truly remarkable effort and is down to the hard work of thousands of people who are working tirelessly on the frontline of the NHS right across Wales to make this happen,â he said. A total of 1,443,885 have now recieved a first dose of Covid 19 vaccine. A total of 449,538 have had two doses. There have been two further deaths of people with Covidreported in Wales in the past 24 hours, health chiefs say. It means the total number of deaths reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) since the pandemic began in March 2020, stands at 5,509. A further 188 cases have been reported, taking the total number of positive tests to 209, 532. Wales' seven day case rate now stands at 35. Pubs, restaurants and hotels in Wales may reopen indoors intime for the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May. The Welsh government also said two households could meet indoors from 10 May, if Covid cases remained low. Travel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK andCommon Travel Area,externalcan go ahead from 12 April and hospitality could reopen outdoors from 26 April. From 3 May, wedding receptions with up to 30 people can take place outdoors. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Gyms say the sector has been ""decimated"" by lockdown The delay to reopening gyms and leisure centres in Wales is ""short-sighted and irresponsible"", gym owners have said. Gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities will be able to reopen from 10 May, including individual or one-to-one training, but not exercise classes. But gyms are ""angry and disappointed"" and a body representing the sector said the decision ""doesn't stack up"". First Minister Mark Drakeford said any suggestion the decision was not based on science was ""completely untrue"". The Welsh government has announceda series of dates for the further easing of lockdown in Wales, including that pubs, restaurants and cafes could reopen outdoors on 16 April, and indoors after 17 May, provided cases remain low. But gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities have been told they will have to wait until 10 or 17 May to reopen. In February, Mental Health MinisterEluned Morgan said gyms and leisure centres would be reopened as soon as possiblewhen lockdown is eased to aid people's mental health. Both the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru said gyms should be allowed to reopen immediately. Pubs could reopen and families meet indoors in May Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Changes after 6 May could depend on the results of the Senedd election, and whether Labour's First Minister Mark Drakeford is returned to power. The Welsh government's decision is ""short-sighted and irresponsible"", says Jin and Matt Bowring Couple Jin and Matt Bowring run a small fitness studio in Penarth, in the Vale of Glamorgan. ""We are one of the only industries that has full control of our environment, from the clientele to cleaning to having the space to create distance between our clients and us,"" said Ms Bowring. ""We also provide a preventative measure by reducing harm caused by ill-health, obesity, diabetes and lifestyle - all causes of Covid hospitalisation. ""To have us as literally the last industry to open is short-sighted and irresponsible."" The continued closure of gyms is affecting members' mental health, says Evolve Fitness owner Stuart Morgan Stuart Morgan is the owner of Evolve Fitness, a group training gym in Tremorfa, Cardiff, which is likely to remain closed until 17 May. He said he was ""angry and disappointed"" that people will have to wait more than a month to get back to the gym. ""I have seen how it's affected people mentally, especially since December,"" said Mr Morgan. ""We have got members saying, 'We don't know how we are going to cope'. ""What the gym provides is routine, structure, a release, an hour of sanctuary. Taking that away is one of the worst things you can do."" Mr Morgan questioned the Welsh government's reasoning, accusing it of having a ""blind spot"" when it comes to gyms and fitness. Evolve Fitness says it has put numerous measure in place to ensure safety, including designated areas for people, temperature checks, track and trace and sanitising UK Active, the fitness industry trade body, said there would be ""mixed emotions"" over Mr Drakeford's announcement. ""I think there'll be some level of relief there's a date but the date should be much earlier,"" said chief executive Huw Edwards. ""The unnecessary delay is incredibly frustrating to operators who have to try to survive another month."" Mr Edwards said it was also frustrating for customers, and that gyms were the ""engine room"" for improving people's health. UK Active CEO Huw Edwards says he is ""surprised and disappointed"" at Mr Drakeford's announcement ""I'm surprised and disappointed. This is a health crisis,"" he added. ""It doesn't stack up to be honest. We've been in conversation with the Technical Advisory Cell throughout the last month to six weeks. ""They've been very clear to us there's been no new evidence associated with the sector, in terms of there being an area of concern, and so there should be equity of treatment for our sector. ""The data shows these facilities when they've been open have been Covid secure with incredibly low levels associated with it."" Speaking toRadio 4's Today programme, Mr Drakeford said it was ""completely untrue"" that the scientific advice for keeping gyms closed did not exist. ""We have published all the scientific advice that demonstrates the risks that gyms pose to the health of people that use them and the health of others,"" he said. ""It's a manageable risk and I have said today that from Monday, 10 May, gyms, leisure centres and fitness facilities will be able to reopen, so I don't know how much more clear we could be than that."" In a statement, the government said its decision was due to ""the higher risk of transmission indoors, and from aerosol transmission"". ""Gyms will still be one of the first premises where people come together over longer periods of time to reopen indoors, before indoor attractions or indoor hospitality,"" it added. Plaid Cymru Leader Adam Price said ""gyms should be able to safely re-open now - not least to help with people's wellbeing and mental health, which has suffered so much during the last few months"". Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies, said it was ""regrettable Labour have not seen fit to give the green light to the safe reopening of gyms given two months ago ministers claimed it was a priority, and considering the huge toll lockdown has had on the physical and mental well-being of thousands of Welsh people"". ""Getting people outdoors and active has to be a priorityÂ for any government and along with the decision to keep gyms closed until May 10, Labour are ignoring the science and ignoring the impact of exercise on people's physical and mental wellbeing,"" he said. Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: ""Any reopening must follow the science and the facts, there is evidence from previous lockdowns that gyms and swimming pools can successfully operate with social distancing measures and as a party we would like to see this achieved as soon as practically possible.""

"About one in five people have symptoms of long Covid five weeks after an initial infection and one in seven after 12 weeks, an Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey suggests. It estimates that 1.1 million people were affected in the UK in the four weeks from 6 February. About 20% of people said ongoing symptoms limited their day-to-day activities a lot. People were asked to report their own symptoms. The ONS survey,externalasked people if they faced issues such as fatigue lasting more than four weeks after a Covid infection that could not be explained by anything else. The most common ongoing problems included fatigue, coughs, headaches and muscle pain.

Despitea slight uptick in infections in children of secondary school agein the week to 20 March, there was no indication of that trend continuing in the latest figures. Among people aged 50-69, the study suggests a decrease in the percentage testing positive, which may be a result of this age group being offered vaccinations against Covid-19 in recent weeks. There is no universally agreed definition of long Covid,but it covers a broad range of symptoms.,external Meanwhile, in the latest daily figures, the government said that a further 4,479 people had tested positive for coronavirus and another 51 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. Although that latter figure is slightly up on the previous day, it is lower than the 63 announced last Thursday. And after Tuesday saw more second vaccinations than first jabs, that accelerated dramatically in Wednesday figures that have just been released. While there were 241,906 making their first trip to the vaccine clinic, there were 404,922 getting their follow-up dose. The survey of UK households found: People aged 35 to 49 were most likely to report symptoms, followed by those aged 50 to 69 Women were more likely to report symptoms persisting for at least five weeks after an initial infection Health and social care workers reported the highest rates of long Covid compared with other occupations, possibly because of greater awareness and a higher chance of coronavirus exposure People with other pre-existing health conditions that limited their day-to-day activities were more likely to report long Covid symptoms Long Covid is an emerging phenomenon that is not yet fully understood, and the estimates from the ONS are preliminary.

"Samuel Kasumu has worked for the government since 2019 Boris Johnson's senior adviser on ethnic minorities is to stand down, amid a row over a government-commissioned report on race. Samuel Kasumu is known to have been unhappy with the government's stance on racial issues. He has not commented on the report, which said the UK ""no longer"" had a system rigged against minorities. The PM said the report was ""original and stimulating"" but he did not agree with ""absolutely everything"" in it. Equality campaigners have criticised it for downplaying the extent of racism in British society and institutions. PM's minority adviser: Tories 'steeped in division' Campaigners criticise government race report Key points: What does the race report say? Former equality and human rights commissioner Lord Simon Woolley said there was a ""crisis at No 10 when it comes to acknowledging and dealing with persistent race inequality"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: The government ""won't agree with every word"" in report Labour's shadow equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova called the report ""divisive,"" adding it was ""no wonder"" the government was ""losing the expertise from their team"". ""To have your most senior advisor on ethnic minorities quit as you publish a so-called landmark report on race in the UK is telling of how far removed the Tories are from the everyday lived experiences of Black, Asian and ethnic minority people,"" she added. A Downing Street spokesman insisted Mr Kasumu had been planning ""for several months"" to leave government in May. ""Any suggestion that this decision has been made this week or that this is linked to the [commission's] report is completely inaccurate,"" he added. Samuel Kasumu may not be a name you're familiar with; even one minister awkwardly said they'd never heard of him this morning. But his resignation is a difficult moment for the government on the sensitive, divisive topic of race. Downing street has denied any suggestion his departure is linked to Wednesday's report. Without Samuel Kasumu's version of events, it's hard to know why and when he chose to resign - having changed his mind about quitting earlier in the year. But his departure leaves questions about the confidence some in government, let alone the public, have about the prime minister's approach to tackling racial inequality. Last year Boris Johnson said he wanted to ""change the narrative"" on this subject  - but this is unlikely to be what he had in mind. Mr Johnson said he had ""worked closely"" with Mr Kasumu - who will leave his role next month - and he had ""done some great stuff and I thank him very much"". The adviser had previously handed in a resignation letter in February, accusing the Conservatives of a ""politics steeped in division"". He had asked to keep working on a project to combat disinformation on Covid vaccines, with ""the view to leaving at the end of May"". But Mr Kasumu went on to retract this letter, following talks with vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi. Mr Kasumu has declined to comment, but sources told the BBC there has been an ""awkward silence"" hanging over Downing Street, with little discussion or movement since he first threatened to resign. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities (CRED) was launched last summer in the wake of anti-racism Black Lives Matter protests last summer. In its reportpublished on Wednesday,external, it concluded the UK was not yet a ""post-racial country,"" but family structure and social class had a bigger impact than race on people's life chances. It argued that racial discrimination has often been misapplied to ""account for every observed disparity"" between ethnic groups. And it said references to racism in the UK being ""institutional"" or ""structural"" had sometimes been used without sufficient evidence. Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a member of the commission, said the report was not denying institutional racism existed, but said they had not discovered evidence of it in the areas they had looked. The commission made 24 recommendations, including urging more research into school performance and for organisations to ditch unconscious bias training. The report was commissioned in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests in the UK Speaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said the commission had suggested several ""interesting ideas"" and the government would respond in ""due course"". ""I don't say the government is going to agree with absolutely everything in it, but it has some original and stimulating work in it that I think people need to read and to consider,"" Mr Johnson added. ""There are very serious issues that our society faces to do with racism that we need to address. ""We've got to do more to fix it, we need to understand the severity of the problem, and we're going to be looking at all the ideas that they have put forward"". The commission's chairman Tony Sewell, an education consultant and ex-charity boss, has meanwhile defended himself from criticism over comments he made in the report about how the British Empire should be taught in schools. In his foreword to the report, he wrote: ""There is a new story about the Caribbean experience which speaks to the slave period not only being about profit and suffering but how culturally African people transformed themselves into a re-modelled African/Britain"". Halima Begum, chief executive of race equality think tank the Runnymede Trust, said his comments were ""out of kilter with where British society is"" - and Labour's Ms de Cordova accused him of ""putting a positive spin on slavery"". But in a statement on Thursday, Dr Sewell said it was ""absurd to suggest that the commission is trying to downplay the evil of the slave trade"". ""The report merely says that, in the face of the inhumanity of slavery, African people preserved their humanity and culture,"" he added.

"Lee Collins played 470 games in a career that began in 2007 on loan at Hereford United Yeovil Town captain Lee Collins has died at the age of 32. Collins began his career at Wolverhampton Wanderers and spent time at Port Vale, Barnsley, Northampton Town, Mansfield Town and Forest Green Rovers before joining Yeovil in 2019. He played his last game for the club on 6 February against Stockport. A spokesperson for Avon and Somerset Police said Collins' ""sudden"" death was not being treated as suspicious and had been referred to the coroner. Yeovil were due to play Altrincham in the National League on Friday but the game has been postponed. ""All at Yeovil Town Football Club are mourning the loss of club captain Lee Collins,"" a club statement read. ""Lee sadly passed away yesterday and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends. ""We ask everyone to respect the family's privacy at this time."" BBC Radio Somerset's Yeovil Town commentator Sheridan Robins told BBC Sport: ""The main thing that everyone will be feeling is a deep sense of shock. ""He was a real winner. I remember when he first joined the club we were at rock bottom having been relegated to the National League. ""In his interview he was said he wasn't there to make friends, he wanted to win. ""He wore his heart on his sleeve on the pitch and was known for his leadership, he was the epitome of a captain, he did everything he could in that 90 minutes to win the three points."" Collins had been out with injury for large parts of the season, but returned to the bench last week in the 3-1 win over Barnet. ""After the game I spoke to Yeovil manager Darren Sarll and he told me how pleased he was to have Lee back,"" added Robins. ""He was an old fashioned centre-half and we've not seen him play a lot this season because of injury."" Mansfield Town owner John Radford - for whom Collins played from 2015 to 2017 -tweeted he was ""shocked and saddened"",externalto learn of Collins' death. ""A no-nonsense, battling braveheart on the field and a gentleman off it. A man who always gave his all in Stags' colours,"" Radford added. Barnsley said they would pay tribute to Collins at Friday's home Championship game against Reading. Collins was part of the Wolves side, which included Wales keeper Wayne Hennessey and former Bolton midfielder Mark Davies, that reached the semi-finals of the FA Youth Cup in 2005, losing on penalties to a Southampton team featuring Theo Walcott.

"Boris Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri at an event in 2014 The Conservative Party helped Boris Johnson pay his legal bills when he fought allegations that he had used his position to ""benefit and reward"" a US businesswoman while London mayor. The police complaints watchdog found ""no evidence"" Mr Johnson had influenced payments to Jennifer Arcuri and did not start a criminal investigation. A Tory spokesperson said the party had given the PM ""financial support"". This was because Labour had made the issue ""party-political"", they added. PM won't face criminal investigation over Arcuri PM's links to Arcuri referred to police watchdog The London Assembly's monitoring officerreferred Mr Johnson,externalto the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) in September 2019 over allegations ""from the media and elsewhere"" of misconduct in a public office. The investigation began after the Sunday Times reported that Ms Arcuri had joined trade missions he led, and that she had received thousands of pounds in sponsorship grants. It also followed demands from Labour for a ""full account"" of what it called ""grave and most serious allegations"" against Mr Johnson. The IOPC later found there was ""some evidence"" Mr Johnson and Ms Arcuri had had an ""intimate relationship"". But the watchdog discovered ""no evidence that Mr Johnson influenced the payment of sponsorship monies or participation in trade missions"". Ms Arcuri, a technology entrepreneur, has since claimed she and Mr Johnson had a four-year romantic relationship while he was London mayor. A Conservative Party spokesperson said of the IOPC investigation: ""This was a party-political matter, given this was a politically vexatious and motivated exercise by Labour politicians. ""Financial legal support was funded by the Conservative Party, as the matter was clearly a party political attack."" They added that the IOPC had thrown out the ""spurious complaint"", adding: ""The House of Commons registrar was consulted [about the payment to the prime minister], and all appropriate rules were followed."" The Greater London Assembly's Oversight Committee is separately investigating ""claims into preferential treatment"" for Ms Arcuri while Mr Johnson was mayor. Mr Johnson, who became prime minister in 2019, has always denied any wrongdoing. On Monday, his spokeswoman, Allegra Stratton, said he had acted with ""honesty and integrity"" as London mayor. She added that the prime minister would ""engage"" with the GLA's investigation but had ""no case to answer"" following the IOPC's findings.

"Chief Constable Simon Byrne faces questions at meeting of Northern Ireland Policing Board It comes after Public Prosecution Service announced no prosecutions of anyone who attended Bobby Storey's funeral The funeral last June attracted 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - when Covid restrictions were in place First Minister Arlene Foster called for chief constable to resign in wake of the decision - he has rejected that Earlier, Stormont Assembly was recalled from Easter break and MLAs passed motion censuring Sinn FÃ©in ministers Sinn FÃ©in was accused in assembly of showing arrogance and privilege; deputy first minister apologised for ""the hurt caused"" Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to examine Police Service of Northern Ireland's role in funeral Emily McGarvey, Stewart Robson, Chris Andrews, Edited by Fiona Murray and Iain McDowell That's all from us for today - thank you for following our live coverage of the Stormont Assembly and the Northern Ireland Policing Board. Have a nice evening! BBC News NI There's plenty still to come from the BBC News NI team this evening. In about half-an-hour Coronavirus Catch-up will be coming live from Belfast's SSE Arena - Northern Ireland's new mass Covid-19 vaccination centre. Presenter Jordan Kenny will be joined by senior GP Dr Alan Stout to bring you the latest developments and the answers to your Covid-related questions. Watch Coronavirus Catch-up live at 19:00 BST. Tune in on the BBC News NI website, the BBC iPlayer and the BBC News NI Facebook page. BBC News NI Sinn FÃ©in has been accused of showing arrogance, self-entitlement and privilege over its actions in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey. MLAs passed a motion censuring party ministers after it was announced there would be no prosecutions. First Minister Arlene Foster said the wake and funeral procession were clear acts of ""premeditated breaches of the Covid regulations"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who was one of the Sinn FÃ©in politicians who attended the funeral - apologised ""for the hurt that has been caused to so many families who have lost a loved one"". Read more:Sinn FÃ©in accused of 'arrogance and self entitlement' BBC News NI PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne has expressed surprise at the conclusion by the Public Prosecution Service not to prosecute anyone in relation to their attendance at Bobby Storey's funeral. Mr Byrne said he recognised that the policing of the former IRA intelligence chief's funeral last June had caused outrage and damaged confidence in the PSNI. He added: ""The PPS draw their conclusions but this is what we're wrestling with now."" Read more:Police chief 'surprised' by PPS funeral decision DUP MLA Trevor Clarke says he feels ""sorry for the rank and file officers out on the street on a daily basis"" as a result of the Bobby Storey funeral row. He probes the senior officers about a paragraph in the PPS report which he says states that a Sinn FÃ©in organiser told police that stewards would be in place outside Mr Storey's home to encourage social distancing, with police not needed in attendance. Mr Clarke asks whether that ""assurance"" would guarantee no prosecutions if another similar-sized funeral was to take place again? It was estimated that 400 people would be outside the home and ACC Alan Alan Todd says there were people there ""who shouldn't have been there"". ""It wasn't a deal, it wasn't an arrangement,"" he adds. ""We merely sought to understand what was happening so we could understand how we could respond to that."" Mr Todd says it would have taken time to make ""an informed approach"" in sending officers to the scene with crowds dispersing after a short period of time. The Policing Board meeting draws to a close. âI do not understand how people did not get what 'stay at
home' meant,"" says the SDLP's Delores Kelly. She asks whether the Sinn FÃ©in funeral organisation plan included numbers of how
many people would attend the funeral. Chief Constable Simon Byrne says that based upon a risk assessment provided by organisers that number was 30. About 2,000 people turned up to watch the funeral cortege. Chief Constable Simon Byrne says the PSNI is ""trying to make sense"" of how its ""legitimate engagement"" in relation to the funeral, which he compares to police planning for events such as bonfires, has ""put us in this situation"". He says police needed to get an understanding of how the funeral would play out in terms of Covid regulations as well as ""public safety"". ""That was not a deliberate attempt to give any community or any individuals a free pass at the regulations."" Mr Byrne continues: ""We are here to enforce and uphold the law. ""We went into this endeavour with an assumption that the independent investigator Mark Webster would follow the evidence and present his findings to the PPS, which is what he did, with a recommendation for prosecution. ""We find ourselves where we do but we are surprised at the outcome."" The Bobby Storey funeral was ""an epic failure"" and has moved Northern Ireland into a system of ""two-tier justice"", says the DUP's Joanne Bunting. She asks the senior PSNI officers why the force did not ask if the funeral organisers were asking people to stay away from the event. ""It was our job to explain what we saw as the regulations and encourage people to comply with them,"" says ACC Alan Todd. ""We were making various assessments of what the likelihood of that compliance was but I didn't and I didn't want my team to get into something that could be portrayed for what it wasn't."" He says the PSNI's approach was to have consistent with engagement with the organisers. Ms Bunting, an MLA for East Belfast, also asks if stewards and organisers of the funeral were assigned to a proscribed organisation. Mr Todd says he ""did not get into"" investigating individuals, claiming it was not his job to do so. Sinn FÃ©in MLA SeÃ¡n Lynch wants to know whether the PSNI can rescind finesissued to people involved in Black Lives Matter protestsin Northern Ireland last year. Chief Constable Simon Byrne says the force has received legal advice which states that it cannot cancel the fines. He tells the board: ""Because the fines have gone into the court after the penalty notices were issued it would be a matter for individuals to either contest the allegation which they face or for the PPS if they thought a ticket had been issued inappropriately to withdraw it."" ""I know there's differing opinions flying around in relation to this,"" he says. Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd says a ""plan"" was sent to the PSNI by the funeral organisers, detailing the logistics of the day, which officers then looked at. ""It wasn't the basis for negotiation,"" he says. The senior officer says he knew it was ""always going to be a challenging funeral"" with thousands of people expected to attend. ""We set our mind to what the tactical options were in respect of that,"" he says, ""which was evidence gathering."" Simon Byrne says that following Bobby Storey's death there were a ""fast-time dialogue"" between the PSNI and Sinn FÃ©in representatives regarding the arrangements for the funeral. Describing it as a ""series of short interactions"", Mr Byrne says he ""could have described that better"" during an interview on BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. Responding to a question from UUP MLA Mike Nesbitt, the chief constable says ""the sense of horse-trading was probably what you heard from the word negotiation - I wasn't trying to imply that"". ""I was trying to describe there was a fast-time dialogue just to understand what the funeral arrangements were so the commanders involved in that could make their risk assessments and prepare their plans and contingencies for that operation."" Chief Constable Simon Byrne says the PSNI ""went into this endeavour with an intent to police the funeral in a sensitive but proportionate way, recognising there were risks"". ""We went into this operation to gather evidence, which is what we did, in case there were breaches because there was always that very real prospect,"" he told the policing board. ""No one's pretending, to a certain degree if you like, we didn't see this coming."" ""We are where we are now and obviously the PPS are reviewing their decision and who knows where they may conclude, and we have to wait [for] that too, but certainly speaking for myself and for the gold commander, if we had anticipated this is where we would have ended up we may have taken an entirely different approach."" John Blair of Alliance is up next. The South Antrim MLA asks Mr Byrne if he will commit to a review of the PSNI engagement processes, which he hopes would be conducted in a way that ""would identify any issues that are causing problems, and remove any future problems"". Simon Byrne says he welcomes the engagement of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) as an ""independent body to come in and help us get an objective understanding of just what went on"". ""Regardless of what HMIC find in a few weeks, what reflection we're able to do ourselves, clearly there are a number of issues at the heart of this,"" the chief constable says. ""Firstly, everyone would have empathy with people who were unable to bury their loved ones in ways that we would traditionally expect. ""We have recognised from the outset, actually, how difficult policing funerals may have been."" First to pose a question this afternoon is DUP MLA Mervyn Storey. He begins by listing a number of events during the pandemic where believes the PSNI took a different approach to policing. They include Black Lives Matter protests. He says: ""While
my party leader has stated publicly what she believes should be the situation in regards
to your position, will you take the opportunity to apologise to those many hundreds of
families who were not afforded the privilege of police acquiescence or police
assistance in the spirit of the letter of the law?  PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne says he recognises that ""events surrounding the policing of this funeral have caused outrage and have damaged confidence in policing"". ""I am listening, but I am confident that my officers have acted with good intent and integrity, managing what was always going to be a sensitive policing operation,"" he told the policing board. In his opening remarks, Mr Byrne said he wanted to ""place on record"" his ""clear and unequivocal understanding about the sympathy we have for the hurt, concern and anger felt by so many people who complied with the health protection regulations over the last year"". Before taking questions, the chief constable stated: ""The PPS themselves, not withstanding some of the public and political concern, found no evidence that deals were done in the run-up to this funeral."" Today's public meeting opens. All attendees are appearing via video link including Stormont MLAs. The Chief Constable Simon Byrne is up first. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor We've had some heated and passionate exchanges in the chamber, not least from those MLAs who've lost loved ones and friends during the pandemic and were unable to attend their funerals. They had pointed remarks for both Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Conor Murphy, both of whom attended Bobby Storey's funeral last year. Even before the debate started, Sinn FÃ©in MLA and Speaker Alex Maskey was challenged for his impartiality, and that set the tone. Ms O'Neill was challenged several times across the chamber floor to apologise for her attendance at the funeral. She didn't do that, but she did say sorry for the hurt caused. This is a non-binding debate which means there will be a vote in the chamber, but there will be no effect on Sinn FÃ©in because this simply registers other MLAs' anger at what happened. In the absence of a court case, it's another chance for MLAs to deliver their verdicts. Ironically, ministers are likely tochange the laws around funerals again with a recommendation to increase the numbers who can attend to 35. It is easy to forget we are still plotting our pathway out of lockdown. Those are the big decisions, for some, which will be made later. No further deaths related to Covid-19 were reported on Thursday by the department of health, meaning its total remains at 2,115. There were 107 more positive cases of the virus identified, bringing the overall tally during the pandemic to 117,396. There are 17 patients being treated in intensive care, with 112 inpatients and nine requiring ventilation. The department statistics show there are five active outbreaks registered at NI care homes. To sum up today's proceedings in the chamber: Sinn FÃ©in has been accused of showing arrogance, self-entitlement and privilege over its actions in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey. MLAs passed a motion censuring party ministers after it was announced there would be no prosecutions. The funeral in June 2020 attracted 2,000 mourners at a time when Covid restrictions were in place. The actions of 24 Sinn FÃ©in politicians were examined, including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Finance Minister Conor Murphy.

Mickey the pony is helping book club members ride out lockdown We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's news: Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Swedes have
been told they canât be guaranteed more than one Covid-19 vaccine dose before 15 August, with ministers formally abandoning a previous promise that all
adults would be fully vaccinated during the first half of 2021. Itâs a major disappointment for
many Swedes, who had, for months, been told they should get two jabs before Midsummer in June, the biggest public holiday in Swedenâs calendar, when locals dance
around maypoles and dine on large buffets of herring and meatballs. At a news conference on
Thursday, Health Minister Lena Hallengren
said a shortage of vaccine supplies from producers was to blame for the delay. But Swedenâs vaccine co-ordinator
Richard Bergstrom told Swedish public service television network SVT that he
still viewed the overall situation as âa fantastic success storyâ, despite the
country missing its target. So far around 1.1 million
people (14.3% of those eligible for a vaccination) have had at least one
dose of the vaccine, in a country of 10 million. This is the wonderful moment 98-year-old Yoshia Uomoto was surprised by her son and niece in Seattle, Washington. It was her first in-person visit from family in a year. Mrs Uomoto lives at Nikkei Manor, a nursing home primarily for Japanese-American seniors. All the residents at the home have now been full vaccinated, allowing family, who have also had their jabs, to come inside to visit. Mark Uomoto, 68, told America's TODAY show that before this moment, they had been talking to his mother through the window, which was difficult as she has trouble hearing. ""It was so wonderful to hear, see her expression of excitement that she had because we've not seen Mom, my cousin and I, for over a year,"" he told the programme. ""So it was wonderful to see her and it was more heart warming for me to see her reaction and so happy to see us."" UK festivals are starting to reveal their line-ups as the nation slowly and cautiously comes out of lockdown - but there has been dismay, with the noticeable lack of women entertainers. One event in the spotlight wasKendal Calling,externalin Cumbria, whose first swathe of acts was predominantly male. Organisers said the initial line-up only reflected about 20% of the full programme, but Emma Zillmann, the festival's booker, admits the criticism was ""completely valid"" and women's names should be higher on the bill. Before the pandemic, the issue of achieving gender-balanced festivals was high on the industry's agenda through various schemes,such as Keychange,external, which aims for a 50/50 split across all line-ups. Last year,a new free-to-use database of female artists was published, providing details of more than 4,500 musicians in all genres of music. And Glastonbury'sEmily Eavis has previously saidher festival needs to achieve a gender balanced line-up as soon as it can.

We've been bringing you updates about long Covid after the Office for National Statistics estimated that1.1 million people were affected in the UKin the four weeks from 6 February. And many people have shared their experiences of the illness. Jade Gray-Christie told us that her life has been turned upside down since getting Covid in March 2020. For months afterwards she experienced chest pains and difficulty breathing. Sometimes she slept more than 16 hours per day, and struggled with the day-to-day activities needed to look after herself. She says: ""My fatigue was like nothing I've ever experienced before.""

In this video he says: ""It's like someone has piled sandbags on top of me."" Midwife Jo Aitken has been unable to work and needs a wheelchair to get aroundsince getting long Covid. She says: ""I can't walk more than 10 metres without needing a rest."" She cried with relief when her doctor said he expected her to make a full recovery. ""At the moment I can't really see an end to it, but him saying that, it kind of put the light at the end of the tunnel,"" she says. The NHS has launched aYour Covid Recovery,externalwebsite to offer support and advice to people affected. Russia has announced it has registered what it says is the world's first coronavirus vaccine specifically for animals. While scientists say there is currently no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the disease to people, infections have been confirmed in various species worldwide. These include dogs, cats, apes and even mink. To address these infections, scientists are developing Covid-19 vaccines that are specially designed for animals. Here's what we know so far. A total of 31,147,444 people have received their first coronavirus vaccination,government daily figures show.,external And 4,513,458 have received their second dose. There have been a further 51 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, the government'sdaily statistics show.,external That brings the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test to 126,764. There were also 4,479 new infections detected. Russia's Covid-19 vaccine,Sputnik V, has been authorised for emergency use in Kenya, the Health Ministry has said. It had earlier cautioned against the distribution of the vaccine, saying it was yet to meet ""all the necessary regulatory approvals for use"" in Kenya. Kenya received 1.02 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine under theCovax scheme, but uptake of it has been low, at only 5% according to local media. Kenya's vaccine rollout has been problematic, with hesitancy from healthcare workers, while some centres have run out of jabs or people who do not currently qualify to get the vaccine have shown up and been given the shot, AP reports. Though Africa was not hit as hard as experts feared during the first year of the pandemic, some countries are in the middle of sharp increases in infections, including Kenya which has seen a 53% average weekly increase over the past month. The capital, Nairobi, and four neighbouring counties are currently under a strict lockdown and curfew. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he is ""very worried"" about the impact of long Covid and has said it is one example of how important it is to ""tackle this pandemic for good"". His comments follow an Office of National Statistics (ONS) survey suggested 1.1 million people were affected by lingering symptoms in the UK in the four weeks from 6 February. Speaking during a visit to Public Health England Colindale, Mr Hancock said: ""I am very worried about the impact of long Covid"". He said it was ""one of the reasons we need to tackle this pandemic for good"" and explained how the government was ""putting more research money into tackling and understanding long Covid"". Mr Hancock went on to say Covid-19 is a ""very strange, very dangerous virus"" and said when it comes to self-isolation, ""the vast majority of people do the right thing"".
""If you suspect you have covid then it is vital you self-isolate to protect other people"". Read more about the ONS datahere. Premier League football matches have been played in empty stadiums during the Covid-19 pandemic. And for the first time there have been more away wins than home wins. BBC football expert Pat Nevin examines the reasons why Premier League teams have struggled at home since matches went behind closed doors. This video can not be played Why empty grounds have destroyed home advantage Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Weâve been looking carefully
at two parts of the infection survey data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) â because they were showing
rises last week that could warn about the risks of easing lockdown. But neither have continued to rise. In Scotland, where the
youngest children returned to school at the end of February, there had been
hints of rising numbers in recent weeks. And in England, we saw
increasing numbers of infections in secondary school pupils in the weeks after
they returned to school. But those rises have stalled - in fact, in Scotland, they've even reversed slightly - suggesting that the opening up so far is
not leading to rapidly rising infections. There is a wrinkle in
England, though. Public Health England (PHE) surveillance data show higher numbers of cases among secondary school age pupils than they have for
months. Some of these rises are due
to more testing â particularly the new rapid tests that all secondary pupils
are supposed to take a couple of times every week. Statisticians prefer the ONS infection survey because it doesnât get blown about by changes in who comes
forward to get tested â it picks a group of people at random and tests them. So, while the experts will be keeping a close eye on the
PHE surveillence data to see how this weekâs trend plays out, the ONS infection survey gives the
clearest picture of trends in infection levels. The new Moderna vaccine could arrive in Scotland as early as next week, Scotland's chief medical officer has said. Dr Gregor Smith told the Scottish government's daily Covid briefing the jab was similar to the Pfizer vaccine. It needs to be kept at low temperatures and will only be available at the very large vaccination centres in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. The National Clinical Director Professor Jason Leitch said the numbers coming to Scotland will be low at first - but described Moderna as a help and as an additional arm of the vaccine programme. It comes as Scotland recorded 400 new Covid cases - but with a very low test positivity rate of 1.8 per cent. Read more hereabout the development. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics More now on new data released by the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said there is evidence of a decline in infections in the South East and South West of England, of an increase in the East of England, but that the trends are uncertain for the rest of England. The ONS said rates fell in those aged 50-69 in the week to 27 March, but the trends are uncertain in other age groups. It means increases seen in older school age pupils in the first weeks after reopening in England do not look to have continued throughout March. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest that about 180,000  people in the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 March. That is 0.28% of the population or 1-in-360 people, slightly lower than 1-in-330 people in the previous week. The ONS said infections have âdecreasedâ in England and Scotland, are âuncertainâ in Wales and are possibly increasing in Northern Ireland . England:1-in-370 are estimated to be testing positive for coronavirusVs 1-in-340 last week Wales:1-in-570Vs 1-in-450 last week Northern Ireland:1-in-220Vs 1-in-320 last week Scotland:1-in-320Vs 1-in-240 last week Israel is already vaccinating all citizens and residents aged 16 and above Israel hopes to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19
vaccine to children aged between 12 and 15 from May,after the initial results of US trials suggested it was safe and effective. The country has already offered vaccinations to all citizens
and residents aged 16 and above, and it has administered two doses to more than half of its 9.3 million population. The governmentâs coronavirus czar, Nachman Ash, said jabs would be offered to the lower age group once the US Food and Drug
Administration and the Israeli health ministry had given their approval. The daily numbers of new infections and seriously-ill
patients in Israel have fallen as a result of its world-leading vaccination programme. Experts say children's risk of becoming ill or dying with
Covid-19 is tiny, but health ministry director general Hezi Levy told Army
Radio: ""We are seeing a rise in the number of children who are hospitalised,
and we are seeing children without symptoms but who suffer from complications.â âThe risk from the vaccine is much lower,â he added. Pfizer and BioNTech said the trials of their vaccine in
2,260 adolescents in the US ""demonstrated 100% efficacy and robust
antibody responses"". They also suggested there were no unusual side-effects. England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty has been speaking to a Royal Society of Medicine webinar about the coronavirus. In a wide-ranging discussion, Whitty has said those without Covid antibodies may still be protected from severe disease - and the slow easing of England's restrictions reflects how difficult the pandemic has been. He said: ""I certainly don't think you should assume that if you have lower or no antibodies that means there is no protection. ""It probably does mean you're more likely to get infected and it may mean you're more likely to be infectious, but doesn't necessarily mean you won't have protection from going into hospital, or having severe disease or mortality."" And he said caution around reopening was needed ""because we've got such a difficult situation to go through at the moment"". ""What we don't want to be is in a situation where we look back in six months and say 'If we'd only just been a bit more cautious for a month or two,"" he added. Whitty also predicted there could be a ""very wide portfolio of vaccines"" in around two years and that technology can ""turn around a vaccine to a new variant incredibly fast, compared to how historically we've been able to do it"". We've been reporting new research which suggests as many as half of all UK adults do not know the main symptoms of Covid-19. So how can you be sure whether you have coronavirus, a cold or the flu?

"About one in five people have symptoms of long Covid five weeks after an initial infection and one in seven after 12 weeks, an Office for National Statistics (ONS) survey suggests. It estimates that 1.1 million people were affected in the UK in the four weeks from 6 February. About 20% of people said ongoing symptoms limited their day-to-day activities a lot. People were asked to report their own symptoms. The ONS survey,externalasked people if they faced issues such as fatigue lasting more than four weeks after a Covid infection that could not be explained by anything else. The most common ongoing problems included fatigue, coughs, headaches and muscle pain. A separateONS study,externalestimates coronavirus infections fell slightly in England and Scotland, rose in Northern Ireland and stayed roughly the same in Wales in the week to 27 March. 'My fatigue was like nothing I've experienced before' Middle-aged women 'worst affected by long Covid' 'I can't walk 10m without a rest' 'Long Covid': Why are some people not recovering? Despitea slight uptick in infections in children of secondary school agein the week to 20 March, there was no indication of that trend continuing in the latest figures. Among people aged 50-69, the study suggests a decrease in the percentage testing positive, which may be a result of this age group being offered vaccinations against Covid-19 in recent weeks. There is no universally agreed definition of long Covid,but it covers a broad range of symptoms.,external Meanwhile, in the latest daily figures, the government said that a further 4,479 people had tested positive for coronavirus and another 51 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. Although that latter figure is slightly up on the previous day, it is lower than the 63 announced last Thursday. And after Tuesday saw more second vaccinations than first jabs, that accelerated dramatically in Wednesday figures that have just been released. While there were 241,906 making their first trip to the vaccine clinic, there were 404,922 getting their follow-up dose. The survey of UK households found: People aged 35 to 49 were most likely to report symptoms, followed by those aged 50 to 69 Women were more likely to report symptoms persisting for at least five weeks after an initial infection Health and social care workers reported the highest rates of long Covid compared with other occupations, possibly because of greater awareness and a higher chance of coronavirus exposure People with other pre-existing health conditions that limited their day-to-day activities were more likely to report long Covid symptoms Long Covid is an emerging phenomenon that is not yet fully understood, and the estimates from the ONS are preliminary.

"Mark Fortune failed to get on the list of fit and proper landlords in 2013 Flats owned by a man who was refused entry to Scotland's landlord register have been let out for residential use under the guise of holiday lets. Mark Fortunefailed to get on the list of fit and proper landlords in 2013after threatening his tenants. But rooms in his Edinburgh flats are being let out under contracts which do not give tenants the same protection as residential agreements. The millionaire property tycoon denied that he rents out flats. Mr Fortune said the properties are operated by limited companies, not him personally. This video can not be played Tenants have shared evidence of poor maintenance standards in flats owned by Mark Fortune. Former tenants have told BBC Scotland that they were given monthly holiday let contracts to sign, despite making clear they were in Edinburgh to live and work. People who have lived in properties owned by Mr Fortune have shared evidence of poor maintenance standards, such as damp, broken windows and faulty wiring, and some claim to have not had their deposit returned when they moved out. One couple said they were asked to leave a flat owned by Mr Fortune during the Covid pandemic after requesting that some repairs be made to the property. Gergely Farkas and Hailey La Sarre said the flat they lived in had a number of issues Hailey La Sarre and Gergely Farkas moved into a flatshare in Edinburgh in October last year. The flat is owned by Mr Fortune and their contract was with Edinburgh Rent Limited. Companies House has Mr Fortune listed as its sole director and the person with significant control. Hailey and Gergely said the flat had a number of issues, including a broken skylight and faulty electrics. When they raised the problems, they were told that they would have to leave the property. ""Your heart sinks,"" said Hailey. ""What are you supposed to do? You don't expect that. You ask for a simple fix and they say get out."" A damaged skylight in the property where Hailey and Gergely lived Edinburgh Rent told the couple their holiday let contract was not being renewed, but Hailey said this was not their understanding of the deal when they found the room listed on the flatmate-finder website Spare Room. She said: ""On their listing online it said that it was long-term lets, implying that we could stay as long as we want."" A group called Mark Fortune Investigation (MFI) said it had been contacted by more than 40 former tenants in flats operated by the businessman's companies. MFI said these people had shared accounts of the flats being in a poor state of repair with issues such as faulty boilers and damp. The group also claimed the majority of ex-tenants who contacted them did not get their deposit back when they moved out. Alessandro Carosi, a spokesman for MFI, said he failed to get his deposit back from a long-term stay in an Edinburgh flat owned by Mr Fortune. He said people had been contacting the MFI group because they wanted their voices to be heard. Alessandro Carosi said MFI want better enforcement of the existing housing laws in place to protect tenants ""The majority are foreigners like me,"" said Mr Carosi. ""A lot of them just move to Edinburgh and they cannot afford more expensive flats."" He said the people contacting MFI had been renting flats under holiday let contracts but living there for a long time. ""That is how Mark Fortune is making his fortune with people on minimum wages or foreigners who just arrive and don't know the rules or the laws,"" he said. One of the Edinburgh city centre streets where Mr Fortune owns property Mr Fortune is thought to own scores of flats across Edinburgh and is no stranger to controversy. In 2013, he wasrefused entry to Scotland's landlord registerafter being convicted of offences directly relating to his letting business, including threatening tenants. Edinburgh City Council said Mr Fortune last applied to join the landlord register in 2018 and this was refused. Mr Fortune told BBC Scotland this application was made in 2015 and that he withdrew it in 2018. Mr Fortune is listed at Companies House as the only director of a company called Edinburgh Holiday and Party Lets (EHPL). Last year part ofa housing tribunal ruling,externalsaid that a person living in a flat operated by EHPL was doing so on a private residential tenancy and not a holiday let agreement. It pointed out the person was living and working in Edinburgh and had lived in the property for seven months. The ruling stated: ""The agreement signed by the parties states that it is a holiday let. However, the evidence clearly establishes that it was not."" The ruling goes on to say that EHPL ""appears to have called the tenancy agreement a holiday let in an attempt to avoid security of tenure and the requirement to serve proper notice and apply to the tribunal for an eviction order"". BBC Scotland showed one of the ""holiday let"" agreements used by one of Mr Fortune's firms to Catherine McQuarrie, a residential tenancy law specialist at TC Young Solicitors. She pointed out a number of problems with the one-page contract, which quoted legislation that had been superseded. She said: ""It's quite clear from the wording of the document that the person using this is attempting to get out of complying with the legislation that would otherwise apply to protect the tenant. ""Essentially you can't have a holiday let if you're not on holiday. It's as simple as that. ""That simply means that the agreement is null and void and instead the parties have a private residential tenancy agreement."" Holiday lets are exempt from tenant protections such as the landlord registration scheme and putting deposits into third-party protection schemes. Mr Fortune told BBC Scotland he was not banned from the landlord register but that a decision was taken to not place his name on the list of Scotland's approved landlords. He added: ""I do not operate as a landlord, any properties both residential or commercial are operated by limited companies having been granted a licence by myself which allows commercial subletting. ""All deposits that were due for refund have, I'm advised, been refunded."" Mr Fortune said the complaints raised represent a ""very small percentage of overall residents"" of  the 160 properties he says he owns.

"Many students are still waiting to find out what will happen about their courses this summer University leaders are lobbying for a return to campuses this month for all students in England - from 12 April rather than suggestions of 17 May. Many students ""feel they have been forgotten by government"", said Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of universities. About a million students are still only studying online. The Department for Education says return dates will be reviewed ""by the end of the Easter holidays"". This timetable is understood to mean by the end of next week. But students have been promised at least a week's notice, which would mean a decision for a return from 12 April would have to be announced over the Easter weekend. Universities UK says ""concerns are growing that the next stage of student returns will be delayed until 17 May at the earliest"". That would mean that many students, paying full fees and in some cases rent, would see their summer term on campus shrinking to a few weeks, before ending in June. Student mental health worse in the pandemic Universities pay out Â£5,000 for less valuable experience 'Right and just' for students to get Covid refunds 'We're paying for what we're not getting' It would add pressure to calls for students to be given refunds after a second year of disruption. While schools and colleges had a big back-to-school return in March, much of university teaching has remained off-campus and online, with no date for a return. Students on practical courses have already been able to return Some practical courses, requiring hands-on training, have returned, with Universities UK estimating that half of 2.1 million students do not have any indication of when they might go back. In some universities, teaching is going to remain online for the rest of the academic year. ""There are university students across the country on courses such as business, maths and languages who are still waiting to find when - or even if - they will be able to return to in-person teaching this year,"" says Dr Bradshaw, head of the Russell Group of 24 leading research universities. ""We are particularly concerned about the impact on student mental health,"" he says. Dr Bradshaw urged ministers to allow students to go back for in-person teaching from 12 April - arguing that there was little evidence that it would threaten a significant increase in infections. A survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute found thattwo-thirds of students have been staying in their term-time accommodation,even if studying online, suggesting there would be less of a mass migration than at the start of the academic year. ""We have shared comprehensive evidence with the government on the clear benefits of a 12 April return to in-person activities for students' mental health and wellbeing,"" said a Universities UK spokeswoman. Debra Humphris, chair of the University Alliance group of universities, said an earlier return would be particularly important for those students graduating this year - who want the ""face-to-face employability support"" before entering an ""uncertain job market"". But the UCU lecturers' union has rejected calls for a campus return this month - saying it ""smacks of self-interest and risks the safety of staff, students and the wider public"". Jo Grady, the union's general secretary, said ""vice-chancellors lured students to university with the promise of a relatively normal campus experience, only for them to be left facing long periods in lockdown. ""Universities should not now be asking hundreds of thousands of students to return for in-person teaching after Easter when most courses will only have revision classes and exams left,"" said Dr Grady. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We will be reviewing options for the timing of the return of all remaining students by the end of the Easter holidays. ""Decisions will take into account the need to protect progress across the wider roadmap out of the pandemic, including the spread of the virus in communities and pressures on the NHS.""

"Mr Okorogheye was in the first year of a business and IT degree at Oxford Brookes University when he disappeared A student with sickle cell disease who has been missing for more than a week has not made any calls on his phone, the Met Police said. Richard Okorogheye has not been seen by his family since 22 March when he left their home in the Ladbroke Grove area. The 19-year-old, who has sickle cell disease, later took a taxi to Loughton, Essex, where he was spotted on CCTV. Since then there has been ""no activity on his phone that we are aware of,"" Det Supt Danny Gosling said. Officers are still investigating whether there has been any financial activity under Mr Okorogheye's name and the teenager's laptop and computer are being examined at a police lab for clues, Mr Gosling added. The 19-year-old left home without his medication Mr Okorogheye did not take his medication or any money when he left home. He was seen boarding the number 23 bus southbound in Ladbroke Grove, Kensington, at about 20:45 GMT on 22 March. CCTV footage showed the Oxford Brookes student was dressed all in black and had a black satchel bag with a white Adidas logo across his lower back. He is now known to have taken a taxi from west London to Loughton where he was then captured on CCTV, walking alone on Smarts Lane towards Epping Forest at 00:39 GMT on 23 March. ""A large number of special search officers are focusing on the Epping Forest area,"" Mr Gosling said. CCTV images show Richard Okorogheye at about 00:30 BST in Loughton, in the Epping Forest Mr Okorogheye's mother, Evidence Joel, previously claimed that whenhis disappearance was first reported, police ""did nothing""and initially told her he was an adult, who could go out and come back whenever he wanted. She said she told officers he had ""no jacket, no money, so I'm worried, I'm concerned about his wellbeing"" but that it was only on the Sunday and Monday following his disappearance that she ""felt like they were doing something"".

"This video can not be played Hans Kluge tells the BBC: ""Covid-19 is now a vaccine preventable disease"" The World Health Organization (WHO) has criticised the rollout of coronavirus vaccines in Europe as being ""unacceptably slow"". It also says the situation in the region is more worrying than it has been for several months. Vaccination campaigns in much of Europe have been hit by delays and the number of infections is rising. France is the latest country to announce new lockdown measures, lasting four weeks. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? How is Europe dealing with the third wave? ""Vaccines present our best way out of this pandemic... However, the rollout of these vaccines is unacceptably slow"" and is prolonging the pandemic in the wider Europe region,WHO director for Europe Hans Kluge said in a statement,external. ""We must speed up the process by ramping up manufacturing, reducing barriers to administering vaccines, and using every single vial we have in stock, now,"" he added. In the meantime, as long as vaccine coverage remained low, he said EU countries would have to impose lockdowns and other measures to compensate for the delays. Mr Kluge also warned that the vaccine rollout, despite its slow speed, risked ""providing a false sense of security to authorities and the public alike"". Last week saw increasing transmission of Covid-19 in the majority of countries in the WHO European region - which includes more than 50 countries and extends from Greenland to the far east of Russia. There were 1.6 million new cases and close to 24,000 deaths, the WHO said. Cases were rising in all but one age group, the organisation said. Only 10% of the nearly 900 million people in the region have had a single dose of coronavirus vaccine. Europe's vaccination campaign has been hit by delays It remains the second most affected by the virus of all the world's regions, with the total number of deaths fast approaching one million and the total number of cases about to surpass 45 million, it added. The WHO also warned of the risks of greater spread associated with increased mobility and number of gatherings over the forthcoming religious holidays of Passover, Easter and Ramadan. Some 27 countries of the more than 50 included in the WHO Europe region have implemented partial or full coronavirus lockdowns. Only 16% of the EU's population has so far received a dose of vaccine. The EU was slow to negotiate a contract with vaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca which caused supply problems. It also sparked a political row with the UK, where AstraZeneca has plants and where 52% of the population has had at least one dose. The EU's deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also ran into early problems with production and distribution. EU regulators were then slow to authorise vaccines for use. Some EU countries subsequently paused their rollouts of the AstraZeneca jab over reports of blood clots among a small number of people who had received a dose. Others restricted its use among older people over concerns that the company had not provided enough testing data. All this has led to low public confidence in the AstraZeneca vaccine. Polling company YouGov says only a third of Germans and less than a quarter of French respondents now consider it safe. The WHO and the European Medicines Agency, however, say the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks. Vaccine rollout in some non-EU countries in the WHO's Europe area has also been slow. In Russia some people are hesitant to be vaccinated with Russia's own Sputnik V vaccine, for which safety data has been made public and which has been shown to be effective. Why many in Russia are reluctant to have Sputnik vaccine Meanwhile Ukraine received its first shipment of vaccines in late February - 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India. But there is widespread scepticism towards vaccination - last month the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found 60% of Ukrainians did not want a jab. However, a bright spot in Europe is Serbia in the Balkans, which has vaccinated more than two million of its seven-million population thanks to early deals with vaccine providers including China's Sinopharm. It has also vaccinated migrants and citizens of neighbouring countries. What else is happening around Europe? After President Emmanuel Macron announced new restrictions inFranceon Wednesday evening, Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Thursday morning at the National Assembly: ""The third wave is here."" He announced more detailed measures including a ban on alcohol in public spaces.France is set to begin a limited lockdown for four weeks from Saturday night, with travel restrictions extended from 19 areas to the entire country Some 35,000Germandoctors are to begin offering vaccinations at their practices after Easter, and 1.4m doses have been ordered for this part of the campaign Eurovisionis to take place in Rotterdam's Ahoy arena in May.

"Nicola Sturgeon believes a simple majority is the way the SNP will make progress on Scottish independence The leader of the SNP has insisted her party was ""not divided"". Speaking onBBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme, Nicola Sturgeon said her aim at May's Holyrood election was winning a ""simple majority"". She rejected Alex Salmond's idea of creating a ""super majority"" by encouraging voters to back his newly-formed Alba Party on the regional list. The former first minister said he wanted to work with an SNP government to advance the cause of independence. He told theBBC's Today programmethat that cause was ""much, much bigger than personalities"". Scottish election 2021: Who should I vote for? The Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon story Ms Sturgeon denied that the SNP was suffering from internal issues and said support had ""never been higher"". She explained: ""I know I lead a party that has a growing membership just now and has a commanding position in the opinion polls. ""The breakdown of opinion polls that tests the views and attitudes of SNP voters show the SNP is actually the most united of all the parties in Scotland."" SCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS What elections are happening?On 6 May, people across Scotland will vote to elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the Scottish government.Find out more here. What powers does the Scottish Parliament have?MSPs pass laws on most aspects of day-to-day life in Scotland, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes and welfare benefits. Defence, foreign policy and immigration are decided by the UK Parliament. How do I vote?Â Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You canÂregister to vote online,external. Ms Sturgeon went to say that she was concentrating on winning a ""simple majority"" and if people wanted an SNP government, and her as first minister, then voting for the nationalists was the only way to bring that about. She said: ""You only have to cast your mind back to the days when Alex Salmond was leader of the SNP and he didn't say what he is saying now. ""What he said then, and he was right then, is that the only way to make sure you get the government you want is to vote for the party that will be that government. ""Anything else is trying to gamble with the system, game the system, take a chance on the outcome of the election. ""If you want to see an SNP government elected that then has the ability to deliver an independence referendum, you don't get that by voting for somebody else."" Nicola Sturgeon insists that there is no split within the independence movement. But it is inescapable that at the same moment she was being interviewed on Radio Scotland, her predecessor Alex Salmond was speaking on Radio 4 as the leader of a rival party. The two were once aninseparable double act atop the SNP, which took Scotland to the brink of independence. But he has now formed his own breakaway group, populated with defectors from the SNP including two sitting MPs. The fact that many of these defectors have left the SNP over various policy differences means there is sure to be friction between their manifesto pledges too. So, Mr Salmond's very presence in the race raises questions for Ms Sturgeon - even over her core objective of independence, which her party can no longer own as home turf. She now has to spend precious time talking about his vision, instead of her own. Both leaders may insist that their campaigns will be positive and do not pose a threat to the cause they share, but in many ways Holyrood is no longer big enough for the both of them. Ms Sturgeon told listeners that two things were required to win independence - a majority in the Scottish Parliament to bring about a referendum and, ""crucially"", winning majority support among the Scottish population. She said: ""Anybody who tries to suggest there's a shortcut to that, or that we can somehow game or trick our way to independence, frankly, is misleading people. It's got to be through a process that is not just legitimate but seen to be legitimate so that it can command respect and authority at home and internationally as well."" On SNP politicians leaving the party to stand at the Holyrood election for the Alba Party she said she was ""not sure it is as many as Mr Salmond might have been hoping for"". She added: ""I also don't think this is a friendly gesture on Mr Salmond's part towards the SNP."" Mr Salmond said he wanted to work with an SNP government to advance the cause of independence Last week,former SNP leader Mr Salmond announced the creation of a new pro-independence party. He said the Alba Party would not field candidates in any of the 73 constituency seats - but the party will field four candidates in each of the eight regional lists. Speaking on Today, Mr Salmond said that securing a ""super majority"" of pro-independence parties at Holyrood would ""strengthen immeasurably Scotland's hand in negotiating with a Tory PM"". He added: ""From 2007 to 2011 I was first minister and I was negotiated first with Gordon Brown. ""No Tory PM will want to be to trying to face down an entire parliament and an entire people."" WHO KILLED EMMA?Journalist Sam Poling investigates the unsolved murder of a young woman in an eight-part podcast for BBC Sounds PODLITICAL:Updates from the campaign Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Ms Sturgeon's comments were ""the clearest sign yet that the SNP will put another referendum before Scotland's recovery."" He added: ""The Institute for Fiscal Studies demonstrated this week that higher levels of public spending in Scotland is possible because we're part of the United Kingdom. ""The UK furlough scheme is still protecting Scottish jobs and people are still getting Covid jags in their arms - but Nicola Sturgeon thinks risking all of that is what's best for Scotland?"" The Scottish Liberal Democrats said Ms Sturgeon had ""once again made it very clear that her only priority this election is another independence referendum"". The party's campaign chairman, Alistair Carmichael, said: ""This is not what Scotland needs. ""Scotland needs a needle-sharp focus on green and secure jobs, a plan to help education bounce back and supporting the NHS and mental health."" Scottish Labour has said the focus of the next parliament should be on recovering from the pandemic and rebuilding the country's economy and health service rather than arguing about the constitution. But the Scottish Greens believe a referendum is needed within the next five years because ""decisions about Scotland should be made by the Scottish people.""

"Mark Fortune failed to get on the list of fit and proper landlords in 2013 Flats owned by a man who was refused entry to Scotland's landlord register have been let out for residential use under the guise of holiday lets. Mark Fortunefailed to get on the list of fit and proper landlords in 2013after threatening his tenants. But rooms in his Edinburgh flats are being let out under contracts which do not give tenants the same protection as residential agreements. The millionaire property tycoon denied that he rents out flats. Mr Fortune said the properties are operated by limited companies, not him personally. This video can not be played Tenants have shared evidence of poor maintenance standards in flats owned by Mark Fortune. Former tenants have told BBC Scotland that they were given monthly holiday let contracts to sign, despite making clear they were in Edinburgh to live and work. People who have lived in properties owned by Mr Fortune have shared evidence of poor maintenance standards, such as damp, broken windows and faulty wiring, and some claim to have not had their deposit returned when they moved out. One couple said they were asked to leave a flat owned by Mr Fortune during the Covid pandemic after requesting that some repairs be made to the property. Gergely Farkas and Hailey La Sarre said the flat they lived in had a number of issues Hailey La Sarre and Gergely Farkas moved into a flatshare in Edinburgh in October last year. The flat is owned by Mr Fortune and their contract was with Edinburgh Rent Limited. Companies House has Mr Fortune listed as its sole director and the person with significant control. Hailey and Gergely said the flat had a number of issues, including a broken skylight and faulty electrics. When they raised the problems, they were told that they would have to leave the property. ""Your heart sinks,"" said Hailey. ""What are you supposed to do? You don't expect that. You ask for a simple fix and they say get out."" A damaged skylight in the property where Hailey and Gergely lived Edinburgh Rent told the couple their holiday let contract was not being renewed, but Hailey said this was not their understanding of the deal when they found the room listed on the flatmate-finder website Spare Room. She said: ""On their listing online it said that it was long-term lets, implying that we could stay as long as we want."" A group called Mark Fortune Investigation (MFI) said it had been contacted by more than 40 former tenants in flats operated by the businessman's companies. MFI said these people had shared accounts of the flats being in a poor state of repair with issues such as faulty boilers and damp. The group also claimed the majority of ex-tenants who contacted them did not get their deposit back when they moved out. Alessandro Carosi, a spokesman for MFI, said he failed to get his deposit back from a long-term stay in an Edinburgh flat owned by Mr Fortune. He said people had been contacting the MFI group because they wanted their voices to be heard. Alessandro Carosi said MFI want better enforcement of the existing housing laws in place to protect tenants ""The majority are foreigners like me,"" said Mr Carosi. ""A lot of them just move to Edinburgh and they cannot afford more expensive flats."" He said the people contacting MFI had been renting flats under holiday let contracts but living there for a long time. ""That is how Mark Fortune is making his fortune with people on minimum wages or foreigners who just arrive and don't know the rules or the laws,"" he said. One of the Edinburgh city centre streets where Mr Fortune owns property Mr Fortune is thought to own scores of flats across Edinburgh and is no stranger to controversy. In 2013, he wasrefused entry to Scotland's landlord registerafter being convicted of offences directly relating to his letting business, including threatening tenants. Edinburgh City Council said Mr Fortune last applied to join the landlord register in 2018 and this was refused. Mr Fortune told BBC Scotland this application was made in 2015 and that he withdrew it in 2018.

It pointed out the person was living and working in Edinburgh and had lived in the property for seven months. The ruling stated: ""The agreement signed by the parties states that it is a holiday let. However, the evidence clearly establishes that it was not."" The ruling goes on to say that EHPL ""appears to have called the tenancy agreement a holiday let in an attempt to avoid security of tenure and the requirement to serve proper notice and apply to the tribunal for an eviction order"". BBC Scotland showed one of the ""holiday let"" agreements used by one of Mr Fortune's firms to Catherine McQuarrie, a residential tenancy law specialist at TC Young Solicitors. She pointed out a number of problems with the one-page contract, which quoted legislation that had been superseded. She said: ""It's quite clear from the wording of the document that the person using this is attempting to get out of complying with the legislation that would otherwise apply to protect the tenant. ""Essentially you can't have a holiday let if you're not on holiday. It's as simple as that. ""That simply means that the agreement is null and void and instead the parties have a private residential tenancy agreement."" Holiday lets are exempt from tenant protections such as the landlord registration scheme and putting deposits into third-party protection schemes. Mr Fortune told BBC Scotland he was not banned from the landlord register but that a decision was taken to not place his name on the list of Scotland's approved landlords. He added: ""I do not operate as a landlord, any properties both residential or commercial are operated by limited companies having been granted a licence by myself which allows commercial subletting.

"Samuel Kasumu has worked for the government since 2019 Boris Johnson's senior adviser on ethnic minorities is to stand down, amid a row over a government-commissioned report on race. Samuel Kasumu is known to have been unhappy with the government's stance on racial issues. He has not commented on the report, which said the UK ""no longer"" had a system rigged against minorities. The PM said the report was ""original and stimulating"" but he did not agree with ""absolutely everything"" in it. Equality campaigners have criticised it for downplaying the extent of racism in British society and institutions. PM's minority adviser: Tories 'steeped in division' Campaigners criticise government race report Key points: What does the race report say? Former equality and human rights commissioner Lord Simon Woolley said there was a ""crisis at No 10 when it comes to acknowledging and dealing with persistent race inequality"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: The government ""won't agree with every word"" in report Labour's shadow equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova called the report ""divisive,"" adding it was ""no wonder"" the government was ""losing the expertise from their team"". ""To have your most senior advisor on ethnic minorities quit as you publish a so-called landmark report on race in the UK is telling of how far removed the Tories are from the everyday lived experiences of Black, Asian and ethnic minority people,"" she added. A Downing Street spokesman insisted Mr Kasumu had been planning ""for several months"" to leave government in May. ""Any suggestion that this decision has been made this week or that this is linked to the [commission's] report is completely inaccurate,"" he added. Samuel Kasumu may not be a name you're familiar with; even one minister awkwardly said they'd never heard of him this morning. But his resignation is a difficult moment for the government on the sensitive, divisive topic of race. Downing street has denied any suggestion his departure is linked to Wednesday's report. Without Samuel Kasumu's version of events, it's hard to know why and when he chose to resign - having changed his mind about quitting earlier in the year. But his departure leaves questions about the confidence some in government, let alone the public, have about the prime minister's approach to tackling racial inequality. Last year Boris Johnson said he wanted to ""change the narrative"" on this subject  - but this is unlikely to be what he had in mind. Mr Johnson said he had ""worked closely"" with Mr Kasumu - who will leave his role next month - and he had ""done some great stuff and I thank him very much"". The adviser had previously handed in a resignation letter in February, accusing the Conservatives of a ""politics steeped in division"". He had asked to keep working on a project to combat disinformation on Covid vaccines, with ""the view to leaving at the end of May"". But Mr Kasumu went on to retract this letter, following talks with vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi. Mr Kasumu has declined to comment, but sources told the BBC there has been an ""awkward silence"" hanging over Downing Street, with little discussion or movement since he first threatened to resign. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities (CRED) was launched last summer in the wake of anti-racism Black Lives Matter protests last summer. In its reportpublished on Wednesday,external, it concluded the UK was not yet a ""post-racial country,"" but family structure and social class had a bigger impact than race on people's life chances. It argued that racial discrimination has often been misapplied to ""account for every observed disparity"" between ethnic groups. And it said references to racism in the UK being ""institutional"" or ""structural"" had sometimes been used without sufficient evidence. Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a member of the commission, said the report was not denying institutional racism existed, but said they had not discovered evidence of it in the areas they had looked. The commission made 24 recommendations, including urging more research into school performance and for organisations to ditch unconscious bias training. The report was commissioned in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests in the UK Speaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said the commission had suggested several ""interesting ideas"" and the government would respond in ""due course"". ""I don't say the government is going to agree with absolutely everything in it, but it has some original and stimulating work in it that I think people need to read and to consider,"" Mr Johnson added. ""There are very serious issues that our society faces to do with racism that we need to address. ""We've got to do more to fix it, we need to understand the severity of the problem, and we're going to be looking at all the ideas that they have put forward"". The commission's chairman Tony Sewell, an education consultant and ex-charity boss, has meanwhile defended himself from criticism over comments he made in the report about how the British Empire should be taught in schools. In his foreword to the report, he wrote: ""There is a new story about the Caribbean experience which speaks to the slave period not only being about profit and suffering but how culturally African people transformed themselves into a re-modelled African/Britain"". Halima Begum, chief executive of race equality think tank the Runnymede Trust, said his comments were ""out of kilter with where British society is"" - and Labour's Ms de Cordova accused him of ""putting a positive spin on slavery"". But in a statement on Thursday, Dr Sewell said it was ""absurd to suggest that the commission is trying to downplay the evil of the slave trade"". ""The report merely says that, in the face of the inhumanity of slavery, African people preserved their humanity and culture,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Sanjeev Gupta: ""UK steel plants will not close on my watch"" Liberty Steel owner Sanjeev Gupta has claimed that none of its plants will shut ""under my watch"" as he races to refinance his business after the collapse of financial backer Greensill. He said taking on the UK plants had been a ""tough journey"" and a ""labour of love"", but he would not walk away. Mr Gupta was rebuffed by the UK government after asking for Â£170m. Some investors have alsobegun legal actionto have parts of his metals group wound up. But Mr Gupta said he and GFG Alliance, Liberty Steel's parent company, were ""not waiting for anybody"" and were ""doing what we can to help our businesses"". ""Our overall global operations are profitable, we have refinancing offers, we will refinance, and we will support our UK business also,"" Mr Gupta told the BBC. ""None of my steel plants under my watch will be shut down,"" he said. Liberty Steel has about 3,000 workers at sites including Rotherham, Motherwell and Newport. A further 2,000 work for GFG Alliance in other UK metals and engineering businesses. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""very hopeful"" that the plants could be saved and that Britain needed a strong steel industry.. He said that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was in ""daily contact"" with GFG. ""I think British steel is a very important national asset. I think the fact that we make steel in this country is of strategic long-term importance,"" he said. ""We have learned during the pandemic that it is not a good idea to be excessively reliant in times of trouble on imports of critical things,"" he added. ""It would be crazy if we were not to use this post-Brexit moment not to use the flexibility we have to buy British steel. So that's want we want to do."" The GMB union said Mr Gupta's comments were ""very welcome"" but making guarantees without showing financial backing ""just raises further questions"". ""To be able to give these guarantees with such confidence you have to assume he's found the financing required to keep the company going,"" said Ross Murdoch, GMB national officer. ""If that's the case he needs to let people know and stop workers worrying about their jobs."" Time is ticking for Sanjeev Gupta's business empire. The collapse of his main source of finance, Greensill Capital, leaves him dangerously exposed and in a race to find new sources of cash. GFG Alliance, the group of companies he runs, owes Greensill about $5bn, according to GFG's own evidence to court when Greensill was put into administration in February. GFG also told the court that Greensill's collapse would put it at risk of insolvency. Since then, it has been something of a phoney war, with little sign of the Greensill debacle causing greater damage. Now, however, winding-up petitions have been lodged against some of Mr Gupta's UK companies. The investors that gave money to Greensill want their money back and Mr Gupta's business empire is firmly in their sights. On the Today programme on Thursday, Mr Gupta said his companies were ready to defend their position in court and they were confident their loan deal with Greensill was a long-term arrangement that could not suddenly be terminated. He must now hold off the winding-off threats for long enough - or defeat them - while he finds sources of finance to replace Greensill. This might mean the sale of assets, or new borrowing, although the process is complicated by much of the Gupta business empire already being pledged as collateral against the loans advanced by Greensill. It will be a complicated and time-consuming business - and Mr Gupta may not be given much time. Mr Gupta said steel prices were at a 13-year peak, while aluminium prices were also high. He said GFG had been streamlining the business and had a ""huge amount of interest from new financiers who are willing to back us"" and refinance the group. He said it would take time to sort things out, but a short-term solution was an initiative called ""Project Athena"" which required each plant to make daily reports on how they were conserving cash. On Wednesday, Citigroup, acting on behalf of the investment bank Credit Suisse, began legal action in London's insolvency court to recoup unpaid debts from Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance. Mr Gupta said it was ""natural to some degree that lenders want to protect their own position"", but that GFG's position was that it had agreed debts with Greensill for three years and they were not due. He said GFG was having ""positive discussions"" with Grant Thornton, the administrators for Greensill. ""It makes no sense for them, or any of the creditors, to destroy jobs, but more importantly to destroy value, because that is the value which will give them their recovery,"" Mr Gupta said. Mr Gupta said former Prime Minister David Cameron had not lobbied on GFG's behalf Mr Gupta's business model centred on buying up failing or mothballed steel and aluminium plants around the world and starting production again, with the help of his main backer Greensill. In 2015, production restarted at the Liberty Steel plant in Newport, and in 2016 Liberty reopened and the Dalzell steel mill in Scotland. In 2017, Liberty acquired Tata's speciality steels business and expanded into Australia. In the following year it expanded into the US. Mr Gupta said: ""The UK has been a tough journey. It's because the UK steel industry has been decimated for decades. So that journey definitely has been a labour of love."" ""But I'm committed to my UK steel plants. I started them, I believe in them, they have a great future. We've saved thousands of jobs here. We've shown that economically those businesses can work,"" he said. Mr Gupta added that former Prime Minister David Cameron, who acted as an advisor for Greensill, had not made representations on behalf of GFG Alliance. ""I've not spoken to him, I think, since he was Prime Minister,"" Mr Gupta said. Mr Cameron wascleared by a watchdog last weekwhich looked at whether he had followed lobbying rules.

"First Minister Mark Drakeford and Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton give a Welsh government update The top nine priority groups will have had a first vaccination by Sunday, Mr Drakeford says From 12 April, travel outside of Wales is due to be allowed again From 26 April, outdoor hospitality will reopen, with indoor hospitality possibly reopening as early as 17 May From 10 May, families can meet again indoors, with extended households able to form again between two households James McCarthy and David Schaffer That's it from our Wales' live page for today, thank you for joining us. Here are the main points:  Wales' opposition parties have responded to the Welsh
Government's plans for the latest easing of lockdown restrictions. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said it was
âgood to seeâ Mr Drakeford âhad bought into the idea of a roadmapâ. âAlthough it's very late in the day,â he told Wales Today. He said it was âunfortunateâ that further funding had not been
made available to the hospitality sector. âWhatâs really dumbfounding is that despite his mental health
ministers' assurances that gyms will be one of the first facilities to open,
they are now not going to open until May.â He said outdoor hospitality should be opening on 12 April - in
line with plans in England. 'Disappointing delay' Plaid Cymruâs Adam Price said the government should move faster
with easing restrictions. âWe've also been calling for a much more accelerated timetable
in terms of reopening gyms, because of their importance in terms of mental and
physical well-being. ""So, I think it's disappointing to see that being delayed
until May the 10th,â he told Wales Today. âThere are dangers of course in moving too fast but thereâs an
equal danger of being over cautiousâ. 'Beer before exercise' Rodney Berman, of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: âI think
we are broadly satisfied with the pace.â He welcomed the planned move to alert level three. âThe fact that we've got a bit of a roadmap here, that we've got
a bit more clarity for various sectors - hospitality, gyms, I think, is to be
welcomed. â[But] youâll be able to go into a beer garden before you'll be
able to take part in even an outdoor exercise class. âThe important thing is that
we do now have a roadmap for when different things are going to open up, but we
maybe do need to look at the level of financial support to businesses that
aren't quite able to open yet.â  Financial support for businesses will not be interrupted and will continue throughout April, Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford told the press conference that Â£180m of funding was announced in the middle of March ""to make sure the businesses in Wales would have the help they need to see them through."" ""Businesses will see no interruption in the flow of financial support to them over that period"", he said. He added: ""Many businesses have already received the help that's available to them, and for others who are still in the process of applying, cash grants will continue to be paid during April as those applications are confirmed. ""And alongside the money that we announced and is already reaching businesses, we've also put Â£200m aside in the Welsh Government's budget for the next financial year."" Election rules mean the Welsh Government cannot make further decisions during the pre-elction period, Mr Drakeford added. Wales' first minister has warned the nation must ""work together""  to fight coronavirus. Mark Drakeford said: âToday, Wales has the lowest level of coronavirus of all four UK nations and the highest rates of vaccination. âThese are the reasons for us all to be hopeful and optimistic about the weeks ahead."" He added: ""We have to remember that the pandemic isnât over â it's more important than ever that we continue to work together to keep this terrible virus under control so that we can go on unlocking Wales."" Plaid
Cymru leader Adam Price has told the Welsh government that gyms should be being opened up as soon as possible. It comes as gym owners branded the delay in reopening their business in Wales as ""short-sighted and irresponsible."" Mr Price said ""gyms should be able to safely re-open now -
not least to help with people's wellbeing and mental health which has suffered
so much during the last few months"". The Welsh Liberal Democrats have called for help for people who could lose jobs with the end of furlough as lockdown eases. And party leader Jane Dodds called for support for those who could lose their homes when the eviction ban ends. Leader
of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds, said: ""Now that more and more of
Wales is opening up and life is slowly returning to normal, it's time to put
our recovery first. ""I
want to see support for those individuals who will lose their jobs when
furlough ends, those who are likely to lose their homes when the ban on
evictions is lifted and those whose mental health has suffered as a result of
this pandemic."" She was speaking as the Welsh Government announcedWales' pubs could reopen and families meet indoors in May. Wales' first minister has continued to set out his lockdown plans, into May. ""I want to see businesses open and trading,â he said. âWe all wantto see our pubs open, people celebrating getting married and Wales welcoming visitors again.â Plans after 6 May depend on the results of the Senedd election, and whether Mark Drakeford is re-elected. Mr Drakeford said if he returned as FM, on 17 May he would allow for: âBeyond that date our ambition will be for indoor hospitality and remaining visitor accommodation to be able to open ahead of the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May,â he added. âBut that as you will appreciate is many weeks from now, and the public health position at the time, will determine whether that is possible.â  Tory leader Andrew RT Davies has criticised the Welsh Government over changes to lockdown financial support for businesses. In a tweet, the Tory leader said that ""sadly"" it was not April Fools Day. ""Labour are keeping thousands of Welsh businesses shut until the end of April and cutting off vital support,"" he said. ""Itâs a dreadful decision that will put so many Welsh jobs at risk.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would  continue a âcareful, step-by-step approach, lifting restrictions week by week, provided the public health situation continues to remain favourable.â The focus for the next three weeks is to ensure all pupils and students return to schools and colleges from 12 April, he said. From that Monday, he explained:  Outdoor canvassing for elections can begin but within strict guidelines. At the same time the go ahead will be given for a ânumber of outdoor pilot eventsâ, including cultural and sports events. Mr Drakeford said his government will work with the Muslim council to consider how to help people to celebrate Eid. âThis is a significant package of measures, a series of steps forward in our journey back to normality and will give everybody a sense of life returning again,â he said. Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton said the overall public health situation in Wales was âremaining quite stableâ. âCommunity transmission is much reduced compared to a few weeks ago,â he said. Latest figures show the seven-day coronavirus rate for Wales has reduced to about 35 cases per 100,000 people, he said. The rate that tests are being returned positive has fallen to 2.5%.

However, he added there were âclusters of casesâ, which have been traced back to people meeting and mixing indoors. Dr Atherton said he did not want to have to advise the FM that lockdown restrictions need to be reintroduced, as seen elsewhere in Europe. By Sunday Wales will have offered a vaccine to everyone in the first nine priority groups, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. That includes everyone over 50, all adults with an underlying health condition and many unpaid carers. A minimum of 75% in each priority group will have received a first vaccination, Mr Drakeford said, describing it as a ""major milestone"". Latest figures show more than 57% of adults in Wales have had the vaccine, he told a press conference. He said Wales was âgetting closeâ to one-in-five adults having completed a two-dose course. He said this means the programme is âpowering aheadâ. Take up, he said, is excellent, with over half of the groups counted it is more than 90%. âThis is a truly remarkable effort and is down to the hard work of thousands of people who are working tirelessly on the frontline of the NHS right across Wales to make this happen,â he said. A total of 1,443,885 have now recieved a first dose of Covid 19 vaccine. A total of 449,538 have had two doses. There have been two further deaths of people with Covidreported in Wales in the past 24 hours, health chiefs say. It means the total number of deaths reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) since the pandemic began in March 2020, stands at 5,509. A further 188 cases have been reported, taking the total number of positive tests to 209, 532. Wales' seven day case rate now stands at 35. Pubs, restaurants and hotels in Wales may reopen indoors intime for the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May. The Welsh government also said two households could meet indoors from 10 May, if Covid cases remained low. Travel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK andCommon Travel Area,externalcan go ahead from 12 April and hospitality could reopen outdoors from 26 April. From 3 May, wedding receptions with up to 30 people can take place outdoors. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Sanjeev Gupta: ""UK steel plants will not close on my watch"" Liberty Steel owner Sanjeev Gupta has claimed that none of its plants will shut ""under my watch"" as he races to refinance his business after the collapse of financial backer Greensill. He said taking on the UK plants had been a ""tough journey"" and a ""labour of love"", but he would not walk away. Mr Gupta was rebuffed by the UK government after asking for Â£170m. Some investors have alsobegun legal actionto have parts of his metals group wound up. But Mr Gupta said he and GFG Alliance, Liberty Steel's parent company, were ""not waiting for anybody"" and were ""doing what we can to help our businesses"". ""Our overall global operations are profitable, we have refinancing offers, we will refinance, and we will support our UK business also,"" Mr Gupta told the BBC. ""None of my steel plants under my watch will be shut down,"" he said. Liberty Steel has about 3,000 workers at sites including Rotherham, Motherwell and Newport. A further 2,000 work for GFG Alliance in other UK metals and engineering businesses. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""very hopeful"" that the plants could be saved and that Britain needed a strong steel industry.. He said that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was in ""daily contact"" with GFG. ""I think British steel is a very important national asset. I think the fact that we make steel in this country is of strategic long-term importance,"" he said. ""We have learned during the pandemic that it is not a good idea to be excessively reliant in times of trouble on imports of critical things,"" he added. ""It would be crazy if we were not to use this post-Brexit moment not to use the flexibility we have to buy British steel. So that's want we want to do."" The GMB union said Mr Gupta's comments were ""very welcome"" but making guarantees without showing financial backing ""just raises further questions"". ""To be able to give these guarantees with such confidence you have to assume he's found the financing required to keep the company going,"" said Ross Murdoch, GMB national officer. ""If that's the case he needs to let people know and stop workers worrying about their jobs."" Time is ticking for Sanjeev Gupta's business empire. The collapse of his main source of finance, Greensill Capital, leaves him dangerously exposed and in a race to find new sources of cash. GFG Alliance, the group of companies he runs, owes Greensill about $5bn, according to GFG's own evidence to court when Greensill was put into administration in February. GFG also told the court that Greensill's collapse would put it at risk of insolvency. Since then, it has been something of a phoney war, with little sign of the Greensill debacle causing greater damage. Now, however, winding-up petitions have been lodged against some of Mr Gupta's UK companies. The investors that gave money to Greensill want their money back and Mr Gupta's business empire is firmly in their sights. On the Today programme on Thursday, Mr Gupta said his companies were ready to defend their position in court and they were confident their loan deal with Greensill was a long-term arrangement that could not suddenly be terminated. He must now hold off the winding-off threats for long enough - or defeat them - while he finds sources of finance to replace Greensill. This might mean the sale of assets, or new borrowing, although the process is complicated by much of the Gupta business empire already being pledged as collateral against the loans advanced by Greensill. It will be a complicated and time-consuming business - and Mr Gupta may not be given much time. Mr Gupta said steel prices were at a 13-year peak, while aluminium prices were also high. He said GFG had been streamlining the business and had a ""huge amount of interest from new financiers who are willing to back us"" and refinance the group. He said it would take time to sort things out, but a short-term solution was an initiative called ""Project Athena"" which required each plant to make daily reports on how they were conserving cash. On Wednesday, Citigroup, acting on behalf of the investment bank Credit Suisse, began legal action in London's insolvency court to recoup unpaid debts from Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance. Mr Gupta said it was ""natural to some degree that lenders want to protect their own position"", but that GFG's position was that it had agreed debts with Greensill for three years and they were not due. He said GFG was having ""positive discussions"" with Grant Thornton, the administrators for Greensill. ""It makes no sense for them, or any of the creditors, to destroy jobs, but more importantly to destroy value, because that is the value which will give them their recovery,"" Mr Gupta said. Mr Gupta said former Prime Minister David Cameron had not lobbied on GFG's behalf Mr Gupta's business model centred on buying up failing or mothballed steel and aluminium plants around the world and starting production again, with the help of his main backer Greensill. In 2015, production restarted at the Liberty Steel plant in Newport, and in 2016 Liberty reopened and the Dalzell steel mill in Scotland. In 2017, Liberty acquired Tata's speciality steels business and expanded into Australia. In the following year it expanded into the US. Mr Gupta said: ""The UK has been a tough journey. It's because the UK steel industry has been decimated for decades. So that journey definitely has been a labour of love."" ""But I'm committed to my UK steel plants. I started them, I believe in them, they have a great future. We've saved thousands of jobs here. We've shown that economically those businesses can work,"" he said. Mr Gupta added that former Prime Minister David Cameron, who acted as an advisor for Greensill, had not made representations on behalf of GFG Alliance. ""I've not spoken to him, I think, since he was Prime Minister,"" Mr Gupta said. Mr Cameron wascleared by a watchdog last weekwhich looked at whether he had followed lobbying rules.

"Hannam in police uniform - he had appeared in a neo-Nazi propaganda video two days before he applied to join Metropolitan Police officer Ben Hannam has been convicted of membership of the banned neo-Nazi group National Action. The deception was as easy as ticking a box. In 2017, on his application form to join the Metropolitan Police, Ben Hannam was asked if he had ever been in the far-right British National Party or any organisations whose aims ""may contradict the duty to promote race equality"". He ticked ""no"". Once accepted, he spent two years in the force, working among communities in north London, even interviewing suspects on his own. But, just two days before he applied to join the force, he had appeared in a neo-Nazi propaganda video. Deceit had become normal. Hannam in a NS131 propaganda video made the same month he applied to join the police At school he had a girlfriend of Mauritian and Muslim heritage, as well as friends from various ethnic backgrounds. Several gave evidence at his trial, saying he never showed any prejudice towards them. One grandparent is gay. Another step-grandparent is Jewish. Yet Hannam spent his weekends with neo-Nazis and collected a library of fascist literature. His beliefs were noticed by some. A teacher told the trial she had been unable to mark one essay submitted by Hannam - the first time this had happened in 20 years of teaching - because of ""concerning content"" and his ""intolerance"" towards Islam. He was also spoken to after students at his diverse school reacted to ""anti-immigration"" views he espoused during a debate. The Met never took a reference from the school. After he was charged, three experts agreed Hannam was autistic and that this was relevant to his interest in fascism, an ideology historically associated with order and structure. One said Hannam was well aware of what National Action stood for. The others said his autism meant it took him some time to realise the group was ""morally bad"". Hannam (second R) posing with a Celtic Cross flag Prosecutors said his diagnosis did not excuse his conduct or explain why he sought friends in a neo-Nazi group. Hannam had joined National Action (NA) in early 2016 while studying for his A-levels. He was active online, including on the image board 4Chan, and was attracted to NA after watching videos of co-founders Alex Davies and Ben Raymond. After writing to the group, Hannam was invited to meet older members in London and was soon travelling north to attend an annual conference in Liverpool, where he posed for a photo next to a man doing a Nazi salute which featured in a film of the event. Using an alias, he joined a neo-Nazi web forum called Iron March, which spawned several extremist groups around the world. Two neo-Nazi groups added to banned list The new parents and the UK's neo-Nazi terror threat In one forum thread started by Hannam, entitled ""Muslim shoots white man in London"", he asked for ""thoughts and advice"". When one user replied by discussing how to get a firearm, Hannam wrote: ""Care to help me out in this topic then? I don't know where to start with obtaining one besides a shotgun, and I don't think they'd be of much use"". He also used the website to help another student apply to NA. He suggested the teenager tone down his application, as otherwise ""you'll get the police knocking at your door"". During his trial, Hannam claimed ""there are no pictures of me doing a Nazi salute"". But the BBC has identified him at a fight training event, filmed for an NA propaganda video, which he arranged to attend in August 2016 with the other teenager. The film shows Hannam boxing with leading member Mark Jones, their faces blurred, with the whole group then saluting together for the camera. The BBC has identified Hannam (circled) saluting in a 2016 NA propaganda video That summer, NA - founded as a youth movement three years earlier - used social media to glorify the murder of the Labour MP Jo Cox by a neo-Nazi. By the end of the year it was outlawed in the UK as a terrorist organisation, making it illegal to remain a member. The ban came as: Zack Davies was jailedfor attempting to behead a Sikh dentist in Wales a teenager was convicted of making explosivesin West Yorkshire and within months former NA spokesman Jack Renshaw was arrested for preparing to murder his MP in a terror attack and waslater jailed for life In 2017 the organisation re-emerged under new aliases, including NS131. Hannam continued to meet other members, pose for propaganda images to promote the new brand, and attend fight training. Another event, not attended by Hannam, saw members practise knife combat in a forest. Counter-terror police seized clear, raw footage of these events in September that year, when they arrested Mark Jones and the NA co-founder Alex Davies. But, despite the small numbers at each gathering, Hannam was not identified. Hannam (in white) boxing with Oskar Dunn-Koczorowski, watched by National Action co-founder Alex Davies (L) in spring 2017 Different counter-terror teams around the UK had responsibility for different group members, but some people - who may have appeared peripheral - were not a focus. Investigations had already revealed several soldiers were members of an NA chat group. One soldier, Mikko Vehvilainen, was stockpiling weapons and would later be convicted of membership During exchanges with other senior figures, Vehvilainen said members should focus on gaining ""military and key civil positions"". Hannam was only caught after anti-fascists leaked data online from the Iron March forum. Detectives reviewed IP addresses for British forum users, tracing the account used by Hannam to his north London home. The police investigation found no evidence he had been involved with NA after July 2017. However, there are hints that he did not break all contact with his past. Hannam at his passing out parade being reviewed by the Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick Even before his arrest, people involved in the group knew that one of their former members had joined the police, the BBC has established. Hannam also continued to access and save disturbing content, including an image glorifying the perpetrator of New Zealand's Christchurch massacre. In November 2018, he saved a photo to his phone of NA associateOskar Dunn-Koczorowski, who was arrested for terrorism offences the following month,but whose image was not yet public. In court, Hannam claimed he simply chanced across it online, but how it actually came into his possession is unclear. Commander Richard Smith, head of the Met's counter terrorism command, said he was ""hugely concerned"" that a serving officer had been a member of a banned group, but that he was identified at the ""earliest"" opportunity and officers then moved quickly to make an arrest.

"Samuel Kasumu has worked for the government since 2019 Boris Johnson's senior adviser on ethnic minorities is to stand down, amid a row over a government-commissioned report on race. Samuel Kasumu is known to have been unhappy with the government's stance on racial issues. He has not commented on the report, which said the UK ""no longer"" had a system rigged against minorities. The PM said the report was ""original and stimulating"" but he did not agree with ""absolutely everything"" in it. Equality campaigners have criticised it for downplaying the extent of racism in British society and institutions. PM's minority adviser: Tories 'steeped in division' Campaigners criticise government race report Key points: What does the race report say? Former equality and human rights commissioner Lord Simon Woolley said there was a ""crisis at No 10 when it comes to acknowledging and dealing with persistent race inequality"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: The government ""won't agree with every word"" in report Labour's shadow equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova called the report ""divisive,"" adding it was ""no wonder"" the government was ""losing the expertise from their team"". ""To have your most senior advisor on ethnic minorities quit as you publish a so-called landmark report on race in the UK is telling of how far removed the Tories are from the everyday lived experiences of Black, Asian and ethnic minority people,"" she added. A Downing Street spokesman insisted Mr Kasumu had been planning ""for several months"" to leave government in May. ""Any suggestion that this decision has been made this week or that this is linked to the [commission's] report is completely inaccurate,"" he added. Samuel Kasumu may not be a name you're familiar with; even one minister awkwardly said they'd never heard of him this morning. But his resignation is a difficult moment for the government on the sensitive, divisive topic of race. Downing street has denied any suggestion his departure is linked to Wednesday's report. Without Samuel Kasumu's version of events, it's hard to know why and when he chose to resign - having changed his mind about quitting earlier in the year. But his departure leaves questions about the confidence some in government, let alone the public, have about the prime minister's approach to tackling racial inequality. Last year Boris Johnson said he wanted to ""change the narrative"" on this subject  - but this is unlikely to be what he had in mind. Mr Johnson said he had ""worked closely"" with Mr Kasumu - who will leave his role next month - and he had ""done some great stuff and I thank him very much"". The adviser had previously handed in a resignation letter in February, accusing the Conservatives of a ""politics steeped in division"". He had asked to keep working on a project to combat disinformation on Covid vaccines, with ""the view to leaving at the end of May"". But Mr Kasumu went on to retract this letter, following talks with vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi. Mr Kasumu has declined to comment, but sources told the BBC there has been an ""awkward silence"" hanging over Downing Street, with little discussion or movement since he first threatened to resign. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities (CRED) was launched last summer in the wake of anti-racism Black Lives Matter protests last summer. In its reportpublished on Wednesday,external, it concluded the UK was not yet a ""post-racial country,"" but family structure and social class had a bigger impact than race on people's life chances. It argued that racial discrimination has often been misapplied to ""account for every observed disparity"" between ethnic groups. And it said references to racism in the UK being ""institutional"" or ""structural"" had sometimes been used without sufficient evidence. Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a member of the commission, said the report was not denying institutional racism existed, but said they had not discovered evidence of it in the areas they had looked. The commission made 24 recommendations, including urging more research into school performance and for organisations to ditch unconscious bias training. The report was commissioned in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests in the UK Speaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said the commission had suggested several ""interesting ideas"" and the government would respond in ""due course"". ""I don't say the government is going to agree with absolutely everything in it, but it has some original and stimulating work in it that I think people need to read and to consider,"" Mr Johnson added. ""There are very serious issues that our society faces to do with racism that we need to address. ""We've got to do more to fix it, we need to understand the severity of the problem, and we're going to be looking at all the ideas that they have put forward"". The commission's chairman Tony Sewell, an education consultant and ex-charity boss, has meanwhile defended himself from criticism over comments he made in the report about how the British Empire should be taught in schools. In his foreword to the report, he wrote: ""There is a new story about the Caribbean experience which speaks to the slave period not only being about profit and suffering but how culturally African people transformed themselves into a re-modelled African/Britain"". Halima Begum, chief executive of race equality think tank the Runnymede Trust, said his comments were ""out of kilter with where British society is"" - and Labour's Ms de Cordova accused him of ""putting a positive spin on slavery"". But in a statement on Thursday, Dr Sewell said it was ""absurd to suggest that the commission is trying to downplay the evil of the slave trade"". ""The report merely says that, in the face of the inhumanity of slavery, African people preserved their humanity and culture,"" he added.

"About two million of the UK's lowest-paid workers will get a pay rise from Thursday as the minimum wage goes up. The National Living Wage will rise 2.2% to Â£8.91, the equivalent of more than Â£345 a year for a full-time employee. It will also be given to 23 and 24-year-olds for the first time, not just those aged 25 and over. Statutory rates for apprentices and those aged between 18 and 22 will also rise, along with the voluntary ""Real Living Wage"". However, hundreds of thousands of low-paid workers on furlough will see no uplift at all after they were excluded. Furlough numbers climb sharply in January 'Finding work feels impossible for my generation' Ministers said the increases to minimum wages would particularly benefit workers in sectors such as retail, hospitality, cleaning and maintenance. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would be ""a welcome boost to families right across the UK"". Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng urged ""all workers"" to check their pay packets to ensure they were ""getting what they are entitled to, and remind employers of their duty to pay the correct wage"". From Â£8.72 to Â£8.91 an hour for workers over the age of 23 From Â£8.20 to Â£8.36 for those aged 21-22 From Â£6.45 to Â£6.56 for 18 to 20-year-olds From Â£4.55 to Â£4.62 for under-18s From Â£4.15 to Â£4.30 for apprentices What is the minimum wage? The voluntary Real Living Wage will rise to Â£10.85 an hour in London and Â£9.50 outside the capital, but only a small minority of employers have signed up to pay it. The foundation promoting it warned there was still a ""substantial gap"" between the statutory rates and one based on the actual cost of living. Much of the UK's retail and hospitality industries remain closed because of Covid, meaning many of the lowest-paid workers are on furlough and will miss out on a pay rise. They will continue to get 80% of their usual income, based on pre-pandemic rates for the minimum wage. About 800,000 of the lowest-paid workers were on furlough in February, according to the House of Commons Library. The government said furloughed workers who returned to work after 1 April would move on to the new minimum wage rates for hours worked. But shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds hit out at the ""pay freeze"" for furloughed workers. ""Hitting Britain's families in their pockets isn't just wrong - it's economically illiterate. If families have less money to spend, then businesses will suffer and the recovery will take longer,"" she said. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, also said nobody should be expected to get by on less than the minimum wage. ""Low-paid workers on furlough have bills to pay like everyone else,"" she said. ""The government should guarantee that everybody will get at least the full rate of the minimum wage. And it should give all minimum wage workers a decent pay rise."" Mike Hawking of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation described the boost to the minimum wage as ""necessary"", but said that the pandemic had revealed the urgency of taking further steps to tackle in-work poverty. ""As we start to recover from the impact of the last year, too many workers are finding that minimum wage increases are being wiped out due to inadequate social security, insufficient hours available to them, and high housing costs."" Bryan Sanderson, chairman of the Low Pay Commission, which recommends the level at which the minimum wage should be set, said: ""This week's increase is our first step towards the government's target of two-thirds of median earnings. ""It is a real-terms increase, meaning that an hour's work can buy more than it could last year at the start of the pandemic. The level of the new rate, however, also reflects the need to protect workers from job losses."" The commission said its best estimate for the National Living Wage rate in 2022 was Â£9.42, but this is subject to more uncertainty than usual and is likely to change. This rise in the legal minimum wage will be welcome news, particularly as most households across the UK are also seeing their bills going up from the start of April. Planned price rises kick in for gas and electricity, council tax, water charges, the licence fee, TV and broadband rates, and NHS prescription charges in England. It'll be a stretch for many. For those minimum wage staff who are on furlough at the moment, the news is even harder. Pay for those who would normally be working in bars, restaurants, hairdressers and hotels will continue to be based on 80% of their pre-Covid earnings. They won't get the new pay rise until they start back to work again, but given the timetable on easing restrictions, many may be heading back to full employment soon.

"This video can not be played Hans Kluge tells the BBC: ""Covid-19 is now a vaccine preventable disease"" The World Health Organization (WHO) has criticised the rollout of coronavirus vaccines in Europe as being ""unacceptably slow"". It also says the situation in the region is more worrying than it has been for several months. Vaccination campaigns in much of Europe have been hit by delays and the number of infections is rising. France is the latest country to announce new lockdown measures, lasting four weeks. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? How is Europe dealing with the third wave? ""Vaccines present our best way out of this pandemic... However, the rollout of these vaccines is unacceptably slow"" and is prolonging the pandemic in the wider Europe region,WHO director for Europe Hans Kluge said in a statement,external. ""We must speed up the process by ramping up manufacturing, reducing barriers to administering vaccines, and using every single vial we have in stock, now,"" he added. In the meantime, as long as vaccine coverage remained low, he said EU countries would have to impose lockdowns and other measures to compensate for the delays. Mr Kluge also warned that the vaccine rollout, despite its slow speed, risked ""providing a false sense of security to authorities and the public alike"". Last week saw increasing transmission of Covid-19 in the majority of countries in the WHO European region - which includes more than 50 countries and extends from Greenland to the far east of Russia. There were 1.6 million new cases and close to 24,000 deaths, the WHO said. Cases were rising in all but one age group, the organisation said. Only 10% of the nearly 900 million people in the region have had a single dose of coronavirus vaccine. Europe's vaccination campaign has been hit by delays It remains the second most affected by the virus of all the world's regions, with the total number of deaths fast approaching one million and the total number of cases about to surpass 45 million, it added. The WHO also warned of the risks of greater spread associated with increased mobility and number of gatherings over the forthcoming religious holidays of Passover, Easter and Ramadan. Some 27 countries of the more than 50 included in the WHO Europe region have implemented partial or full coronavirus lockdowns. Only 16% of the EU's population has so far received a dose of vaccine. The EU was slow to negotiate a contract with vaccine manufacturer AstraZeneca which caused supply problems. It also sparked a political row with the UK, where AstraZeneca has plants and where 52% of the population has had at least one dose. The EU's deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna also ran into early problems with production and distribution. EU regulators were then slow to authorise vaccines for use. Some EU countries subsequently paused their rollouts of the AstraZeneca jab over reports of blood clots among a small number of people who had received a dose. Others restricted its use among older people over concerns that the company had not provided enough testing data. All this has led to low public confidence in the AstraZeneca vaccine. Polling company YouGov says only a third of Germans and less than a quarter of French respondents now consider it safe. The WHO and the European Medicines Agency, however, say the benefits of the vaccine outweigh any risks. Vaccine rollout in some non-EU countries in the WHO's Europe area has also been slow. In Russia some people are hesitant to be vaccinated with Russia's own Sputnik V vaccine, for which safety data has been made public and which has been shown to be effective. Why many in Russia are reluctant to have Sputnik vaccine Meanwhile Ukraine received its first shipment of vaccines in late February - 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured in India. But there is widespread scepticism towards vaccination - last month the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found 60% of Ukrainians did not want a jab. However, a bright spot in Europe is Serbia in the Balkans, which has vaccinated more than two million of its seven-million population thanks to early deals with vaccine providers including China's Sinopharm. It has also vaccinated migrants and citizens of neighbouring countries. What else is happening around Europe? After President Emmanuel Macron announced new restrictions inFranceon Wednesday evening, Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Thursday morning at the National Assembly: ""The third wave is here."" He announced more detailed measures including a ban on alcohol in public spaces.France is set to begin a limited lockdown for four weeks from Saturday night, with travel restrictions extended from 19 areas to the entire country Some 35,000Germandoctors are to begin offering vaccinations at their practices after Easter, and 1.4m doses have been ordered for this part of the campaign Eurovisionis to take place in Rotterdam's Ahoy arena in May.

"Nicola Sturgeon believes a simple majority is the way the SNP will make progress on Scottish independence The leader of the SNP has insisted her party was ""not divided"". Speaking onBBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme, Nicola Sturgeon said her aim at May's Holyrood election was winning a ""simple majority"". She rejected Alex Salmond's idea of creating a ""super majority"" by encouraging voters to back his newly-formed Alba Party on the regional list. The former first minister said he wanted to work with an SNP government to advance the cause of independence. He told theBBC's Today programmethat that cause was ""much, much bigger than personalities"". Scottish election 2021: Who should I vote for? The Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon story Ms Sturgeon denied that the SNP was suffering from internal issues and said support had ""never been higher"". She explained: ""I know I lead a party that has a growing membership just now and has a commanding position in the opinion polls. ""The breakdown of opinion polls that tests the views and attitudes of SNP voters show the SNP is actually the most united of all the parties in Scotland."" SCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS What elections are happening?On 6 May, people across Scotland will vote to elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the Scottish government.Find out more here. What powers does the Scottish Parliament have?MSPs pass laws on most aspects of day-to-day life in Scotland, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes and welfare benefits. Defence, foreign policy and immigration are decided by the UK Parliament. How do I vote?Â Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You canÂregister to vote online,external. Ms Sturgeon went to say that she was concentrating on winning a ""simple majority"" and if people wanted an SNP government, and her as first minister, then voting for the nationalists was the only way to bring that about. She said: ""You only have to cast your mind back to the days when Alex Salmond was leader of the SNP and he didn't say what he is saying now. ""What he said then, and he was right then, is that the only way to make sure you get the government you want is to vote for the party that will be that government. ""Anything else is trying to gamble with the system, game the system, take a chance on the outcome of the election. ""If you want to see an SNP government elected that then has the ability to deliver an independence referendum, you don't get that by voting for somebody else."" Nicola Sturgeon insists that there is no split within the independence movement. But it is inescapable that at the same moment she was being interviewed on Radio Scotland, her predecessor Alex Salmond was speaking on Radio 4 as the leader of a rival party. The two were once aninseparable double act atop the SNP, which took Scotland to the brink of independence. But he has now formed his own breakaway group, populated with defectors from the SNP including two sitting MPs. The fact that many of these defectors have left the SNP over various policy differences means there is sure to be friction between their manifesto pledges too. So, Mr Salmond's very presence in the race raises questions for Ms Sturgeon - even over her core objective of independence, which her party can no longer own as home turf. She now has to spend precious time talking about his vision, instead of her own. Both leaders may insist that their campaigns will be positive and do not pose a threat to the cause they share, but in many ways Holyrood is no longer big enough for the both of them. Ms Sturgeon told listeners that two things were required to win independence - a majority in the Scottish Parliament to bring about a referendum and, ""crucially"", winning majority support among the Scottish population. She said: ""Anybody who tries to suggest there's a shortcut to that, or that we can somehow game or trick our way to independence, frankly, is misleading people. It's got to be through a process that is not just legitimate but seen to be legitimate so that it can command respect and authority at home and internationally as well."" On SNP politicians leaving the party to stand at the Holyrood election for the Alba Party she said she was ""not sure it is as many as Mr Salmond might have been hoping for"". She added: ""I also don't think this is a friendly gesture on Mr Salmond's part towards the SNP."" Mr Salmond said he wanted to work with an SNP government to advance the cause of independence Last week,former SNP leader Mr Salmond announced the creation of a new pro-independence party. He said the Alba Party would not field candidates in any of the 73 constituency seats - but the party will field four candidates in each of the eight regional lists. Speaking on Today, Mr Salmond said that securing a ""super majority"" of pro-independence parties at Holyrood would ""strengthen immeasurably Scotland's hand in negotiating with a Tory PM"". He added: ""From 2007 to 2011 I was first minister and I was negotiated first with Gordon Brown. ""No Tory PM will want to be to trying to face down an entire parliament and an entire people."" WHO KILLED EMMA?Journalist Sam Poling investigates the unsolved murder of a young woman in an eight-part podcast for BBC Sounds PODLITICAL:Updates from the campaign Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Ms Sturgeon's comments were ""the clearest sign yet that the SNP will put another referendum before Scotland's recovery."" He added: ""The Institute for Fiscal Studies demonstrated this week that higher levels of public spending in Scotland is possible because we're part of the United Kingdom. ""The UK furlough scheme is still protecting Scottish jobs and people are still getting Covid jags in their arms - but Nicola Sturgeon thinks risking all of that is what's best for Scotland?"" The Scottish Liberal Democrats said Ms Sturgeon had ""once again made it very clear that her only priority this election is another independence referendum"". The party's campaign chairman, Alistair Carmichael, said: ""This is not what Scotland needs. ""Scotland needs a needle-sharp focus on green and secure jobs, a plan to help education bounce back and supporting the NHS and mental health."" Scottish Labour has said the focus of the next parliament should be on recovering from the pandemic and rebuilding the country's economy and health service rather than arguing about the constitution. But the Scottish Greens believe a referendum is needed within the next five years because ""decisions about Scotland should be made by the Scottish people.""

"Princess Diana spent several years living at a flat in Earl's Court, west London, before she married Charles, Prince of Wales Blue plaques to commemorate six women including Diana, Princess of Wales, are due to be installed later this year. One will be placed at the Earl's Court flat where the then Lady Diana Spencer lived for several years before marrying Prince Charles. The mansion-block apartment at 60 Coleherne Court was an 18th birthday gift from her parents. Only 14% of the plaques in the capital honour women and these new ones are intended to help address the imbalance, English Heritage said. Dame Kathleen Lonsdale, Caroline Norton, Jean Muir, Ellen Craft and Helena Normanton are the five recipients not famous for marrying into the royal family. Here are the potted histories of their achievements. Plaque location: Central London Jean Muir argued for the importance of British fashion manufacturing Jean Muir was a designer famous for her outfits with long, fluid lines, classic cut and simple yet skilful tailoring. She taught herself to sew at boarding school, and her favourite fabrics included jersey, crepe and suede, usually in dark, plain colours - midnight navy in particular. She also argued for the importance of British fashion manufacturing and appealed for it to be recognised and valued as a skilled industry. ""We must combat once and for all the idea that there is something lowly about working with one's hands. Hands need the mind,"" she said. Plaque location: Central London Caroline Norton improved the fates of many a woman by fighting for divorce rights for wives Mrs Norton brought about one of the first pieces of feminist legislation in the UK by dint of fighting for the custody of her children after she left her abusive husband. She was also determined to keep the rights to her own property, such as profits from her published writings. She had great influence on theMarriage and Divorce Act of 1857,external. The Matrimonial Causes Act meant wives could now allege cruelty and desertion, in addition to the husband's adultery, in order to obtain a divorce. Plaque location: Hammersmith Ellen Craft disguised herself as a white American man Born in 1826, Ellen Craft was an American woman who had been kept in slavery. Because her skin was pale, she managed to disguise herself as a white man. She and her husband fled their homeland, arriving in England in 1850. To avoid suspicion and evade their former masters, who were chasing them, Mr Craft - who had darker skin than his wife - pretended to be her slave. Once in England, the couple toured the country lecturing against slavery, before settling in Hammersmith. Plaque location: Seven Kings, Redbridge Dame Kathleen Lonsdale, pictured in her study at University College, London Dame Kathleen was born in 1903 in County Kildare, the youngest of 10 children. She and her mother and siblings moved to Essex, England in 1908. A bright girl, she won a scholarship to Ilford County High School, but she had to go to maths and science lessons at the local boys' school as her girls' school didn't teach those subjects. She entered Bedford College for Women, part of the University of London, aged 16, where she got the highest marks not just of her peers, but of anyone in the previous 10 years. She specialised in crystallography, which is the science of working out the arrangement of atoms in crystalline solids. She later became a professor and (along with biochemist Marjory Stephenson) was one of the first female Fellows of theRoyal Society,external. Despite her academic brilliance, the spotlight seemed aimed at her gender, with one newspaper article beginning ""Dame Kathleen Lonsdale at 67 is so tiny she hardly reaches the top drawer of her filing cabinet at London's University College. ""But 14 years ago she was game enough to receive her D.B.E. from the Queen Mother in a hat she'd bought for ninepence."" It's hard to envisage a man being described in those terms. You canhear Dame Kathleen speakingabout the role of science in society and balancing research and motherhood (she had three children) on a 1967 episode of Women's Hour on BBC Radio 4. The scheme celebrates the link between significant figures of the past and the buildings in which they lived and worked. Here are the criteria: They should be regarded as eminent within their own profession or calling Their achievements should have made an exceptional impact in terms of public recognition or their achievements deserve national recognition They must have been dead for 20 years They should have lived in London for a significant period The London building in which they lived or worked should still survive and must not have a significantly altered exterior The building must be within Greater London but outside the City of London, which has its own scheme Buildings with many personal associations, such as churches, schools and theatres, are not normally considered for plaques Anna Eavis, English Heritage's curatorial director, said Princess Diana's campaigns to highlight issues like HIV/Aids and landmines - along with her enduring appeal as ""an inspiration and cultural icon to many""- were deciding factors in giving the go-ahead for her blue plaque. She was nominated by the London Assembly after the body ran a#BackthePlaque campaign,externalasking Londoners to suggest women worthy of the recognition. Plaque location: TBC Helena Normanton fought for married women to be allowed to keep their money instead of it being subsumed into that of their husband upon marriage Born in East London in 1882, Helena Normanton was a woman of firsts - the first woman to join an Inn of Court, first woman to practice at the Bar, first woman to appear in the High Court, first woman to appear in the Old Bailey, first woman to prosecute in a murder trial and one of the two first women to become King's Counsel (KC) in England and Wales. She fought for women's rights to vote and for married women to be allowed to keep their money and property instead of, upon marriage, it being subsumed into that of their husband. She co-founded theMarried Women's Association,externalwith the aim of promoting financial equality during marriage, giving mothers and children a legal right to a share of the family home, securing equal guardianship rights for both parents, and extending the National Insurance Act to give equal provision for women.

"Chief Constable Simon Byrne faces questions at meeting of Northern Ireland Policing Board It comes after Public Prosecution Service announced no prosecutions of anyone who attended Bobby Storey's funeral The funeral last June attracted 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - when Covid restrictions were in place First Minister Arlene Foster called for chief constable to resign in wake of the decision - he has rejected that Earlier, Stormont Assembly was recalled from Easter break and MLAs passed motion censuring Sinn FÃ©in ministers Sinn FÃ©in was accused in assembly of showing arrogance and privilege; deputy first minister apologised for ""the hurt caused"" Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to examine Police Service of Northern Ireland's role in funeral Emily McGarvey, Stewart Robson, Chris Andrews, Edited by Fiona Murray and Iain McDowell That's all from us for today - thank you for following our live coverage of the Stormont Assembly and the Northern Ireland Policing Board. Have a nice evening! BBC News NI There's plenty still to come from the BBC News NI team this evening. In about half-an-hour Coronavirus Catch-up will be coming live from Belfast's SSE Arena - Northern Ireland's new mass Covid-19 vaccination centre.

Tune in on the BBC News NI website, the BBC iPlayer and the BBC News NI Facebook page. BBC News NI Sinn FÃ©in has been accused of showing arrogance, self-entitlement and privilege over its actions in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey. MLAs passed a motion censuring party ministers after it was announced there would be no prosecutions. First Minister Arlene Foster said the wake and funeral procession were clear acts of ""premeditated breaches of the Covid regulations"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - who was one of the Sinn FÃ©in politicians who attended the funeral - apologised ""for the hurt that has been caused to so many families who have lost a loved one"". Read more:Sinn FÃ©in accused of 'arrogance and self entitlement' BBC News NI PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne has expressed surprise at the conclusion by the Public Prosecution Service not to prosecute anyone in relation to their attendance at Bobby Storey's funeral. Mr Byrne said he recognised that the policing of the former IRA intelligence chief's funeral last June had caused outrage and damaged confidence in the PSNI. He added: ""The PPS draw their conclusions but this is what we're wrestling with now."" Read more:Police chief 'surprised' by PPS funeral decision DUP MLA Trevor Clarke says he feels ""sorry for the rank and file officers out on the street on a daily basis"" as a result of the Bobby Storey funeral row. He probes the senior officers about a paragraph in the PPS report which he says states that a Sinn FÃ©in organiser told police that stewards would be in place outside Mr Storey's home to encourage social distancing, with police not needed in attendance. Mr Clarke asks whether that ""assurance"" would guarantee no prosecutions if another similar-sized funeral was to take place again? It was estimated that 400 people would be outside the home and ACC Alan Alan Todd says there were people there ""who shouldn't have been there"". ""It wasn't a deal, it wasn't an arrangement,"" he adds. ""We merely sought to understand what was happening so we could understand how we could respond to that."" Mr Todd says it would have taken time to make ""an informed approach"" in sending officers to the scene with crowds dispersing after a short period of time. The Policing Board meeting draws to a close. âI do not understand how people did not get what 'stay at
home' meant,"" says the SDLP's Delores Kelly. She asks whether the Sinn FÃ©in funeral organisation plan included numbers of how
many people would attend the funeral. Chief Constable Simon Byrne says that based upon a risk assessment provided by organisers that number was 30. About 2,000 people turned up to watch the funeral cortege. Chief Constable Simon Byrne says the PSNI is ""trying to make sense"" of how its ""legitimate engagement"" in relation to the funeral, which he compares to police planning for events such as bonfires, has ""put us in this situation"". He says police needed to get an understanding of how the funeral would play out in terms of Covid regulations as well as ""public safety"". ""That was not a deliberate attempt to give any community or any individuals a free pass at the regulations."" Mr Byrne continues: ""We are here to enforce and uphold the law. ""We went into this endeavour with an assumption that the independent investigator Mark Webster would follow the evidence and present his findings to the PPS, which is what he did, with a recommendation for prosecution. ""We find ourselves where we do but we are surprised at the outcome."" The Bobby Storey funeral was ""an epic failure"" and has moved Northern Ireland into a system of ""two-tier justice"", says the DUP's Joanne Bunting. She asks the senior PSNI officers why the force did not ask if the funeral organisers were asking people to stay away from the event. ""It was our job to explain what we saw as the regulations and encourage people to comply with them,"" says ACC Alan Todd. ""We were making various assessments of what the likelihood of that compliance was but I didn't and I didn't want my team to get into something that could be portrayed for what it wasn't."" He says the PSNI's approach was to have consistent with engagement with the organisers. Ms Bunting, an MLA for East Belfast, also asks if stewards and organisers of the funeral were assigned to a proscribed organisation. Mr Todd says he ""did not get into"" investigating individuals, claiming it was not his job to do so. Sinn FÃ©in MLA SeÃ¡n Lynch wants to know whether the PSNI can rescind finesissued to people involved in Black Lives Matter protestsin Northern Ireland last year. Chief Constable Simon Byrne says the force has received legal advice which states that it cannot cancel the fines. He tells the board: ""Because the fines have gone into the court after the penalty notices were issued it would be a matter for individuals to either contest the allegation which they face or for the PPS if they thought a ticket had been issued inappropriately to withdraw it."" ""I know there's differing opinions flying around in relation to this,"" he says. Assistant Chief Constable Alan Todd says a ""plan"" was sent to the PSNI by the funeral organisers, detailing the logistics of the day, which officers then looked at. ""It wasn't the basis for negotiation,"" he says. The senior officer says he knew it was ""always going to be a challenging funeral"" with thousands of people expected to attend. ""We set our mind to what the tactical options were in respect of that,"" he says, ""which was evidence gathering."" Simon Byrne says that following Bobby Storey's death there were a ""fast-time dialogue"" between the PSNI and Sinn FÃ©in representatives regarding the arrangements for the funeral. Describing it as a ""series of short interactions"", Mr Byrne says he ""could have described that better"" during an interview on BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. Responding to a question from UUP MLA Mike Nesbitt, the chief constable says ""the sense of horse-trading was probably what you heard from the word negotiation - I wasn't trying to imply that"". ""I was trying to describe there was a fast-time dialogue just to understand what the funeral arrangements were so the commanders involved in that could make their risk assessments and prepare their plans and contingencies for that operation."" Chief Constable Simon Byrne says the PSNI ""went into this endeavour with an intent to police the funeral in a sensitive but proportionate way, recognising there were risks"". ""We went into this operation to gather evidence, which is what we did, in case there were breaches because there was always that very real prospect,"" he told the policing board. ""No one's pretending, to a certain degree if you like, we didn't see this coming."" ""We are where we are now and obviously the PPS are reviewing their decision and who knows where they may conclude, and we have to wait [for] that too, but certainly speaking for myself and for the gold commander, if we had anticipated this is where we would have ended up we may have taken an entirely different approach."" John Blair of Alliance is up next. The South Antrim MLA asks Mr Byrne if he will commit to a review of the PSNI engagement processes, which he hopes would be conducted in a way that ""would identify any issues that are causing problems, and remove any future problems"". Simon Byrne says he welcomes the engagement of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) as an ""independent body to come in and help us get an objective understanding of just what went on"". ""Regardless of what HMIC find in a few weeks, what reflection we're able to do ourselves, clearly there are a number of issues at the heart of this,"" the chief constable says. ""Firstly, everyone would have empathy with people who were unable to bury their loved ones in ways that we would traditionally expect. ""We have recognised from the outset, actually, how difficult policing funerals may have been."" First to pose a question this afternoon is DUP MLA Mervyn Storey. He begins by listing a number of events during the pandemic where believes the PSNI took a different approach to policing. They include Black Lives Matter protests. He says: ""While
my party leader has stated publicly what she believes should be the situation in regards
to your position, will you take the opportunity to apologise to those many hundreds of
families who were not afforded the privilege of police acquiescence or police
assistance in the spirit of the letter of the law?  PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne says he recognises that ""events surrounding the policing of this funeral have caused outrage and have damaged confidence in policing"". ""I am listening, but I am confident that my officers have acted with good intent and integrity, managing what was always going to be a sensitive policing operation,"" he told the policing board. In his opening remarks, Mr Byrne said he wanted to ""place on record"" his ""clear and unequivocal understanding about the sympathy we have for the hurt, concern and anger felt by so many people who complied with the health protection regulations over the last year"". Before taking questions, the chief constable stated: ""The PPS themselves, not withstanding some of the public and political concern, found no evidence that deals were done in the run-up to this funeral."" Today's public meeting opens. All attendees are appearing via video link including Stormont MLAs. The Chief Constable Simon Byrne is up first. Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor We've had some heated and passionate exchanges in the chamber, not least from those MLAs who've lost loved ones and friends during the pandemic and were unable to attend their funerals. They had pointed remarks for both Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Conor Murphy, both of whom attended Bobby Storey's funeral last year. Even before the debate started, Sinn FÃ©in MLA and Speaker Alex Maskey was challenged for his impartiality, and that set the tone. Ms O'Neill was challenged several times across the chamber floor to apologise for her attendance at the funeral. She didn't do that, but she did say sorry for the hurt caused. This is a non-binding debate which means there will be a vote in the chamber, but there will be no effect on Sinn FÃ©in because this simply registers other MLAs' anger at what happened. In the absence of a court case, it's another chance for MLAs to deliver their verdicts. Ironically, ministers are likely tochange the laws around funerals again with a recommendation to increase the numbers who can attend to 35. It is easy to forget we are still plotting our pathway out of lockdown. Those are the big decisions, for some, which will be made later. No further deaths related to Covid-19 were reported on Thursday by the department of health, meaning its total remains at 2,115. There were 107 more positive cases of the virus identified, bringing the overall tally during the pandemic to 117,396. There are 17 patients being treated in intensive care, with 112 inpatients and nine requiring ventilation. The department statistics show there are five active outbreaks registered at NI care homes. To sum up today's proceedings in the chamber: Sinn FÃ©in has been accused of showing arrogance, self-entitlement and privilege over its actions in relation to the funeral of Bobby Storey. MLAs passed a motion censuring party ministers after it was announced there would be no prosecutions. The funeral in June 2020 attracted 2,000 mourners at a time when Covid restrictions were in place. The actions of 24 Sinn FÃ©in politicians were examined, including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Finance Minister Conor Murphy. In the assembly today, the deputy first minister apologised ""for the hurt that has been caused to so many families who have lost a loved one"". Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"First Minister Mark Drakeford and Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton give a Welsh government update The top nine priority groups will have had a first vaccination by Sunday, Mr Drakeford says From 12 April, travel outside of Wales is due to be allowed again From 26 April, outdoor hospitality will reopen, with indoor hospitality possibly reopening as early as 17 May From 10 May, families can meet again indoors, with extended households able to form again between two households James McCarthy and David Schaffer That's it from our Wales' live page for today, thank you for joining us. Here are the main points:  Wales' opposition parties have responded to the Welsh
Government's plans for the latest easing of lockdown restrictions. Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies said it was
âgood to seeâ Mr Drakeford âhad bought into the idea of a roadmapâ. âAlthough it's very late in the day,â he told Wales Today. He said it was âunfortunateâ that further funding had not been
made available to the hospitality sector. âWhatâs really dumbfounding is that despite his mental health
ministers' assurances that gyms will be one of the first facilities to open,
they are now not going to open until May.â He said outdoor hospitality should be opening on 12 April - in
line with plans in England. 'Disappointing delay' Plaid Cymruâs Adam Price said the government should move faster
with easing restrictions. âWe've also been calling for a much more accelerated timetable
in terms of reopening gyms, because of their importance in terms of mental and
physical well-being. ""So, I think it's disappointing to see that being delayed
until May the 10th,â he told Wales Today. âThere are dangers of course in moving too fast but thereâs an
equal danger of being over cautiousâ. 'Beer before exercise' Rodney Berman, of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: âI think
we are broadly satisfied with the pace.â He welcomed the planned move to alert level three. âThe fact that we've got a bit of a roadmap here, that we've got
a bit more clarity for various sectors - hospitality, gyms, I think, is to be
welcomed. â[But] youâll be able to go into a beer garden before you'll be
able to take part in even an outdoor exercise class. âThe important thing is that
we do now have a roadmap for when different things are going to open up, but we
maybe do need to look at the level of financial support to businesses that
aren't quite able to open yet.â  Financial support for businesses will not be interrupted and will continue throughout April, Wales' first minister has said. Mark Drakeford told the press conference that Â£180m of funding was announced in the middle of March ""to make sure the businesses in Wales would have the help they need to see them through."" ""Businesses will see no interruption in the flow of financial support to them over that period"", he said. He added: ""Many businesses have already received the help that's available to them, and for others who are still in the process of applying, cash grants will continue to be paid during April as those applications are confirmed. ""And alongside the money that we announced and is already reaching businesses, we've also put Â£200m aside in the Welsh Government's budget for the next financial year."" Election rules mean the Welsh Government cannot make further decisions during the pre-elction period, Mr Drakeford added. Wales' first minister has warned the nation must ""work together""  to fight coronavirus. Mark Drakeford said: âToday, Wales has the lowest level of coronavirus of all four UK nations and the highest rates of vaccination. âThese are the reasons for us all to be hopeful and optimistic about the weeks ahead."" He added: ""We have to remember that the pandemic isnât over â it's more important than ever that we continue to work together to keep this terrible virus under control so that we can go on unlocking Wales."" Plaid
Cymru leader Adam Price has told the Welsh government that gyms should be being opened up as soon as possible. It comes as gym owners branded the delay in reopening their business in Wales as ""short-sighted and irresponsible."" Mr Price said ""gyms should be able to safely re-open now -
not least to help with people's wellbeing and mental health which has suffered
so much during the last few months"". The Welsh Liberal Democrats have called for help for people who could lose jobs with the end of furlough as lockdown eases. And party leader Jane Dodds called for support for those who could lose their homes when the eviction ban ends. Leader
of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Jane Dodds, said: ""Now that more and more of
Wales is opening up and life is slowly returning to normal, it's time to put
our recovery first. ""I
want to see support for those individuals who will lose their jobs when
furlough ends, those who are likely to lose their homes when the ban on
evictions is lifted and those whose mental health has suffered as a result of
this pandemic."" She was speaking as the Welsh Government announcedWales' pubs could reopen and families meet indoors in May. Wales' first minister has continued to set out his lockdown plans, into May. ""I want to see businesses open and trading,â he said. âWe all wantto see our pubs open, people celebrating getting married and Wales welcoming visitors again.â Plans after 6 May depend on the results of the Senedd election, and whether Mark Drakeford is re-elected. Mr Drakeford said if he returned as FM, on 17 May he would allow for: âBeyond that date our ambition will be for indoor hospitality and remaining visitor accommodation to be able to open ahead of the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May,â he added. âBut that as you will appreciate is many weeks from now, and the public health position at the time, will determine whether that is possible.â  Tory leader Andrew RT Davies has criticised the Welsh Government over changes to lockdown financial support for businesses. In a tweet, the Tory leader said that ""sadly"" it was not April Fools Day. ""Labour are keeping thousands of Welsh businesses shut until the end of April and cutting off vital support,"" he said. ""Itâs a dreadful decision that will put so many Welsh jobs at risk.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would  continue a âcareful, step-by-step approach, lifting restrictions week by week, provided the public health situation continues to remain favourable.â The focus for the next three weeks is to ensure all pupils and students return to schools and colleges from 12 April, he said. From that Monday, he explained:  Outdoor canvassing for elections can begin but within strict guidelines. At the same time the go ahead will be given for a ânumber of outdoor pilot eventsâ, including cultural and sports events. Mr Drakeford said his government will work with the Muslim council to consider how to help people to celebrate Eid. âThis is a significant package of measures, a series of steps forward in our journey back to normality and will give everybody a sense of life returning again,â he said. Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton said the overall public health situation in Wales was âremaining quite stableâ. âCommunity transmission is much reduced compared to a few weeks ago,â he said. Latest figures show the seven-day coronavirus rate for Wales has reduced to about 35 cases per 100,000 people, he said. The rate that tests are being returned positive has fallen to 2.5%.

However, he added there were âclusters of casesâ, which have been traced back to people meeting and mixing indoors. Dr Atherton said he did not want to have to advise the FM that lockdown restrictions need to be reintroduced, as seen elsewhere in Europe. By Sunday Wales will have offered a vaccine to everyone in the first nine priority groups, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. That includes everyone over 50, all adults with an underlying health condition and many unpaid carers. A minimum of 75% in each priority group will have received a first vaccination, Mr Drakeford said, describing it as a ""major milestone"". Latest figures show more than 57% of adults in Wales have had the vaccine, he told a press conference. He said Wales was âgetting closeâ to one-in-five adults having completed a two-dose course. He said this means the programme is âpowering aheadâ. Take up, he said, is excellent, with over half of the groups counted it is more than 90%. âThis is a truly remarkable effort and is down to the hard work of thousands of people who are working tirelessly on the frontline of the NHS right across Wales to make this happen,â he said. A total of 1,443,885 have now recieved a first dose of Covid 19 vaccine. A total of 449,538 have had two doses. There have been two further deaths of people with Covidreported in Wales in the past 24 hours, health chiefs say. It means the total number of deaths reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) since the pandemic began in March 2020, stands at 5,509. A further 188 cases have been reported, taking the total number of positive tests to 209, 532. Wales' seven day case rate now stands at 35. Pubs, restaurants and hotels in Wales may reopen indoors intime for the Spring Bank Holiday at the end of May. The Welsh government also said two households could meet indoors from 10 May, if Covid cases remained low. Travel into and out of Wales from the rest of the UK andCommon Travel Area,externalcan go ahead from 12 April and hospitality could reopen outdoors from 26 April. From 3 May, wedding receptions with up to 30 people can take place outdoors. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Samuel Kasumu has worked for the government since 2019 Boris Johnson's senior adviser on ethnic minorities is to stand down, amid a row over a government-commissioned report on race. Samuel Kasumu is known to have been unhappy with the government's stance on racial issues. He has not commented on the report, which said the UK ""no longer"" had a system rigged against minorities. The PM said the report was ""original and stimulating"" but he did not agree with ""absolutely everything"" in it. Equality campaigners have criticised it for downplaying the extent of racism in British society and institutions. PM's minority adviser: Tories 'steeped in division' Campaigners criticise government race report Key points: What does the race report say? Former equality and human rights commissioner Lord Simon Woolley said there was a ""crisis at No 10 when it comes to acknowledging and dealing with persistent race inequality"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: The government ""won't agree with every word"" in report Labour's shadow equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova called the report ""divisive,"" adding it was ""no wonder"" the government was ""losing the expertise from their team"". ""To have your most senior advisor on ethnic minorities quit as you publish a so-called landmark report on race in the UK is telling of how far removed the Tories are from the everyday lived experiences of Black, Asian and ethnic minority people,"" she added. A Downing Street spokesman insisted Mr Kasumu had been planning ""for several months"" to leave government in May. ""Any suggestion that this decision has been made this week or that this is linked to the [commission's] report is completely inaccurate,"" he added. Samuel Kasumu may not be a name you're familiar with; even one minister awkwardly said they'd never heard of him this morning. But his resignation is a difficult moment for the government on the sensitive, divisive topic of race. Downing street has denied any suggestion his departure is linked to Wednesday's report. Without Samuel Kasumu's version of events, it's hard to know why and when he chose to resign - having changed his mind about quitting earlier in the year. But his departure leaves questions about the confidence some in government, let alone the public, have about the prime minister's approach to tackling racial inequality. Last year Boris Johnson said he wanted to ""change the narrative"" on this subject  - but this is unlikely to be what he had in mind. Mr Johnson said he had ""worked closely"" with Mr Kasumu - who will leave his role next month - and he had ""done some great stuff and I thank him very much"". The adviser had previously handed in a resignation letter in February, accusing the Conservatives of a ""politics steeped in division"". He had asked to keep working on a project to combat disinformation on Covid vaccines, with ""the view to leaving at the end of May"". But Mr Kasumu went on to retract this letter, following talks with vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi. Mr Kasumu has declined to comment, but sources told the BBC there has been an ""awkward silence"" hanging over Downing Street, with little discussion or movement since he first threatened to resign. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities (CRED) was launched last summer in the wake of anti-racism Black Lives Matter protests last summer. In its reportpublished on Wednesday,external, it concluded the UK was not yet a ""post-racial country,"" but family structure and social class had a bigger impact than race on people's life chances. It argued that racial discrimination has often been misapplied to ""account for every observed disparity"" between ethnic groups. And it said references to racism in the UK being ""institutional"" or ""structural"" had sometimes been used without sufficient evidence. Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a member of the commission, said the report was not denying institutional racism existed, but said they had not discovered evidence of it in the areas they had looked. The commission made 24 recommendations, including urging more research into school performance and for organisations to ditch unconscious bias training. The report was commissioned in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests in the UK Speaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said the commission had suggested several ""interesting ideas"" and the government would respond in ""due course"". ""I don't say the government is going to agree with absolutely everything in it, but it has some original and stimulating work in it that I think people need to read and to consider,"" Mr Johnson added. ""There are very serious issues that our society faces to do with racism that we need to address. ""We've got to do more to fix it, we need to understand the severity of the problem, and we're going to be looking at all the ideas that they have put forward"". The commission's chairman Tony Sewell, an education consultant and ex-charity boss, has meanwhile defended himself from criticism over comments he made in the report about how the British Empire should be taught in schools. In his foreword to the report, he wrote: ""There is a new story about the Caribbean experience which speaks to the slave period not only being about profit and suffering but how culturally African people transformed themselves into a re-modelled African/Britain"". Halima Begum, chief executive of race equality think tank the Runnymede Trust, said his comments were ""out of kilter with where British society is"" - and Labour's Ms de Cordova accused him of ""putting a positive spin on slavery"". But in a statement on Thursday, Dr Sewell said it was ""absurd to suggest that the commission is trying to downplay the evil of the slave trade"". ""The report merely says that, in the face of the inhumanity of slavery, African people preserved their humanity and culture,"" he added.

"Mark Fortune failed to get on the list of fit and proper landlords in 2013 Flats owned by a man who was refused entry to Scotland's landlord register have been let out for residential use under the guise of holiday lets. Mark Fortunefailed to get on the list of fit and proper landlords in 2013after threatening his tenants. But rooms in his Edinburgh flats are being let out under contracts which do not give tenants the same protection as residential agreements. The millionaire property tycoon denied that he rents out flats. Mr Fortune said the properties are operated by limited companies, not him personally. This video can not be played Tenants have shared evidence of poor maintenance standards in flats owned by Mark Fortune. Former tenants have told BBC Scotland that they were given monthly holiday let contracts to sign, despite making clear they were in Edinburgh to live and work. People who have lived in properties owned by Mr Fortune have shared evidence of poor maintenance standards, such as damp, broken windows and faulty wiring, and some claim to have not had their deposit returned when they moved out. One couple said they were asked to leave a flat owned by Mr Fortune during the Covid pandemic after requesting that some repairs be made to the property. Gergely Farkas and Hailey La Sarre said the flat they lived in had a number of issues Hailey La Sarre and Gergely Farkas moved into a flatshare in Edinburgh in October last year. The flat is owned by Mr Fortune and their contract was with Edinburgh Rent Limited. Companies House has Mr Fortune listed as its sole director and the person with significant control. Hailey and Gergely said the flat had a number of issues, including a broken skylight and faulty electrics. When they raised the problems, they were told that they would have to leave the property. ""Your heart sinks,"" said Hailey. ""What are you supposed to do? You don't expect that. You ask for a simple fix and they say get out."" A damaged skylight in the property where Hailey and Gergely lived Edinburgh Rent told the couple their holiday let contract was not being renewed, but Hailey said this was not their understanding of the deal when they found the room listed on the flatmate-finder website Spare Room. She said: ""On their listing online it said that it was long-term lets, implying that we could stay as long as we want."" A group called Mark Fortune Investigation (MFI) said it had been contacted by more than 40 former tenants in flats operated by the businessman's companies. MFI said these people had shared accounts of the flats being in a poor state of repair with issues such as faulty boilers and damp. The group also claimed the majority of ex-tenants who contacted them did not get their deposit back when they moved out. Alessandro Carosi, a spokesman for MFI, said he failed to get his deposit back from a long-term stay in an Edinburgh flat owned by Mr Fortune. He said people had been contacting the MFI group because they wanted their voices to be heard. Alessandro Carosi said MFI want better enforcement of the existing housing laws in place to protect tenants ""The majority are foreigners like me,"" said Mr Carosi. ""A lot of them just move to Edinburgh and they cannot afford more expensive flats."" He said the people contacting MFI had been renting flats under holiday let contracts but living there for a long time. ""That is how Mark Fortune is making his fortune with people on minimum wages or foreigners who just arrive and don't know the rules or the laws,"" he said. One of the Edinburgh city centre streets where Mr Fortune owns property Mr Fortune is thought to own scores of flats across Edinburgh and is no stranger to controversy. In 2013, he wasrefused entry to Scotland's landlord registerafter being convicted of offences directly relating to his letting business, including threatening tenants. Edinburgh City Council said Mr Fortune last applied to join the landlord register in 2018 and this was refused. Mr Fortune told BBC Scotland this application was made in 2015 and that he withdrew it in 2018. Mr Fortune is listed at Companies House as the only director of a company called Edinburgh Holiday and Party Lets (EHPL). Last year part ofa housing tribunal ruling,externalsaid that a person living in a flat operated by EHPL was doing so on a private residential tenancy and not a holiday let agreement. It pointed out the person was living and working in Edinburgh and had lived in the property for seven months. The ruling stated: ""The agreement signed by the parties states that it is a holiday let. However, the evidence clearly establishes that it was not."" The ruling goes on to say that EHPL ""appears to have called the tenancy agreement a holiday let in an attempt to avoid security of tenure and the requirement to serve proper notice and apply to the tribunal for an eviction order"". BBC Scotland showed one of the ""holiday let"" agreements used by one of Mr Fortune's firms to Catherine McQuarrie, a residential tenancy law specialist at TC Young Solicitors. She pointed out a number of problems with the one-page contract, which quoted legislation that had been superseded. She said: ""It's quite clear from the wording of the document that the person using this is attempting to get out of complying with the legislation that would otherwise apply to protect the tenant. ""Essentially you can't have a holiday let if you're not on holiday. It's as simple as that. ""That simply means that the agreement is null and void and instead the parties have a private residential tenancy agreement."" Holiday lets are exempt from tenant protections such as the landlord registration scheme and putting deposits into third-party protection schemes. Mr Fortune told BBC Scotland he was not banned from the landlord register but that a decision was taken to not place his name on the list of Scotland's approved landlords. He added: ""I do not operate as a landlord, any properties both residential or commercial are operated by limited companies having been granted a licence by myself which allows commercial subletting. ""All deposits that were due for refund have, I'm advised, been refunded."" Mr Fortune said the complaints raised represent a ""very small percentage of overall residents"" of  the 160 properties he says he owns.

Thank you for joining us and we will be back on Friday morning. Mickey the pony is helping book club members ride out lockdown We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's news: Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Swedes have
been told they canât be guaranteed more than one Covid-19 vaccine dose before 15 August, with ministers formally abandoning a previous promise that all
adults would be fully vaccinated during the first half of 2021. Itâs a major disappointment for
many Swedes, who had, for months, been told they should get two jabs before Midsummer in June, the biggest public holiday in Swedenâs calendar, when locals dance
around maypoles and dine on large buffets of herring and meatballs. At a news conference on
Thursday, Health Minister Lena Hallengren
said a shortage of vaccine supplies from producers was to blame for the delay. But Swedenâs vaccine co-ordinator
Richard Bergstrom told Swedish public service television network SVT that he
still viewed the overall situation as âa fantastic success storyâ, despite the
country missing its target. So far around 1.1 million
people (14.3% of those eligible for a vaccination) have had at least one
dose of the vaccine, in a country of 10 million. This is the wonderful moment 98-year-old Yoshia Uomoto was surprised by her son and niece in Seattle, Washington. It was her first in-person visit from family in a year. Mrs Uomoto lives at Nikkei Manor, a nursing home primarily for Japanese-American seniors. All the residents at the home have now been full vaccinated, allowing family, who have also had their jabs, to come inside to visit. Mark Uomoto, 68, told America's TODAY show that before this moment, they had been talking to his mother through the window, which was difficult as she has trouble hearing. ""It was so wonderful to hear, see her expression of excitement that she had because we've not seen Mom, my cousin and I, for over a year,"" he told the programme. ""So it was wonderful to see her and it was more heart warming for me to see her reaction and so happy to see us."" UK festivals are starting to reveal their line-ups as the nation slowly and cautiously comes out of lockdown - but there has been dismay, with the noticeable lack of women entertainers. One event in the spotlight wasKendal Calling,externalin Cumbria, whose first swathe of acts was predominantly male. Organisers said the initial line-up only reflected about 20% of the full programme, but Emma Zillmann, the festival's booker, admits the criticism was ""completely valid"" and women's names should be higher on the bill. Before the pandemic, the issue of achieving gender-balanced festivals was high on the industry's agenda through various schemes,such as Keychange,external, which aims for a 50/50 split across all line-ups. Last year,a new free-to-use database of female artists was published, providing details of more than 4,500 musicians in all genres of music. And Glastonbury'sEmily Eavis has previously saidher festival needs to achieve a gender balanced line-up as soon as it can. ""It's about supporting women and gender minority artists from the bottom up. Remember that we're trying to undo years and years and years of discrimination, and it's just going to take longer to do than maybe it should."" Read morehere. We've been bringing you updates about long Covid after the Office for National Statistics estimated that1.1 million people were affected in the UKin the four weeks from 6 February. And many people have shared their experiences of the illness. Jade Gray-Christie told us that her life has been turned upside down since getting Covid in March 2020. For months afterwards she experienced chest pains and difficulty breathing. Sometimes she slept more than 16 hours per day, and struggled with the day-to-day activities needed to look after herself. She says: ""My fatigue was like nothing I've ever experienced before."" This video can not be played Reece says what he thought would be a mild illness became a protracted nightmare with his partner Alice becoming his carer. In this video he says: ""It's like someone has piled sandbags on top of me."" Midwife Jo Aitken has been unable to work and needs a wheelchair to get aroundsince getting long Covid. She says: ""I can't walk more than 10 metres without needing a rest."" She cried with relief when her doctor said he expected her to make a full recovery. ""At the moment I can't really see an end to it, but him saying that, it kind of put the light at the end of the tunnel,"" she says. The NHS has launched aYour Covid Recovery,externalwebsite to offer support and advice to people affected. Russia has announced it has registered what it says is the world's first coronavirus vaccine specifically for animals. While scientists say there is currently no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the disease to people, infections have been confirmed in various species worldwide. These include dogs, cats, apes and even mink. To address these infections, scientists are developing Covid-19 vaccines that are specially designed for animals. Here's what we know so far. A total of 31,147,444 people have received their first coronavirus vaccination,government daily figures show.,external And 4,513,458 have received their second dose. There have been a further 51 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, the government'sdaily statistics show.,external That brings the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test to 126,764. There were also 4,479 new infections detected. Russia's Covid-19 vaccine,Sputnik V, has been authorised for emergency use in Kenya, the Health Ministry has said. It had earlier cautioned against the distribution of the vaccine, saying it was yet to meet ""all the necessary regulatory approvals for use"" in Kenya. Kenya received 1.02 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine under theCovax scheme, but uptake of it has been low, at only 5% according to local media. Kenya's vaccine rollout has been problematic, with hesitancy from healthcare workers, while some centres have run out of jabs or people who do not currently qualify to get the vaccine have shown up and been given the shot, AP reports. Though Africa was not hit as hard as experts feared during the first year of the pandemic, some countries are in the middle of sharp increases in infections, including Kenya which has seen a 53% average weekly increase over the past month. The capital, Nairobi, and four neighbouring counties are currently under a strict lockdown and curfew. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he is ""very worried"" about the impact of long Covid and has said it is one example of how important it is to ""tackle this pandemic for good"". His comments follow an Office of National Statistics (ONS) survey suggested 1.1 million people were affected by lingering symptoms in the UK in the four weeks from 6 February. Speaking during a visit to Public Health England Colindale, Mr Hancock said: ""I am very worried about the impact of long Covid"". He said it was ""one of the reasons we need to tackle this pandemic for good"" and explained how the government was ""putting more research money into tackling and understanding long Covid"". Mr Hancock went on to say Covid-19 is a ""very strange, very dangerous virus"" and said when it comes to self-isolation, ""the vast majority of people do the right thing"".
""If you suspect you have covid then it is vital you self-isolate to protect other people"". Read more about the ONS datahere. Premier League football matches have been played in empty stadiums during the Covid-19 pandemic. And for the first time there have been more away wins than home wins. BBC football expert Pat Nevin examines the reasons why Premier League teams have struggled at home since matches went behind closed doors. This video can not be played Why empty grounds have destroyed home advantage Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Weâve been looking carefully
at two parts of the infection survey data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) â because they were showing
rises last week that could warn about the risks of easing lockdown. But neither have continued to rise. In Scotland, where the
youngest children returned to school at the end of February, there had been
hints of rising numbers in recent weeks. And in England, we saw
increasing numbers of infections in secondary school pupils in the weeks after
they returned to school. But those rises have stalled - in fact, in Scotland, they've even reversed slightly - suggesting that the opening up so far is
not leading to rapidly rising infections. There is a wrinkle in
England, though. Public Health England (PHE) surveillance data show higher numbers of cases among secondary school age pupils than they have for
months. Some of these rises are due
to more testing â particularly the new rapid tests that all secondary pupils
are supposed to take a couple of times every week. Statisticians prefer the ONS infection survey because it doesnât get blown about by changes in who comes
forward to get tested â it picks a group of people at random and tests them. So, while the experts will be keeping a close eye on the
PHE surveillence data to see how this weekâs trend plays out, the ONS infection survey gives the
clearest picture of trends in infection levels. The new Moderna vaccine could arrive in Scotland as early as next week, Scotland's chief medical officer has said. Dr Gregor Smith told the Scottish government's daily Covid briefing the jab was similar to the Pfizer vaccine. It needs to be kept at low temperatures and will only be available at the very large vaccination centres in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. The National Clinical Director Professor Jason Leitch said the numbers coming to Scotland will be low at first - but described Moderna as a help and as an additional arm of the vaccine programme. It comes as Scotland recorded 400 new Covid cases - but with a very low test positivity rate of 1.8 per cent. Read more hereabout the development. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics More now on new data released by the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said there is evidence of a decline in infections in the South East and South West of England, of an increase in the East of England, but that the trends are uncertain for the rest of England. The ONS said rates fell in those aged 50-69 in the week to 27 March, but the trends are uncertain in other age groups. It means increases seen in older school age pupils in the first weeks after reopening in England do not look to have continued throughout March. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest that about 180,000  people in the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 March. That is 0.28% of the population or 1-in-360 people, slightly lower than 1-in-330 people in the previous week. The ONS said infections have âdecreasedâ in England and Scotland, are âuncertainâ in Wales and are possibly increasing in Northern Ireland . England:1-in-370 are estimated to be testing positive for coronavirusVs 1-in-340 last week Wales:1-in-570Vs 1-in-450 last week Northern Ireland:1-in-220Vs 1-in-320 last week Scotland:1-in-320Vs 1-in-240 last week Israel is already vaccinating all citizens and residents aged 16 and above Israel hopes to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19
vaccine to children aged between 12 and 15 from May,after the initial results of US trials suggested it was safe and effective. The country has already offered vaccinations to all citizens
and residents aged 16 and above, and it has administered two doses to more than half of its 9.3 million population. The governmentâs coronavirus czar, Nachman Ash, said jabs would be offered to the lower age group once the US Food and Drug
Administration and the Israeli health ministry had given their approval. The daily numbers of new infections and seriously-ill
patients in Israel have fallen as a result of its world-leading vaccination programme. Experts say children's risk of becoming ill or dying with
Covid-19 is tiny, but health ministry director general Hezi Levy told Army
Radio: ""We are seeing a rise in the number of children who are hospitalised,
and we are seeing children without symptoms but who suffer from complications.â âThe risk from the vaccine is much lower,â he added. Pfizer and BioNTech said the trials of their vaccine in
2,260 adolescents in the US ""demonstrated 100% efficacy and robust
antibody responses"". They also suggested there were no unusual side-effects. England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty has been speaking to a Royal Society of Medicine webinar about the coronavirus. In a wide-ranging discussion, Whitty has said those without Covid antibodies may still be protected from severe disease - and the slow easing of England's restrictions reflects how difficult the pandemic has been. He said: ""I certainly don't think you should assume that if you have lower or no antibodies that means there is no protection. ""It probably does mean you're more likely to get infected and it may mean you're more likely to be infectious, but doesn't necessarily mean you won't have protection from going into hospital, or having severe disease or mortality."" And he said caution around reopening was needed ""because we've got such a difficult situation to go through at the moment"". ""What we don't want to be is in a situation where we look back in six months and say 'If we'd only just been a bit more cautious for a month or two,"" he added. Whitty also predicted there could be a ""very wide portfolio of vaccines"" in around two years and that technology can ""turn around a vaccine to a new variant incredibly fast, compared to how historically we've been able to do it"". We've been reporting new research which suggests as many as half of all UK adults do not know the main symptoms of Covid-19. So how can you be sure whether you have coronavirus, a cold or the flu? They are all caused by different viruses, but can have similar symptoms. BBC online health editor Michelle Robertshas looked into this here.

"Princess Diana spent several years living at a flat in Earl's Court, west London, before she married Charles, Prince of Wales Blue plaques to commemorate six women including Diana, Princess of Wales, are due to be installed later this year. One will be placed at the Earl's Court flat where the then Lady Diana Spencer lived for several years before marrying Prince Charles. The mansion-block apartment at 60 Coleherne Court was an 18th birthday gift from her parents. Only 14% of the plaques in the capital honour women and these new ones are intended to help address the imbalance, English Heritage said. Dame Kathleen Lonsdale, Caroline Norton, Jean Muir, Ellen Craft and Helena Normanton are the five recipients not famous for marrying into the royal family. Here are the potted histories of their achievements. Plaque location: Central London Jean Muir argued for the importance of British fashion manufacturing Jean Muir was a designer famous for her outfits with long, fluid lines, classic cut and simple yet skilful tailoring. She taught herself to sew at boarding school, and her favourite fabrics included jersey, crepe and suede, usually in dark, plain colours - midnight navy in particular. She also argued for the importance of British fashion manufacturing and appealed for it to be recognised and valued as a skilled industry. ""We must combat once and for all the idea that there is something lowly about working with one's hands. Hands need the mind,"" she said. Plaque location: Central London Caroline Norton improved the fates of many a woman by fighting for divorce rights for wives Mrs Norton brought about one of the first pieces of feminist legislation in the UK by dint of fighting for the custody of her children after she left her abusive husband. She was also determined to keep the rights to her own property, such as profits from her published writings. She had great influence on theMarriage and Divorce Act of 1857,external. The Matrimonial Causes Act meant wives could now allege cruelty and desertion, in addition to the husband's adultery, in order to obtain a divorce. Plaque location: Hammersmith Ellen Craft disguised herself as a white American man Born in 1826, Ellen Craft was an American woman who had been kept in slavery. Because her skin was pale, she managed to disguise herself as a white man. She and her husband fled their homeland, arriving in England in 1850. To avoid suspicion and evade their former masters, who were chasing them, Mr Craft - who had darker skin than his wife - pretended to be her slave. Once in England, the couple toured the country lecturing against slavery, before settling in Hammersmith. Plaque location: Seven Kings, Redbridge Dame Kathleen Lonsdale, pictured in her study at University College, London Dame Kathleen was born in 1903 in County Kildare, the youngest of 10 children. She and her mother and siblings moved to Essex, England in 1908. A bright girl, she won a scholarship to Ilford County High School, but she had to go to maths and science lessons at the local boys' school as her girls' school didn't teach those subjects.

"The usually low-profile Denise Coates was appointed CBE for services to the community and business in 2012 The boss of the gambling firm Bet365 has been awarded one of the biggest pay packets in UK corporate history. The highest paid director of Bet365 Group - believed to be founder and majority shareholder Denise Coates CBE - earned a salary of Â£421m in the year ending 29 March. She also earned Â£48m in dividends, taking her total pay to Â£469m. The company said the arrangements were ""appropriate and fair"", despite sales falling at the firm last year. But campaign group the High Pay Centre said it was ""appallingly inefficient for single individuals to hoard wealth in this way"". Ms Coates, who founded the Bet365 website 20 years ago in Stoke-on-Trent, has been the UK's highest paid boss for several years. How Bet365's Denise Coates hit her own jackpot She is also one of Britain's wealthiest women and a major philanthropist, donating millions through the Denise Coates Foundation. Her salary in the year to March was more than 50% higher than the Â£277m received in 2019 and meant she earned almost Â£1.2m every day last year. That was more than the bosses of every FTSE 100 company combined, according to the High Pay Centre. It came as sales at Bet365 fell 8% to Â£2.8bn as international sporting events were cancelled due to the pandemic. Profits slumped 74% to Â£194.7m. However, the company said it had not cut staff pay or laid off employees as a result of the crisis. It also did not make use of the furlough scheme. The company also paid Â£85m to Ms Coates's charitable foundation. Ms Coates and her brother John took over the gambling business 20 years ago, which was run by their father. Ms Coates now owns about half of the company. She has previously been described as one of the UK's ""most successful women"". Ms Coates achieved a first-class degree in econometrics and later trained as an accountant within the family firm, building further on the knowledge of the then small chain that she picked up while working part-time during high school. The chief executive's annual pay packet is likely to be the biggest in UK history. Earlier this month, hedge fund tycoon Sir Chris Hohn staked a claim to that title after paying himself Â£343m last year.

Thank you for joining us and we will be back on Friday morning. Mickey the pony is helping book club members ride out lockdown We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's news: Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Swedes have
been told they canât be guaranteed more than one Covid-19 vaccine dose before 15 August, with ministers formally abandoning a previous promise that all
adults would be fully vaccinated during the first half of 2021. Itâs a major disappointment for
many Swedes, who had, for months, been told they should get two jabs before Midsummer in June, the biggest public holiday in Swedenâs calendar, when locals dance
around maypoles and dine on large buffets of herring and meatballs. At a news conference on
Thursday, Health Minister Lena Hallengren
said a shortage of vaccine supplies from producers was to blame for the delay. But Swedenâs vaccine co-ordinator
Richard Bergstrom told Swedish public service television network SVT that he
still viewed the overall situation as âa fantastic success storyâ, despite the
country missing its target. So far around 1.1 million
people (14.3% of those eligible for a vaccination) have had at least one
dose of the vaccine, in a country of 10 million. This is the wonderful moment 98-year-old Yoshia Uomoto was surprised by her son and niece in Seattle, Washington. It was her first in-person visit from family in a year. Mrs Uomoto lives at Nikkei Manor, a nursing home primarily for Japanese-American seniors. All the residents at the home have now been full vaccinated, allowing family, who have also had their jabs, to come inside to visit. Mark Uomoto, 68, told America's TODAY show that before this moment, they had been talking to his mother through the window, which was difficult as she has trouble hearing. ""It was so wonderful to hear, see her expression of excitement that she had because we've not seen Mom, my cousin and I, for over a year,"" he told the programme. ""So it was wonderful to see her and it was more heart warming for me to see her reaction and so happy to see us."" UK festivals are starting to reveal their line-ups as the nation slowly and cautiously comes out of lockdown - but there has been dismay, with the noticeable lack of women entertainers. One event in the spotlight wasKendal Calling,externalin Cumbria, whose first swathe of acts was predominantly male. Organisers said the initial line-up only reflected about 20% of the full programme, but Emma Zillmann, the festival's booker, admits the criticism was ""completely valid"" and women's names should be higher on the bill. Before the pandemic, the issue of achieving gender-balanced festivals was high on the industry's agenda through various schemes,such as Keychange,external, which aims for a 50/50 split across all line-ups. Last year,a new free-to-use database of female artists was published, providing details of more than 4,500 musicians in all genres of music. And Glastonbury'sEmily Eavis has previously saidher festival needs to achieve a gender balanced line-up as soon as it can. ""It's about supporting women and gender minority artists from the bottom up. Remember that we're trying to undo years and years and years of discrimination, and it's just going to take longer to do than maybe it should."" Read morehere. We've been bringing you updates about long Covid after the Office for National Statistics estimated that1.1 million people were affected in the UKin the four weeks from 6 February. And many people have shared their experiences of the illness. Jade Gray-Christie told us that her life has been turned upside down since getting Covid in March 2020. For months afterwards she experienced chest pains and difficulty breathing. Sometimes she slept more than 16 hours per day, and struggled with the day-to-day activities needed to look after herself. She says: ""My fatigue was like nothing I've ever experienced before."" This video can not be played Reece says what he thought would be a mild illness became a protracted nightmare with his partner Alice becoming his carer. In this video he says: ""It's like someone has piled sandbags on top of me."" Midwife Jo Aitken has been unable to work and needs a wheelchair to get aroundsince getting long Covid. She says: ""I can't walk more than 10 metres without needing a rest."" She cried with relief when her doctor said he expected her to make a full recovery. ""At the moment I can't really see an end to it, but him saying that, it kind of put the light at the end of the tunnel,"" she says. The NHS has launched aYour Covid Recovery,externalwebsite to offer support and advice to people affected. Russia has announced it has registered what it says is the world's first coronavirus vaccine specifically for animals. While scientists say there is currently no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the disease to people, infections have been confirmed in various species worldwide. These include dogs, cats, apes and even mink. To address these infections, scientists are developing Covid-19 vaccines that are specially designed for animals. Here's what we know so far. A total of 31,147,444 people have received their first coronavirus vaccination,government daily figures show.,external And 4,513,458 have received their second dose. There have been a further 51 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, the government'sdaily statistics show.,external That brings the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test to 126,764. There were also 4,479 new infections detected. Russia's Covid-19 vaccine,Sputnik V, has been authorised for emergency use in Kenya, the Health Ministry has said. It had earlier cautioned against the distribution of the vaccine, saying it was yet to meet ""all the necessary regulatory approvals for use"" in Kenya. Kenya received 1.02 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine under theCovax scheme, but uptake of it has been low, at only 5% according to local media. Kenya's vaccine rollout has been problematic, with hesitancy from healthcare workers, while some centres have run out of jabs or people who do not currently qualify to get the vaccine have shown up and been given the shot, AP reports. Though Africa was not hit as hard as experts feared during the first year of the pandemic, some countries are in the middle of sharp increases in infections, including Kenya which has seen a 53% average weekly increase over the past month. The capital, Nairobi, and four neighbouring counties are currently under a strict lockdown and curfew. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he is ""very worried"" about the impact of long Covid and has said it is one example of how important it is to ""tackle this pandemic for good"". His comments follow an Office of National Statistics (ONS) survey suggested 1.1 million people were affected by lingering symptoms in the UK in the four weeks from 6 February. Speaking during a visit to Public Health England Colindale, Mr Hancock said: ""I am very worried about the impact of long Covid"". He said it was ""one of the reasons we need to tackle this pandemic for good"" and explained how the government was ""putting more research money into tackling and understanding long Covid"". Mr Hancock went on to say Covid-19 is a ""very strange, very dangerous virus"" and said when it comes to self-isolation, ""the vast majority of people do the right thing"".
""If you suspect you have covid then it is vital you self-isolate to protect other people"". Read more about the ONS datahere. Premier League football matches have been played in empty stadiums during the Covid-19 pandemic. And for the first time there have been more away wins than home wins. BBC football expert Pat Nevin examines the reasons why Premier League teams have struggled at home since matches went behind closed doors. This video can not be played Why empty grounds have destroyed home advantage Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Weâve been looking carefully
at two parts of the infection survey data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) â because they were showing
rises last week that could warn about the risks of easing lockdown. But neither have continued to rise. In Scotland, where the
youngest children returned to school at the end of February, there had been
hints of rising numbers in recent weeks. And in England, we saw
increasing numbers of infections in secondary school pupils in the weeks after
they returned to school. But those rises have stalled - in fact, in Scotland, they've even reversed slightly - suggesting that the opening up so far is
not leading to rapidly rising infections. There is a wrinkle in
England, though. Public Health England (PHE) surveillance data show higher numbers of cases among secondary school age pupils than they have for
months. Some of these rises are due
to more testing â particularly the new rapid tests that all secondary pupils
are supposed to take a couple of times every week. Statisticians prefer the ONS infection survey because it doesnât get blown about by changes in who comes
forward to get tested â it picks a group of people at random and tests them. So, while the experts will be keeping a close eye on the
PHE surveillence data to see how this weekâs trend plays out, the ONS infection survey gives the
clearest picture of trends in infection levels. The new Moderna vaccine could arrive in Scotland as early as next week, Scotland's chief medical officer has said. Dr Gregor Smith told the Scottish government's daily Covid briefing the jab was similar to the Pfizer vaccine. It needs to be kept at low temperatures and will only be available at the very large vaccination centres in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. The National Clinical Director Professor Jason Leitch said the numbers coming to Scotland will be low at first - but described Moderna as a help and as an additional arm of the vaccine programme. It comes as Scotland recorded 400 new Covid cases - but with a very low test positivity rate of 1.8 per cent. Read more hereabout the development. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics More now on new data released by the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said there is evidence of a decline in infections in the South East and South West of England, of an increase in the East of England, but that the trends are uncertain for the rest of England. The ONS said rates fell in those aged 50-69 in the week to 27 March, but the trends are uncertain in other age groups. It means increases seen in older school age pupils in the first weeks after reopening in England do not look to have continued throughout March. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest that about 180,000  people in the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 March. That is 0.28% of the population or 1-in-360 people, slightly lower than 1-in-330 people in the previous week. The ONS said infections have âdecreasedâ in England and Scotland, are âuncertainâ in Wales and are possibly increasing in Northern Ireland . England:1-in-370 are estimated to be testing positive for coronavirusVs 1-in-340 last week Wales:1-in-570Vs 1-in-450 last week Northern Ireland:1-in-220Vs 1-in-320 last week Scotland:1-in-320Vs 1-in-240 last week Israel is already vaccinating all citizens and residents aged 16 and above Israel hopes to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19
vaccine to children aged between 12 and 15 from May,after the initial results of US trials suggested it was safe and effective. The country has already offered vaccinations to all citizens
and residents aged 16 and above, and it has administered two doses to more than half of its 9.3 million population. The governmentâs coronavirus czar, Nachman Ash, said jabs would be offered to the lower age group once the US Food and Drug
Administration and the Israeli health ministry had given their approval. The daily numbers of new infections and seriously-ill
patients in Israel have fallen as a result of its world-leading vaccination programme. Experts say children's risk of becoming ill or dying with
Covid-19 is tiny, but health ministry director general Hezi Levy told Army
Radio: ""We are seeing a rise in the number of children who are hospitalised,
and we are seeing children without symptoms but who suffer from complications.â âThe risk from the vaccine is much lower,â he added. Pfizer and BioNTech said the trials of their vaccine in
2,260 adolescents in the US ""demonstrated 100% efficacy and robust
antibody responses"". They also suggested there were no unusual side-effects. England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty has been speaking to a Royal Society of Medicine webinar about the coronavirus. In a wide-ranging discussion, Whitty has said those without Covid antibodies may still be protected from severe disease - and the slow easing of England's restrictions reflects how difficult the pandemic has been. He said: ""I certainly don't think you should assume that if you have lower or no antibodies that means there is no protection. ""It probably does mean you're more likely to get infected and it may mean you're more likely to be infectious, but doesn't necessarily mean you won't have protection from going into hospital, or having severe disease or mortality."" And he said caution around reopening was needed ""because we've got such a difficult situation to go through at the moment"". ""What we don't want to be is in a situation where we look back in six months and say 'If we'd only just been a bit more cautious for a month or two,"" he added. Whitty also predicted there could be a ""very wide portfolio of vaccines"" in around two years and that technology can ""turn around a vaccine to a new variant incredibly fast, compared to how historically we've been able to do it"". We've been reporting new research which suggests as many as half of all UK adults do not know the main symptoms of Covid-19. So how can you be sure whether you have coronavirus, a cold or the flu? They are all caused by different viruses, but can have similar symptoms. BBC online health editor Michelle Robertshas looked into this here.

"Fewer than one in five people request a Covid-19 test if they have symptoms, while the number who follow full self-isolation rules is low, a large study of the test-and-trace system has found. The report, published in theBritish Medical Journal,external, also found only half of people knew the main Covid symptoms. These include a cough, high temperature and loss of taste or smell. Experts said the findings suggested the impact of the Â£37bn NHS Test and Trace system was ""limited"". The Department for Health and Social Care said test-and-trace had saved ""countless lives"", adding that the latest ONS data found the ""overwhelming majority"" self-isolated when asked to. The findings are based on 74,697 responses to online surveys from 53,880 people aged 16 or older living in the UK. In total, 37 survey waves were carried out from 2 March last year to 27 January this year, with about 2,000 participants in each wave. 'No clear impact' from Â£37bn NHS Test and Trace How do I get a coronavirus test? Test-and-trace 'finds half contacts in some areas' Experts involved in the study, including from Public Health England's behavioural science team, found that just 18% of those with coronavirus symptoms said they had requested a test, while 43% with symptoms in the previous seven days adhered to full self-isolation. Men, younger people and those with young children were less likely to self-isolate, as were those from more working-class backgrounds, people experiencing greater financial hardship, and those working in key sectors. Common reasons for not fully self-isolating included needing to go to the shops or work, for a medical need other than Covid-19, to care for a vulnerable person, to exercise or meet others, or because symptoms were only mild or got better. Test-and-trace, or contact tracing, is a system for identifying people who have been in close contact with someone who has caught Covid. Those people are then asked to self-isolate for 10 days - even if they have no symptoms - to prevent the chance of passing the virus on, if they do have it. Each UK nation has its own contact tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external Read more - how does test-and-trace work? The report's authors, who also included experts from King's College London, said: ""With such low rates for symptom recognition, testing, and full self-isolation, the effectiveness of the current form of the UK's test, trace, and isolate system is limited."" However, the team did acknowledge that while adherence to test, trace and isolate rules had been low, ""some improvement has occurred over time"". Across all waves, 43% of people adhered to rules around self-isolation, though this improved in January to 52%. According to the latest Office for National Statistics data, 90% of people told they must self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace after being in contact with a positive Covid case did so. The authors said greater practical and financial support was likely to improve adherence to the rules, adding that targeted messaging and policies for men, younger age groups and key workers might also be necessary. Last month, the Commons Public Accounts Committee said theimpact of NHS Test and Trace was still unclear, despite the government setting aside Â£37bn for it over two years. MPs said the spending was ""unimaginable"" and warned the taxpayer could not be treated like an ""ATM machine"". And in December, the National Audit Office alsocriticised the scheme,external, saying it had not yet achieved its objectives. Paulette Hamilton, vice chairwoman of the Local Government Association's community wellbeing board, said the findings of the latest study were ""concerning"". She said: ""Although the rollout of the vaccine is providing us with hope of a return to our normal way of life, the responsibility on us all to get ourselves tested when necessary and share our contacts on request will be needed for some time to come, in order to keep case rates as low as possible. ""It is also critical that everyone does the right thing and self-isolates when required. Key to this is making sure people understand what self-isolation means, feel able to comply and are supported to do so if necessary."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? Meanwhile, the head of the NHS has urged anyone who is eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine to book one immediately - and for people to turn up for second doses when called. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: ""We're well on track to meet our 15 April goal of offering NHS Covid vaccination to everyone aged 50 and over, as well as other high risk groups. ""In just the past two weeks, we've now jabbed nearly 85% of people aged 50-54, and over three million of the highest risk people have also now had their top-up second dose."" The call comes as Wednesday'sdaily coronavirus figures,externalshowed continued falls in deaths, hospital admissions and infections. There were 43 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, 268 patients admitted into hospital and 4,052 new cases recorded, with the seven-day averages down by 39.9%, 22.6% and 11.5% respectively. A Department for Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Since last May, NHS Test and Trace has contacted 3.2 million people who tested positive, and another 6.4 million of their contacts. ""Behind these numbers are countless lives saved and the latest ONS figures show that when people are asked to self-isolate, the overwhelming majority do so. ""It is vital that people continue to do their bit by isolating when they are asked to.

"Fewer than one in five people request a Covid-19 test if they have symptoms, while the number who follow full self-isolation rules is low, a large study of the test-and-trace system has found. The report, published in theBritish Medical Journal,external, also found only half of people knew the main Covid symptoms. These include a cough, high temperature and loss of taste or smell. Experts said the findings suggested the impact of the Â£37bn NHS Test and Trace system was ""limited"". The Department for Health and Social Care said test-and-trace had saved ""countless lives"", adding that the latest ONS data found the ""overwhelming majority"" self-isolated when asked to. The findings are based on 74,697 responses to online surveys from 53,880 people aged 16 or older living in the UK. In total, 37 survey waves were carried out from 2 March last year to 27 January this year, with about 2,000 participants in each wave. 'No clear impact' from Â£37bn NHS Test and Trace How do I get a coronavirus test? Test-and-trace 'finds half contacts in some areas' Experts involved in the study, including from Public Health England's behavioural science team, found that just 18% of those with coronavirus symptoms said they had requested a test, while 43% with symptoms in the previous seven days adhered to full self-isolation. Men, younger people and those with young children were less likely to self-isolate, as were those from more working-class backgrounds, people experiencing greater financial hardship, and those working in key sectors. Common reasons for not fully self-isolating included needing to go to the shops or work, for a medical need other than Covid-19, to care for a vulnerable person, to exercise or meet others, or because symptoms were only mild or got better. Test-and-trace, or contact tracing, is a system for identifying people who have been in close contact with someone who has caught Covid. Those people are then asked to self-isolate for 10 days - even if they have no symptoms - to prevent the chance of passing the virus on, if they do have it.

"Nicola Sturgeon believes a simple majority is the way the SNP will make progress on Scottish independence The leader of the SNP has insisted her party was ""not divided"". Speaking onBBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme, Nicola Sturgeon said her aim at May's Holyrood election was winning a ""simple majority"". She rejected Alex Salmond's idea of creating a ""super majority"" by encouraging voters to back his newly-formed Alba Party on the regional list. The former first minister said he wanted to work with an SNP government to advance the cause of independence. He told theBBC's Today programmethat that cause was ""much, much bigger than personalities"". Scottish election 2021: Who should I vote for? The Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon story Ms Sturgeon denied that the SNP was suffering from internal issues and said support had ""never been higher"". She explained: ""I know I lead a party that has a growing membership just now and has a commanding position in the opinion polls. ""The breakdown of opinion polls that tests the views and attitudes of SNP voters show the SNP is actually the most united of all the parties in Scotland."" SCOTLAND'S ELECTION: THE BASICS What elections are happening?On 6 May, people across Scotland will vote to elect 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs). The party that wins the most seats will form the Scottish government.Find out more here. What powers does the Scottish Parliament have?MSPs pass laws on most aspects of day-to-day life in Scotland, such as health, education and transport. They also have control over some taxes and welfare benefits. Defence, foreign policy and immigration are decided by the UK Parliament. How do I vote?Â Anyone who lives in Scotland and is registered to vote is eligible, so long as they are aged 16 or over on the day of the election. You canÂregister to vote online,external. Ms Sturgeon went to say that she was concentrating on winning a ""simple majority"" and if people wanted an SNP government, and her as first minister, then voting for the nationalists was the only way to bring that about. She said: ""You only have to cast your mind back to the days when Alex Salmond was leader of the SNP and he didn't say what he is saying now. ""What he said then, and he was right then, is that the only way to make sure you get the government you want is to vote for the party that will be that government. ""Anything else is trying to gamble with the system, game the system, take a chance on the outcome of the election. ""If you want to see an SNP government elected that then has the ability to deliver an independence referendum, you don't get that by voting for somebody else."" Nicola Sturgeon insists that there is no split within the independence movement. But it is inescapable that at the same moment she was being interviewed on Radio Scotland, her predecessor Alex Salmond was speaking on Radio 4 as the leader of a rival party. The two were once aninseparable double act atop the SNP, which took Scotland to the brink of independence. But he has now formed his own breakaway group, populated with defectors from the SNP including two sitting MPs. The fact that many of these defectors have left the SNP over various policy differences means there is sure to be friction between their manifesto pledges too. So, Mr Salmond's very presence in the race raises questions for Ms Sturgeon - even over her core objective of independence, which her party can no longer own as home turf. She now has to spend precious time talking about his vision, instead of her own. Both leaders may insist that their campaigns will be positive and do not pose a threat to the cause they share, but in many ways Holyrood is no longer big enough for the both of them. Ms Sturgeon told listeners that two things were required to win independence - a majority in the Scottish Parliament to bring about a referendum and, ""crucially"", winning majority support among the Scottish population. She said: ""Anybody who tries to suggest there's a shortcut to that, or that we can somehow game or trick our way to independence, frankly, is misleading people. It's got to be through a process that is not just legitimate but seen to be legitimate so that it can command respect and authority at home and internationally as well."" On SNP politicians leaving the party to stand at the Holyrood election for the Alba Party she said she was ""not sure it is as many as Mr Salmond might have been hoping for"". She added: ""I also don't think this is a friendly gesture on Mr Salmond's part towards the SNP."" Mr Salmond said he wanted to work with an SNP government to advance the cause of independence Last week,former SNP leader Mr Salmond announced the creation of a new pro-independence party. He said the Alba Party would not field candidates in any of the 73 constituency seats - but the party will field four candidates in each of the eight regional lists. Speaking on Today, Mr Salmond said that securing a ""super majority"" of pro-independence parties at Holyrood would ""strengthen immeasurably Scotland's hand in negotiating with a Tory PM"". He added: ""From 2007 to 2011 I was first minister and I was negotiated first with Gordon Brown. ""No Tory PM will want to be to trying to face down an entire parliament and an entire people."" WHO KILLED EMMA?Journalist Sam Poling investigates the unsolved murder of a young woman in an eight-part podcast for BBC Sounds PODLITICAL:Updates from the campaign Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said Ms Sturgeon's comments were ""the clearest sign yet that the SNP will put another referendum before Scotland's recovery."" He added: ""The Institute for Fiscal Studies demonstrated this week that higher levels of public spending in Scotland is possible because we're part of the United Kingdom. ""The UK furlough scheme is still protecting Scottish jobs and people are still getting Covid jags in their arms - but Nicola Sturgeon thinks risking all of that is what's best for Scotland?"" The Scottish Liberal Democrats said Ms Sturgeon had ""once again made it very clear that her only priority this election is another independence referendum"". The party's campaign chairman, Alistair Carmichael, said: ""This is not what Scotland needs. ""Scotland needs a needle-sharp focus on green and secure jobs, a plan to help education bounce back and supporting the NHS and mental health."" Scottish Labour has said the focus of the next parliament should be on recovering from the pandemic and rebuilding the country's economy and health service rather than arguing about the constitution. But the Scottish Greens believe a referendum is needed within the next five years because ""decisions about Scotland should be made by the Scottish people.""

"The Atlantic bluefin tuna is one of the fastest fish in the world and can reach speeds of more than 40mph The return of giant bluefin tuna to waters off the Welsh coast presents a ""massive opportunity"" for science and tourism, fishing groups have said. The fish disappeared from UK waters during the 1960s due to commercial overfishing and a changing climate. But they are returning, including off the coast of Pembrokeshire, and fishing groups want to catch, tag and release a limited number. The Welsh government said it was part of UK-level discussions on the issue. Fishing groups have warned Wales risks ""missing the boat"" if action is not taken quickly, but the Wildlife Trusts have urged caution. ""Some of the biggest tuna in the world"" are living 10 miles off the Welsh coast, says actor and keen angler Julian Lewis Jones Famed for their size and speed in the water, the Atlantic bluefin tuna, also known as the giant bluefin tuna, have been spotted in large numbers over the past decade between the months of July and December. They can grow to an average 6.5 feet (1.98m) long and can weigh up to 550lbs (249kg). Julian Lewis Jones, known for his acting roles in films such as Invictus and Justice League, and patron of the Welsh Federation of Sea Anglers, said there was the potential for a ""world class"" recreational catch and release tuna fishery in Wales. ""Being a mad keen fisherman myself I know what lengths people will go to see their dream fish,"" Mr Jones said. ""And these are huge - some of the biggest tuna in the world - just 10 miles off the Welsh coast."" Mr Jones said a tuna fishery would attract anglers from around the world, adding: ""It's a massive opportunity - we've had a terrible year with Covid and tourism has really suffered in our coastal communities."" Fishing groups want to work alongside scientists to catch, tag and release a small number of fish The first step, Mr Jones explained, would be to set up a catch and release tagging programme, known as a Chart, where anglers working as part of a scientific study would be able to catch, tag and release a small number of fish. But he warned Wales was lagging behind the rest of the UK, with hopes of an announcement in England ""within weeks"" and Scotland having already earmarked funding. Ireland has been running a Chart scheme for more than two years. The UK government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has been leading a public consultation on the issue and could decide to allocate a share of the small quota the UK has for bluefin tuna to the UK nations. Warming seas linked to bluefin tuna surge in UK waters Could big-game fishing return to the UK? Anglers launch campaign to catch bluefin tuna But it would be down to the Welsh government after May's Senedd election to decide what to do next. If Wales is to secure a Chart programme for this year's tuna season, it would have to happen soon so skippers can receive the necessary training and bring a university on board to manage the scientific study. ""If we aren't up to speed we will lose our chance,"" Mr Jones continued. ""If we're not in a position to be able to have those skippers ready in time for the season then it isn't going to happen for Wales, and that would be a travesty."" Andrew Alsop accidentally caught a giant bluefin tuna off the Pembrokeshire coast in 2017, and put it back in the sea Andrew Alsop, who runs White Water Charters from Neyland marina in Pembrokeshire,accidentally reeled in a ""monster"" tuna- weighing about 500lb (226kg) and 7ft 7in (2.3m) in length - while fishing in 2017. He said he first started to spot shoals of the fish back in 2012, describing it as an ""amazing sight that you'd usually have to go abroad to Africa or America to see"". Since then he has been involved in theUK Thunnus Programme,external, which was tasked with understanding more about the recovery in tuna numbers here. A tuna fishery off the Welsh coast would benefit the economy and aid scientific research, says Andrew Alsop He said it would be a ""kick in the teeth"" if further research programmes were to take off across the UK but not in Wales. ""It needs to be done properly and anglers do need to know what they're doing - you can't just go out there like in the Jaws film,"" he said. ""We'd be working with scientists, monitoring these fish and the universities would benefit as they'd get a massive study."" He also pointed out that the tuna season runs into autumn and winter - the time of year when the west Wales economy could do with a tourism boost. ""My boat already brings in guys from Norway and America as it is. But tuna is king - people travel all over the world for it."" Joan Edwards, of the Wildlife Trusts, says bluefin tuna should not be caught Joan Edwards, policy director for the Wildlife Trusts, said it was right for governments to proceed with caution. ""I do have my concerns - in the last 50 to 60 years we've lost 80% of the bluefin tuna in the Atlantic and we're now just starting to see them reappear in our waters,"" she said. ""I'm sure it's very exciting to land such a fish but [we should consider] the trauma that fish is going to go through. ""I just feel that we've got some recovery happening in our marine environment and that's something to celebrate - I don't think we should be catching them."" Plaid Cymru said it had already written to Welsh Labour ministers urging them to ""engage with the process fully"" and ""make sure we don't get left behind"". The Welsh Conservatives said while they were ""broadly in favour of tagging for research, these decisions should always be led by the data and interested parties should be consulted on potential options"". The Welsh Liberal Democrats said fishing was ""vital to the Welsh economy and the next Welsh government must do everything in its power to ensure the industry is able to stay afloat"", adding Wales was in danger of being ""left behind"". A spokesman for the Labour-run Welsh Government said it ""was engaged with Phase 2 of the Defra-led UK Bluefin Tuna Catch and Release Tagging (Chart) project"".

Thank you for joining us and we will be back on Friday morning. Mickey the pony is helping book club members ride out lockdown We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's news: Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Swedes have
been told they canât be guaranteed more than one Covid-19 vaccine dose before 15 August, with ministers formally abandoning a previous promise that all
adults would be fully vaccinated during the first half of 2021. Itâs a major disappointment for
many Swedes, who had, for months, been told they should get two jabs before Midsummer in June, the biggest public holiday in Swedenâs calendar, when locals dance
around maypoles and dine on large buffets of herring and meatballs. At a news conference on
Thursday, Health Minister Lena Hallengren
said a shortage of vaccine supplies from producers was to blame for the delay. But Swedenâs vaccine co-ordinator
Richard Bergstrom told Swedish public service television network SVT that he
still viewed the overall situation as âa fantastic success storyâ, despite the
country missing its target. So far around 1.1 million
people (14.3% of those eligible for a vaccination) have had at least one
dose of the vaccine, in a country of 10 million. This is the wonderful moment 98-year-old Yoshia Uomoto was surprised by her son and niece in Seattle, Washington. It was her first in-person visit from family in a year. Mrs Uomoto lives at Nikkei Manor, a nursing home primarily for Japanese-American seniors. All the residents at the home have now been full vaccinated, allowing family, who have also had their jabs, to come inside to visit. Mark Uomoto, 68, told America's TODAY show that before this moment, they had been talking to his mother through the window, which was difficult as she has trouble hearing. ""It was so wonderful to hear, see her expression of excitement that she had because we've not seen Mom, my cousin and I, for over a year,"" he told the programme. ""So it was wonderful to see her and it was more heart warming for me to see her reaction and so happy to see us."" UK festivals are starting to reveal their line-ups as the nation slowly and cautiously comes out of lockdown - but there has been dismay, with the noticeable lack of women entertainers. One event in the spotlight wasKendal Calling,externalin Cumbria, whose first swathe of acts was predominantly male. Organisers said the initial line-up only reflected about 20% of the full programme, but Emma Zillmann, the festival's booker, admits the criticism was ""completely valid"" and women's names should be higher on the bill. Before the pandemic, the issue of achieving gender-balanced festivals was high on the industry's agenda through various schemes,such as Keychange,external, which aims for a 50/50 split across all line-ups. Last year,a new free-to-use database of female artists was published, providing details of more than 4,500 musicians in all genres of music. And Glastonbury'sEmily Eavis has previously saidher festival needs to achieve a gender balanced line-up as soon as it can. ""It's about supporting women and gender minority artists from the bottom up. Remember that we're trying to undo years and years and years of discrimination, and it's just going to take longer to do than maybe it should."" Read morehere.

The NHS has launched aYour Covid Recovery,externalwebsite to offer support and advice to people affected. Russia has announced it has registered what it says is the world's first coronavirus vaccine specifically for animals. While scientists say there is currently no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the disease to people, infections have been confirmed in various species worldwide. These include dogs, cats, apes and even mink. To address these infections, scientists are developing Covid-19 vaccines that are specially designed for animals. Here's what we know so far. A total of 31,147,444 people have received their first coronavirus vaccination,government daily figures show.,external And 4,513,458 have received their second dose. There have been a further 51 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK, the government'sdaily statistics show.,external That brings the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test to 126,764. There were also 4,479 new infections detected. Russia's Covid-19 vaccine,Sputnik V, has been authorised for emergency use in Kenya, the Health Ministry has said. It had earlier cautioned against the distribution of the vaccine, saying it was yet to meet ""all the necessary regulatory approvals for use"" in Kenya. Kenya received 1.02 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine under theCovax scheme, but uptake of it has been low, at only 5% according to local media. Kenya's vaccine rollout has been problematic, with hesitancy from healthcare workers, while some centres have run out of jabs or people who do not currently qualify to get the vaccine have shown up and been given the shot, AP reports. Though Africa was not hit as hard as experts feared during the first year of the pandemic, some countries are in the middle of sharp increases in infections, including Kenya which has seen a 53% average weekly increase over the past month. The capital, Nairobi, and four neighbouring counties are currently under a strict lockdown and curfew. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he is ""very worried"" about the impact of long Covid and has said it is one example of how important it is to ""tackle this pandemic for good"". His comments follow an Office of National Statistics (ONS) survey suggested 1.1 million people were affected by lingering symptoms in the UK in the four weeks from 6 February. Speaking during a visit to Public Health England Colindale, Mr Hancock said: ""I am very worried about the impact of long Covid"". He said it was ""one of the reasons we need to tackle this pandemic for good"" and explained how the government was ""putting more research money into tackling and understanding long Covid"". Mr Hancock went on to say Covid-19 is a ""very strange, very dangerous virus"" and said when it comes to self-isolation, ""the vast majority of people do the right thing"".
""If you suspect you have covid then it is vital you self-isolate to protect other people"". Read more about the ONS datahere. Premier League football matches have been played in empty stadiums during the Covid-19 pandemic. And for the first time there have been more away wins than home wins. BBC football expert Pat Nevin examines the reasons why Premier League teams have struggled at home since matches went behind closed doors. This video can not be played Why empty grounds have destroyed home advantage Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Weâve been looking carefully
at two parts of the infection survey data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) â because they were showing
rises last week that could warn about the risks of easing lockdown. But neither have continued to rise. In Scotland, where the
youngest children returned to school at the end of February, there had been
hints of rising numbers in recent weeks. And in England, we saw
increasing numbers of infections in secondary school pupils in the weeks after
they returned to school. But those rises have stalled - in fact, in Scotland, they've even reversed slightly - suggesting that the opening up so far is
not leading to rapidly rising infections. There is a wrinkle in
England, though. Public Health England (PHE) surveillance data show higher numbers of cases among secondary school age pupils than they have for
months. Some of these rises are due
to more testing â particularly the new rapid tests that all secondary pupils
are supposed to take a couple of times every week. Statisticians prefer the ONS infection survey because it doesnât get blown about by changes in who comes
forward to get tested â it picks a group of people at random and tests them. So, while the experts will be keeping a close eye on the
PHE surveillence data to see how this weekâs trend plays out, the ONS infection survey gives the
clearest picture of trends in infection levels. The new Moderna vaccine could arrive in Scotland as early as next week, Scotland's chief medical officer has said. Dr Gregor Smith told the Scottish government's daily Covid briefing the jab was similar to the Pfizer vaccine. It needs to be kept at low temperatures and will only be available at the very large vaccination centres in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. The National Clinical Director Professor Jason Leitch said the numbers coming to Scotland will be low at first - but described Moderna as a help and as an additional arm of the vaccine programme. It comes as Scotland recorded 400 new Covid cases - but with a very low test positivity rate of 1.8 per cent. Read more hereabout the development. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics More now on new data released by the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said there is evidence of a decline in infections in the South East and South West of England, of an increase in the East of England, but that the trends are uncertain for the rest of England. The ONS said rates fell in those aged 50-69 in the week to 27 March, but the trends are uncertain in other age groups. It means increases seen in older school age pupils in the first weeks after reopening in England do not look to have continued throughout March. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest that about 180,000  people in the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 March. That is 0.28% of the population or 1-in-360 people, slightly lower than 1-in-330 people in the previous week. The ONS said infections have âdecreasedâ in England and Scotland, are âuncertainâ in Wales and are possibly increasing in Northern Ireland . England:1-in-370 are estimated to be testing positive for coronavirusVs 1-in-340 last week Wales:1-in-570Vs 1-in-450 last week Northern Ireland:1-in-220Vs 1-in-320 last week Scotland:1-in-320Vs 1-in-240 last week Israel is already vaccinating all citizens and residents aged 16 and above Israel hopes to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19
vaccine to children aged between 12 and 15 from May,after the initial results of US trials suggested it was safe and effective. The country has already offered vaccinations to all citizens
and residents aged 16 and above, and it has administered two doses to more than half of its 9.3 million population. The governmentâs coronavirus czar, Nachman Ash, said jabs would be offered to the lower age group once the US Food and Drug
Administration and the Israeli health ministry had given their approval. The daily numbers of new infections and seriously-ill
patients in Israel have fallen as a result of its world-leading vaccination programme. Experts say children's risk of becoming ill or dying with
Covid-19 is tiny, but health ministry director general Hezi Levy told Army
Radio: ""We are seeing a rise in the number of children who are hospitalised,
and we are seeing children without symptoms but who suffer from complications.â âThe risk from the vaccine is much lower,â he added. Pfizer and BioNTech said the trials of their vaccine in
2,260 adolescents in the US ""demonstrated 100% efficacy and robust
antibody responses"". They also suggested there were no unusual side-effects. England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty has been speaking to a Royal Society of Medicine webinar about the coronavirus. In a wide-ranging discussion, Whitty has said those without Covid antibodies may still be protected from severe disease - and the slow easing of England's restrictions reflects how difficult the pandemic has been. He said: ""I certainly don't think you should assume that if you have lower or no antibodies that means there is no protection. ""It probably does mean you're more likely to get infected and it may mean you're more likely to be infectious, but doesn't necessarily mean you won't have protection from going into hospital, or having severe disease or mortality."" And he said caution around reopening was needed ""because we've got such a difficult situation to go through at the moment"". ""What we don't want to be is in a situation where we look back in six months and say 'If we'd only just been a bit more cautious for a month or two,"" he added. Whitty also predicted there could be a ""very wide portfolio of vaccines"" in around two years and that technology can ""turn around a vaccine to a new variant incredibly fast, compared to how historically we've been able to do it"". We've been reporting new research which suggests as many as half of all UK adults do not know the main symptoms of Covid-19. So how can you be sure whether you have coronavirus, a cold or the flu? They are all caused by different viruses, but can have similar symptoms. BBC online health editor Michelle Robertshas looked into this here.

"The usually low-profile Denise Coates was appointed CBE for services to the community and business in 2012 The boss of the gambling firm Bet365 has been awarded one of the biggest pay packets in UK corporate history. The highest paid director of Bet365 Group - believed to be founder and majority shareholder Denise Coates CBE - earned a salary of Â£421m in the year ending 29 March. She also earned Â£48m in dividends, taking her total pay to Â£469m. The company said the arrangements were ""appropriate and fair"", despite sales falling at the firm last year. But campaign group the High Pay Centre said it was ""appallingly inefficient for single individuals to hoard wealth in this way"". Ms Coates, who founded the Bet365 website 20 years ago in Stoke-on-Trent, has been the UK's highest paid boss for several years. How Bet365's Denise Coates hit her own jackpot She is also one of Britain's wealthiest women and a major philanthropist, donating millions through the Denise Coates Foundation. Her salary in the year to March was more than 50% higher than the Â£277m received in 2019 and meant she earned almost Â£1.2m every day last year. That was more than the bosses of every FTSE 100 company combined, according to the High Pay Centre. It came as sales at Bet365 fell 8% to Â£2.8bn as international sporting events were cancelled due to the pandemic. Profits slumped 74% to Â£194.7m. However, the company said it had not cut staff pay or laid off employees as a result of the crisis. It also did not make use of the furlough scheme. The company also paid Â£85m to Ms Coates's charitable foundation. Ms Coates and her brother John took over the gambling business 20 years ago, which was run by their father. Ms Coates now owns about half of the company. She has previously been described as one of the UK's ""most successful women"". Ms Coates achieved a first-class degree in econometrics and later trained as an accountant within the family firm, building further on the knowledge of the then small chain that she picked up while working part-time during high school. The chief executive's annual pay packet is likely to be the biggest in UK history. Earlier this month, hedge fund tycoon Sir Chris Hohn staked a claim to that title after paying himself Â£343m last year.

"This video can not be played Sanjeev Gupta: ""UK steel plants will not close on my watch"" Liberty Steel owner Sanjeev Gupta has claimed that none of its plants will shut ""under my watch"" as he races to refinance his business after the collapse of financial backer Greensill. He said taking on the UK plants had been a ""tough journey"" and a ""labour of love"", but he would not walk away. Mr Gupta was rebuffed by the UK government after asking for Â£170m. Some investors have alsobegun legal actionto have parts of his metals group wound up. But Mr Gupta said he and GFG Alliance, Liberty Steel's parent company, were ""not waiting for anybody"" and were ""doing what we can to help our businesses"". ""Our overall global operations are profitable, we have refinancing offers, we will refinance, and we will support our UK business also,"" Mr Gupta told the BBC. ""None of my steel plants under my watch will be shut down,"" he said. Liberty Steel has about 3,000 workers at sites including Rotherham, Motherwell and Newport. A further 2,000 work for GFG Alliance in other UK metals and engineering businesses. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""very hopeful"" that the plants could be saved and that Britain needed a strong steel industry.. He said that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was in ""daily contact"" with GFG. ""I think British steel is a very important national asset. I think the fact that we make steel in this country is of strategic long-term importance,"" he said. ""We have learned during the pandemic that it is not a good idea to be excessively reliant in times of trouble on imports of critical things,"" he added. ""It would be crazy if we were not to use this post-Brexit moment not to use the flexibility we have to buy British steel. So that's want we want to do."" The GMB union said Mr Gupta's comments were ""very welcome"" but making guarantees without showing financial backing ""just raises further questions"". ""To be able to give these guarantees with such confidence you have to assume he's found the financing required to keep the company going,"" said Ross Murdoch, GMB national officer. ""If that's the case he needs to let people know and stop workers worrying about their jobs."" Time is ticking for Sanjeev Gupta's business empire. The collapse of his main source of finance, Greensill Capital, leaves him dangerously exposed and in a race to find new sources of cash. GFG Alliance, the group of companies he runs, owes Greensill about $5bn, according to GFG's own evidence to court when Greensill was put into administration in February. GFG also told the court that Greensill's collapse would put it at risk of insolvency. Since then, it has been something of a phoney war, with little sign of the Greensill debacle causing greater damage. Now, however, winding-up petitions have been lodged against some of Mr Gupta's UK companies. The investors that gave money to Greensill want their money back and Mr Gupta's business empire is firmly in their sights. On the Today programme on Thursday, Mr Gupta said his companies were ready to defend their position in court and they were confident their loan deal with Greensill was a long-term arrangement that could not suddenly be terminated. He must now hold off the winding-off threats for long enough - or defeat them - while he finds sources of finance to replace Greensill. This might mean the sale of assets, or new borrowing, although the process is complicated by much of the Gupta business empire already being pledged as collateral against the loans advanced by Greensill. It will be a complicated and time-consuming business - and Mr Gupta may not be given much time. Mr Gupta said steel prices were at a 13-year peak, while aluminium prices were also high. He said GFG had been streamlining the business and had a ""huge amount of interest from new financiers who are willing to back us"" and refinance the group. He said it would take time to sort things out, but a short-term solution was an initiative called ""Project Athena"" which required each plant to make daily reports on how they were conserving cash. On Wednesday, Citigroup, acting on behalf of the investment bank Credit Suisse, began legal action in London's insolvency court to recoup unpaid debts from Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance. Mr Gupta said it was ""natural to some degree that lenders want to protect their own position"", but that GFG's position was that it had agreed debts with Greensill for three years and they were not due. He said GFG was having ""positive discussions"" with Grant Thornton, the administrators for Greensill. ""It makes no sense for them, or any of the creditors, to destroy jobs, but more importantly to destroy value, because that is the value which will give them their recovery,"" Mr Gupta said. Mr Gupta said former Prime Minister David Cameron had not lobbied on GFG's behalf Mr Gupta's business model centred on buying up failing or mothballed steel and aluminium plants around the world and starting production again, with the help of his main backer Greensill. In 2015, production restarted at the Liberty Steel plant in Newport, and in 2016 Liberty reopened and the Dalzell steel mill in Scotland. In 2017, Liberty acquired Tata's speciality steels business and expanded into Australia. In the following year it expanded into the US. Mr Gupta said: ""The UK has been a tough journey. It's because the UK steel industry has been decimated for decades. So that journey definitely has been a labour of love."" ""But I'm committed to my UK steel plants. I started them, I believe in them, they have a great future. We've saved thousands of jobs here. We've shown that economically those businesses can work,"" he said. Mr Gupta added that former Prime Minister David Cameron, who acted as an advisor for Greensill, had not made representations on behalf of GFG Alliance. ""I've not spoken to him, I think, since he was Prime Minister,"" Mr Gupta said. Mr Cameron wascleared by a watchdog last weekwhich looked at whether he had followed lobbying rules.

"People gathered at the Castlefield Bowl in Manchester Hundreds of people who ignored Covid rules to attend an illegal rave in a city centre have been condemned as ""selfish and dangerous"". People were seen singing and dancing along to a DJ set at the Castlefield Bowl outdoor arena in Manchester on Wednesday evening. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said officers were trying to find out who organised the gathering. Councillor Pat Karney said the people were ""letting Manchester down"". ""If you play live music at any of these gatherings your equipment will be seized,"" said the Labour councillor, who is an associate member of the Manchester City Council executive. Castlefield Bowl is used for outdoor concerts or gatherings such as a live screenings of football matches. On Tuesday, Heath Secretary Matt Hancock tweeted to say ""don't blow it"" asthousands gathered to enjoy the weather in outdoor spaces,prompting social distancing concerns. Police officers broke up the illegal gathering GMP said officers spent all of Wednesday patrolling the Castlefield Bowl area and ""were continually monitoring and engaging with groups of individuals to engage, explain and encourage compliance with the Covid rules and regulations"". The force said music equipment was set up as numbers increased in the evening. ""As officers attempted to engage with a group at the scene they were met with hostility causing them to withdraw,"" a spokesman said. GMP said the gathering was ""swiftly dispersed"" when reinforcements arrived. Outdoor meet-ups and sports resume in England 'Groundhog Day' after late-night park party Over 100 people gather and light fires in dunes No fixed penalty notices were issued ""but inquiries are ongoing to locate the organiser"", the force added. Assistant Chief Constable Chris Sykes condemned the ""disgusting and appalling"" behaviour. ""I accept it has been hard but rules are rules,"" he said. The gathering has been described as ""selfish and dangerous"" A big clean up started on Thursday morning Insp Jonathan Shilvock said the gathering was a ""clear breach"" of coronavirus rules and regulations. ""We appreciate that people will want to socialise due to the warm weather and the recent relaxation of the rules, but I want to remind people that this pandemic is not over and we all share a collective responsibility in complying with the rules and keeping infection rates down,"" he said. Councillor Rabnawaz Akbar, executive member for neighbourhoods, said the easing of lockdown restrictions did not allow for public spaces to be left in ""disgraceful state"" by ""selfishness pure and simple"". By Thursday morning, volunteers and council contractors had removed 58 bags of waste. Mr Akbar urged people to ""be considerate and to either put rubbish in the bin, or take it home with you"". ""It was encouraging to see so many people come out to help clear up, it is frustrating they had to do this in the first place,"" he said. Gary Rumens said seeing the area used for the rave was upsetting Gary Rumens, from Castlefield Litter Pickers which helped with the clean up, said residents were ""disappointed and angry"". ""We're got a tight-knit community and to see such an open space like this being used like this is upsetting,"" he said. Lynne Cade, who lives nearby on a boat, said she was ""extremely tired"" and ""very tearful"" after the illegal rave and was planning to move out of the area.

Thank you for joining us and we will be back on Friday morning. Mickey the pony is helping book club members ride out lockdown We are going to be bringing our coronavirus updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the day's news: Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Swedes have
been told they canât be guaranteed more than one Covid-19 vaccine dose before 15 August, with ministers formally abandoning a previous promise that all
adults would be fully vaccinated during the first half of 2021. Itâs a major disappointment for
many Swedes, who had, for months, been told they should get two jabs before Midsummer in June, the biggest public holiday in Swedenâs calendar, when locals dance
around maypoles and dine on large buffets of herring and meatballs. At a news conference on
Thursday, Health Minister Lena Hallengren
said a shortage of vaccine supplies from producers was to blame for the delay. But Swedenâs vaccine co-ordinator
Richard Bergstrom told Swedish public service television network SVT that he
still viewed the overall situation as âa fantastic success storyâ, despite the
country missing its target. So far around 1.1 million
people (14.3% of those eligible for a vaccination) have had at least one
dose of the vaccine, in a country of 10 million. This is the wonderful moment 98-year-old Yoshia Uomoto was surprised by her son and niece in Seattle, Washington. It was her first in-person visit from family in a year. Mrs Uomoto lives at Nikkei Manor, a nursing home primarily for Japanese-American seniors. All the residents at the home have now been full vaccinated, allowing family, who have also had their jabs, to come inside to visit. Mark Uomoto, 68, told America's TODAY show that before this moment, they had been talking to his mother through the window, which was difficult as she has trouble hearing. ""It was so wonderful to hear, see her expression of excitement that she had because we've not seen Mom, my cousin and I, for over a year,"" he told the programme. ""So it was wonderful to see her and it was more heart warming for me to see her reaction and so happy to see us."" UK festivals are starting to reveal their line-ups as the nation slowly and cautiously comes out of lockdown - but there has been dismay, with the noticeable lack of women entertainers. One event in the spotlight wasKendal Calling,externalin Cumbria, whose first swathe of acts was predominantly male. Organisers said the initial line-up only reflected about 20% of the full programme, but Emma Zillmann, the festival's booker, admits the criticism was ""completely valid"" and women's names should be higher on the bill. Before the pandemic, the issue of achieving gender-balanced festivals was high on the industry's agenda through various schemes,such as Keychange,external, which aims for a 50/50 split across all line-ups. Last year,a new free-to-use database of female artists was published, providing details of more than 4,500 musicians in all genres of music. And Glastonbury'sEmily Eavis has previously saidher festival needs to achieve a gender balanced line-up as soon as it can. ""It's about supporting women and gender minority artists from the bottom up. Remember that we're trying to undo years and years and years of discrimination, and it's just going to take longer to do than maybe it should."" Read morehere.

Kenya's vaccine rollout has been problematic, with hesitancy from healthcare workers, while some centres have run out of jabs or people who do not currently qualify to get the vaccine have shown up and been given the shot, AP reports. Though Africa was not hit as hard as experts feared during the first year of the pandemic, some countries are in the middle of sharp increases in infections, including Kenya which has seen a 53% average weekly increase over the past month. The capital, Nairobi, and four neighbouring counties are currently under a strict lockdown and curfew. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said he is ""very worried"" about the impact of long Covid and has said it is one example of how important it is to ""tackle this pandemic for good"". His comments follow an Office of National Statistics (ONS) survey suggested 1.1 million people were affected by lingering symptoms in the UK in the four weeks from 6 February. Speaking during a visit to Public Health England Colindale, Mr Hancock said: ""I am very worried about the impact of long Covid"". He said it was ""one of the reasons we need to tackle this pandemic for good"" and explained how the government was ""putting more research money into tackling and understanding long Covid"". Mr Hancock went on to say Covid-19 is a ""very strange, very dangerous virus"" and said when it comes to self-isolation, ""the vast majority of people do the right thing"".
""If you suspect you have covid then it is vital you self-isolate to protect other people"". Read more about the ONS datahere. Premier League football matches have been played in empty stadiums during the Covid-19 pandemic. And for the first time there have been more away wins than home wins. BBC football expert Pat Nevin examines the reasons why Premier League teams have struggled at home since matches went behind closed doors. This video can not be played Why empty grounds have destroyed home advantage Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Weâve been looking carefully
at two parts of the infection survey data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) â because they were showing
rises last week that could warn about the risks of easing lockdown. But neither have continued to rise. In Scotland, where the
youngest children returned to school at the end of February, there had been
hints of rising numbers in recent weeks. And in England, we saw
increasing numbers of infections in secondary school pupils in the weeks after
they returned to school. But those rises have stalled - in fact, in Scotland, they've even reversed slightly - suggesting that the opening up so far is
not leading to rapidly rising infections. There is a wrinkle in
England, though. Public Health England (PHE) surveillance data show higher numbers of cases among secondary school age pupils than they have for
months. Some of these rises are due
to more testing â particularly the new rapid tests that all secondary pupils
are supposed to take a couple of times every week. Statisticians prefer the ONS infection survey because it doesnât get blown about by changes in who comes
forward to get tested â it picks a group of people at random and tests them. So, while the experts will be keeping a close eye on the
PHE surveillence data to see how this weekâs trend plays out, the ONS infection survey gives the
clearest picture of trends in infection levels. The new Moderna vaccine could arrive in Scotland as early as next week, Scotland's chief medical officer has said. Dr Gregor Smith told the Scottish government's daily Covid briefing the jab was similar to the Pfizer vaccine. It needs to be kept at low temperatures and will only be available at the very large vaccination centres in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen. The National Clinical Director Professor Jason Leitch said the numbers coming to Scotland will be low at first - but described Moderna as a help and as an additional arm of the vaccine programme. It comes as Scotland recorded 400 new Covid cases - but with a very low test positivity rate of 1.8 per cent. Read more hereabout the development. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics More now on new data released by the Office for National Statistics. The ONS said there is evidence of a decline in infections in the South East and South West of England, of an increase in the East of England, but that the trends are uncertain for the rest of England. The ONS said rates fell in those aged 50-69 in the week to 27 March, but the trends are uncertain in other age groups. It means increases seen in older school age pupils in the first weeks after reopening in England do not look to have continued throughout March. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggest that about 180,000  people in the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus in the week to 27 March. That is 0.28% of the population or 1-in-360 people, slightly lower than 1-in-330 people in the previous week. The ONS said infections have âdecreasedâ in England and Scotland, are âuncertainâ in Wales and are possibly increasing in Northern Ireland . England:1-in-370 are estimated to be testing positive for coronavirusVs 1-in-340 last week Wales:1-in-570Vs 1-in-450 last week Northern Ireland:1-in-220Vs 1-in-320 last week Scotland:1-in-320Vs 1-in-240 last week Israel is already vaccinating all citizens and residents aged 16 and above Israel hopes to administer the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19
vaccine to children aged between 12 and 15 from May,after the initial results of US trials suggested it was safe and effective. The country has already offered vaccinations to all citizens
and residents aged 16 and above, and it has administered two doses to more than half of its 9.3 million population. The governmentâs coronavirus czar, Nachman Ash, said jabs would be offered to the lower age group once the US Food and Drug
Administration and the Israeli health ministry had given their approval. The daily numbers of new infections and seriously-ill
patients in Israel have fallen as a result of its world-leading vaccination programme. Experts say children's risk of becoming ill or dying with
Covid-19 is tiny, but health ministry director general Hezi Levy told Army
Radio: ""We are seeing a rise in the number of children who are hospitalised,
and we are seeing children without symptoms but who suffer from complications.â âThe risk from the vaccine is much lower,â he added. Pfizer and BioNTech said the trials of their vaccine in
2,260 adolescents in the US ""demonstrated 100% efficacy and robust
antibody responses"". They also suggested there were no unusual side-effects. England's chief medical officer Professor Chris Whitty has been speaking to a Royal Society of Medicine webinar about the coronavirus. In a wide-ranging discussion, Whitty has said those without Covid antibodies may still be protected from severe disease - and the slow easing of England's restrictions reflects how difficult the pandemic has been. He said: ""I certainly don't think you should assume that if you have lower or no antibodies that means there is no protection. ""It probably does mean you're more likely to get infected and it may mean you're more likely to be infectious, but doesn't necessarily mean you won't have protection from going into hospital, or having severe disease or mortality."" And he said caution around reopening was needed ""because we've got such a difficult situation to go through at the moment"". ""What we don't want to be is in a situation where we look back in six months and say 'If we'd only just been a bit more cautious for a month or two,"" he added. Whitty also predicted there could be a ""very wide portfolio of vaccines"" in around two years and that technology can ""turn around a vaccine to a new variant incredibly fast, compared to how historically we've been able to do it"". We've been reporting new research which suggests as many as half of all UK adults do not know the main symptoms of Covid-19. So how can you be sure whether you have coronavirus, a cold or the flu? They are all caused by different viruses, but can have similar symptoms. BBC online health editor Michelle Robertshas looked into this here.

"This video can not be played Tiger Woods suffered serious injuries in the crash The details of what caused Tiger Woods' car crash will only be released if the 15-time major winner gives permission for police to share their findings. A cause has been determined and the investigation is concluded, said Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva. Woods, 45, needed surgery after suffering a fractured leg and shattered ankle inthe crash on 23 February. ""We have the contents of the black box, everything completed, signed, sealed and delivered,"" said Villanueva. ""But we cannot release it without the permission of the people involved in the collision."" Woods returned to his Florida home from hospital earlier this month, saying he would work on ""getting stronger every day"". The American former world number one, who was recovering from back surgery at the time of his accident, was found unconscious and with his face and chin covered in blood at the scene. Los Angeles police said there was no evidence Woods had been impaired by drugs or alcohol at the time of the crash. Following the crash, Villanueva said Woods survived ""what would otherwise have been a fatal crash"" because the interior of his vehicle had remained largely intact. When confirming on Wednesday that the investigation had been concluded, he added: ""We have reached out to Tiger Woods and his personnel and there are some privacy issues on releasing information on the investigation. ""We are going to ask them if they can waive the privacy, and then we will be able to do a full release on all the information regarding the accident.""

"Samuel Kasumu has worked for the government since 2019 Boris Johnson's senior adviser on ethnic minorities is to stand down, amid a row over a government-commissioned report on race. Samuel Kasumu is known to have been unhappy with the government's stance on racial issues. He has not commented on the report, which said the UK ""no longer"" had a system rigged against minorities. The PM said the report was ""original and stimulating"" but he did not agree with ""absolutely everything"" in it. Equality campaigners have criticised it for downplaying the extent of racism in British society and institutions. PM's minority adviser: Tories 'steeped in division' Campaigners criticise government race report Key points: What does the race report say? Former equality and human rights commissioner Lord Simon Woolley said there was a ""crisis at No 10 when it comes to acknowledging and dealing with persistent race inequality"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: The government ""won't agree with every word"" in report Labour's shadow equalities secretary Marsha de Cordova called the report ""divisive,"" adding it was ""no wonder"" the government was ""losing the expertise from their team"". ""To have your most senior advisor on ethnic minorities quit as you publish a so-called landmark report on race in the UK is telling of how far removed the Tories are from the everyday lived experiences of Black, Asian and ethnic minority people,"" she added. A Downing Street spokesman insisted Mr Kasumu had been planning ""for several months"" to leave government in May. ""Any suggestion that this decision has been made this week or that this is linked to the [commission's] report is completely inaccurate,"" he added. Samuel Kasumu may not be a name you're familiar with; even one minister awkwardly said they'd never heard of him this morning. But his resignation is a difficult moment for the government on the sensitive, divisive topic of race. Downing street has denied any suggestion his departure is linked to Wednesday's report. Without Samuel Kasumu's version of events, it's hard to know why and when he chose to resign - having changed his mind about quitting earlier in the year. But his departure leaves questions about the confidence some in government, let alone the public, have about the prime minister's approach to tackling racial inequality. Last year Boris Johnson said he wanted to ""change the narrative"" on this subject  - but this is unlikely to be what he had in mind. Mr Johnson said he had ""worked closely"" with Mr Kasumu - who will leave his role next month - and he had ""done some great stuff and I thank him very much"". The adviser had previously handed in a resignation letter in February, accusing the Conservatives of a ""politics steeped in division"". He had asked to keep working on a project to combat disinformation on Covid vaccines, with ""the view to leaving at the end of May"". But Mr Kasumu went on to retract this letter, following talks with vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi. Mr Kasumu has declined to comment, but sources told the BBC there has been an ""awkward silence"" hanging over Downing Street, with little discussion or movement since he first threatened to resign. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities (CRED) was launched last summer in the wake of anti-racism Black Lives Matter protests last summer. In its reportpublished on Wednesday,external, it concluded the UK was not yet a ""post-racial country,"" but family structure and social class had a bigger impact than race on people's life chances. It argued that racial discrimination has often been misapplied to ""account for every observed disparity"" between ethnic groups. And it said references to racism in the UK being ""institutional"" or ""structural"" had sometimes been used without sufficient evidence. Dr Maggie Aderin-Pocock, a member of the commission, said the report was not denying institutional racism existed, but said they had not discovered evidence of it in the areas they had looked. The commission made 24 recommendations, including urging more research into school performance and for organisations to ditch unconscious bias training. The report was commissioned in the aftermath of Black Lives Matter protests in the UK Speaking on Thursday, Mr Johnson said the commission had suggested several ""interesting ideas"" and the government would respond in ""due course"". ""I don't say the government is going to agree with absolutely everything in it, but it has some original and stimulating work in it that I think people need to read and to consider,"" Mr Johnson added. ""There are very serious issues that our society faces to do with racism that we need to address. ""We've got to do more to fix it, we need to understand the severity of the problem, and we're going to be looking at all the ideas that they have put forward"". The commission's chairman Tony Sewell, an education consultant and ex-charity boss, has meanwhile defended himself from criticism over comments he made in the report about how the British Empire should be taught in schools. In his foreword to the report, he wrote: ""There is a new story about the Caribbean experience which speaks to the slave period not only being about profit and suffering but how culturally African people transformed themselves into a re-modelled African/Britain"". Halima Begum, chief executive of race equality think tank the Runnymede Trust, said his comments were ""out of kilter with where British society is"" - and Labour's Ms de Cordova accused him of ""putting a positive spin on slavery"". But in a statement on Thursday, Dr Sewell said it was ""absurd to suggest that the commission is trying to downplay the evil of the slave trade"". ""The report merely says that, in the face of the inhumanity of slavery, African people preserved their humanity and culture,"" he added.

"Officials have identified the gunman in a shooting inside an office building in southern California that left four people dead, including a nine-year-old boy. The child died while being embraced by another victim, police said. The Wednesday attack in Orange, 30 miles south of Los Angeles, ended when officers shot and wounded the suspect. Police said he had ""a business and personal relationship"" with his victims, but did not confirm a motive. The suspect, Aminadab Gaxiola Gonzalez, 44, is in hospital and there is no current threat to the public, they said. According to police, a fifth victim is also in hospital. None of the victims will be identified until next of kin have been informed. Police were called to the scene by multiple reports of shots fired inside the courtyard of the two-storey building on Lincoln Avenue. At a news conference Thursday, officials said they had to use bolt cutters to enter the premises because the doors were locked. Orange Police spokeswoman Lt Jennifer Amat described the city as ""very safe"" and ""usually quiet"". Wednesday's shooting is the deadliest in Orange since 1997, Ms Amat said. California governor Gavin Newsom called the shooting ""horrifying and heart-breaking"". ""Our hearts are with the families impacted by this terrible tragedy tonight,"" he said on Twitter. The attack is the third mass shooting in the US in just over two weeks. Eight people were killed inside spas in Atlanta, Georgia, on 16 March.

"This video can not be played Sanjeev Gupta: ""UK steel plants will not close on my watch"" Liberty Steel owner Sanjeev Gupta has claimed that none of its plants will shut ""under my watch"" as he races to refinance his business after the collapse of financial backer Greensill. He said taking on the UK plants had been a ""tough journey"" and a ""labour of love"", but he would not walk away. Mr Gupta was rebuffed by the UK government after asking for Â£170m. Some investors have alsobegun legal actionto have parts of his metals group wound up. But Mr Gupta said he and GFG Alliance, Liberty Steel's parent company, were ""not waiting for anybody"" and were ""doing what we can to help our businesses"". ""Our overall global operations are profitable, we have refinancing offers, we will refinance, and we will support our UK business also,"" Mr Gupta told the BBC. ""None of my steel plants under my watch will be shut down,"" he said. Liberty Steel has about 3,000 workers at sites including Rotherham, Motherwell and Newport. A further 2,000 work for GFG Alliance in other UK metals and engineering businesses. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""very hopeful"" that the plants could be saved and that Britain needed a strong steel industry.. He said that Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was in ""daily contact"" with GFG. ""I think British steel is a very important national asset. I think the fact that we make steel in this country is of strategic long-term importance,"" he said. ""We have learned during the pandemic that it is not a good idea to be excessively reliant in times of trouble on imports of critical things,"" he added. ""It would be crazy if we were not to use this post-Brexit moment not to use the flexibility we have to buy British steel. So that's want we want to do."" The GMB union said Mr Gupta's comments were ""very welcome"" but making guarantees without showing financial backing ""just raises further questions"". ""To be able to give these guarantees with such confidence you have to assume he's found the financing required to keep the company going,"" said Ross Murdoch, GMB national officer. ""If that's the case he needs to let people know and stop workers worrying about their jobs."" Time is ticking for Sanjeev Gupta's business empire. The collapse of his main source of finance, Greensill Capital, leaves him dangerously exposed and in a race to find new sources of cash. GFG Alliance, the group of companies he runs, owes Greensill about $5bn, according to GFG's own evidence to court when Greensill was put into administration in February. GFG also told the court that Greensill's collapse would put it at risk of insolvency. Since then, it has been something of a phoney war, with little sign of the Greensill debacle causing greater damage. Now, however, winding-up petitions have been lodged against some of Mr Gupta's UK companies. The investors that gave money to Greensill want their money back and Mr Gupta's business empire is firmly in their sights. On the Today programme on Thursday, Mr Gupta said his companies were ready to defend their position in court and they were confident their loan deal with Greensill was a long-term arrangement that could not suddenly be terminated. He must now hold off the winding-off threats for long enough - or defeat them - while he finds sources of finance to replace Greensill. This might mean the sale of assets, or new borrowing, although the process is complicated by much of the Gupta business empire already being pledged as collateral against the loans advanced by Greensill. It will be a complicated and time-consuming business - and Mr Gupta may not be given much time. Mr Gupta said steel prices were at a 13-year peak, while aluminium prices were also high. He said GFG had been streamlining the business and had a ""huge amount of interest from new financiers who are willing to back us"" and refinance the group. He said it would take time to sort things out, but a short-term solution was an initiative called ""Project Athena"" which required each plant to make daily reports on how they were conserving cash. On Wednesday, Citigroup, acting on behalf of the investment bank Credit Suisse, began legal action in London's insolvency court to recoup unpaid debts from Mr Gupta's GFG Alliance. Mr Gupta said it was ""natural to some degree that lenders want to protect their own position"", but that GFG's position was that it had agreed debts with Greensill for three years and they were not due. He said GFG was having ""positive discussions"" with Grant Thornton, the administrators for Greensill. ""It makes no sense for them, or any of the creditors, to destroy jobs, but more importantly to destroy value, because that is the value which will give them their recovery,"" Mr Gupta said. Mr Gupta said former Prime Minister David Cameron had not lobbied on GFG's behalf Mr Gupta's business model centred on buying up failing or mothballed steel and aluminium plants around the world and starting production again, with the help of his main backer Greensill. In 2015, production restarted at the Liberty Steel plant in Newport, and in 2016 Liberty reopened and the Dalzell steel mill in Scotland. In 2017, Liberty acquired Tata's speciality steels business and expanded into Australia. In the following year it expanded into the US. Mr Gupta said: ""The UK has been a tough journey. It's because the UK steel industry has been decimated for decades. So that journey definitely has been a labour of love."" ""But I'm committed to my UK steel plants. I started them, I believe in them, they have a great future. We've saved thousands of jobs here. We've shown that economically those businesses can work,"" he said. Mr Gupta added that former Prime Minister David Cameron, who acted as an advisor for Greensill, had not made representations on behalf of GFG Alliance. ""I've not spoken to him, I think, since he was Prime Minister,"" Mr Gupta said. Mr Cameron wascleared by a watchdog last weekwhich looked at whether he had followed lobbying rules.

"This video can not be played Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala is calling for voluntary licensing deals Pharmaceutical firms manufacturing the Covid-19 vaccine should make enough for everyone in the world or voluntarily hand their technology to developing countries, says the new WTO head. Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said it was ""not acceptable"" to leave poorer countries at the ""end of the queue"" for vaccines. She pointed to AstraZeneca's deal to transfer its know-how to a mass vaccine manufacturer in India. Such ""voluntary licensing... could save many more people,"" she said. ""There is some capacity in developing countries unused now. Let's have the same kind of arrangement that AstraZeneca has with the Serum Institute of India,"" she told the BBC's Economics Editor Faisal Islam. ""Novovax, J& J and all the others should follow suit,"" she said, referring to other vaccine manufacturers. The global plan to share Covid-19 vaccines fairly Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Dr Okonjo-Iweala, who became director general of the World Trade Organization earlier this month, acknowledged that members were split on the issue of relaxing WTO rules on intellectual property so that more drug manufacturers can make the jabs. The issue has been pushed by India, South Africa and dozens of poorer countries who want to freely replicate the vaccines. Wealthier countries have resisted such a move although the Biden administration in the US has signalled it is considering the plans. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa this week described the hoarding of vaccines and refusal to freely share vaccine-making blueprints as ""vaccine apartheid"". But Dr Okonjo-Iweala said the issue, known as the Trips waiver, is for the next pandemic and all efforts now must be focused on increasing manufacturing capacity. She said the world must avoid the decade-long wait many developing countries faced to get anti-HIV drugs. ""I'm very concerned,"" she said. ""The kind of inequities we see in vaccine access are really not acceptable, you can't have a situation in which, you know, 10 countries have administered 70% of vaccine doses in the world, and there are countries that don't have one single dose"". This video can not be played Long Covid: 'It's like someone has piled sandbags on top of me' Until the end of last year Dr Okonjo-Iweala, Nigeria's former finance minister, chaired the global vaccine alliance, Gavi, which aims to increase access to vaccines around the world. Many nations in the developed world, which began their own vaccinations months ago, have faced criticism for buying or ordering more vaccines than they need. The World Health Organization said in January that over 39 million vaccines had been given in 49 wealthier countries, while one poorer nation had just 25 doses. But many of the wealthier countries placed orders for doses with pharmaceutical companies before knowing whether the vaccine in development would be effective. They were hedging their bets - placing multiple orders in the hope that at least some of them would work out. The UK, which has ordered 400 million vaccine doses and will have many left over, has saidit will donate most of its surplus vaccine supply to poorer countries.

"US President Joe Biden has called for trillions in spending aimed at re-igniting America's economic growth by upgrading its crumbling infrastructure and tackling climate change. The $2.3tn (Â£1.7tn) proposal would direct billions to initiatives such as charging stations for electric vehicles and eliminating lead water pipes. The spending would be partially offset by raising taxes on businesses. Those plans have already roused fierce opposition. Republicans have called the rises ""a recipe for stagnation and decline"", while powerful business lobby groups including the Business Roundtable and Chamber of Commerce said they supported investments but would oppose tax increases. The pushback is a sign of the tough fight ahead for the plan, which needs approval from Congress. Joe Biden could have gone in a number of different policy directions after narrowly getting his covid pandemic aid package through Congress. That he opted to push for an infrastructure bill, rather than upping the pressure for gun control, voting rights, immigration, the environment or healthcare reform, suggests he's looking for a popular, non-controversial legislative second act. Of course, like that coronavirus package, the Biden administration is likely to use a massive piece of legislation to quietly advance some of those other policy priorities. The proposal contains hundreds of millions of dollars in green energy spending, expanded care for the elderly and disabled and job training, for instance. Also like the coronavirus aid bill, even non-controversial infrastructure provisions that have high public support will be swamped in partisan acrimony. In particular, Republicans are going to vehemently object to the tax increases for corporations and businesses contained in the proposed legislation. Chances are, Democrats will again have to go it alone when it comes to passing Biden's legislative agenda. The challenge, then, will be keeping the Democratic coalition together at a time when a wide number of constituencies, many of whom held their tongue during the Covid negotiations, line up to ensure their priorities are funded. The White House has promoted its proposal as the most ambitious public spending in decades, saying the investments are necessary to keep the US economy growing and competitive with other countries, especially China. ""This is not a plan that tinkers around the edges,"" Mr Biden said in a speech in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Wednesday. ""It's a once in a generation investment in America."" It calls for investing more than $600bn in infrastructure, including modernising roads, replacing rail cars and buses and repairing crumbling bridges. Billions more would be devoted to initiatives like improving veterans hospitals, upgrading affordable housing, expanding high-speed broadband, and providing incentives for manufacturing and technology research. It calls for money to be directed to rural communities and communities of colour, including establishing a national climate-focused laboratory affiliated with an historically black university. Civic Works runs programmes focused on job training for green careers in Baltimore, MD The spending, which would have to be approved by Congress, would roll out over eight years. The White House said tax increases would offset the cost over 15 years. Mr Biden called for raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, a move that would partially undo cuts the US passed in 2017. He also proposed raising the minimum rate charged for overseas profits. In his speech, in an acknowledgment such plans are likely to face, he said he was also ""open to other ideas"" when it came to paying for the spending. ""Failing to make these investments adds to our debt and effectively puts our children at a disadvantage relative to our competitors,"" he said. ""The divisions of the moment shouldn't stop us from doing the right thing for the future."" Mr Biden's proposal - which closely resembles promises he made during last year's election campaign - comes just weeks after Democrats muscled through $1.9tn more in aid to address the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic, approving that package without Republican support. It's not clear yet how much of Mr Biden's latest plan will make it through Congress - or how much of another spending package focused on areas such as childcare and education that he plans to unveil in coming weeks. Biden signs $1.9tn Covid relief bill into law Biden warns China will 'eat our lunch' on spending Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said the speedy advance of the pandemic package was unusual. ""Normally the negotiations drag on for months and what eventually gets passed, if anything gets passed at all, bears only a passing resemblance to what the administration originally asked for,"" he said. ""We suspect these negotiations will revert to the mean."" Eli Allen is director of the Center for Sustainable Careers at Civic Works, a non-profit organisation that offers programmes such as job training focused on careers in sustainable energy in Baltimore, Maryland, a majority black city near Washington, DC. He said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" that something resembling Mr Biden's ambitions would eventually pass and  was particularly heartened by Mr Biden's emphasis on creating ""quality jobs"" in terms of pay and benefits - which he said could help set a standard across the industry. ""The focus on racial equity is not something we've seen in some of the past federal programmes that we've worked with,"" he added. ""I think that focus â¦ is very important as we think about strategies to expand access to these jobs, especially for communities of colour."" Joe Biden delivered his speech in Pittsburgh, which has been working to reinvent its economy Stefani Pashman is chief executive of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, a regional economic development group in Pittsburgh, the former steel town in Pennsylvania where Mr Biden delivered his speech on Wednesday. The city, located in a state that was key to Mr Biden's election victory, has been working to reinvent itself as a centre for high-tech research in areas such as autonomous vehicles. Ms Pashman said the president's promise of billions of government dollars has also injected new energy into ambitious local plans, like an effort by Carnegie Mellon University and rail technology company Wabtec to establish a new research lab focused on innovations in freight rail, like autonomous trains. ""The idea is to transform the rail industry â¦ but we need $600m from the federal government to amplify what we're able to do at the local level,"" she said. ""The past few years â¦ I don't think the government was positioned to take this on at the level that it needs to be addressed and invested in to propel our region's economy and all the economies of the nation,"" she added. ""It's clear that they're prioritizing infrastructure in a new way.""

"Fewer than one in five people request a Covid-19 test if they have symptoms, while the number who follow full self-isolation rules is low, a large study of the test-and-trace system has found. The report, published in theBritish Medical Journal,external, also found only half of people knew the main Covid symptoms. These include a cough, high temperature and loss of taste or smell. Experts said the findings suggested the impact of the Â£37bn NHS Test and Trace system was ""limited"". The Department for Health and Social Care said test-and-trace had saved ""countless lives"", adding that the latest ONS data found the ""overwhelming majority"" self-isolated when asked to. The findings are based on 74,697 responses to online surveys from 53,880 people aged 16 or older living in the UK. In total, 37 survey waves were carried out from 2 March last year to 27 January this year, with about 2,000 participants in each wave. 'No clear impact' from Â£37bn NHS Test and Trace How do I get a coronavirus test? Test-and-trace 'finds half contacts in some areas' Experts involved in the study, including from Public Health England's behavioural science team, found that just 18% of those with coronavirus symptoms said they had requested a test, while 43% with symptoms in the previous seven days adhered to full self-isolation. Men, younger people and those with young children were less likely to self-isolate, as were those from more working-class backgrounds, people experiencing greater financial hardship, and those working in key sectors. Common reasons for not fully self-isolating included needing to go to the shops or work, for a medical need other than Covid-19, to care for a vulnerable person, to exercise or meet others, or because symptoms were only mild or got better. Test-and-trace, or contact tracing, is a system for identifying people who have been in close contact with someone who has caught Covid. Those people are then asked to self-isolate for 10 days - even if they have no symptoms - to prevent the chance of passing the virus on, if they do have it. Each UK nation has its own contact tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external Read more - how does test-and-trace work? The report's authors, who also included experts from King's College London, said: ""With such low rates for symptom recognition, testing, and full self-isolation, the effectiveness of the current form of the UK's test, trace, and isolate system is limited."" However, the team did acknowledge that while adherence to test, trace and isolate rules had been low, ""some improvement has occurred over time"". Across all waves, 43% of people adhered to rules around self-isolation, though this improved in January to 52%. According to the latest Office for National Statistics data, 90% of people told they must self-isolate by NHS Test and Trace after being in contact with a positive Covid case did so. The authors said greater practical and financial support was likely to improve adherence to the rules, adding that targeted messaging and policies for men, younger age groups and key workers might also be necessary. Last month, the Commons Public Accounts Committee said theimpact of NHS Test and Trace was still unclear, despite the government setting aside Â£37bn for it over two years. MPs said the spending was ""unimaginable"" and warned the taxpayer could not be treated like an ""ATM machine"". And in December, the National Audit Office alsocriticised the scheme,external, saying it had not yet achieved its objectives. Paulette Hamilton, vice chairwoman of the Local Government Association's community wellbeing board, said the findings of the latest study were ""concerning"". She said: ""Although the rollout of the vaccine is providing us with hope of a return to our normal way of life, the responsibility on us all to get ourselves tested when necessary and share our contacts on request will be needed for some time to come, in order to keep case rates as low as possible. ""It is also critical that everyone does the right thing and self-isolates when required.

LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? Meanwhile, the head of the NHS has urged anyone who is eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine to book one immediately - and for people to turn up for second doses when called. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: ""We're well on track to meet our 15 April goal of offering NHS Covid vaccination to everyone aged 50 and over, as well as other high risk groups. ""In just the past two weeks, we've now jabbed nearly 85% of people aged 50-54, and over three million of the highest risk people have also now had their top-up second dose.""

A Department for Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Since last May, NHS Test and Trace has contacted 3.2 million people who tested positive, and another 6.4 million of their contacts. ""Behind these numbers are countless lives saved and the latest ONS figures show that when people are asked to self-isolate, the overwhelming majority do so. ""It is vital that people continue to do their bit by isolating when they are asked to.
