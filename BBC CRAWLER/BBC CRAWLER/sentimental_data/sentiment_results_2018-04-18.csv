"This video can not be played Darryll Rowe told one of his victims 'I got you. Burn, you have it' A man who said he was ""riddled"" with HIV and convicted of trying to infect 10 men has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 12 years. Daryll Rowe, 27, infected five men he had unprotected sex with and sabotaged the condoms of another five in Brighton and Northumberland. He is the first man in the country to be found guilty of intentionally setting out to spread the virus. His crimes were branded a ""determined hateful campaign of sly violence"". After being diagnosed in April 2015, Rowe met men on the gay dating app Grindr and had sex with eight of them in Brighton between October that year and February 2016, before fleeing to the north east where he went on the run from police, targeting two more men. He sent mocking messages after sex with some of the men, including ""I have HIV LOL. Oops"" and ""I'm riddled"". Darryll Rowe was branded as a ""sociopath"" by one victim Sentencing Rowe at Brighton Crown Court, Judge Christine Henson QC said: ""The messages you sent make it crystal clear you knew exactly what you were doing. ""As well as the physical offences it is clear for the victims the psychological effects are immense. ""They describe living with a life sentence as a result of your cruel and senseless acts. Many of those men were young men in their 20s at the time they had the misfortune to meet you. ""I cannot see how and when you will no longer be a danger to gay men."" She added: ""I note that this sentence is not about stigmatising anyone living with HIV."" Rowe, from Brighton, was convicted of five counts of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) and five of attempted GBH. During his six-week trial, one man said he felt ""pressured"" into having sex with the hairdresser. Another victim branded Rowe as ""grotesque"" and a ""sociopath"". Ahead of sentencing, prosecutor Caroline Carberry QC read out statements from nine of his 10 victims, which she said showed the ""devastating consequences"" of his actions. Many told how they had considered suicide having suffered physical and psychological damage and needed to take daily medication. One said: ""Darryl has destroyed my life. I would rather he had murdered me than left me to live my life like this."" Another said he found condoms with the tops cut off in the bin, and that it had been ""a horrendous chapter"" in his life. A Tyneside man who was in a relationship with Rowe while he was on bail, but was not infected, told BBC Look North: ""If you have a dog, and that dog has rabies, and it bites someone, you'd put it down ""That is exactly how I think about him now. ""I think he doesn't deserve to be paid for by the taxpayer for the rest of his life."" Describing his behaviour as ""predatory"", Judge Henson said Rowe had ""emotionally unstable personality traits"" but there was insufficient evidence to diagnose a personality disorder. Det Insp Andy Wolstenholme, of Sussex Police, said the sentence was ""hugely important for Rowe's victims, and the communities that he deliberately targeted"". ""Daryll Rowe was consistent in lying to his victims about having HIV, he was persistent and aggressive in wanting unprotected sex in order to infect people, and when he didn't get what he wanted, he deliberately damaged condoms to achieve his aim,"" he said.

"Dan Johnson defended his work on the Sir Cliff Richard story The BBC journalist who broke the story about the police investigation into Sir Cliff Richard has told the singer's privacy case he acted in a ""professional and fair"" way. Asked if he wanted to make a ""personal apology"" to Sir Cliff, Dan Johnson told the High Court he was sorry the star ""went through such a difficult time"". Sir Cliff was not arrested or charged. The BBC says its report on South Yorkshire Police's sexual assault inquiry was of public interest. Lawyers for the corporation say its coverage was accurate and in good faith, and journalists had respected Sir Cliff's ""presumption of innocence"". Report 'led to conspiracy theories' Case 'likely to have huge impact' Sir Cliff felt violated by BBC - Hunniford Sir Cliff, 77, who is suing the BBC over the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules, was in court to hear Mr Johnson give evidence. He says he suffered ""profound and long-lasting damage"" after the BBC named him and broadcast footage of police searching his Berkshire flat in August 2014. Questioned by Sir Cliff's barrister Justin Rushbrooke QC, Mr Johnson acknowledged using the term ""celebrity paedo"" when referring to the case in an email to a colleague. But he said the description was a ""shorthand reference"" and did not reflect his ""overall approach"" to the story. ""In all my external dealings on the story and the way that I covered it, I have been professional and fair,"" Mr Johnson told the judge. ""What matters is what is said publicly and how you conduct yourself with other people externally."" Sir Cliff was in court to hear Dan Johnson give evidence The allegation Sir Cliff had sexually assaulted a boy under the age of 16 in Sheffield in 1985 was passed to South Yorkshire Police by the Metropolitan Police. Mr Johnson said there had been some ""regrettable"" false allegations made against some high-profile people, but he had only been reporting the facts of the story at the time the singer's home was being searched. The reporter told the court he was ""pleased to have broken such a big story"", but accepted it had left Sir Cliff ""upset and distressed"". ""I accept the distress he feels, I don't accept it was caused by me uniquely,"" he said. ""Obviously South Yorkshire Police were part of that and my colleagues at the BBC who were part of the story as well. ""I don't believe I was at fault... I am sure the investigation would have been distressing."" Mr Johnson said decisions about a helicopter being used to film the search - including footage of officers inside Sir Cliff's flat - were taken by senior BBC editorial staff. ""It wasn't for me to consider the bigger picture, the wider implications of what was being broadcast,"" he told the court. He added that ""the general idea of having the helicopter there... was useful to tell people what was going on."" Sir Cliff's barrister twice asked Mr Johnson if he was prepared to apologise to Sir Cliff in court, before the judge intervened, saying the line of questioning was ""not helpful"". In his witness statement, Mr Johnson said he came across the story after speaking to a ""contact"" in June 2014. They had talked about high-profile cases involving celebrities and the ""confidential source"" told him there was ""just one more major figure"" police were looking at. Mr Johnson said: ""I guessed this to be Sir Cliff Richard because of previous rumours I had heard about him. ""The contact confirmed I had guessed the right name."" Mr Johnson said Carrie Goodwin, South Yorkshire Police's then head of communications, had responded with an ""audible gasp"" when he asked whether Sir Cliff was on their ""radar"". The force says it felt forced to provide Mr Johnson with details of the search to prevent him running a story at that stage, but the reporter insisted he did not put police under any pressure. ""We had an important story of very broad public interest which we should not ignore,"" he said. ""However, I was keen to wait until the next stage in the investigation (i.e. the search) before the BBC ran the story."" Sir Cliff's solicitor Gideon Benaimearlier told the courtthe BBC coverage ""gave an air of authority to conspiracy theorists and online trolls to have a field day"". He said he believed the report caused ""online chatter"" about Sir Cliff and prompted people to make up ""spurious allegations"", prolonging the police investigation.

"The prosecution said Ortega's actions were premeditated A nanny has been found guilty of murdering two children she stabbed at their luxury New York City apartment. Yoselyn Ortega had pleaded insanity, but the jury rejected that defence as they unanimously convicted her. The bloody bodies of Lucia ""Lulu"" Krim, six, and her brother Leo, two, were found by their mother in a bathtub at the Manhattan flat on 25 October 2012. Marina Krim told the court how she saw Ortega, 55, stabbing herself in the neck in an apparent suicide attempt. She had come home with her third child, three-year-old Nessie, after Ortega did not turn up at Lulu's dance class. Ms Krim was found by police crying and screaming hysterically, clutching on to her surviving child. After two days of deliberations, the jury found Ortega guilty of four charges: two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder, which are punishable by a maximum sentence of life in prison. Marina Krim was with her surviving child Nessie (L) when she discovered the bodies of Leo and Lucia (R) Prosecutors said the nanny was disgruntled because she felt she was being overworked by the family at the Upper West Side apartment. Ortega was also struggling to pay tuition fees for her 17-year-old son, whom she had brought to the US from the Dominican Republic and enrolled in a private school. The nanny's defence team argued she suffered from ""chronic mental illness"" and was mentally incapable of being held responsible for her actions. Her lawyer said she had hallucinated an order from the devil ""to kill the children and herself"". 'Killer' NYC nanny 'fit for trial' Nanny suspected of double murder However, the prosecution said Ortega's actions were premeditated and the trial heard how she slit Leo's neck from behind so he would not fight back as his sister had done. ""We hope now that this verdict will give the Krim family an opportunity to heal, to find some closure and to move on in their lives,"" Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance told reporters following the verdict. Kevin Krim, the children's father, stood beside the prosecutor with tears in his eyes but declined to comment. He was returning from a business trip at the time of the 2012 killings.

"Many teachers blame the problem on youngsters not reading enough for pleasure Monosyllabic adolescents may be nothing new, but the latest research suggests a big chunk of them do not know enough words to do well at school. According to academics, four out of 10 pupils in their first year of secondary school have such a limited vocabulary that it is affecting their learning. Many teachers from the 800 secondaries involved in the Oxford University Press research say the problem is worsening. They blame the ""word gap"" on too little reading for pleasure. Studies suggest breadth of vocabulary is strongly influenced by the number of words a child comes into contact with on a daily basis. This includes conversations with parents, siblings and friends, as well as what they read. The report, focusing on schools in England, says the number of pupils with limited vocabulary remains ""stubbornly high"" across all age groups, despite a range of programmes addressing literacy. And 80% of the teachers surveyed said children with limited vocabulary would find it ""extremely challenging"" to understand test papers. A very high proportion of the teachers said the word gap held back progress in not just English (91%), but in history (90%), geography (86%) and religious studies (78%). Lionel Bolton, of the Oxford University Press, said: ""Whether a child is 11 years old and in Year 7, or 16 years old and in Year 11, if there are words in a task that they do not understand, they will struggle to complete the task. ""The 11-year-old is likely to be able to ask for help or access a dictionary; a 16 year old in their GCSE exam cannot. ""And if they do understand all the words in the task, if their vocabulary is lower than their age, their written response may be less articulate, less effective, and ultimately achieve a lower mark. ""This of course is not new - it has ever been thus. ""But with the changes that have been brought in by the new GCSE exams - increased rigour, removal of controlled assessment, and tiering in most subjects - the vocabulary challenges posed are even more pronounced."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders - and an English teacher for 32 years - said: ""In reality the word gap will depend on your circumstances rather than your choices - your home, your family, the richness of language and relations, the presence of books and conversations, the habits you form as you grow up. ""These are things largely beyond our control.""

"This video can not be played A clean getaway for Tess and its Falcon 9 rocket launch It's lift-off for a new era in planet-hunting. The US space agency's Tess satellite has launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on a mission to find thousands of new worlds beyond our Solar System. The mission will survey a great swathe of stars, hoping to catch the dips in brightness that occur when orbiting planets traverse their faces. Tess's goal is to compile a catalogue that other telescopes can then focus in on for more detailed analysis. ""Tess is equipped with four very sensitive cameras that will enable it to monitor nearly the entire sky,"" said George Ricker, the mission's principal investigator from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which leads the project. ""The types of planets that Tess will detect are revealed by a process called a transit. We can see the shadow, effectively, of the planet as it passes in front of its host star."" Nasa's latest space telescope went up on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at 18:51 local time (22:51 GMT; 23:51 BST). UK will lead European exoplanet mission UK satellite makes HD movies of Earth 'Big players' invest in UK space engine Artwork: Tess has four camera systems to scan the sky The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (Tess) was supposed to have departed on Monday, but the rocket company had wanted some extra time to investigate an issue connected with the launch vehicle's guidance system. Wednesday's 49-minute flight put the satellite on a highly elliptical path around the Earth. Mission planners have designed a novel orbit that will see the observatory corralled by the gravity of the Moon. This will lead to it using very little fuel to manage operations, enabling the mission to keep on working for a couple of decades, or for as long as Nasa finds value in its science. Tess follows in the footsteps of Kepler, a groundbreaking space telescope launched in 2009. It also used the transit technique to confirm more than 2,000 so-called exoplanets. But Kepler, for its primary mission at least, only looked at a very small patch of sky, and most of its discoveries were simply too far away or too dim to permit further study. This video can not be played Sara Seager: ""Tess will orbit in a giant ellipse that goes far away from Earth"" The Tess strategy will be different on a number of fronts. First and foremost, it is a wide-field survey. Its cameras will scan big strips of the sky over 27-day periods, taking in 85% of the heavens in two years. ""Over those first two years, which is the nominal mission for Tess, we're expecting to add thousands of planets; something like 2,000-3,000 planets that are certainly below the size of Jupiter, and most of them below the size of Neptune. So, the kind that have the potential for being the terrestrial-type worlds that we're most interested in,"" MIT co-worker Jennifer Burt told BBC News. All the discoveries will go into a catalogue that other observatories can then mine. ""Think of it as a phone book; you'll be able to look up the ones that interest you,"" said Tess deputy science director, Sara Seager, also of MIT. ""But it's not just quantity; it's quality as well - because the planets we do find will be bright enough and close enough to Earth that we really can do follow-up measurements with them."" A sudden dip in a star's brightness indicates the presence of a transiting planet Tess's mission is very timely. The next few years will see a new generation of super-telescopes come online that have the technologies to probe the atmospheres of nearby worlds. Scientists will be looking for gases that are potential ""biomarkers"" - the chemical signatures such as molecular oxygen, methane and water that could indicate the presence of lifeforms. Perhaps the key actor in this field will be the successor to Hubble - the James Webb space observatory, due in orbit from 2020. Its 6.5m-wide primary mirror and infrared instruments seem perfectly tuned for the job. But there will be others as well, especially in Europe where exoplanet science is very strong. The ground-based European Extremely Large Telescope, with its 39m-wide primary mirror, will certainly be targeting Tess discoveries when it becomes operational in the early 2020s. And then there is the recently selected European Space Agency telescope known as Ariel, which will launch in the late 2020s with the very specific ambition of studying exoplanet atmospheres. ""Tess will be extremely important for us,"" said Ariel's principal investigator Giovanna Tinetti from University College London, UK. ""In particular, it is expected that many super-Earths will be discovered around very bright stars by Tess, and it's clear these will be absolutely great targets for Ariel,"" she told BBC News.

"RaÃºl Castro (L) will remain in the background as Miguel DÃ­az-Canel (R) takes over Cuba's parliament has picked RaÃºl Castro's right-hand man, Miguel DÃ­az-Canel, as the sole candidate to succeed him, ending the family's long rule. Mr Castro took over as president from his ailing brother Fidel in 2006. An improvement in relations with the US which began under Barack Obama has been partially reversed since Donald Trump entered the White House. Mr Castro is expected to remain a powerful influence in the communist state even after he steps down. The National Assembly has voted on the nomination but the result will not be announced until Thursday, when he is expected to formally pass the presidency to Mr DÃ­az-Canel. However, he will stay on as head of the Communist Party until its next congress in 2021. The next Cuban leader will inherit a country in economic stagnation and with a young population impatient for change, BBC Cuba correspondent Will Grant reports. There is also the complex task of leading without the same revolutionary past embodied by RaÃºl andFidel, who died in retirement aged 90 in November 2016. Cuba after the Castros Did Fidel Castro's name kill his son? Watch: Cuba prepares for the end of the long-running Castro era He may have had a relatively low profile when he was first appointed vice-president of Cuba's Council of State in 2013 but he has since become Mr Castro's key ally. Mr DÃ­az-Canel is said to be more accessible than the Castro brothers For the past five years, he has been groomed for the presidency and the handover of power. But even before being named first vice-president, the 57-year-old had already had a long political career. He was born in April 1960, little over a year after Fidel Castro was first sworn in as prime minister. He studied electrical engineering and began his political career in his early 20s as a member of the Young Communist League in Santa Clara. While teaching engineering at the local university, he worked his way up the ranks of the Young Communist League, becoming its second secretary at the age of 33. RaÃºl Castro has praised his ""ideological firmness"". Analysis by Will Grant, BBC News, Havana In some respects, Miguel Diaz-Canel is a departure from the past. He is in his 50s and he wasn't even born until after the revolution took power. Yet, he still represents an extension of the Castro model - especially politically. The message of political continuity which the Cuban government has stressed from the moment the handover was announced has taken much of the wind out of the sense of renewal. At least two of RaÃºl Castro's inner circle, men in their late 80s, have remained on the Council of State. The biggest challenges, at least in the short term, are economic. He must tackle a complex dual currency system while trying to make sure inflation doesn't rise for ordinary Cubans. He must also try to stimulate a stagnant economy. Many are watching to see if he reverses the freeze on new private business licences to at least signal some support for the concept of private enterprise on the island. All of this, without the same popular backing of the Castros. He may have his work cut out. He is unlikely to make any major changes in the short term, especially while Mr Castro remains a political force to be reckoned with. Any changes are likely to be gradual and slow-paced. Yet Mr Castro did bring in reforms after he took over as president, most strikingly the thaw in relations with the US which had seemed unthinkable under his brother Fidel. ""Long live Fidel! Long live RaÃºl!"" Graffiti on a Havana street The new leader will have to consider how to overcome the problems caused by the economic collapse of Cuba's ally, Venezuela, and what kind of relationship the Caribbean island wants with the US under Mr Trump. Last year,the new American president reimposed certain travel and trade restrictionseased by the Obama administration but did not reverse key diplomatic and commercial ties. Four takeaways from Trump's Cuba policy But what most Cubans will judge the new leader on is whether their day-to-day lives improve. ""Right now, we don't know what the future holds,"" Adriana Valdivia, 45, a teacher in Havana, told Reuters news agency. ""Raul is finished and Fidel is history. I can't see a way out to help Cubans live better, salaries are the same and don't make ends meet, and now Trump is tightening the screws with the blockade, imagine that."" ""Politics is not my strong point,"" said Diadenis Sanabria, 34, who works in a state-owned restaurant in the Cuban capital. ""But I don't think a change of chief is going to change my life."" Often regarded as a rubber-stamp body, it is officially meeting to swear in its 605 members, who were elected last month. It also votes on the composition of the all-powerful Council of State, whose president serves as both head of state and government. Cuba has long maintained it has one of the most inclusive and fairest election systems in the world but critics say that assertion is laughable as the process is fully overseen by the ruling Communist Party. All 605 candidates stood unopposed in March. Did Fidel Castro's name kill his son? Cuba prepares for end to Castro era.

"Elon Musk wants staff to cut short unproductive phone calls and meetings as he aims to boost production of the Tesla Model 3 over the next few months. Work has temporarily halted at Tesla plants in California for upgrades aimed at increasing output from 2,000 to 6,000 cars per week by the end of June. A leaked email outlined other ways staff could help streamline operations. These include walking out of meetings, sidestepping the chain of command and ignoring company rules on occasion. Increasing production of the Model 3 is considered key to shifting Tesla from loss-making to profitability, but the firm has repeatedly missed previous production targets. In the leaked email,published by website Elektrek,external, chief executive Mr Musk calls for a crackdown on the performance of Tesla's contractors,  which he says in some cases has been ""worse than a drunken sloth"". And he says the firm will keep a sharper tally on expenditure in future. Mr Musk's other thoughts on improving productivity include avoiding large meetings - which he says are the ""blight of big companies"". ""It is not rude to leave, it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time,"" he wrote. Tesla's Model 3 is aimed at the mass market but the firm has been unable to fulfil a backlog of orders for the $35,000 electric car. Highly-automated plants have run into difficulties prompting Mr Musk to tweet last week that ""excessive automation"" had been a mistake and that ""humans are underrated"". Allow Twitter content?

The plan involves recruiting hundreds more staff to man an extra shift at Tesla's Fremont car plant so it can operate around the clock. Mr Musk's email also suggested there would be a crack down on expenditure. ""I have asked the Tesla finance team to comb through every expense worldwide, no matter how small,"" he wrote. ""All contracting companies should consider the coming week to be a final opportunity to demonstrate excellence. Any that fail to meet the Tesla standard of excellence will have their contracts ended on Monday."" He then added a list of productivity tips including advice to: Cancel large meetings or if you have to have them keep them ""very short"" Walk out of a meeting or end a phone call if it is failing to serve a useful purpose. Avoid acronyms or nonsense words. ""We don't want people to have to memorise a glossary just to function at Tesla"" Sidestep the ""chain of command"" to get the job done. Managers insisting on hierarchies will ""soon find themselves working elsewhere"" Ignore the rules if following them is obviously ridiculous. The firm has come under increasing pressure from investors in recent months, a situation exacerbated by the death of a driver in a Tesla car operating in its Autopilot mode last month. Mr Musk made light of the company's financial situation on 1 April, joking in a tweet that Tesla had gone bankrupt. ""Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it,""the tweet said,external. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Lord Patten was among two dozen Conservative peers to defy the party whip Peers have defeated the government on the issue of staying in a UK-EU customs union after Brexit. Lords voted by 348 to 225 in favour of a plan requiring ministers to report on steps to negotiate a continued union. Backing it, ex-EU Commissioner Lord Patten said the UK would be worse off unless current arrangements continued. But Brexit minister Lord Callanan said it required the government to report on the steps taken towards an objective it has ""clearly ruled out"". Number 10 argues that remaining in the customs union would prevent the UK from signing third-party trade agreements with countries across the world. Lord Callanan signalled the government's intention to overturn the measures at a later stage, saying before the vote it had no intention to ""reflect further"" on the matter. The defeat is the first of several expected as the House of Lords - in which the government does not have a majority - debates the government's flagship EU Withdrawal Bill in detail. The bill will end the supremacy of EU law in the UK while ensuring existing laws passed since the UK's entry in 1973 continue to apply. A total of 24 Conservatives voted against the government on the customs union amendment, including former ministers Lord Heseltine, Lord Lansley and Lord Willetts. Serving notice that he would be a serial rebel during the bill's passage, the former EU commissioner said: ""There are times in one's political career where what is alleged to be party loyalty comes way behind trying to stand up for the national interest."" Campaigners demand 'people's' Brexit vote Barnier: UK can change mind on single market Brexit bill fundamentally flawed, say peers Brexit: All you need to know However, former Conservative Chancellor Lord Lawson said Lord Patten was putting forward a ""political argument dressed up as a trade argument"" and it amounted to a ""wrecking amendment"". Remaining in a customs union while leaving the EU would leave the UK in a ""quasi-colonial"" status, he said. ""I can see there are political reason for remaining in the EU, but I think the political reasons for leaving are much stronger. But what it is absolute nonsense to suggest is that there is an economic case for what is being proposed."" The former chancellor said the financial arguments were ""economic nonsense"" Lord Forsyth went further, suggesting it was a plot by ""Remainers in this House, who are the majority, who refuse to accept the verdict of the British people - and I believe they are playing with fire"". ""I say to colleagues in this House, 'Have a care to what we are doing.' We are an unelected house, and this amendment [is] part of a campaign which is putting peers against the people."" Tory MP and Remain supporter Anna Soubry tweeted that the Lords had ""put their country first"", and called on her colleagues in the Commons to back them when the amendment returns.

But a statement from the Department for Exiting the EU said the fundamental purpose of the bill was to prepare the UK's statute book for exit day, not about the terms of departure. ""This amendment does not commit the UK to remaining in a customs union with the EU, it requires us to make a statement in Parliament explaining the steps we've taken,"" a spokesman said. ""Our policy on this subject is very clear. We are leaving the customs union and will establish a new and ambitious customs arrangement with the EU while forging new trade relationships with our partners around the world."" Analysis:By BBC political correspondent Ben Wright Peers turned out in force on Wednesday to wrestle with a question the government insists is settled - whether or not the UK should form a customs union with the EU after Brexit. It is one of the government's negotiating red lines that Britain must not remain in any sort of customs union. However, Labour believes the creation of a new union would keep goods flowing freely without tariffs and provide a workable solution to the Irish border issue. Many Tory peers strongly criticised Wednesday's amendment as an attempt by Remain supporters in the Lords to wreck the Bill and tie the hands of negotiators. But a number of Conservatives, combined with opposition parties, inflicted a heavy defeat on the government and the issue will now have to return to the House of Commons. What will be crucial then is how many Tory MPs align with Labour to try and force a change to the government's policy. The government also lost a vote against a second amendment aimed at ensuring that existing protections from EU law cannot be changed - except by primary legislation - which would require any changes to go through both the Commons and the Lords. Lord Callanan said the government had already taken steps to address concerns around employment, equality, and health and safety laws, ""potentially in ways that are even stronger than the amendment"". But Labour's Lady Hayter, who proposed the change, said there were ""parts of the government that appear a bit more deregulation obsessed"". After the debate, peers voted by 314 to 217 in favour of the amendment. Other potential flashpoints in the bill include amendments relating to Northern Ireland and a plan to scrap the government's decision to fix Brexit for 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019.

"The van caused ""significant damage"" when it hit the house in Yeolands Drive A 90-year-old woman was killed when a van crashed into a house near Bristol while she was inside. The white Ford Transit van caused ""substantial damage"" when it hit the property in Yeolands Drive, Clevedon, at 20:27 BST on Wednesday. Neighbours who were initially evacuated amid fears a gas pipe had been damaged have now returned to their homes. A 34-year-old woman and 33-year-old man remain in police custody on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Avon and Somerset Police said the woman's family had been informed. Emergency services were called to the scene in Clevedon Insp Frazer Davey said CCTV showed the van - which has the number plate WR65 LNC - had left the Crab Apple Inn in Southern Way ""moments before colliding with the house"". He said someone was seen outside the pub talking to the people inside the van at about 20:25 BST and urged that person to come forward ""as soon as possible"". Insp Davey added they also wanted to speak to anyone who may have seen the ""quite distinctive"" van which was ""white with a black bonnet and two white stripes"" with ladders on the roof. Homes were evacuated after fears a gas pipe had been damaged in the crash Neighbour Paul Tree said he had been sitting at home with his wife at about 20:30 when a ""whole convoy of emergency vehicles went racing past"". He said: ""I went down to have a look and saw a van had gone through the front of the house - literally - and they were bringing out someone - I wasn't too sure who it was. ""The road was cordoned off. Obviously people in the community are shocked."" One neighbour, who did not want to be named, said the van had crashed ""straight through"" the wall and into the woman's lounge. Police said the van was seen leaving the Crab Apple Inn ""moments before colliding with the house"" Neighbour Julie Elson told BBC Radio Bristol that the victim was a ""lovely lady"". ""It's just so sad. She always asked how you were, it's what neighbours are for really. It's just a shock to the community round here,"" she said. Avon Fire and Rescue Service said its specialist urban search and rescue team had to be called in because of the damage caused to the house. The crews, who are trained in shoring and propping techniques, stayed at the scene until 01:30 BST to make sure the building was structurally safe. A spokesman said: ""No-one was trapped within the vehicle but one person was in the house at the time of the incident and sadly she died."" The car hit the house in Yeolands Drive on Wednesday evening Avon and Somerset Police thanked residents who were asked to leave for their co-operation and support. ""A gas pipe was damaged in the collision and we had to make sure it was made safe before allowing people back in their homes,"" Insp Davey said.

"This video can not be played Prince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive at Commonwealth Youth Forum in London. Meghan Markle has been hailed ""a great champion and ambassador for women"" as she visited the Commonwealth Youth Forum alongside Prince Harry. The couple, who will marry in Windsor on 19 May, met about 40 young leaders as part of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London. Karuna Rana, from Mauritius, told Ms Markle she should start her own women's rights campaign. Harry said Ms Markle was ""hugely excited"" to join him in his duties. Ms Rana said she asked the former actress to start up an equivalent to the UN's HeForShe campaign, which aims to get men and boys involved in the fight to achieve gender equality. ""I said she was a great champion and ambassador for women and that she should start a SheForShe campaign,"" Ms Rana said. ""She said she'd think about it - right after May 20th."" Prince Harry has been appointed a Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by the Queen, but it is unusual for someone not yet married into the Royal Family to be included in a high-profile summit like CHOGM. Referring to the Commonwealth, Ms Markle told some of the youth delegates: ""You have this umbrella to hold you together. ""It's incredible. Stay in touch - maximise it."" Australian delegate Jacob Thomas, who works with the Commonwealth Equalities Network on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, spoke to Ms Markle about LGBT rights and said: ""It's not just about love and sexuality. It's also about being here, supporting and recognising us for the benefit of all."" Earlier this week, Prime Minister Theresa May spoke of her ""regret"" at Britain's role in creating laws criminalising same-sex relationships while a colonial power. Mx Thomas said the couple praised the work of the equalities network, adding: ""Harry recognised that five years ago, 10 years ago, this would not have happened."" Royal Wedding: Republicans ask to protest 'peacefully' Windrush generation: Theresa May apologises to Caribbean leaders The Youth Forum aims to encourage young people to debate challenges facing their generation, and agree youth-led initiatives to help solve those challenges. Ms Markle and the prince will also attend a Women's Empowerment reception on Thursday, hosted by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. The event involves charities and organisations that work to promote global gender equality through girls' education. Heads of the 53 Commonwealth nations are also attending events in both London and Windsor as part of the CHOGM summit, which is staged every two years to discuss the major challenges facing the Commonwealth's 2.4 billion citizens.

"The town is awash with class A drugs, say police Drugs have killed 12 people in one Cumbrian town since December, making the death rate far higher than that of many cities. Police say they are struggling to stem the tide of drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine in Barrow-in-Furness. They say staff cuts are hampering their ability to tackle gangs arriving from as far away as London to sell them. The county council blames government cuts for substantial reductions in drug and alcohol services. ""We will keep doing what we can within the resources that we've got,"" said Nick Coughlan, from Cumbria Police, ""but inevitably, if the pattern continues, more people will die."" The police say they are struggling to tackle a problem known as county lines, where criminals from large cities target smaller towns. In Barrow, the usual heroin and crack cocaine suppliers, gangs from Liverpool and Manchester, have been joined in recent months by London groups, happy to make the 600-mile round trip to exploit the town's longstanding drug market. Cumbria Police say budget cuts mean they have lost surveillance and intelligence officers, the mainstay of most drug teams. While they have secured prison sentences totalling almost 200 years for drugs offences in the past 18 months across south Cumbria, Detective Chief Inspector Coughlan is realistic about the impact. ""It would be fair to say that we disrupt individuals and very, very soon after, there's someone to fill that void in the drugs market,"" he said. Fay Johnson's son Mark died in January Fay Johnson says her son Mark first started taking drugs, mostly cannabis, in his late teens. Despite working as a cook in various hotels in the Lake District, he progressed onto harder, Class A substances, though his mother says she doesn't know the full details. As Fay's only child, she would see Mark several times a week, often pleading with him to stop using ""or it'll kill you"". The 35-year-old ignored his mother's warnings, and in January, her worst fears were realised when Mark was found dead in a flat he had recently moved into, leaving her heartbroken. ""They make their own choices, and it's only if they listenâ¦"" she says, fighting back tears. ""I miss him so much. I really do."" The deaths started in December, and since the BBC started investigating the problem in January, there have been eight more fatalities. For a town of 67,000 people, the 12 deaths are ""totally disproportionate"" says Nick Coughlan, making the rate in Barrow far higher than in many cities. Four of the deaths have occurred at Egerton Court, a dilapidated block of flats with crumbling masonry, boarded and smashed windows, discarded furniture and little hope. Sitting just yards from where the town's largest employer, BAE Systems, is building the nation's nuclear submarines, the Ego, as it's known locally, is often the dumping ground for Barrow's most vulnerable residents. Former prisoners, rough sleepers and drug addicts are regularly sent to one of the 144 flats in the complex, where the local council has paid out nearly Â£2m in the past  year in housing benefit payments, according to a BBC Freedom of Information request. Cooped up together, residents are easy prey for Barrow's dealers, who often entice residents with free drugs. Once hooked, the dealers sometimes take control of a resident's property and use the address to sell drugs to others - a practice known as cuckooing, which is becoming increasingly common in Barrow. Four of the deaths were in one single block of flats ""It's never been this bad,"" says Donna Stainton, who lives in a flat in another problem area of Barrow where one of the dozen died. ""You used to get the odd overdose now and again, but now it's constant."" Drug-related deaths are at record levels across Britain, with the latest figures showing 4,611 people died following drug misuse in 2016. In Cumbria, an assessment in November by the county council found ""the local death rate is currently significantly higher than the national average."" Despite this, the council has cut Â£1.3m from its budget for drug and alcohol services in recent years. The November assessment also raised questions over whether the model of drug treatment the government has encouraged councils to follow, which emphasised recovery and abstinence over long-term methadone maintenance, might have harmed some users. The local drugs death rate is significantly higher than average, says the county council Taking a strict approach, such as ending treatment if clients relapse, ""might mean that people who are not ready to become drug free are left without access to support and are put at higher risk as a result"", wrote the county council's director of public health. In a statement, Cumbria County Council said drug misuse was ""extremely complex"", and they regularly reviewed drug-related deaths ""to improve the support we offer to those who misuse drugs"". ""The commissioning of services is also largely dependent on budget - in Cumbria, we have one of the lowest public health budgets per head in the country, and austerity savings of over Â£200m in a 10-year period have meant that budgets across all council services have been reduced.""

"RaÃºl Castro (L) will remain in the background as Miguel DÃ­az-Canel (R) takes over Cuba's parliament has picked RaÃºl Castro's right-hand man, Miguel DÃ­az-Canel, as the sole candidate to succeed him, ending the family's long rule. Mr Castro took over as president from his ailing brother Fidel in 2006. An improvement in relations with the US which began under Barack Obama has been partially reversed since Donald Trump entered the White House. Mr Castro is expected to remain a powerful influence in the communist state even after he steps down. The National Assembly has voted on the nomination but the result will not be announced until Thursday, when he is expected to formally pass the presidency to Mr DÃ­az-Canel. However, he will stay on as head of the Communist Party until its next congress in 2021. The next Cuban leader will inherit a country in economic stagnation and with a young population impatient for change, BBC Cuba correspondent Will Grant reports. There is also the complex task of leading without the same revolutionary past embodied by RaÃºl andFidel, who died in retirement aged 90 in November 2016. Cuba after the Castros Did Fidel Castro's name kill his son? Watch: Cuba prepares for the end of the long-running Castro era He may have had a relatively low profile when he was first appointed vice-president of Cuba's Council of State in 2013 but he has since become Mr Castro's key ally. Mr DÃ­az-Canel is said to be more accessible than the Castro brothers For the past five years, he has been groomed for the presidency and the handover of power. But even before being named first vice-president, the 57-year-old had already had a long political career. He was born in April 1960, little over a year after Fidel Castro was first sworn in as prime minister. He studied electrical engineering and began his political career in his early 20s as a member of the Young Communist League in Santa Clara. While teaching engineering at the local university, he worked his way up the ranks of the Young Communist League, becoming its second secretary at the age of 33. RaÃºl Castro has praised his ""ideological firmness"". Analysis by Will Grant, BBC News, Havana In some respects, Miguel Diaz-Canel is a departure from the past. He is in his 50s and he wasn't even born until after the revolution took power. Yet, he still represents an extension of the Castro model - especially politically. The message of political continuity which the Cuban government has stressed from the moment the handover was announced has taken much of the wind out of the sense of renewal. At least two of RaÃºl Castro's inner circle, men in their late 80s, have remained on the Council of State. The biggest challenges, at least in the short term, are economic. He must tackle a complex dual currency system while trying to make sure inflation doesn't rise for ordinary Cubans. He must also try to stimulate a stagnant economy. Many are watching to see if he reverses the freeze on new private business licences to at least signal some support for the concept of private enterprise on the island. All of this, without the same popular backing of the Castros. He may have his work cut out. He is unlikely to make any major changes in the short term, especially while Mr Castro remains a political force to be reckoned with. Any changes are likely to be gradual and slow-paced. Yet Mr Castro did bring in reforms after he took over as president, most strikingly the thaw in relations with the US which had seemed unthinkable under his brother Fidel. ""Long live Fidel! Long live RaÃºl!"" Graffiti on a Havana street The new leader will have to consider how to overcome the problems caused by the economic collapse of Cuba's ally, Venezuela, and what kind of relationship the Caribbean island wants with the US under Mr Trump. Last year,the new American president reimposed certain travel and trade restrictionseased by the Obama administration but did not reverse key diplomatic and commercial ties. Four takeaways from Trump's Cuba policy But what most Cubans will judge the new leader on is whether their day-to-day lives improve. ""Right now, we don't know what the future holds,"" Adriana Valdivia, 45, a teacher in Havana, told Reuters news agency. ""Raul is finished and Fidel is history. I can't see a way out to help Cubans live better, salaries are the same and don't make ends meet, and now Trump is tightening the screws with the blockade, imagine that."" ""Politics is not my strong point,"" said Diadenis Sanabria, 34, who works in a state-owned restaurant in the Cuban capital. ""But I don't think a change of chief is going to change my life."" Often regarded as a rubber-stamp body, it is officially meeting to swear in its 605 members, who were elected last month. It also votes on the composition of the all-powerful Council of State, whose president serves as both head of state and government. Cuba has long maintained it has one of the most inclusive and fairest election systems in the world but critics say that assertion is laughable as the process is fully overseen by the ruling Communist Party. All 605 candidates stood unopposed in March. Did Fidel Castro's name kill his son? Cuba prepares for end to Castro era.

He was suspended from the force in November on full pay, on an annual salary of Â£119,000. Mr Beale has been able to keep his pension of Â£215,000 The documents included top secret minutes of a meeting of the Executive Liaison Group, which passes on intelligence of major covert terror investigations to police forces, as well as highly sensitive information about a high-profile investigation. The location of the documents, which police said were not supposed to have been taken off police premises, remains a ""mystery"". Mr Beale had been due to retire this month after 30 years of police service. After a legal ruling the hearing was pushed back so Mr Beale's dismissal would not fall outside of his notice period, meaning he could still claim his pension. ""I am sure the public would recognise the great service and would wish no harm to him and his family and to this extent I have no regrets this case has finalised after he can retire securely,"" Mr Thompson said. During the five days the documents were in the boot of Mr Beale's car, it had been parked in several different locations, including at a railway station while he had a weekend away in London with his wife, a pub and a supermarket. Despite a ""considerable diversion"" of police resources, the documents were not recovered. Mr Thompson said: ""It is deeply painful to look at what he [Mr Beale] has achieved and where he is now. ""At the heart of this case is simply what sanction will maintain public confidence in policing."" Mr Beale's counsel John Beggs QC said in light of his imminent retirement, dismissal would be ""merely symbolic"", adding the 54-year-old's failings had been ""unintentional with no malice or premeditation"". Previously, Mr Beale was one of four former Staffordshire Police officers who it was recommended by the then Independent Police Complaints Commission should face disciplinary proceedings over the""mishandling"" of the Kevin Nunes murder investigation. In March 2016 it was confirmed none would face a hearing.

"This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK Windrush Day has been held on 22 June since 2018, to celebrate the contribution Caribbean migrants and their families have made to the UK. HMT Empire Windrush docked in Tilbury, Essex, in 1948, bringing hundreds of passengers from the Caribbean to the UK. In 2018, it emerged that the government had not properly recorded the details of people granted permission to stay in the UK, and many were wrongly mistreated. HMT Empire Windrush became a symbol of a wider mass-migration movement. People in the Caribbean were invited to the UK to help rebuild post-war Britain. According to the National Archives,which holds the ship's passenger list,,externalthere were 1,027 people on board. More than 800 gave their last country of residence as somewhere in the Caribbean. Several hundred passengers were Jamaican, but others arrived from islands including Trinidad, St Lucia, Grenada and Barbados. These travellers - and those on other ships which came to the UK until 1971 - became known as the Windrush generation. Many had served in the British armed forces in World War Two. In 1948, the British Nationality Act gave people from colonies the right to live and work in Britain. The government needed workers to help fill post-war labour shortages and rebuild the economy. Caribbean countries were also struggling economically, and job vacancies in the UK offered an opportunity. Many of those who came became manual workers, drivers, cleaners, and nurses in the newly established NHS.

Commemoration events have been held on 22 June every year since 2018. In 2023, the 75th anniversary of the arrival of HMT Windrush was marked witha series of concerts, exhibitions and seminars across the country.,external King Charles, who held a reception at Buckingham Palace to mark the anniversary, hailed the Windrush generation's ""profound and permanent contribution to British life"". 'We have come a long way': Windrush generation on 75th anniversary New 50p coin to mark Windrush anniversary released Poet Benjamin Zephaniah to get posthumous honour on Windrush Day It is unclear how many people from the Windrush generation are still in the UK, but the number is thought to be in the thousands. They are among more than 500,000 UK residents who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971, according to University of Oxford estimates. The 1971 Immigration Act gave Commonwealth citizens living in the UK indefinite leave to remain - the permanent right to live and work in the UK. This included the Windrush generation, but also people from other former British colonies in South Asia and Africa. This video can not be played ""My whole life sunk down to my feet"" - Windrush migrant Michael Braithwaite However, in April 2018, it emerged that the UK Home Office had kept no records of those granted permission to stay, and had not issued the paperwork they needed to confirm their status. It had also destroyed landing cards belonging to Windrush migrants, in 2010. Those affected were unable to prove they were in the country legally and were prevented from accessing healthcare, work and housing. Manywere also threatened with deportation. A review of historical cases also found that at least 83 people who had arrived before 1973 had been wrongly deported.

The inquiry, whichreported in March 2020,,externalsaid that the scandal was both ""foreseeable and avoidable"", and criticised ""a culture of disbelief and carelessness"" in the Home Office. The inquiry made 30 recommendations, including: a full Home Office review of the UK's ""hostile environment"" immigration policy appointing a migrants' commissioner establishing a race advisory board Inquiry author Wendy Williamswarned there was a ""grave risk""of similar problems happening again without government action. Then-Home Secretary Priti Patel accepted the recommendations in full. Then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman announced plans to scrap three recommendations from Wendy Williams's review But in January 2023, then-Home Secretary Suella Braverman announced the Home office wasdropping three of the commitments: to appoint a migrants' commissioner responsible for ""speaking up for migrants and those affected by the system directly or indirectly"" to give the independent chief inspector of borders and immigration new powers to hold events with people affected to ""listen and reflect on their stories"" Ms Williams criticised the decision, saying the proposals would have raised the ""confidence of the Windrush community"".

But the scheme has been consistently criticised for processing delays, low offers, and unfair rejections reversed on appeal.

"This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? Some members of the so-called Windrush generation, who arrived in the UK decades ago as children, have been incorrectly identified as illegal immigrants. Here are some of their stories. The case of Albert Thompson - not his real name - has become the focus of much coverage during the current row. The 63-year-old is not technically of the Windrush generation as he arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1973 as a teenager. Buthis case was brought to light,externalafter he was told he would have to pay Â£54,000 for prostate cancer treatment unless he could produce the right documentation. ""I was less than two weeks away from my treatment. That was really upsetting,"" he told the BBC. ""I get to the Royal Marsden and they gave me this form to fill out where they want to see passport or visa, benefits letter and bank statement. ""At the end of the day, I don't have those things to show so I've got to pay Â£54,000, which I haven't got."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has raised Mr Thompson's struggles at Prime Minister's Questions, first in March and again on Wednesday, when he accused Theresa May of declining to help him. The prime minister insisted the Home Office has been in contact with Mr Thompson's representatives, and said his NHS treatment should never have been withheld. Who are the Windrush generation? In Pictures: The Windrush generation Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? But Mr Thompson said he first heard that he would receive treatment on the TV news. ""It makes me feel a bit better but not really completely. When I get the treatment - then I'll be over the moon,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Royal Marsden Hospital in London said it had been committed to resolving Mr Thompson's eligibility for further NHS treatment with his legal advisers. They added that his cancer specialist has contacted Mr Thompson to assess him in clinic for his next stage of treatment. In response, Jeremy Bloom, Mr Thompson's lawyer, said his client had been told radiotherapy treatment would only go ahead if he paid in advance or proved he had indefinite leave to remain. The Royal Marsden disputes this. Paulette Wilson, here alongside her daughter Natalie, spent time at an immigration detention centre Paulette Wilson came to Britain from Jamaica aged 10 in the late 1960s. Now 61, she said she was confused when she received a letter saying she was in the country illegally. ""I just didn't understand it and I kept it away from my daughter for about two weeks, walking around in a daze thinking 'why am I illegal?'"" Her daughter Natalie Barnes booked an appointment with the Home Office and was told her mother had six months to leave the country. Ms Wilson then spent two years with the threat of deportation hanging over her, includinga week at Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre, which she describes as ""a nightmare"". Windrush peers attack 'incompetent' Home Office How do you prove you've been living in the UK? Her MP and a local charity intervened to prevent her removal, and she has since been given a biometric residence permit which proves she can stay in the country. ""It's not ended because I've just got a card saying I have a right to stay in England - I still have to renew it in 2024,"" she said. Ms Wilson welcomed the government's apology, but asked: ""What about all the other people who were sent away before my case became big? ""It's just upsetting to think that an ordinary person like me could go through something like that. I'm still going through hell at the moment."" This video can not be played Winston Walker has lived in the UK since he was 18 months old Winston Walker arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1966 aged 18 months, on his father's passport. ""I'm as British as anyone,"" said the 53-year-old, who grew up in Birmingham and now lives in Bristol. He ran into difficulty in 2008 when applying for a provisional driving licence. ""I kept sending documents to the DVLA and they kept on sending it back,"" he told the BBC. Mr Walker later contacted an MP to help, after which he said he was told he did not ""exist on any data in this country"". ""It was frightening. I've been schooled here - had the same National Insurance number since I was 16... To be told you don't exist, it's overwhelming."" Mr Walker was able to get a resident's permit but that does not make him a British citizen. He said he wanted a British passport, but found it ""insulting"" that it would cost him ""about Â£1,500"". ""My grandmother would be turning in her grave to find out the way her offspring had been treated,"" he added. This video can not be played Junior Green was not allowed to return to the UK for his mother's funeral Junior Green arrived in the UK from Jamaica at 15 months old, in 1958. ""Sixty years, it's a long time. I'm an Englishman,"" he told BBC Newsnight. In 2009, Mr Green tried to update his passport with the proper visa information, but was told by the Home Office he had to prove he had lived in the UK for each of the previous 10 years. His application was rejected twice. In March last year, Mr Green travelled to Jamaica to be with his dying mother, but when he tried to return to the UK in June, he was not allowed on the flight. ""I was upset - virtually in tears. I couldn't understand why,"" he said. Months passed and Mr Green's mother was repatriated to the UK, but her son was unable to return to attend her funeral. He finally came back to the UK in September, after his local MP intervened. This video can not be played Windrush migrant Nick Broderick: 'I contemplated suicide' Nick Broderick, who came to the UK as a baby in 1962, has been fighting for the past four years to prove his legal status. He was working for a recruitment company in Dunstable when his office was subject to an immigration check. ""I wrote to the Jamaican embassy, I sent Â£70 to get a birth certificate. That didn't happen 3 or 4 times... So they gave me these papers to fill out and after I filled it out, they said to me 'I'm sorry, we seem to have lost the papers that you sent in and so now you're going to be deported',"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. In the months that followed, Mr Broderick had to report to the police station every month, could not work or use his driving licence. He said he knows others, in a similar position, who have been seriously ill with cancer and denied NHS treatment. ""It was an awful, awful time"" which sent him ""into a spiral of depression"", he said. ""I always thought myself as being English. I just want to have a normal life again,"" Nick added. Whitfield Francis - here with his eldest daughter Maria - came to England with his parents at the age of nine Whitfield Francis was born in Jamaica in 1958 and came to England with his parents at the age of nine. He only realised there was an issue over his right to remain in the UK when he tried to change jobs four years ago and was unable to provide proof of his status - something he didn't have - and he hasn't been able to work since. The father-of-four says he can't afford to pay for a biometric residence permit or for legal assistance. ""No-one has given me any help,"" the 59-year-old said. ""If I haven't got these certain documents, my children could be affected. They may not be eligible for a British passport although they were born in Britain."" His former partner Helen Cappasso says the situation ""nearly destroyed him"" and being unable to provide for their four children has ""broken his heart"". ""I cannot express here what a nightmare it's been, and it's not over yet,"" she said. Mr Francis, who is currently ""sofa surfing"" in Birmingham as he is unable to rent somewhere to live, said the government's pledge to help those affected has given him renewed hope that he would finally be able to work again. Sonia Williams says she doesn't accept the government's apology Sonia Williams, who came to the UK from Barbados in 1975, aged 13, has been fighting to prove she is British for four years. She was made redundant in 2014, and lost her driving licence in 2016. ""I can't drive, I can't work, I can't claims benefits, I can't do anything,"" she said. ""Sometimes I just want to give up. ""My mum's got citizenship, my dad had right to remain. So I just presumed I had all that, because I was leaving Barbados to come and live with my family. I wasn't just coming on holiday."" May apologises to Caribbean leaders Have you been affected? She said she feels ""stressed"" and ""numb"", and doesn't accept the government's apology. ""I'm not working, I can't claim benefits, so where am I going to get this money to apply for these things that they're asking me for?"" The Home Office said it would get in touch with Ms Williams. Londoner Katrice, 18, and her mother are both unable to get British passports The impact has not only been felt by the Windrush generation, but many of their children as well. Katrice Louis, whose mother, now 59, came to England from St Lucia aged 8, was born and raised in London but is unable to get a British passport. The 18-year-old says she only found out she wasn't classed as a British citizen when her mother tried to get passports for a family holiday in 2005. Two of Katrice's older siblings, born in the 1980s, have British passports, but Katrice and two of her other sisters, born in the 1990s, are unable to get one. ""The only option we have been given is to spend thousands of pounds to apply for citizenship and a passport which we cannot afford,"" she said. ""I have never understood how I have been born and raised here, but still not classed as a British citizen and been stripped of my identity. I have been denied a job. ""I have been living in fear of being deported to a country I have never even seen."" Tanya Simms, from Sheffield, was born in the UK in 1990. Her grandparents came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s and settled in Reading, Berkshire. They were granted British citizenship in the late 1960s and Tanya's mother joined them in the UK in 1975. Last year Tanya applied for a passport so she could go on her friend's hen do but was turned down on the grounds that neither of her parents were settled at the time of her birth. ""I cried my heart out when I got the letter,"" she said. ""It hurts. I've put into the system, I've been educated here, paid national insurance here."" She fears for the future: ""Where would they send me and my daughter? I've never been to Jamaica. What are they going to do? Just stick me in the sea?""

"Around three million EU residents will have the right to remain in the UK after Brexit European nationals must not face a ""bureaucratic nightmare"" to stay in the UK after Brexit, a top MEP has said. Guy Verhofstadt told the European Parliament the three million or so EU residents in the UK must be able to secure their future rights easily. ""After the Windrush scandal, we want to be sure that the same is not happening to our European citizens,"" he said. Ministers said the system would be ""user-friendly"" and forms would not be rejected on minor technicalities. The UK and EU have reached agreement on residents' rights after the UK leaves the EU, although this will only apply if an overarching withdrawal deal is agreed. All EU nationals who arrive before Brexit day - 29 March, 2019 - and also during a transition period lasting up to the end of 2020, will have the right to remain, as will their family members. However, they will have to apply for settled status or temporary permission to stay. Live: MEPs debate in European Parliament Rudd facing call to quit over Windrush Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK? Ministers have said there will be a presumption in favour of this being granted in nearly all cases and unlike the previous process of applying for permanent residency, which involved filling out an 85 page document, there will only be a small amount of paperwork involved. But questions have already been raised about the Home Office's ability to process so many applications in a relatively short period of time. And, during a debate in Strasbourg, MEPs drew attention to the ongoing Windrush deportations row in the UK - in which the children of Caribbean migrants who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s but have no formal documentation, face uncertainty over their future as a result of recent changes in immigration rules. Guy Verhofstadt, who leads the Liberal ALDE group and is also the Parliament's chief Brexit spokesman, has already expressed concerns that EU nationals could face ""similar treatment"". Analysis by the BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason Former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt says he remains to be convinced The EU - and the European Parliament in particular - has always been sceptical about the ability of the Home Office to handle the registration of more than three million people in a timely and efficient way. Revelations about the ordeal facing many Windrush migrants was bound to increase that sense of concern. There has been concerted pressure from other European capitals to ensure that the registration process will be as simple as possible; now there may well be renewed attention on how legal guarantees given to EU citizens will be upheld after Brexit. Spare a thought too, though, for the one million or so British citizens elsewhere in the EU who still have no idea what kind of registration system may be applied to them. He and other MEPs are due to meet Home Office officials next week to talk through the details of the UK's proposed registration system. ""We need to have citizens' rights completed,"" he said. ""If there are changes needed, we will communicate that to the negotiators what modifications are needed to avoid real problems for our EU citizens."" The BBC's Europe reporter Adam Fleming said he understood the Windrush situation was raised during a meeting of the European Parliament's Brexit Steering Group attended by chief negotiator Michael Barnier. Ministers say the registration system for EU nationals will be up and running in the second half of the year and will remain open until 30 June 2021, giving people plenty of time to complete the forms. Applicants will need to provide an ""identity document"" and recent photograph and, to minimise the need for supporting evidence, data such as employment records held by the HM Revenue and Customs will be used. Officials say applicants will not have to account for every foreign trip they have taken while living in the country. ""Every EU citizen resident in the UK on the day the transition period ends in December 2020 will be eligible for some form of leave to remain, subject to criminality checks,"" said a Home Office spokesman. ""We have committed to ensuring that applications will not be refused on minor technicalities and that caseworkers processing applications will exercise discretion in favour of the applicant where appropriate."" Unlike other applicants, existing permanent residents will not to have to pay a fee to re-apply nor have to supply fresh evidence they are still living in the UK.

"Tammie Jo Shults flew fighter jets for the US Navy A pilot who safely landed a Southwest Airlines passenger plane after a jet engine ripped apart mid-air has been praised as a hero by passengers. A female passenger died after she was nearly sucked out of a shattered window of the stricken plane. Tammie Jo Shults captained Flight 1380 to a Philadelphia airport in Tuesday's emergency, said passengers. Survivors on the New York-to-Dallas flight carrying 149 people lauded the ex-US Navy pilot as an ""American hero"". A cause has yet to be determined, but officials said an early review of the incident found evidence of metal fatigue where a fan blade had broken off, according to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Capt Shults has not been officially named by Southwest Airlines, but passengers who were on the flight have identified her as the pilot. Her husband has also confirmed to the Associated Press that she was at the controls of the plane. This video can not be played Air traffic control: ""I'm sorry, you said there is a hole?""

Capt Shults served in the US Navy for 10 years and flew fighter jets before leaving active service in 1993 after achieving the rank of lieutenant commander. Her husband, Dean Shults, is also a pilot for Southwest, says a relative.

"This video can not be played Starbucks' tortured relationship with race Starbucks' executive chairman has said he is ""embarrassed"" by the recent accusations of racial profiling in the company's US cafes. Howard Schultz's comments came after Starbucks announced it will close US stores on 29 May for company-wide ""racial bias training"". The initiative is in response to the arrest of two black men for trespassing at a Philadelphia Starbucks last week. The two men were waiting for a friend when the manager called the police. ""I think what occurred was reprehensible at every single level,"" Mr Schultz told CBS News on Wednesday. Starbucks race row leaves customers a bitter aftertaste Starbucks shuts US cafes for race training ""The announcement we made yesterday about closing our stores, 8,000 stores closed, to do significant training with our people is just the beginning of what we will do to transform the way we do business and educate our people on unconscious bias."" The former Starbucks CEO added that the firm is working with the NAACP and Equal Justice Initiative to assist company efforts to reduce unconscious bias in employees. ""There's no doubt in my mind that the reason that they [police] were called was because they were African American,"" he said. ""That's not who Starbucks is."" This video can not be played Watch the arrest of two black men at Starbucks - and the protests that followed The coffee company has since apologised over the incident as protesters called for a boycott of Starbucks. Mr Schultz said that the two black men from Philadelphia might also be working with Starbucks in the future. According to Schultz, the store manager who called the police has said she is ""interested"" in speaking with the two men. He added that this could be a ""unique opportunity"" to reconcile. ""Perhaps something good can come out of this and by that I mean, this has highlighted for us that we have more work to do as a company."" Days after Starbucks apologised to the Philadelphia men, mobile phone footage emerged of an apparent race-related incident in a Starbucks store in California. This video can not be played Brandon Wardâs video of his encounter at a Starbucks has gone viral Brandon Ward, a black Starbucks customer in Torrance in southern California, posted a video on social media purporting to show an incident in January, in which he was barred from using a toilet - despite being a paying customer - while a white man who hadn't bought anything was allowed to use the facilities. Mr Schultz told CBS it was possible that the Philadelphia incident was not ""isolated"" and the company would continue to examine its policies. In 2015 a Starbucks public relations campaign to encourage customers to discuss issues of race backfired, when the company's big roll-out was widely mocked. Launching the ""Race Together"" campaign, Starbucks had said it wanted to engage customers in a conversation about race amid protests about policing of African-American communities. Starbucks #RaceTogether campaign mocked online It involved baristas scribbling the words ""Race Together"" on cups and attempting to ""engage customers in conversation through Race Together stickers available in select stores"", Starbucks said. But instead the hashtag #racetogether was hijacked on social media and the campaign became the subject of widespread criticism.

"Bleaching causes coral to lose the algae which give it its colour Prolonged ocean warming events, known as marine heatwaves, take a significant toll on the complex ecosystem of the Great Barrier Reef. This is according to a new study on the impacts of the 2016 marine heatwave,published in Nature,external. In surveying the 3,863 individual reefs that make up the system off Australia's north-east coast, scientists found that 29% of communities were affected. In some cases up to 90% of coral died, in a process known as bleaching. This occurs when the stress of elevated temperatures causes a breakdown of the coral's symbiotic relationship with its algae, which provide the coral with energy to survive, and give the reef its distinctive colours. Certain coral species are more susceptible to this heat-induced stress, and the 2016 marine heatwave saw the death of many tabular and staghorn corals, which are a key part of the reef's structure. Coral reefs head for 'knock-out punch' Rising carbon dioxide levels threaten reefs 10 amazing facts about coral reefs When they are healthy, tabular or table corals provide shelter for smaller reef dwellers Researchers led by Terry Hughes at Australia's ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies looked at aerial observations of the entire 2,300km reef between March and November 2016. These were combined with underwater surveys at over 100 locations. ""We saw some corals rapidly dying,"" explained Dr Scott Heron, another of the study's authors. ""Bleaching... is essentially a starvation process that occurs over one to two months. This rapid onset is not the same starvation mechanism. The best way to describe it is akin to cooking,"" added the Noaa Coral Reef Watch scientist. They found that these ""cooked"" corals were dying within two to three weeks. The northern section of the reef, some 700km long, was worst affected, with 50% of the coral cover in the reef's shallowest areas being lost within eight months. A bleached branching coral stands out next to minimally-bleached boulder corals Not all areas of the reef, or all coral species, were equally affected. Some were better able to tolerate the stressful conditions, or to bounce back afterwards. ""There have been some signs of recovery,"" said Dr Heron. But in other areas the team noted that stressed coral populations were more susceptible to disease, and have since seen outbreaks. In many areas of the reef, there was a reduction in the diversity of coral species: shifting from the dominance of fast-growing species like tabular coral to simpler, slower growing varieties. In the much warmer waters of the Red Sea, researchers at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia have been looking at how corals can potentially adapt to increased temperatures. Their results,published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society,external, indicate that it is the partner algae, and not the coral themselves, who may be responsible for a capacity to tolerate heat stress. The Red Sea has a vibrant reef community With year-round temperatures of 29 - 30C, the Red Sea is a more thermally stable environment than many other reef communities. TheSymbiodiniumalgae there have adapted to tolerate the warmest ocean waters in the world, and it appears this may also make them more resilient to the stresses of changing temperatures. Partnering up with these particular algae could give corals an advantage. It's not yet clear what this could mean for other reef environments in danger of bleaching, but lead author Maha Cziesielski says that swapping to a different algae species is something corals already do in nature: ""It's quite  common... it's called symbiont shuffling. Association with more 'thermotolerant' algae can play a very important role in adapting to warmer environments,"" she told BBC News. She cautions that there will be no silver bullet when it comes to stalling the impact of climate change on reef environments. ""We don't understand the reef system well enough yet to have one answer... I don't think we have a large scale solution for this yet. [But this is] work that can in the future lead to something bigger."" For Dr Heron, the increasing frequency of marine heatwaves on the Great Barrier Reef is a pressing issue. 2016 was part of the third, and longest, mass coral bleaching event so far recorded. ""We're very concerned that the return period between events is now much shorter than the recovery time required,"" he told BBC News. ""If we continue on the trajectory we're going, [the reef] will not be the same ecosystem it has been. ""Will there be a reef? Yes. Will it be the same Great Barrier Reef we have known historically? No."" Bleached corals on the Great Barrier Reef Prof JÃ¶rg Wiedenmann from the University of Southampton's Coral Reef Laboratory agrees that, if present conditions continue, significant change lies ahead. ""Looking into the future of the Great Barrier Reef and reefs elsewhere, corals in the Arabian Gulf and other extreme temperature environments send both signs of hope and dire warning: reef communities can shift to states that tolerate more heat stress, however, this will likely come at the price of a loss of about 90% of coral species,"" he explained. ""Therefore,"" he added, ""efforts to protect these key ecosystems need to be made at all levels.""

"RaÃºl Castro (L) will remain in the background as Miguel DÃ­az-Canel (R) takes over Cuba's parliament has picked RaÃºl Castro's right-hand man, Miguel DÃ­az-Canel, as the sole candidate to succeed him, ending the family's long rule. Mr Castro took over as president from his ailing brother Fidel in 2006. An improvement in relations with the US which began under Barack Obama has been partially reversed since Donald Trump entered the White House. Mr Castro is expected to remain a powerful influence in the communist state even after he steps down. The National Assembly has voted on the nomination but the result will not be announced until Thursday, when he is expected to formally pass the presidency to Mr DÃ­az-Canel. However, he will stay on as head of the Communist Party until its next congress in 2021. The next Cuban leader will inherit a country in economic stagnation and with a young population impatient for change, BBC Cuba correspondent Will Grant reports. There is also the complex task of leading without the same revolutionary past embodied by RaÃºl andFidel, who died in retirement aged 90 in November 2016. Cuba after the Castros Did Fidel Castro's name kill his son? Watch: Cuba prepares for the end of the long-running Castro era He may have had a relatively low profile when he was first appointed vice-president of Cuba's Council of State in 2013 but he has since become Mr Castro's key ally. Mr DÃ­az-Canel is said to be more accessible than the Castro brothers For the past five years, he has been groomed for the presidency and the handover of power. But even before being named first vice-president, the 57-year-old had already had a long political career. He was born in April 1960, little over a year after Fidel Castro was first sworn in as prime minister. He studied electrical engineering and began his political career in his early 20s as a member of the Young Communist League in Santa Clara. While teaching engineering at the local university, he worked his way up the ranks of the Young Communist League, becoming its second secretary at the age of 33. RaÃºl Castro has praised his ""ideological firmness"". Analysis by Will Grant, BBC News, Havana In some respects, Miguel Diaz-Canel is a departure from the past. He is in his 50s and he wasn't even born until after the revolution took power. Yet, he still represents an extension of the Castro model - especially politically. The message of political continuity which the Cuban government has stressed from the moment the handover was announced has taken much of the wind out of the sense of renewal. At least two of RaÃºl Castro's inner circle, men in their late 80s, have remained on the Council of State. The biggest challenges, at least in the short term, are economic. He must tackle a complex dual currency system while trying to make sure inflation doesn't rise for ordinary Cubans. He must also try to stimulate a stagnant economy. Many are watching to see if he reverses the freeze on new private business licences to at least signal some support for the concept of private enterprise on the island. All of this, without the same popular backing of the Castros. He may have his work cut out. He is unlikely to make any major changes in the short term, especially while Mr Castro remains a political force to be reckoned with. Any changes are likely to be gradual and slow-paced. Yet Mr Castro did bring in reforms after he took over as president, most strikingly the thaw in relations with the US which had seemed unthinkable under his brother Fidel. ""Long live Fidel! Long live RaÃºl!"" Graffiti on a Havana street The new leader will have to consider how to overcome the problems caused by the economic collapse of Cuba's ally, Venezuela, and what kind of relationship the Caribbean island wants with the US under Mr Trump. Last year,the new American president reimposed certain travel and trade restrictionseased by the Obama administration but did not reverse key diplomatic and commercial ties. Four takeaways from Trump's Cuba policy But what most Cubans will judge the new leader on is whether their day-to-day lives improve. ""Right now, we don't know what the future holds,"" Adriana Valdivia, 45, a teacher in Havana, told Reuters news agency. ""Raul is finished and Fidel is history. I can't see a way out to help Cubans live better, salaries are the same and don't make ends meet, and now Trump is tightening the screws with the blockade, imagine that."" ""Politics is not my strong point,"" said Diadenis Sanabria, 34, who works in a state-owned restaurant in the Cuban capital. ""But I don't think a change of chief is going to change my life."" Often regarded as a rubber-stamp body, it is officially meeting to swear in its 605 members, who were elected last month. It also votes on the composition of the all-powerful Council of State, whose president serves as both head of state and government. Cuba has long maintained it has one of the most inclusive and fairest election systems in the world but critics say that assertion is laughable as the process is fully overseen by the ruling Communist Party. All 605 candidates stood unopposed in March. Did Fidel Castro's name kill his son? Cuba prepares for end to Castro era.

"Tammie Jo Shults flew fighter jets for the US Navy A pilot who safely landed a Southwest Airlines passenger plane after a jet engine ripped apart mid-air has been praised as a hero by passengers. A female passenger died after she was nearly sucked out of a shattered window of the stricken plane. Tammie Jo Shults captained Flight 1380 to a Philadelphia airport in Tuesday's emergency, said passengers. Survivors on the New York-to-Dallas flight carrying 149 people lauded the ex-US Navy pilot as an ""American hero"". A cause has yet to be determined, but officials said an early review of the incident found evidence of metal fatigue where a fan blade had broken off, according to the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Capt Shults has not been officially named by Southwest Airlines, but passengers who were on the flight have identified her as the pilot. Her husband has also confirmed to the Associated Press that she was at the controls of the plane. This video can not be played Air traffic control: ""I'm sorry, you said there is a hole?""

"Lord Patten was among two dozen Conservative peers to defy the party whip Peers have defeated the government on the issue of staying in a UK-EU customs union after Brexit. Lords voted by 348 to 225 in favour of a plan requiring ministers to report on steps to negotiate a continued union. Backing it, ex-EU Commissioner Lord Patten said the UK would be worse off unless current arrangements continued. But Brexit minister Lord Callanan said it required the government to report on the steps taken towards an objective it has ""clearly ruled out"". Number 10 argues that remaining in the customs union would prevent the UK from signing third-party trade agreements with countries across the world. Lord Callanan signalled the government's intention to overturn the measures at a later stage, saying before the vote it had no intention to ""reflect further"" on the matter. The defeat is the first of several expected as the House of Lords - in which the government does not have a majority - debates the government's flagship EU Withdrawal Bill in detail. The bill will end the supremacy of EU law in the UK while ensuring existing laws passed since the UK's entry in 1973 continue to apply. A total of 24 Conservatives voted against the government on the customs union amendment, including former ministers Lord Heseltine, Lord Lansley and Lord Willetts. Serving notice that he would be a serial rebel during the bill's passage, the former EU commissioner said: ""There are times in one's political career where what is alleged to be party loyalty comes way behind trying to stand up for the national interest."" Campaigners demand 'people's' Brexit vote Barnier: UK can change mind on single market Brexit bill fundamentally flawed, say peers Brexit: All you need to know However, former Conservative Chancellor Lord Lawson said Lord Patten was putting forward a ""political argument dressed up as a trade argument"" and it amounted to a ""wrecking amendment"". Remaining in a customs union while leaving the EU would leave the UK in a ""quasi-colonial"" status, he said. ""I can see there are political reason for remaining in the EU, but I think the political reasons for leaving are much stronger. But what it is absolute nonsense to suggest is that there is an economic case for what is being proposed."" The former chancellor said the financial arguments were ""economic nonsense"" Lord Forsyth went further, suggesting it was a plot by ""Remainers in this House, who are the majority, who refuse to accept the verdict of the British people - and I believe they are playing with fire"". ""I say to colleagues in this House, 'Have a care to what we are doing.' We are an unelected house, and this amendment [is] part of a campaign which is putting peers against the people."" Tory MP and Remain supporter Anna Soubry tweeted that the Lords had ""put their country first"", and called on her colleagues in the Commons to back them when the amendment returns.

But a statement from the Department for Exiting the EU said the fundamental purpose of the bill was to prepare the UK's statute book for exit day, not about the terms of departure. ""This amendment does not commit the UK to remaining in a customs union with the EU, it requires us to make a statement in Parliament explaining the steps we've taken,"" a spokesman said. ""Our policy on this subject is very clear. We are leaving the customs union and will establish a new and ambitious customs arrangement with the EU while forging new trade relationships with our partners around the world."" Analysis:By BBC political correspondent Ben Wright Peers turned out in force on Wednesday to wrestle with a question the government insists is settled - whether or not the UK should form a customs union with the EU after Brexit. It is one of the government's negotiating red lines that Britain must not remain in any sort of customs union. However, Labour believes the creation of a new union would keep goods flowing freely without tariffs and provide a workable solution to the Irish border issue. Many Tory peers strongly criticised Wednesday's amendment as an attempt by Remain supporters in the Lords to wreck the Bill and tie the hands of negotiators. But a number of Conservatives, combined with opposition parties, inflicted a heavy defeat on the government and the issue will now have to return to the House of Commons. What will be crucial then is how many Tory MPs align with Labour to try and force a change to the government's policy. The government also lost a vote against a second amendment aimed at ensuring that existing protections from EU law cannot be changed - except by primary legislation - which would require any changes to go through both the Commons and the Lords. Lord Callanan said the government had already taken steps to address concerns around employment, equality, and health and safety laws, ""potentially in ways that are even stronger than the amendment"". But Labour's Lady Hayter, who proposed the change, said there were ""parts of the government that appear a bit more deregulation obsessed"". After the debate, peers voted by 314 to 217 in favour of the amendment. Other potential flashpoints in the bill include amendments relating to Northern Ireland and a plan to scrap the government's decision to fix Brexit for 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019.

"Transport questions at start of day Business statement next Backbench debates on surgical mesh and cancer treatment Lords questions at 11am Lords debate on national security Richard Morris, Esther Webber and Alex Partridge HMT Empire Windrush docked in Essex in 1948, carrying passengers from the Caribbean to the UK. End of the week House of CommonsParliament After a frantic start to the week, with two emergency debates, the Commons has been altogether quieter today. Transport questions kicked off the day with questions on HS2 and train ticketing, as well as aviation and Brexit. The Leader of the House outlined upcoming business for the Commons next week. Then there have been two backbench debates on surgical mesh and cancer treatments. Baroness Jowell, pictured, sat in the Commons for the debate on cancer treatment. The Commons sits again on Monday at 2:30pm, starting with Defence questions and then the second reading of the Rating and Council Tax Bill. House of LordsParliament The House of Lords has adjourned for the day. Peers return at 2:30pm on Monday for oral questions, followed by the second day of report stage on the EU Withdrawal Bill. Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Health Minister Steve Brine says that today's debate is something which he ""will remember for a long time"". He says that as the ""current minister for cancer"", he was ""captivated"" by Baroness Jowell's speech, made to the House of Lords in January. He says that people affected by cancer ""are never just"" a cancer, in the case of Baroness Jowell she is still a mum and campaigner. ""We shouldn't underestimate what a difficult challenge brain cancer is,"" he says he is ""impatient and determined"" to ""fighting the big C"". He believes ""that this challenge is one we can overcome"". He says that funding for new research into brain tumours is now open to bids from Monday of this week. ""Due to the rarity of these many types of brain tumours it is vital we use this patient data more effectively,"" he says. The UK must start sharing patient data on brain tumours much more effectively, ""for the common good, not for the almighty shilling"". National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Addressing the airstrikes on Syrian government sites by the US, UK and France last weekend Defence Minister Earl Howe says consulting Parliament beforehand would have ""weakened our operational security"" by potentially revealing targets for a strike. He adds that the attacks were a ""limited, targeted, effective strike"" and were ""not about intervening in a civil war"". A cross-party group of MPs aims to increase pressure for a Brexit customs union deal. What does the government defeat in the House of Lords on amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill mean - and what more is to come? Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, says she lost her mother-in-law 21 years ago to breast cancer, which inspired her to join the All-Party Parliamentary Group on breast cancer. ""Tessa's optimism and and ambition has affected us all over the years,"" she says, ""today is not about politics, but patients,"" she adds, quoting Baroness Jowell. ""Cancer is not about politics,"" she says ""in the future, we can put our politics aside...to truly fight cancer together"". Brain tumours are the most common killers of adults under the age of 40 in the UK, and the most common killer of children, she says. She welcomes the announcement of Â£45m of funding for brain cancer research which the government announced in February. But the research community on brain tumors is ""fragmented"" and there are ""no clear hubs for excellence"". National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Defence Minister Earl Howe is winding up today's debate. He says the debate has emphasised some of the ""big themes"" of the current international situation, both the ""depth and breadth of the threats that we face is different"" as well as the ""range of threats from state powers, not just terrorists and insurgents"". He goes on to address Syria, where he says the government believes a ""negotiated settlement"" is the ""only appropriate outcome"". He also chides Russia for engaging in what he calls ""greyzone conflict"" using methods that ""strive to stay below our range of response"" but ""can be very serious"", including cyber attacks. Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Tulip Siddiq says ""it was Tessa who was fundamental in bringing the Olympics to London"", saying that it was Baroness Jowell who said that the Olympics would tell London to ""celebrate our diversity"". ""A cancer friends initiative could also bring profound benefits"" for cancer patients, which she says would help some sufferers in trying to find stem cell matches, for example. Only 60% of sufferers receive a ""best match"" in stem cell operations, and in the BAME community, this is much lower, she says. She says Baroness Jowell is a ""model of"" ""resilience"", ""optimism"" and a ""politician"". Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Rachel Maclean says that this debate highlights that ""we really do have more in common,"" she says that cancer's ""dark logic spares nobody"". She says that cancer has been around since 4600BC, but lived in silence until 440BC, when a slave ""recalled removing a tumour from his mistress's breast"". She says that her local NHS Trust is ""failing to meet"" their cancer statistics, and says that the health secretary first said that her Trust was one of the worst performing when she was elected. ""Breast cancer patients are now benefiting from a drastically reduced waiting time,"" thanks to simpler tests, she says. Tests are now done in house, reducing the time in waiting for results, she adds. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Glasman spent five days in Syria during the parliamentary recess, as a guest of the authorities who run the Kurdish segment of northern Syria, alongside the Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle. He says Western policy in Syria has laboured under a ""delusion"" that there is some sort of ""moderate Sunni Arab force"" the UK could ally with against Assad. But he says the Kurds exist as a ""third force"" in Syria ""that isn't Assad and isn't ISIS"", but they have been ""betrayed"". Kurdish forces have benefitted from western military support during the Syrian civil war. He says he wants to ask the minister ""whose side are we on in this? Why are we not being much more resolute in supporting our allies who have fought with consitently? Why have we stood back?"" A month ago forces backed by Turkey, a member of NATO, took the city of Afrin from mainly Kurdish forces defending it. Turkey claims it was fighting ""terrorists"". Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Former Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, who himself recently went through a procedure to remove a tumour in his lung, says ""fundamentally, a profound message of hope"" shone through from Baroness Jowell's words. He says that many speeches on cancer in Parliament can become ""sterile"" and just focus on statistics and funding. He says that Baroness Jowell's speech, focusing on ""a life well led"" broke through many typical speeches on the matter. Brain tumours are the biggest preventable cause of blindness in children, he states. There needs to be a better ""join up"" between hospitals and clinical trials. He says he ""warmly"" welcomes the announcement from the government of Â£45m of additional funding for brain tumour research from the government in conjunction with Cancer Research UK. He adds that he recently gave permission for his own tumour sample to be used for further research, in the hope that it will help others. Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Sarah Jones opens this debate on cancer treatments in the UK. She says that her father died of cancer last June, three days after she was elected to the Commons. No-one in the chamber is not ""touched by cancer,"" she adds. She pays tribute to her former boss, Baroness Jowell, who is currently undergoing treatment for an aggressive and difficult to treat form of brain cancer. Only 2% of funding for research goes to study brain tumours, she says. Baroness Jowell has ""thrown herself into her campaign"" to help people who have cancer live longer, she says. As a woman ""who walks through walls"" in her campaigns, ""you could almost feel sorry for cancer,"" she jokes. She says the UK needs to radically transform both clinical trials and data sharing because ""no vital drugs have been approved for 50 years"" in brain tumour treatments and uptake of clinical trials in brain tumour patients are low. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, says on Syria the British government has made ""a real error"" because we ""hate and loathe"" Assad. He says he'd ""love a regime change to something nice"" but ""look at the opposition...my goodness me, some of them are worse than Daesh"" he says, referring to another term for the ISIS group. He says UK policy in Syria is ""a real worry and we need to think that through"". Surgical mesh debate House of CommonsParliament Jackie Doyle-Price, Health Minister, thanks everyone who has contributed their personal stories in this debate. ""It is very important that the NHS does do its best to actually make life better for those women,"" she adds, and asks MPs to contact her directly with individual cases where the NHS may not be responding to cases well. She says that NHS guidance is ""clear"" that mesh ""should not be offered as a first intervention"". The guidance will be published later this year, and completed next year, she says. ""The acceptable level of risk will differ from patient to patient,"" she says, in how doctors consider recommending this course of treatment. The government has introduced a review to look into cases and to hear from individuals, she says. Surgical mesh debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow Health Minister, Sharon Hodgson, says the stories shared by constituents with their MPs, which have been retold in the Commons this afternoon, are ""distressing"". She says that her 74-year old mother, who has been ""back and forth to the doctors"" in the past four years, has also had a procedure done to her. ""It hadn't even occured to her"" that there was a connection between the procedure she'd gone through and the symptoms she was now receiving. She says her mother is now on the ""long road"" to some reversal surgery if it is possible. ""She trusted the medical profession to do her no harm,"" she says ""but my mam is lucky, she recognises that"". She says that her symptoms have not been as bad as other people's experiences. She says that Labour are urging NICE to update the guidelines immediately before they are next due to be reviewed in 2019-20. If this was a tumble dryer which was causing harm to people in 10-15% of people, it would be recalled, she adds. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Conservative Baroness Helic says action in Syria ""must go well beyond surgical strikes"" and there needs to be a ""comprehensive strategy"" for ending the war. She says the world must fight the use of chemical weapons, and that the ""ultimate deterrent would be the sight of Syrian leaders in the dock"" at a future war crimes tribunal. She says she wants a guarantee from the minister that the UK ""will not support a peace process that includes amnesty for war crimes in Syria"", listing chemical weapons, sieges, starvation, barrel bombs, attacks on hospitals and systematic use of rape and sexual violence as crimes carried out during the seven year long Syrian Civil War. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Lord Hennessy of Nympsfield, best known for his work as a military historian, says the operation last weekend in Syria was the first test of ""Chilcot compliant"" policy making. The Chilcot report into the 2003 Iraq War suggested a ""checklist"" to aid military decision making. He says that the strikes on Syria should have been the first UK operation to be carried out using the checklist,which encourages decision makers to ask why action is proposed, what the UK knows about the situation and what the legal status of the proposed action is,external. He says he's sought answers from ministers about the use of the checklist but has not had any. ""Perhaps surprisingly"", he adds, the checklist is ""silent"" on the question of Parliamentary involvement. It may only be symbolic, but those forcing a customs union vote in the Commons hope it will add to pressure for a policy change. Â© 2025 BBC.

"RaÃºl Castro (L) will remain in the background as Miguel DÃ­az-Canel (R) takes over Cuba's parliament has picked RaÃºl Castro's right-hand man, Miguel DÃ­az-Canel, as the sole candidate to succeed him, ending the family's long rule. Mr Castro took over as president from his ailing brother Fidel in 2006. An improvement in relations with the US which began under Barack Obama has been partially reversed since Donald Trump entered the White House. Mr Castro is expected to remain a powerful influence in the communist state even after he steps down. The National Assembly has voted on the nomination but the result will not be announced until Thursday, when he is expected to formally pass the presidency to Mr DÃ­az-Canel. However, he will stay on as head of the Communist Party until its next congress in 2021. The next Cuban leader will inherit a country in economic stagnation and with a young population impatient for change, BBC Cuba correspondent Will Grant reports. There is also the complex task of leading without the same revolutionary past embodied by RaÃºl andFidel, who died in retirement aged 90 in November 2016. Cuba after the Castros Did Fidel Castro's name kill his son? Watch: Cuba prepares for the end of the long-running Castro era He may have had a relatively low profile when he was first appointed vice-president of Cuba's Council of State in 2013 but he has since become Mr Castro's key ally. Mr DÃ­az-Canel is said to be more accessible than the Castro brothers For the past five years, he has been groomed for the presidency and the handover of power. But even before being named first vice-president, the 57-year-old had already had a long political career. He was born in April 1960, little over a year after Fidel Castro was first sworn in as prime minister. He studied electrical engineering and began his political career in his early 20s as a member of the Young Communist League in Santa Clara. While teaching engineering at the local university, he worked his way up the ranks of the Young Communist League, becoming its second secretary at the age of 33. RaÃºl Castro has praised his ""ideological firmness"". Analysis by Will Grant, BBC News, Havana In some respects, Miguel Diaz-Canel is a departure from the past. He is in his 50s and he wasn't even born until after the revolution took power. Yet, he still represents an extension of the Castro model - especially politically. The message of political continuity which the Cuban government has stressed from the moment the handover was announced has taken much of the wind out of the sense of renewal. At least two of RaÃºl Castro's inner circle, men in their late 80s, have remained on the Council of State. The biggest challenges, at least in the short term, are economic. He must tackle a complex dual currency system while trying to make sure inflation doesn't rise for ordinary Cubans. He must also try to stimulate a stagnant economy. Many are watching to see if he reverses the freeze on new private business licences to at least signal some support for the concept of private enterprise on the island. All of this, without the same popular backing of the Castros. He may have his work cut out. He is unlikely to make any major changes in the short term, especially while Mr Castro remains a political force to be reckoned with. Any changes are likely to be gradual and slow-paced. Yet Mr Castro did bring in reforms after he took over as president, most strikingly the thaw in relations with the US which had seemed unthinkable under his brother Fidel. ""Long live Fidel! Long live RaÃºl!"" Graffiti on a Havana street The new leader will have to consider how to overcome the problems caused by the economic collapse of Cuba's ally, Venezuela, and what kind of relationship the Caribbean island wants with the US under Mr Trump. Last year,the new American president reimposed certain travel and trade restrictionseased by the Obama administration but did not reverse key diplomatic and commercial ties. Four takeaways from Trump's Cuba policy But what most Cubans will judge the new leader on is whether their day-to-day lives improve. ""Right now, we don't know what the future holds,"" Adriana Valdivia, 45, a teacher in Havana, told Reuters news agency. ""Raul is finished and Fidel is history. I can't see a way out to help Cubans live better, salaries are the same and don't make ends meet, and now Trump is tightening the screws with the blockade, imagine that."" ""Politics is not my strong point,"" said Diadenis Sanabria, 34, who works in a state-owned restaurant in the Cuban capital. ""But I don't think a change of chief is going to change my life."" Often regarded as a rubber-stamp body, it is officially meeting to swear in its 605 members, who were elected last month. It also votes on the composition of the all-powerful Council of State, whose president serves as both head of state and government. Cuba has long maintained it has one of the most inclusive and fairest election systems in the world but critics say that assertion is laughable as the process is fully overseen by the ruling Communist Party. All 605 candidates stood unopposed in March. Did Fidel Castro's name kill his son? Cuba prepares for end to Castro era.

"This video can not be played Alfie's father Tom Evans met Pope Francis at the Vatican The father of terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans has met Pope Francis, begging him to ""save our son"". Tom Evans has flown to Rome asking the Pope to intervene in the legal battle about ending 23-month-old Alfie's life support. It comes after the family lost the latest appeal for his treatment to continue at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. Mr Evans said: ""Your Holiness, save our son"" and asked for asylum for Alfie. Mr Evans, 21, and Kate James, 20, have so far had all appeals against aHigh Court rulingin February to withdraw his life support and take him to Rome for treatment rejected. Alfie has an undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition The Court of Appeal dismissed a fresh appeal by the couple on Monday and they haveapplied to the Supreme Courtto consider their case. Mr Evans posted on Facebook: ""Last night I jumped on a plane and come to Vatican Rome to meet the Pope. ""Alfie we will do everything for you."" Who is Alfie Evans? Alfie parents appeal to Supreme Court Court rules against Alfie parents again He met with the Pope before his general audience when he highlighted Alfie's plight and asked the crowd to pray for him. Vatican Newsreported,externalPope Francis said ""it is our duty to do all that is possible to safeguard life"" during his address. He said cases like Alfie's were ""very painful and complex"" and asked that ""every sick person may always be respected in their dignity and cared for in an appropriate way for their condition... and with great respect for life."" Earlier this month the Popetweeted support for the sick toddlerand called for all sides to work together for what is best for Alfie. Andrea Williams, from the Christian Legal Centre which is representing Alfie's family, confirmed Mr Evans had asked the Pope for asylum for his son during the meeting at the Vatican. ""When every avenue has been shut down in this country it shows he won't give up. ""He wants his son to be given a chance to live which is being denied when there are places prepared to look after him.""

It added recent criticism of Alder Hey hospital was ""unfounded"". Tom Evans and Kate James want to take Alfie to Rome The Supreme Court whichrefused to consider the parents case in Marchsaid it was examining the latest application to overrule Monday's Court of Appeal decision. The Court of Appeal judges explained theydismissed the latest challenge because it was the same legal argument,external- albeit with a different legal term - they made in February and March and moving him to a hospital in Italy was ""contrary to his best interests"". The judges said: ""The application of a different legal label... does not change the fact that the court has already determined the issues which the parents now seek, again, to advance. ""Their views, their rights do not take precedence and do not give them an 'unfettered right' to make choices and exercise rights on behalf of Alfie."" The judges said Alfie was not being ""detained"" in hospital or ""deprived of his liberty... the doctrine of habeas corpus."" Alder Hey Children's Hospital has said continuing to treat Alfie, who has an undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition, was ""inhumane"" and ""futile"".

"Elon Musk wants staff to cut short unproductive phone calls and meetings as he aims to boost production of the Tesla Model 3 over the next few months. Work has temporarily halted at Tesla plants in California for upgrades aimed at increasing output from 2,000 to 6,000 cars per week by the end of June. A leaked email outlined other ways staff could help streamline operations. These include walking out of meetings, sidestepping the chain of command and ignoring company rules on occasion. Increasing production of the Model 3 is considered key to shifting Tesla from loss-making to profitability, but the firm has repeatedly missed previous production targets. In the leaked email,published by website Elektrek,external, chief executive Mr Musk calls for a crackdown on the performance of Tesla's contractors,  which he says in some cases has been ""worse than a drunken sloth"". And he says the firm will keep a sharper tally on expenditure in future. Mr Musk's other thoughts on improving productivity include avoiding large meetings - which he says are the ""blight of big companies"". ""It is not rude to leave, it is rude to make someone stay and waste their time,"" he wrote. Tesla's Model 3 is aimed at the mass market but the firm has been unable to fulfil a backlog of orders for the $35,000 electric car. Highly-automated plants have run into difficulties prompting Mr Musk to tweet last week that ""excessive automation"" had been a mistake and that ""humans are underrated"". Allow Twitter content?

The email says the current technical upgrade will allow production to increase to  3,000 to 4,000 Model 3 cars per week from next month, and that further upgrades should allow them to reach 6,000 per week by the end of June. The plan involves recruiting hundreds more staff to man an extra shift at Tesla's Fremont car plant so it can operate around the clock. Mr Musk's email also suggested there would be a crack down on expenditure. ""I have asked the Tesla finance team to comb through every expense worldwide, no matter how small,"" he wrote. ""All contracting companies should consider the coming week to be a final opportunity to demonstrate excellence. Any that fail to meet the Tesla standard of excellence will have their contracts ended on Monday."" He then added a list of productivity tips including advice to: Cancel large meetings or if you have to have them keep them ""very short"" Walk out of a meeting or end a phone call if it is failing to serve a useful purpose. Avoid acronyms or nonsense words. ""We don't want people to have to memorise a glossary just to function at Tesla"" Sidestep the ""chain of command"" to get the job done. Managers insisting on hierarchies will ""soon find themselves working elsewhere"" Ignore the rules if following them is obviously ridiculous. The firm has come under increasing pressure from investors in recent months, a situation exacerbated by the death of a driver in a Tesla car operating in its Autopilot mode last month. Mr Musk made light of the company's financial situation on 1 April, joking in a tweet that Tesla had gone bankrupt. ""Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt.

"Around three million EU residents will have the right to remain in the UK after Brexit European nationals must not face a ""bureaucratic nightmare"" to stay in the UK after Brexit, a top MEP has said. Guy Verhofstadt told the European Parliament the three million or so EU residents in the UK must be able to secure their future rights easily. ""After the Windrush scandal, we want to be sure that the same is not happening to our European citizens,"" he said. Ministers said the system would be ""user-friendly"" and forms would not be rejected on minor technicalities. The UK and EU have reached agreement on residents' rights after the UK leaves the EU, although this will only apply if an overarching withdrawal deal is agreed. All EU nationals who arrive before Brexit day - 29 March, 2019 - and also during a transition period lasting up to the end of 2020, will have the right to remain, as will their family members. However, they will have to apply for settled status or temporary permission to stay. Live: MEPs debate in European Parliament Rudd facing call to quit over Windrush Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK? Ministers have said there will be a presumption in favour of this being granted in nearly all cases and unlike the previous process of applying for permanent residency, which involved filling out an 85 page document, there will only be a small amount of paperwork involved. But questions have already been raised about the Home Office's ability to process so many applications in a relatively short period of time. And, during a debate in Strasbourg, MEPs drew attention to the ongoing Windrush deportations row in the UK - in which the children of Caribbean migrants who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s but have no formal documentation, face uncertainty over their future as a result of recent changes in immigration rules. Guy Verhofstadt, who leads the Liberal ALDE group and is also the Parliament's chief Brexit spokesman, has already expressed concerns that EU nationals could face ""similar treatment"". Analysis by the BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason Former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt says he remains to be convinced The EU - and the European Parliament in particular - has always been sceptical about the ability of the Home Office to handle the registration of more than three million people in a timely and efficient way. Revelations about the ordeal facing many Windrush migrants was bound to increase that sense of concern. There has been concerted pressure from other European capitals to ensure that the registration process will be as simple as possible; now there may well be renewed attention on how legal guarantees given to EU citizens will be upheld after Brexit. Spare a thought too, though, for the one million or so British citizens elsewhere in the EU who still have no idea what kind of registration system may be applied to them. He and other MEPs are due to meet Home Office officials next week to talk through the details of the UK's proposed registration system. ""We need to have citizens' rights completed,"" he said. ""If there are changes needed, we will communicate that to the negotiators what modifications are needed to avoid real problems for our EU citizens."" The BBC's Europe reporter Adam Fleming said he understood the Windrush situation was raised during a meeting of the European Parliament's Brexit Steering Group attended by chief negotiator Michael Barnier. Ministers say the registration system for EU nationals will be up and running in the second half of the year and will remain open until 30 June 2021, giving people plenty of time to complete the forms. Applicants will need to provide an ""identity document"" and recent photograph and, to minimise the need for supporting evidence, data such as employment records held by the HM Revenue and Customs will be used. Officials say applicants will not have to account for every foreign trip they have taken while living in the country. ""Every EU citizen resident in the UK on the day the transition period ends in December 2020 will be eligible for some form of leave to remain, subject to criminality checks,"" said a Home Office spokesman. ""We have committed to ensuring that applications will not be refused on minor technicalities and that caseworkers processing applications will exercise discretion in favour of the applicant where appropriate."" Unlike other applicants, existing permanent residents will not to have to pay a fee to re-apply nor have to supply fresh evidence they are still living in the UK.

" The boat was barely seaworthy and heavily overloaded with men and equipment. For seven days and nights, the crew had attempted to navigate the treacherous seas but the ship was unfit and letting in water. Almost all the men on board were unwell – seasick or weak with hunger and thirst. Now, arriving two days later than planned and miles from the rendezvous, the ship had run aground in thick mud. A Cuban postage stamp celebrates the Granma's voyage As Che Guevara would later observe, the supposedly triumphant return to Cuban soil of Fidel Castro and his revolutionary force in December 1956 “wasn’t a landing, it was a shipwreck”. In all, 82 men stepped off that vessel, Granma, bedraggled and dispirited. It soon got worse. In the foothills of the Sierra Maestra they were ambushed by the Cuban army and reduced to just a handful of guerrillas, among them Fidel Castro and his younger brother, Raúl. From that ignominious start, they eventually defeated Fulgencio Batista’s military regime. Facing 40,000 men and far superior weaponry, it was one of the most successful guerrilla campaigns of the 20th Century. (Below: Fidel Castro waves to crowds in the Cuban capital  Havana in January 1959, shortly after his victory over Batista) Perhaps more incredibly, though, they have stayed in power until today. Between them, the Castro brothers have spent almost 60 years at the helm. The mark they have left on the island, shaping it into a one-party communist-run state, is indelible. Fidel and Raúl in 1999 Now, a turning point beckons. The Father of the Revolution, Fidel Castro, died in late 2016 and Raúl Castro is retiring from the presidency. Cuba is about to be governed by someone other than a Castro for the first time since 1959. So, after six decades, what kind of country will they pass on? As the elderly Castro slipped into his final moments, he could reflect on a long and contented life. Though frail in body, he’d stayed mentally agile until the very end and his adoring children and grandchildren were at his bedside. He was stubborn - a family trait - and a fighter to the last. For nearly nine hours the doctors attempted to save him. But it was not to be. This was Mártin Castro, half-brother of Fidel and Raúl, and he died in September 2017 only a stone’s throw from where he was born - in Birán. He had suffered an aneurysm, aged 87, a year after Fidel’s death. Mártin Castro, pictured in 2016 Although the two men shared a father and played together as children, there were perhaps no two lives in Cuba quite so different as theirs. One became the founder of the Cuban Revolution. The other never left home. An icon of the Cold War, Fidel Castro led Cuba for almost 50 years, installing communism on an island barely 90 miles off the coast of Florida. “Right under the noses of the imperialists,” as he would later famously say. After the revolution, in 1959, his little-known half brother Mártin was offered the chance to move to Havana to take up a role in government. He turned it down. A simple man, Mártin was happier among his animals and the sugar cane fields of their hometown. “I often wonder what would have happened if Dad had joined with Fidel,” says his daughter, Josefa Beatriz, her grief still evident, “but he never wanted to.” A Castro family photo featuring Mártin and Raúl “My father never studied but he shared their intelligence,"" she recalls with fondness, passing a finger lovingly over his photograph. The family resemblance, especially to Raúl, is striking. Mártin Castro's daughter, Josefa Beatriz Castro López: “I often wonder what would have happened if Dad had joined with Fidel, but he never wanted to.” The Castro family home, Finca Las Manacas, is now a museum, painstakingly restored as a monument to Fidel and Raúl's rural roots. The town’s historian, Antonio López, guides me around the estate. Finca Las Manacas, the Castro family estate Birán, he says, was the town that Castro built. Fidel’s father, Ángel Castro, first came to Cuba in the 1890s from the Spanish region of Galicia as a conscript to defend colonial rule during the Spanish-American War. When he returned to the island shortly after its independence in 1898, he began working in the mines and later the sugar cane plantations for the American giant, United Fruit Company. Ángel Castro, father of Fidel By the early 1910s, he was on the path to wealth. He had bought a little land on the side of the Camino Real, a muddy route between Santiago de Cuba and Nipe Bay on the northern coast. Little by little, that farm grew into a fiefdom typical of the era: a school, a general store, a lumberyard, a bar, a blacksmith, rustic huts for the Haitian sugar cane and timber workers. Antonio shows me the tiny schoolroom where Fidel first sat in on classes before being sent to study under the Jesuit priests in Santiago and Havana. As one guide walks past, she repeats the official story to tourists - how the impoverished conditions of the indentured Haitian sugar cane cutters left a lasting impression on Fidel and Raúl. “Fidel once said he was glad to be the son, not the grandson, of a landowner as there still wasn’t a family culture of privilege or entitlement,” says Antonio. Ángel wouldn’t live to see the victory of the socialist revolution nor his sons become the two most powerful men on the island. He died in 1956 and is buried alongside Fidel and Raúl's mother, Lina, in Finca Las Manacas. However, for at least one other son, life never really changed much from those early days of rural tranquillity. Over sugary black coffee in her living room, Josefa explains how Mártin had left them a little land, a few head of cattle and the cramped but welcoming home where we are sitting. Birán retains its sleepy village life. Men gather in the tiny plaza around the state-run shop, sharing a little rum after a morning in the fields or buying fizzy drinks and cheap ham sandwiches in the subsidised cafeteria. Mártin's rudimentary concrete house was part of a plan by Fidel to build 400 homes for the townsfolk, in contrast to the workers’ flimsy wooden huts on his father’s estate. Rectangular and boxy, with a bathroom hidden behind a curtain, all along the street the homes are uniform, except for a few which stand out with bright pink, yellow or green facades. Most have a narrow front porch. Mártin used to sit on his in a rocking chair and watch Birán go by. In the end only 218 of the 400 were completed. At the wake, it seemed like neighbours from all of those 218 turned up to pay their respects, his daughter recalls. “Everyone knew him, would stop by and chat to him. People used to ask me why I didn’t take him to live in Havana but he was happy here. “He’d say, ‘I don’t want wealth. These are my riches’,” and she motions towards the fields. The ferry to Cayo Granma can get pretty crowded. Just one Cuban peso (5 US cents; 3p) each way, it is the easiest and cheapest way to reach the island, which lies at the mouth of the Bay of Santiago. The deck is full of boxes of frozen chicken thighs from Brazil, a motorbike rests precariously against the railings and on the benches inside a group of high school kids are giggling and shouting over one another. Few tourists venture out to the sleepy fishing village but one suspects most locals prefer it that way. “They’ll have to set me on fire before I leave this island,” jokes Rosa Caridad Valverde, who has lived on the tiny islet her whole life. “Then, after they put me out, I’d swim back to the Cayo!” Now in her late 70s, she is suffering from high blood pressure. Nothing serious, she insists, but she has come to see the family doctor to pick up a repeat prescription for her pills. Rosa is sitting in the shade waiting for Dr Clara Luaces, who is attending to her patients inside a spotlessly clean clinic. “Given how cut off this island is from the city, we have the basic equipment needed to treat people,” explains the doctor, her stethoscope still around her neck. Clara is a very direct but warm woman in her 50s who takes pride in living among the community itself, something she says is key to the concept of primary healthcare in Cuba. “There are 651 inhabitants living here,” she says, nodding at the wood-and-tin houses which snake up the hillside towards the church. “There is a launch to take emergency cases or pregnant women to the mainland, although we have saved several lives here on the island ourselves,” she adds with a hint of pride. Rosa Caridad is thankful for the service. Unprompted, she offers glowing revolutionary praise: “The greatest thing for a country is not food or clothes, it’s health and education. And we get both of them for free.” Dr Clara Luaces These are the two pillars of the Cuban Revolution, the social achievements most synonymous with Cuba under the Castros. In fact, to suggest that there are inadequacies in either - to point out that they are in dire need of investment and modernisation - borders on blasphemy to some government officials in Cuba. Asked what she would most want from Raúl's successor, Clara speaks carefully. She is only prepared to say that bureaucracy remains an obstacle in Cuba and that it isn’t easy to get by on a salary of about US$35 a month. Even then she quickly corrects herself: “But I’ve seen my wages increase more than most in recent years.” Plus, she adds dutifully, the US economic embargo on Cuba should be lifted. It’s a refrain that is repeated endlessly across Cuba. From supplies of medicines to new strains of seeds, the embargo – or “blockade” as Cubans call it – is now in its 58th year and is blamed for much of the island’s economic stagnation. But there are, of course, several homegrown challenges facing Cuba’s healthcare system. Off the record, some doctors and nurses will say that infection inside hospitals is a significant problem. And while treatment remains completely free, a significant burden of care falls to the families. They must provide the sheets, pillows, and sometimes even source the meals and basic antibiotics their loved ones require. Nevertheless, Clara says, in the rest of Latin America very few can count on the same free medical attention that Cuban doctors provide. The Pan-American Health Organization, among others, has been fulsome in its praise, especially in the fight against infectious disease on the island. Back on the mainland, I visit the spot where it all began, where the opening salvo of the Cuban Revolution was fired - the Moncada Barracks. On 26 July 1953, Fidel and Raúl led an ill-equipped uprising in Santiago against Batista’s brutal regime by attacking the barracks. The attempted coup was crushed within hours and the plotters rounded up and tortured. The Castro brothers were fortunate not to be among them. In a flourish typical of the Castros, once they took power, they turned the military base into a school. Today it houses several schools under one roof as well as a museum about the uprising. Education is another source of huge pride in Cuba. The country eradicated illiteracy in rural regions in the early 1960s and its commitment to higher education and scientific research is internationally recognised. At the turn of the 21st Century,a World Bank study of Latin America and the Caribbeanfound that Cuba ranked first in maths and science at all school grades and for both males and females. The report also described Cuba’s schools as the “equals” of schools in many OECD countries. Education remains a key tenet of the revolution. But today resources are scarce, budgets stretched thin and official statistics suggest a worsening teacher shortage. Thousands of teachers are absent or have apparently abandoned the profession altogether in favour of the private sector, where more can be made in a day renting rooms to tourists or giving private classes than in a month as a state educator. In the shaded patio at Moncada, the children are lined up in neat rows besides a plaque marking the spot where the bodies of the revolutionaries killed in the Moncada attack were laid out. “Pioneers of communism,” calls a child to the entire student body assembled before her. “We will be like Che!” comes their resounding response. It is the slogan chanted every morning by schoolchildren across the island, a lifelong dedication to the values of socialism as personified by Che Guevara. Afterwards, we are ushered into a classroom to see the children at work. “Who can conjugate this in the past tense?” asks the teacher, writing the verb “to study” on the board. A volley of hands go up and, typically, she picks one of the kids whose hand stayed down. We're told we can interview the children but from experience they invariably just recite revolutionary mantras under the watchful eye of their teachers. So instead I ask the head teacher herself what she says to critics, especially in Miami, who say that such heavy rhetoric at school amounts to indoctrination. “It’s absurd to argue there’s brainwashing here,” says Elaine Infante. “Our revolution is very humanitarian and we think about the well-being of all children here.” “That’s why we come to work. Not to turn them into militants, no. But to prepare them for the future, to make them into good men and women who can serve their society.” Don Manolo worked the land until his knees could take no more. By then he was 90. He had grown coffee in the Sierra Maestra mountains for his entire life but two years ago the ravages of time forced him to return his deeds to the state in exchange for a pension. “We began as squatters, with no titles to the land.” His gnarled hands grip a cane for support and a wide-brimmed straw hat protects him from the harsh Caribbean sun. Before the revolution, Manolo used to give a third of every harvest to the local landowner, he explains. One day a group of bearded men appeared on his plot. “A lot of us wanted to fight but Fidel said not all thecampesinos(peasant farmers) could join the rebel army as we were needed to produce their food,” he recalls. The rebels promised that Manolo and other farmers would soon own their land. He was 33, the same age as Fidel, and the two men would meet again a few months later when the leader of the revolution returned to the region to give out the promised deeds. Under the reforms, all landholdings over a certain size were confiscated and redistributed as small plots to the peasant farmers or turned into state-run communes. All major landowners - from wealthy Cuban families to foreign multinationals like Coca-Cola and the United Fruit Company - had their lands nationalised. Sugar plantations could no longer be foreign-owned - one of the early decisions which first set Cuba at loggerheads with Washington. Castro supposedly even confiscated some of his family’s estate at Finca Las Manacas, much to his mother’s fury. The law remains the basis of Cuba’s agricultural model. “We held a party with a horse parade in Caney de las Mercedes that day they gave us the titles,” recalls Manolo. “We were happy because now no-one could throw us off the land.” (Below: Don Manolo poses for a photo with a replica of the paperwork he received from – and 57 years later returned to – the Cuban state) In the foothills of the Sierra Maestra the microclimate is perfect for growing coffee. At a point called Polo Norte - North Pole - lives Lérido Medina, another of the original recipients of the land titles. He doesn’t have the paperwork now, though - he donated his deeds to a museum in Havana. Wearing a thick woollen shirt in the cool mountain air, the 92-year-old explains that he now relies on his wife, Aida, and his son to do the manual work on the farm. “The hardest part has been cutting back the forest to sow,” says Lérido. “There is no mechanisation whatsoever, it’s all by hand – pickaxe, machete, brute force.” The entirety of the family’s crop is sold to the state - coffee cannot be sold on the open market. To this day, most farmers like Lérido  see the agrarian reform as the bedrock law that gave them autonomy. But critics say it tied them to the state for life. Lérido Medina The economic rules have eased a little under Raúl's presidency and although they’re far from being private enterprises, the coffee farmers in Polo Norte joined forces to create a co-operative. It has allowed them to pool their resources and wield a little more collective bargaining power, explains Lérido's eldest son, Eziquiel. But whether farming mountainous coffee plantations or the sugar cane and tobacco fields that dot the countryside, almost everyone involved in agriculture appears to agree on the limitations of the technology. Much of the farming equipment still used on the island is from the 19th Century - oxen and plough, horse and cart, machete. “In the plains you can use tractors but not up here. It’s a tough life for the campesino but the work must be done,” says Lérido. Despite Raúl's changes, the state-run model still forms the basis of Cuba’s agriculture. For many farmers, growth has been sluggish at best since the collapse of the Soviet Union and about three-quarters of Cuba’s domestic food requirements are imported. However, hunger has largely been eradicated and it’s highly unlikely that a future leader would unpick one of the revolution’s founding principles in agricultural production. While coffee is important to Cuba, sugar has traditionally been the island’s main export crop and at the centre of its economy. On the road passing through Camaguey province, we stop to speak to a group of sugar cane farmers as they harvest the crop. “We’re aiming for 40,000 tonnes this year,” says Osvany Iglesias, the leader of the harvest platoon, before echoing the complaint over working with Soviet-era machines. “That was made in 1972, that one in 1975, and this is the most modern, from 1994,” he says pointing at the combine harvesters as they roar past. “The lack of parts is difficult and the Chinese replacements aren’t good quality.” But he shrugs and laughs. There’s little choice but to make do. “GIRÓN: THE FIRST DEFEAT OF THE YANKEE IMPERIALISTS IN LATIN AMERICA” proclaims the sign at the side of the road as you drive into the town. Revolutionary hyperbole aside, it is basically true. Washington had never really lost a battle in Latin America until the bungled invasion at the Bay of Pigs, or Playa Girón, in 1961. For months, the CIA trained Cuban exiles in southern Florida and secret bases in Guatemala to prepare them for the invasion. On 15 April 1961, Douglas B-26 bombers with false flag markings attacked airfields outside Havana and in Santiago. 1961: Fighting during the unsuccessful US invasion at Bay of Pigs Then came the invasion from the sea. Some 1,400 men came ashore at Girón and two other nearby beaches. It was a debacle from the start, with instructions going awry and the counter-revolutionaries getting lost and entangled in the harsh mangroves along the coast. Fidel took control of the Cuban armed forces himself and, once Washington’s hand was revealed to be behind the attack, President John F Kennedy opted against sending in US air support. The invasion was crushed, Castro had won a crucial victory and the Kennedy administration suffered a humiliating defeat. Che Guevara would later send Kennedy a thank you note for the invasion saying: “The revolution was weak. Now it is stronger than ever.” The entire story, from a staunchly pro-revolutionary perspective of course, can be seen at a small museum in Playa Girón . There’s a smattering of American accents in the tour groups going round. But if they really want to hear the story of what happened that fateful week, they should probably leave the museum and find Dolores Fis. She lives nearby in a simple home with a cement floor, which remains surprisingly cool in Girón's swampy heat. One of her daughters lives next door and a nephew lives opposite. She welcomes me like an old relative - this isn’t the first time I’ve paid her a visit. Dolores is one of the few remaining residents who were in Girón during the 1961 invasion. Now 84, her stories are unique and spellbinding. An ordinary person tied up in a moment that pierced the national psyche, her life story a microcosm of Cuba’s revolution. I interviewed her shortly before President Obama visited Cuba in 2016. She retold the moment of the attack, of how she woke her husband whispering “they’re firing on the beach!” She was prepared to stay and fight but eventually her husband persuaded her and her sister-in-law to take the children and hide in the hills. They had to break into an abandoned house to grab what little food they could. But this time she talks about how Playa Girón has changed. “There used to be nothing here. But now I don’t know half of the homes because so many people have come from all over. From Oriente, from Camaguey, from Havana, from everywhere to live here.” That’s because there’s decent money to be made in the sleepy coastal village. As you drive into Girón, every other house has the distinctive blue-and-white symbol outside which denotes private accommodation where foreigners can stay. ‘Casas particulares’, as they are known in Cuba, have become one of the most popular private enterprises among ordinary Cubans. Although the government has frozen the issuing of new business licences for almost a year now, tourist accommodation remains the easiest way for many Cuban families to break into the private sector, and earn much more than their state wages without having to invest a fortune to covert their homes. Deynier Suarez, known as ‘Jimmy’, moved to Girón from the capital as the tourism boom in the area started to grow. He began as a chef in the state-run hotel near the beach but moved into the private sector when one of the most successful casa particulares in the town was looking for a manager. “Business has been OK this year, but down on the previous two”, he explains. He attributes the downturn to two factors: Hurricane Irma, which wrought devastation on parts of Cuba’s northern coast. It left the southern coastline basically untouched but Jimmy thinks the television images of the storm gave the impression of chaos across Cuba and put off people from visiting. Deynier “Jimmy” Suarez: Tourism has fallen because of Donald Trump The other factor, he says, was Donald Trump. “It’s been pretty noticeable”, he remarks of the stricter travel rules imposed by the Trump Administration following the warmer ties under the Obama presidency. “Very few Americans are coming, you hardly see them. And Europeans, well, we hope they keep coming. We’re not worried yet but it would help if Trump changed his decisions.” Beyond the revolutionary history, the average tourist comes to Girón  for birdwatching or diving, with the Cienaga de Zapata National Park offering some of the best ecotourism on the island. Just outside Girón is the Cueva de los Peces, a popular spot for diving and snorkelling. Our instructor, Rey, takes us out to the largely undamaged reef. A group of Canadians enjoy investigating a sunken boat. Two decades ago, Fidel essentially considered foreign tourists a necessary evil, a useful way of bringing in much-needed foreign currency. Today, however, tourism has been earmarked as the solution for the island’s economic future and the government hopes for even more visitors in the coming years. That has already brought some noticeable economic inequalities, a challenge the next president will have to bear in mind. There is a growing disconnection between Cubans who earn in the “convertible peso”, the currency used by most foreigners, and those who earn in the local “Cuban pesos”. Some of those who work in state-run enterprises of the tourism sector are keen to spread their wings and set up their own businesses. Privately-owned diving shops, for example, are currently prohibited under the strict economic rules. “There are a lot of us who are interested in going private,” insists Rey. “But things will stay the same for a while yet. This model suits the state.” As the sun goes down it casts long shadows across the beach at the Bay of Pigs. Groups of tourists lounge under the palm trees, sipping on cold beers or drinking Cuban rum out of coconut husks sold by the locals. Few looking on the scene can fail to reflect on the invasion of tourists - an obvious metaphor, but an accurate one. The question for the people of Girón is how much they will be allowed to harness it for their own ends. As Raúl was preparing to step down, Cuba held an election. Across the country, people dutifully turned out to cast their ballots for members of the national assembly. On 19 April those national assembly members chose Miguel Díaz-Canel, the vice-president, to replace Raúl as president. In turns painted as a moderniser and a stalwart hardliner, he is the first non-Castro to govern the island since 1959. Sounds straightforward enough. But in reality, on the ballots cast by Cuban voters there was exactly the same number of candidates as seats in parliament - 605. And, of course, under Cuba’s strict one-party system, no other choices of political colours were on offer. Last year, a number of dissidents and opposition figures attempted to stand as municipal candidates, including members of a group called Otro 18. They claim they were prevented from registering their nominations through repressive tactics by the police and state security officers. As I watched people vote, I was reminded of Raúl's comments in 2014. Barely five days after the historic agreement with President Obama to re-establish diplomatic ties, there was a genuine sense of expectation in the air. Addressing parliament, Raúl quickly referred to the changing relationship with Washington saying: “We shouldn't expect that in order for relations to improve with the United States, Cuba is renouncing the ideas for which we have fought for more than a century and for which our people have spilled so much blood and run such great risks.” The message was simple - political continuation. Open dissent or multi-party politics weren’t about to emerge in Cuba. They still aren’t. A decade ago, the state’s modus operandi against its opponents and dissidents was to give them long jail sentences. Today, that practice has largely ended. In its place is a system of control under which critics and independent journalists are frequently held under short-term arbitrary detentions. For its part, the Cuban government accuses those critics of being “mercenaries” in the pay of anti-Castro groups from Washington and Miami. Few can doubt that there were some on both sides of the Florida Straits who had their misgivings about improved relations between the US and Cuba. On the Miami side, the thaw was loudly decried by the standard-bearers for anti-Castro policy, in particular Florida Senator Marco Rubio. On the Cuban side too, there were plenty of ideologues who were uncomfortable with the sight of the US president visiting Havana, the old enemy now playing nice on Cuban soil. “I come to bury the remnants of the Cold War in the Americas,” said President Obama during his historic trip. He spoke of families - pulled apart by decades of hostility - being reunited amid a new spirit of friendship. “I just burst into tears,” one woman watching at home told me later. 2016: President Obama's visit to Cuba Fidel wrote an editorial warning of President Obama’s “honeyed words” and asking revolutionaries not to let their guard down. A number of hard-line elements in the government strongly agreed with him and wanted to push back against the growing tide of pro-Americanism on the island. Then, Donald Trump won the US presidency. In the hours following Fidel's death, President-elect Trump took to Twitter to mark the passing of, as he put it, a “brutal dictator” whose “legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights”. The stage was set for a return to hostility. That is where things remain today. The rapidly deteriorating relationship was then complicated further by a chapter straight out of a spy novel. More than 20 US diplomats in Havana began to suffer unexplained health problems, everything from hearing loss and nausea to mild concussion. The State Department claims its embassy staff had been the victims of so-called “health attacks” and blamed Cuba for failing to protect the diplomats, if not necessarily carrying out the alleged acts. Havana has denied any knowledge of the incidents and says the entire episode is a combination of cover story and mass hysteria. The intention was, they claimed, to undo the recent goodwill and justify a more hostile diplomatic and political relationship with the island. Either way, the US drew down its staff in Havana to a bare minimum and today relations could barely be further from the heady years of thaw during the Obama administration. This is the context in which Raúl's replacement takes over the reins. Does any of this matter to ordinary Cubans, like 92-year-old coffee grower Lérido, or Rey, the diving instructor who wants to open his own business? One could argue very little. Certainly the most committed revolutionaries continually insist that everything will be fine. That the Cuban Revolution is in safe hands and that, in essence, everything will carry on as before. It is undoubtedly true that no future government in Cuba would dare meddle with the key pillars of the revolution, especially the free healthcare and education or subsidies to the rural poor. But when you ask how Cuba will pay for it in when its close socialist ally, Venezuela, is on its knees economically or when Cuba’s export earnings are low, you’re generally met with a smile and a shrug of the shoulders. Few can provide specifics on how the island will face the next set of economic challenges. “We’ve been through worse. The collapse of the Soviet bloc and the ‘Special Period’,” one party official in Bayamo told me, referring to the economic hardships in Cuba of the 1990s. “If we can survive that, we can survive anything.” This is where the blind trust in the system comes in, where true revolutionaries place their unwavering faith in the revolution to provide a solution. Under Fidel and Raúl, it was enough for many people. But an older man I meet in the coastal town of Manzanillo, Pedro Rodríguez , his glasses held together with a sticking plaster, is evidently tired of such an approach. The port in the town is no longer vibrant, he complains, and the state-run enterprises are poorly run and inefficient. “No-one produces anything here any more,” the former accountant says with the resignation of a man who has seen the decades come and go. “People just wait for the ripe mangoes to fall.” A harsh assessment? Perhaps. Millions of Cubans face a daily struggle under trying circumstances to make ends meet. There’s still much that they are proud of - especially the social achievements under the Castros that many larger and wealthier countries struggle to reproduce. But as Cubans’ demands for improved living standards grow, the challenges for the state institutions - and the island’s new leadership - will increase with them.

Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 made an emergency landing in Philadelphia after a window, wings and fuselage were damaged. Seven passengers were injured. Initial findings say an engine fan blade was missing. In a recording, one of the pilots can be heard saying ""there is a hole and someone went out"". The last passenger death on a US commercial flight was in 2009. This video can not be played Video shows exploded plane engine The Boeing 737-700 had been en route from New York's La Guardia airport to Dallas, Texas, with 143 passengers and five crew when the incident happened. Witnesses say an engine on the plane's left side blew, smashing a window and causing cabin depressurisation that nearly sucked the woman out of the aircraft. She was pulled back in by other passengers. Jennifer Riordan was a mother-of-two and bank vice-president The plane made a safe landing at 11:20 (15:20 GMT), fire officials said. The victim was Jennifer Riordan, a mother-of-two and bank vice-president at Wells Fargo in Albuquerque, New Mexico,according to the Philadelphia Inquirer,external. In the air traffic control recording released by NBC News, pilot Tammie Jo Shults is heard saying: ""We have a part of the aircraft missing, so we're going to need to slow down a bit."" Asked if the plane is on fire, she says it is not but adds: ""They said there is a hole and someone went out."" Passenger images shows a broken window and oxygen masks deployed The former Navy pilot was at the controls when the plane landed. The US Federal Aviation Administration has opened an investigation. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said a preliminary investigation had revealed that an engine fan blade was missing and there was evidence of metal fatigue at the point where it had apparently broken off. Why do people grab their bags after a plane crash? 2017 was safest year for air travel Air disasters timeline NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said part of the cowling - the engine's covering - was found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles (112km) from Philadelphia. ""It is very unusual so we are taking this event extremely seriously,"" he said, adding that the investigation could take 12 to 15 months. Mr Sumwalt told reporters the type of engine, a CFM56, is ""very widely used in commercial transport"". Southwest Airlines said it was accelerating its inspection programme for CFM56 engines ""out of an abundance of caution"" and said inspections should be completed over the next 30 days.

"The aim Mr Pompeo's mission was to pave the way for a Trump-Kim summit CIA director Mike Pompeo forged a ""good relationship"" with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un when they met last week, US President Donald Trump has tweeted. Confirming media reports of the secret meeting in Pyongyang, Mr Trump said it had gone ""very smoothly"". The surprise visit marks the highest-level contact between the United States and North Korea since 2000. Mr Trump is expected to hold a summit with Mr Kim by June. Details are being worked out, the US president said. North Korea crisis in 300 words The political gamble of the 21st Century South Korea has also signalled that it may pursue a formal resolution of the longstanding conflict on the peninsula. President Moon Jae-in and Mr Kim are due to meet next week. The US president earlier gave his ""blessing"" for the talks between the South and North to discuss a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War. Mr Pompeo's trip took place after he was nominated by Mr Trump to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Very little is known about the talks other than that they were to prepare for the forthcoming Trump-Kim summit. Mr Pompeo is predicted to be confirmed as the top US diplomat by the Republican-controlled Senate in the coming weeks, although Democratic opposition to the conservative's candidacy is strong. Senator Robert Menendez, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said he did not think Mr Pompeo's ""past sentiments"" reflected American values. The hawkish CIA chief is known for his opposition to same-sex marriage and has made controversial remarks about Islam. Trump's loyalist new diplomat The US does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, although diplomats have visited in the past and so-called ""back channels"" are used to communicate with Pyongyang. Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? The last senior US official to meet a North Korean leader was Madeleine Albright, who was secretary of state when she travelled to Pyongyang for talks with Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader. This video can not be played Pompeo: 'Kim Jong-un continues to present risks to US' In 2014, the then-head of National Intelligence James Clapper visited North Korea in a secret mission to negotiate the release of two US citizens. Mr Clapper did not meet the North Korean leader. Mr Trump stunned the international community last month by accepting Pyongyang's suggestion for direct talks. It would be unprecedented for a sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader. He said the summit would take place either in early June or ""a little before that"" and that several sites were under consideration. Analysts have speculated that a location for talks could be the Demilitarised Zone between North and South Korea, another Asian country, or a neutral European country. North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its human rights abuses and pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws and UN sanctions. It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles that it says could reach the US. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics in February gave an unexpected window for diplomacy, and in the weeks since there have been a flurry of visits to the North from China, South Korea and now the US. North Korea's surge of friendly visitors The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit News of Mr Pompeo's visit is likely to overshadow delicate talks with Japan, a key US ally and neighbour of North Korea. This video can not be played Trump takes credit for the success of the Winter Olympics in South Korea There have been fears in Tokyo that Mr Trump's plans for bilateral talks could sideline Japan, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is currently in Florida for talks with the US leader. Relations between the two men appeared cordial on this, the second time that Mr Trump has welcomed Mr Abe to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Japan's worries about the Korean detente Mr Trump insisted on Tuesday that the two countries were ""very unified on the subject of North Korea"", and Mr Abe praised the US president's handling of the North Korea issue. However, observers say Mr Abe's goal for his US trip will be to persuade the US president as much as he can not to sway from the West's hard line on Pyongyang.

"This video can not be played Prince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive at Commonwealth Youth Forum in London. Meghan Markle has been hailed ""a great champion and ambassador for women"" as she visited the Commonwealth Youth Forum alongside Prince Harry. The couple, who will marry in Windsor on 19 May, met about 40 young leaders as part of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London. Karuna Rana, from Mauritius, told Ms Markle she should start her own women's rights campaign. Harry said Ms Markle was ""hugely excited"" to join him in his duties. Ms Rana said she asked the former actress to start up an equivalent to the UN's HeForShe campaign, which aims to get men and boys involved in the fight to achieve gender equality. ""I said she was a great champion and ambassador for women and that she should start a SheForShe campaign,"" Ms Rana said. ""She said she'd think about it - right after May 20th."" Prince Harry has been appointed a Commonwealth Youth Ambassador by the Queen, but it is unusual for someone not yet married into the Royal Family to be included in a high-profile summit like CHOGM. Referring to the Commonwealth, Ms Markle told some of the youth delegates: ""You have this umbrella to hold you together. ""It's incredible. Stay in touch - maximise it."" Australian delegate Jacob Thomas, who works with the Commonwealth Equalities Network on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, spoke to Ms Markle about LGBT rights and said: ""It's not just about love and sexuality. It's also about being here, supporting and recognising us for the benefit of all."" Earlier this week, Prime Minister Theresa May spoke of her ""regret"" at Britain's role in creating laws criminalising same-sex relationships while a colonial power. Mx Thomas said the couple praised the work of the equalities network, adding: ""Harry recognised that five years ago, 10 years ago, this would not have happened."" Royal Wedding: Republicans ask to protest 'peacefully' Windrush generation: Theresa May apologises to Caribbean leaders The Youth Forum aims to encourage young people to debate challenges facing their generation, and agree youth-led initiatives to help solve those challenges. Ms Markle and the prince will also attend a Women's Empowerment reception on Thursday, hosted by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. The event involves charities and organisations that work to promote global gender equality through girls' education. Heads of the 53 Commonwealth nations are also attending events in both London and Windsor as part of the CHOGM summit, which is staged every two years to discuss the major challenges facing the Commonwealth's 2.4 billion citizens.

"This video can not be played Alfie's father Tom Evans met Pope Francis at the Vatican The father of terminally ill toddler Alfie Evans has met Pope Francis, begging him to ""save our son"". Tom Evans has flown to Rome asking the Pope to intervene in the legal battle about ending 23-month-old Alfie's life support. It comes after the family lost the latest appeal for his treatment to continue at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. Mr Evans said: ""Your Holiness, save our son"" and asked for asylum for Alfie. Mr Evans, 21, and Kate James, 20, have so far had all appeals against aHigh Court rulingin February to withdraw his life support and take him to Rome for treatment rejected. Alfie has an undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition The Court of Appeal dismissed a fresh appeal by the couple on Monday and they haveapplied to the Supreme Courtto consider their case. Mr Evans posted on Facebook: ""Last night I jumped on a plane and come to Vatican Rome to meet the Pope. ""Alfie we will do everything for you."" Who is Alfie Evans? Alfie parents appeal to Supreme Court Court rules against Alfie parents again He met with the Pope before his general audience when he highlighted Alfie's plight and asked the crowd to pray for him. Vatican Newsreported,externalPope Francis said ""it is our duty to do all that is possible to safeguard life"" during his address. He said cases like Alfie's were ""very painful and complex"" and asked that ""every sick person may always be respected in their dignity and cared for in an appropriate way for their condition... and with great respect for life."" Earlier this month the Popetweeted support for the sick toddlerand called for all sides to work together for what is best for Alfie. Andrea Williams, from the Christian Legal Centre which is representing Alfie's family, confirmed Mr Evans had asked the Pope for asylum for his son during the meeting at the Vatican. ""When every avenue has been shut down in this country it shows he won't give up. ""He wants his son to be given a chance to live which is being denied when there are places prepared to look after him.""

It added recent criticism of Alder Hey hospital was ""unfounded"". Tom Evans and Kate James want to take Alfie to Rome The Supreme Court whichrefused to consider the parents case in Marchsaid it was examining the latest application to overrule Monday's Court of Appeal decision. The Court of Appeal judges explained theydismissed the latest challenge because it was the same legal argument,external- albeit with a different legal term - they made in February and March and moving him to a hospital in Italy was ""contrary to his best interests"". The judges said: ""The application of a different legal label... does not change the fact that the court has already determined the issues which the parents now seek, again, to advance. ""Their views, their rights do not take precedence and do not give them an 'unfettered right' to make choices and exercise rights on behalf of Alfie."" The judges said Alfie was not being ""detained"" in hospital or ""deprived of his liberty... the doctrine of habeas corpus."" Alder Hey Children's Hospital has said continuing to treat Alfie, who has an undiagnosed degenerative neurological condition, was ""inhumane"" and ""futile"".

"Prices for clothing and footwear, in particular womenswear, rose at a slower rate UK consumer price inflation fell in March to 2.5%, the lowest rate in a year, according to the Office for National Statistics. It fell from 2.7% in February after prices for women's clothing rose at a slower pace than last year. The data appears to show that the squeeze on UK households may be coming to an end as wages rise. Despite the inflation fall, economists still expect the Bank of England to raise interest rates in May. According to the most recent figures, UK wages rose by 2.8% in February. The Bank is forecast to lift the interest rate to 0.75% from 0.5% next month. Is the incomes squeeze coming to an end? Leggings in and pork pies out of latest inflation basket Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that while he expected the Bank to proceed with the increase, he believes the Monetary Policy Committee will move slowly. He said: ""Wage growth remains surprisingly lacklustre in the face of such low levels of unemployment, though it is now heading in the right direction, and the recent political shift on public sector pay suggests there's some more momentum in the post. ""While an interest rate rise now looks odds on in May, the Bank will still be wary of moving too fast and too soon, so beyond that monetary policy is still likely to move at a slovenly pace."" The pound fell by 0.74% against the dollar to $1.4183. The ONS said the biggest downward contribution to inflation came from clothing and footwear, mainly women's clothing. Prices rose by 0.7% between February and March 2018 compared with a 2% increase between the same months last year. Alcohol and tobacco also helped ease inflation pressures. ONS head of inflation Mike Hardie said the new autumn Budget means tobacco duty rises no longer appear in March. Economists had been expecting the consumer prices index to be 2.7%, the same as last time. It came in at 2.5%. Yet in the City, the probability that traders put on an interest rate rise next month barely shifted - from 90% to 80%. The currency markets reacted a little more strongly - marking the pound down by about a cent against both the euro and the dollar. The reason is simple: the Bank of England appears determined to raise the official rate next month to 0.75% - not so much to tame this relatively mild inflation, as to normalise interest rates. That way, when the next downturn comes, there'll at least be some room to cut them again. Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe, said the inflation figure ""will be a spanner in the works for the Bank of England"". He points out that the ""pace and breadth"" of the fall in inflation during March means it could fall below the Bank of England's 2% target earlier than expected. He said: ""Investors are still treating a May rate hike as a done deal, after the Bank of England just about spelled it out in a confident series of statements and inflation projections that may now be revised. ""[Governor Mark] Carney risks once again being labelled an ""unreliable boyfriend"" should the Bank of England hold fire in May or even August.""

Scott Taunton, CEO of TalkSport owner Wireless Group, said winning the rights was ""a great victory"" for the station. ""I'm delighted that we will be with England fans for every ball of the day throughout these winter tours,"" he added. The free to air rights cover the Tests, one-day internationals (ODIs) and T20s for the tours that start in Sri Lanka in October and the West Indies in early 2019. Test Match Special will, however, continue to broadcast England's home summer series through to 2024. A deal agreed last year will also see domestic and international cricket shown live on BBC television from 2020. ""Aggers"" said he hoped he could ""still provide news coverage"" about the tours Many cricket fans have reacted with dismay to Agnew's retweet of TalkSport's announcement, with one calling it ""a national disgrace"". ""This is literally the worst thing I have ever read on Twitter,"" wrote another. Yet some fans have been more moderate, with one calling on listeners to ""give TS [TalkSport] a chance before passing judgement."" In his own post, Aggers, as he's known, stressed the decision was made by the Sri Lankan and West Indies cricket boards and not the ECB (England and Wales Cricket Board). TalkSport's cricket coup follows News Corp's 2016 purchase of its parent companyin a Â£220m deal. In a statement, the BBC said: ""We put forward a competitive bid for these tours but it was unsuccessful on this occasion. ""We're disappointed because we know how much cricket fans value our coverage. We are still the home of cricket on the radio, as we demonstrated during the Ashes last winter. ""This summer, all England's matches will be live on Test Match Special, and we have a long term deal for all England's home internationals through to 2024 as well as rights to the next three Ashes series, both home and away."" The ECB declined to comment on the decision. England's Joe Root during a recent Test Match against New Zealand For devotees of Test Match Special - an international club comprising hundreds of thousands of people, if not more - the sound of Jonathan Agnew and his colleagues isn't just part of summer.

"Around three million EU residents will have the right to remain in the UK after Brexit European nationals must not face a ""bureaucratic nightmare"" to stay in the UK after Brexit, a top MEP has said. Guy Verhofstadt told the European Parliament the three million or so EU residents in the UK must be able to secure their future rights easily. ""After the Windrush scandal, we want to be sure that the same is not happening to our European citizens,"" he said. Ministers said the system would be ""user-friendly"" and forms would not be rejected on minor technicalities. The UK and EU have reached agreement on residents' rights after the UK leaves the EU, although this will only apply if an overarching withdrawal deal is agreed. All EU nationals who arrive before Brexit day - 29 March, 2019 - and also during a transition period lasting up to the end of 2020, will have the right to remain, as will their family members. However, they will have to apply for settled status or temporary permission to stay. Live: MEPs debate in European Parliament Rudd facing call to quit over Windrush Brexit: What now for EU citizens in the UK? Ministers have said there will be a presumption in favour of this being granted in nearly all cases and unlike the previous process of applying for permanent residency, which involved filling out an 85 page document, there will only be a small amount of paperwork involved. But questions have already been raised about the Home Office's ability to process so many applications in a relatively short period of time. And, during a debate in Strasbourg, MEPs drew attention to the ongoing Windrush deportations row in the UK - in which the children of Caribbean migrants who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s but have no formal documentation, face uncertainty over their future as a result of recent changes in immigration rules. Guy Verhofstadt, who leads the Liberal ALDE group and is also the Parliament's chief Brexit spokesman, has already expressed concerns that EU nationals could face ""similar treatment"". Analysis by the BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason Former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt says he remains to be convinced The EU - and the European Parliament in particular - has always been sceptical about the ability of the Home Office to handle the registration of more than three million people in a timely and efficient way. Revelations about the ordeal facing many Windrush migrants was bound to increase that sense of concern. There has been concerted pressure from other European capitals to ensure that the registration process will be as simple as possible; now there may well be renewed attention on how legal guarantees given to EU citizens will be upheld after Brexit. Spare a thought too, though, for the one million or so British citizens elsewhere in the EU who still have no idea what kind of registration system may be applied to them. He and other MEPs are due to meet Home Office officials next week to talk through the details of the UK's proposed registration system. ""We need to have citizens' rights completed,"" he said. ""If there are changes needed, we will communicate that to the negotiators what modifications are needed to avoid real problems for our EU citizens."" The BBC's Europe reporter Adam Fleming said he understood the Windrush situation was raised during a meeting of the European Parliament's Brexit Steering Group attended by chief negotiator Michael Barnier. Ministers say the registration system for EU nationals will be up and running in the second half of the year and will remain open until 30 June 2021, giving people plenty of time to complete the forms. Applicants will need to provide an ""identity document"" and recent photograph and, to minimise the need for supporting evidence, data such as employment records held by the HM Revenue and Customs will be used. Officials say applicants will not have to account for every foreign trip they have taken while living in the country. ""Every EU citizen resident in the UK on the day the transition period ends in December 2020 will be eligible for some form of leave to remain, subject to criminality checks,"" said a Home Office spokesman. ""We have committed to ensuring that applications will not be refused on minor technicalities and that caseworkers processing applications will exercise discretion in favour of the applicant where appropriate."" Unlike other applicants, existing permanent residents will not to have to pay a fee to re-apply nor have to supply fresh evidence they are still living in the UK.

"This video can not be played Darryll Rowe told one of his victims 'I got you. Burn, you have it' A man who said he was ""riddled"" with HIV and convicted of trying to infect 10 men has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 12 years. Daryll Rowe, 27, infected five men he had unprotected sex with and sabotaged the condoms of another five in Brighton and Northumberland. He is the first man in the country to be found guilty of intentionally setting out to spread the virus. His crimes were branded a ""determined hateful campaign of sly violence"". After being diagnosed in April 2015, Rowe met men on the gay dating app Grindr and had sex with eight of them in Brighton between October that year and February 2016, before fleeing to the north east where he went on the run from police, targeting two more men. He sent mocking messages after sex with some of the men, including ""I have HIV LOL. Oops"" and ""I'm riddled"". Darryll Rowe was branded as a ""sociopath"" by one victim Sentencing Rowe at Brighton Crown Court, Judge Christine Henson QC said: ""The messages you sent make it crystal clear you knew exactly what you were doing. ""As well as the physical offences it is clear for the victims the psychological effects are immense. ""They describe living with a life sentence as a result of your cruel and senseless acts. Many of those men were young men in their 20s at the time they had the misfortune to meet you. ""I cannot see how and when you will no longer be a danger to gay men."" She added: ""I note that this sentence is not about stigmatising anyone living with HIV."" Rowe, from Brighton, was convicted of five counts of causing grievous bodily harm (GBH) and five of attempted GBH. During his six-week trial, one man said he felt ""pressured"" into having sex with the hairdresser. Another victim branded Rowe as ""grotesque"" and a ""sociopath"". Ahead of sentencing, prosecutor Caroline Carberry QC read out statements from nine of his 10 victims, which she said showed the ""devastating consequences"" of his actions. Many told how they had considered suicide having suffered physical and psychological damage and needed to take daily medication. One said: ""Darryl has destroyed my life. I would rather he had murdered me than left me to live my life like this."" Another said he found condoms with the tops cut off in the bin, and that it had been ""a horrendous chapter"" in his life. A Tyneside man who was in a relationship with Rowe while he was on bail, but was not infected, told BBC Look North: ""If you have a dog, and that dog has rabies, and it bites someone, you'd put it down ""That is exactly how I think about him now. ""I think he doesn't deserve to be paid for by the taxpayer for the rest of his life."" Describing his behaviour as ""predatory"", Judge Henson said Rowe had ""emotionally unstable personality traits"" but there was insufficient evidence to diagnose a personality disorder. Det Insp Andy Wolstenholme, of Sussex Police, said the sentence was ""hugely important for Rowe's victims, and the communities that he deliberately targeted"". ""Daryll Rowe was consistent in lying to his victims about having HIV, he was persistent and aggressive in wanting unprotected sex in order to infect people, and when he didn't get what he wanted, he deliberately damaged condoms to achieve his aim,"" he said.

"The BBC coverage of a police search at Sir Cliff Richard's Berkshire home allowed ""conspiracy theorists and online trolls to have a field day"", the singer's privacy case has been told. Solicitor Gideon Benaim said the South Yorkshire Police inquiry into alleged historical sexual assault would have been shorter than 22 months if the BBC had not reported the way it did. Sir Cliff was not arrested or charged. The BBC says it reported on a story of ""legitimate public interest"". Case 'likely to have huge impact' Coverage 'invasion of privacy' Sir Cliff felt violated by BBC - Hunniford Giving evidence on the fifth day of the case, Mr Benaim told the High Court the singer's lawyers did their best to ""mitigate the damage"" caused by the BBC coverage. He told the court he believed the broadcaster's report of the raid in Sunningdale - which featured shots taken from a helicopter of officers searching the property - caused ""online chatter"" about Sir Cliff and prompted people to make up ""spurious allegations"". ""I believe it was as a direct result of the publicity generated by the BBC that various people came out of the woodwork, and those allegations came to nothing eventually,"" he said. He added that lawyers from his firm Simkins had become involved in taking action against a potential blackmailer who contacted a newspaper with his claims. In his witness statement to the court, Mr Benaim said about 13,000 emails were exchanged in total ""which highlights the sheer volume of work that this firm undertook for (Sir Cliff) during the period"". Mr Benaim said: ""We worked throughout the period alongside Sir Cliff's PR advisers, which is an entirely normal practice and indeed necessary in crisis situations, which is clearly what Sir Cliff found himself in due to the BBC's actions."" The BBC's barrister, Gavin Millar QC, took Mr Benaim through legal fees run up by Sir Cliff. Mr Millar questioned whether certain costs, such as a bill for advice about travelling to the US during the period, were a consequence of the police investigation rather than the BBC's coverage. Sir Cliff, 77, says he suffered ""profound and long-lasting damage"" and is suing the BBC over the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. Lawyers for the BBC says its coverage of the search was accurate and in good faith and journalists had respected Sir Cliff's ""presumption of innocence"". The judge, Mr Justice Mr Justice Mann, heard Sir Cliff's public relations representative Phil Hall had a conversation with the BBC nearly two hours before the story was first broadcast on the News at One. In his witness statement, Mr Hall said there had been no mention of ""helicopters"" or ""quasi-rolling coverage"" and the BBC representative said she did not know whether Sir Cliff would be named. He said it appeared ""there wasn't any great urgency about it because they were prepared to give me some time to prepare a statement"". Giving evidence, Mr Hall denied the BBC's assertion it told him the police search of Sir Cliff's property was in connection with an allegation of a sexual nature. He said he ""would've been straight to the lawyers... talking about an intrusive situation"" had he known a helicopter was being used by the BBC. BBC reporter Dan Johnson, who broke the story about the South Yorkshire Police investigation, is scheduled to give evidence in the afternoon.

"This video can not be played Barbara Bush, matriarch of US political dynasty, dies at 92 Barbara Bush, the former US first lady and literacy campaigner, has died at the age of 92. She was the matriarchal figure of a political dynasty that included two presidents - her husband George HW Bush and son George W Bush. Mrs Bush, who was first lady from 1989 to 1993, had been in failing health for some time and had declined further medical treatment. Tributes to her poured in from across the US political establishment. Her husband, at 93, is the longest-lived US president. Their son, George, was elected in 2000 and served two terms as the nation's 43rd president. Barbara Bush, political matriarch and literacy campaigner Tributes from across US politics and society He said in a statement: ""My dear mother has passed on at age 92. Laura, Barbara, Jenna, and I are sad, but our souls are settled because we know hers was. Barbara Bush was a fabulous First Lady and a woman unlike any other who brought levity, love, and literacy to millions."" Mrs Bush pictured with her son in 2005 Mr Bush said his mother had ""kept us on our toes and kept us laughing until the end"", adding: ""I'm a lucky man that Barbara Bush was my mother. Our family will miss her dearly, and we thank you all for your prayers and good wishes."" A statement from the office of her husband described her as a ""relentless proponent of family literacy"". Mrs Bush was also the mother of Jeb Bush, who served as governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007 and unsuccessfully ran for the White House in 2016. As first lady, Mrs Bush went beyond the traditional role of a political spouse, founding the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy to help parents and children from disadvantaged communities to read and write. She was a fierce advocate of civil rights and went against many of her husband's Republican party supporters with her more liberal view on abortion rights. In a statement from the White House, President Donald Trump said Mrs Bush would be long remembered for her devotion to country and family, ""both of which she served unfailingly well"". George HW Bush and Barbara Bush were married for 73 years Barack and Michelle Obama described her as ""the rock of a family dedicated to public service"" and as ""an example of the humility and decency that reflects the very best of the American spirit"". Another former US president, Bill Clinton, said Mrs Bush was ""feisty in support of her family and friends, her country and her causes"". He said he and Hillary Clinton would ""never forget the courtesy she and President Bush showed us"". Mrs Bush was known for her snow-white hair and was dubbed ""The Silver Fox"" by her family. She once dismissed speculation that she had influenced her husband during his time in the White House, saying: ""I don't fool around with his office and he doesn't fool around with my household."" As first lady, Barbara Bush met leaders from around the world Mrs Bush also sparked a debate on gender equality in 1990 with an address to the all-women Wellesley College. She told graduates: ""Who knows, somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the president's spouse and I wish him well."" George HW Bush, who served as the 41st US president, suffers from a form of Parkinson's disease and uses a wheelchair. Barbara Bush often brought humour to an occasion, such as here in a photoshoot with celebrities It was recently announced that Mrs Bush had declined further medical treatment after a series of hospital visits, but the statement did not reveal the nature of her ailments. She said she wanted to spend her last days in ""comfort care"" with her family. Mrs Bush was born Barbara Pierce, the daughter of Marvin Pierce, publisher of McCall's magazine. She grew up in Rye, New York. Bush presidents wade into Trump furore She met her future husband in 1941 at a Christmas party in Connecticut and the couple celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary in January this year. They had six children including a daughter, Robin, who died of leukaemia aged three in 1953. As well as George and Jeb, the other Bush children are Neil, Marvin and Dorothy. Mrs Bush was one of only two women whose husband and son became US president, and the only one to have seen them both sworn in. Abigail Adams was married to the second US president, John Adams, and was the mother of the sixth, John Quincy Adams, although she did not live to see their son elected.

"The Margaret River Pro was due to conclude on Sunday A major surfing tournament in Australia has been called off following two shark attacks in the area. The World Surf League (WSL) said the final days of the Margaret River Pro event in Western Australia would be cancelled due to safety concerns. On Monday, two recreational surfers survived separate attacks in Gracetown, about 6km (3.8 miles) from the event. The first man was treated for serious leg injuries. The second man suffered a minor bite to his thigh. The event had been suspended for an hour after the first attack on Monday. But organisers said ""actively aggressive sharks"" remained in the area on Wednesday, possibly due to the presence of nearby beached whales. ""Current circumstances are very unusual and troubling, and we have decided that the elevated risk during this season's Margaret River Pro has crossed the threshold for what is acceptable,"" chief executive Sophie Goldschmidt said. ""The WSL puts the highest premium on safety. This cannot be just talk, and it cannot be compromised."" Some competitors, including Brazilian Italo Ferreira, had expressed concerns about returning to the water. ""Two shark attacks in less than 24 hours here in Australia, just a few kilometres from where the event is being held,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""Very dangerous, don't you think? Is the safety of athletes not priority?"" Another Brazilian surfer, Gabriel Medina, wrote: ""I do not feel safe training and competing in this kind of place, any time anything can happen to one of us."" Medina endured a shark scare during a competition in South Africa last year when he and Australian surfer Mick Fanning had to be removed from the water. Surfer Mick Fanning in another shark scare How do you stop sharks attacking? Drones used to protect swimmers The first man to be attacked on Monday, Alejandro Travaglini, underwent surgery after being mauled by what he said was a white pointer shark, also known as a great white. Mr Travaglini, 37, had managed to escape the shark and bodysurf back to shore with the help of other surfers. ""I just want to thank all the legends who helped me up the beach,"" he said after his surgery. The second man was attacked a few hours after Mr Travaglini at a nearby beach, despite it being closed by authorities. He was treated by paramedics for minor injuries.

"Mr Pompeo's mission reportedly was to prepare for the Trump-Kim summit CIA director Mike Pompeo travelled to Pyongyang for a secret meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, US President Donald Trump has confirmed. A ""good relationship"" was formed at the meeting last week, Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday. News of the visit first emerged on Tuesday. US officials were quoted as saying the aim was to prepare a summit between Mr Trump and Mr Kim. Mr Trump had earlier alluded to high-level direct talks with Pyongyang. But the unexpected and clandestine meeting marks the highest level US contact with North Korea since 2000. ""We have had direct talks at... extremely high levels,"" Mr Trump said from Florida, where he is hosting Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The president added that he gave his ""blessing"" for talks between the South and North to discuss a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War. North Korea crisis in 300 words The political gamble of the 21st Century South Korea has also signalled that it may pursue a formal resolution of the conflict. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in and Mr Kim are due to meet next week. The two sides have agreed to broadcast parts of the summit live, the South's state news agency Yonhap reported. The news that Mr Pompeo had travelled to North Korea fora clandestine meeting with Mr Kim,externalwas first reported by The Washington Post. The trip took place shortly after Mr Pompeo was nominated by Mr Trump to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, two anonymous sources ""with direct knowledge of the trip"" told the newspaper. Later Reuters news agency said the report had been confirmed to them by senior officials. Early on Wednesday, Mr Trump confirmed the reports with a tweet. Allow Twitter content?

Very little is known about the talks other than that they were to prepare for the forthcoming Trump-Kim summit. Mr Pompeo is predicted to be confirmed as the top US diplomat by the Republican-controlled Senate in coming weeks. This is despite mounting speculation that he will, unusually, fail to receive the backing of the bipartisan Senate Foreign Relations Committee followinga grilling of more than five hoursby the committee last week. The US does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, although diplomats have visited in the past and there are some so-called ""back channels"" used to communicate with Pyongyang. Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? Mr Pompeo's trip was the highest level meeting with a North Korean leader since 2000 when then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader, in Pyongyang. This video can not be played Trump takes credit for the success of the Winter Olympics in South Korea In 2014, the then-head of National Intelligence James Clapper visited North Korea in a secret mission to negotiate the release of two US citizens. Mr Clapper did not meet the North Korean leader during his trip. Mr Trump stunned the international community last month by accepting Pyongyang's suggestion for direct talks. It would be unprecedented for a sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader. He said the summit would take place either in early June or ""a little before that"" and that several sites were under consideration but that none of them were in the US. Analysts have speculated that a location for talks could be the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea, Beijing, another Asian country, Europe or even a vessel in international waters. North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws and UN sanctions. It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles that it says could reach the US. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics in February gave an unexpected window for diplomacy, and in the weeks since there have been a flurry of visits to the North from China, South Korea and now the US. North Korea's surge of friendly visitors The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit Mr Trump's estimate that a meeting could take place in June or earlier appears to be one the administration is taking seriously. But news of Mr Pompeo's visit is also likely to overshadow delicate talks with Japan, a key US ally and neighbour of North Korea. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders (left) was on hand for the meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Abe There have been fears in Tokyo that Mr Trump's plans for bilateral talks could sideline Japan, and Mr Abe is currently in Florida for talks with the US leader. Relations between the two men appeared cordial on this, the second time that Mr Trump has welcomed Mr Abe to his Mar-a-Lago resort. Japan's worries about the Korean detente Mr Trump insisted on Tuesday that the two countries were ""very unified on the subject of North Korea"", and Mr Abe praised the US president's handling of the North Korea issue. However, observers say Mr Abe's goal for his US trip will be to persuade the US president as much as he can not to sway from the West's hard line on Pyongyang. The Japanese prime minister has repeatedly sought to portray a close personal relationship with Mr Trump and was the first foreign leader to meet him in New York after his election victory in 2016.

"Transport questions at start of day Business statement next Backbench debates on surgical mesh and cancer treatment Lords questions at 11am Lords debate on national security Richard Morris, Esther Webber and Alex Partridge HMT Empire Windrush docked in Essex in 1948, carrying passengers from the Caribbean to the UK. End of the week House of CommonsParliament After a frantic start to the week, with two emergency debates, the Commons has been altogether quieter today. Transport questions kicked off the day with questions on HS2 and train ticketing, as well as aviation and Brexit. The Leader of the House outlined upcoming business for the Commons next week. Then there have been two backbench debates on surgical mesh and cancer treatments. Baroness Jowell, pictured, sat in the Commons for the debate on cancer treatment. The Commons sits again on Monday at 2:30pm, starting with Defence questions and then the second reading of the Rating and Council Tax Bill. House of LordsParliament The House of Lords has adjourned for the day. Peers return at 2:30pm on Monday for oral questions, followed by the second day of report stage on the EU Withdrawal Bill. Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Health Minister Steve Brine says that today's debate is something which he ""will remember for a long time"". He says that as the ""current minister for cancer"", he was ""captivated"" by Baroness Jowell's speech, made to the House of Lords in January. He says that people affected by cancer ""are never just"" a cancer, in the case of Baroness Jowell she is still a mum and campaigner. ""We shouldn't underestimate what a difficult challenge brain cancer is,"" he says he is ""impatient and determined"" to ""fighting the big C"". He believes ""that this challenge is one we can overcome"". He says that funding for new research into brain tumours is now open to bids from Monday of this week. ""Due to the rarity of these many types of brain tumours it is vital we use this patient data more effectively,"" he says. The UK must start sharing patient data on brain tumours much more effectively, ""for the common good, not for the almighty shilling"". National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Addressing the airstrikes on Syrian government sites by the US, UK and France last weekend Defence Minister Earl Howe says consulting Parliament beforehand would have ""weakened our operational security"" by potentially revealing targets for a strike. He adds that the attacks were a ""limited, targeted, effective strike"" and were ""not about intervening in a civil war"". A cross-party group of MPs aims to increase pressure for a Brexit customs union deal. What does the government defeat in the House of Lords on amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill mean - and what more is to come? Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, says she lost her mother-in-law 21 years ago to breast cancer, which inspired her to join the All-Party Parliamentary Group on breast cancer. ""Tessa's optimism and and ambition has affected us all over the years,"" she says, ""today is not about politics, but patients,"" she adds, quoting Baroness Jowell. ""Cancer is not about politics,"" she says ""in the future, we can put our politics aside...to truly fight cancer together"". Brain tumours are the most common killers of adults under the age of 40 in the UK, and the most common killer of children, she says. She welcomes the announcement of Â£45m of funding for brain cancer research which the government announced in February. But the research community on brain tumors is ""fragmented"" and there are ""no clear hubs for excellence"". National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Defence Minister Earl Howe is winding up today's debate. He says the debate has emphasised some of the ""big themes"" of the current international situation, both the ""depth and breadth of the threats that we face is different"" as well as the ""range of threats from state powers, not just terrorists and insurgents"". He goes on to address Syria, where he says the government believes a ""negotiated settlement"" is the ""only appropriate outcome"". He also chides Russia for engaging in what he calls ""greyzone conflict"" using methods that ""strive to stay below our range of response"" but ""can be very serious"", including cyber attacks. Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Tulip Siddiq says ""it was Tessa who was fundamental in bringing the Olympics to London"", saying that it was Baroness Jowell who said that the Olympics would tell London to ""celebrate our diversity"". ""A cancer friends initiative could also bring profound benefits"" for cancer patients, which she says would help some sufferers in trying to find stem cell matches, for example. Only 60% of sufferers receive a ""best match"" in stem cell operations, and in the BAME community, this is much lower, she says. She says Baroness Jowell is a ""model of"" ""resilience"", ""optimism"" and a ""politician"". Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Rachel Maclean says that this debate highlights that ""we really do have more in common,"" she says that cancer's ""dark logic spares nobody"". She says that cancer has been around since 4600BC, but lived in silence until 440BC, when a slave ""recalled removing a tumour from his mistress's breast"". She says that her local NHS Trust is ""failing to meet"" their cancer statistics, and says that the health secretary first said that her Trust was one of the worst performing when she was elected. ""Breast cancer patients are now benefiting from a drastically reduced waiting time,"" thanks to simpler tests, she says. Tests are now done in house, reducing the time in waiting for results, she adds. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Glasman spent five days in Syria during the parliamentary recess, as a guest of the authorities who run the Kurdish segment of northern Syria, alongside the Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle. He says Western policy in Syria has laboured under a ""delusion"" that there is some sort of ""moderate Sunni Arab force"" the UK could ally with against Assad. But he says the Kurds exist as a ""third force"" in Syria ""that isn't Assad and isn't ISIS"", but they have been ""betrayed"". Kurdish forces have benefitted from western military support during the Syrian civil war. He says he wants to ask the minister ""whose side are we on in this? Why are we not being much more resolute in supporting our allies who have fought with consitently? Why have we stood back?"" A month ago forces backed by Turkey, a member of NATO, took the city of Afrin from mainly Kurdish forces defending it. Turkey claims it was fighting ""terrorists"". Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Former Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, who himself recently went through a procedure to remove a tumour in his lung, says ""fundamentally, a profound message of hope"" shone through from Baroness Jowell's words. He says that many speeches on cancer in Parliament can become ""sterile"" and just focus on statistics and funding. He says that Baroness Jowell's speech, focusing on ""a life well led"" broke through many typical speeches on the matter. Brain tumours are the biggest preventable cause of blindness in children, he states. There needs to be a better ""join up"" between hospitals and clinical trials. He says he ""warmly"" welcomes the announcement from the government of Â£45m of additional funding for brain tumour research from the government in conjunction with Cancer Research UK. He adds that he recently gave permission for his own tumour sample to be used for further research, in the hope that it will help others. Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Sarah Jones opens this debate on cancer treatments in the UK. She says that her father died of cancer last June, three days after she was elected to the Commons. No-one in the chamber is not ""touched by cancer,"" she adds. She pays tribute to her former boss, Baroness Jowell, who is currently undergoing treatment for an aggressive and difficult to treat form of brain cancer. Only 2% of funding for research goes to study brain tumours, she says. Baroness Jowell has ""thrown herself into her campaign"" to help people who have cancer live longer, she says. As a woman ""who walks through walls"" in her campaigns, ""you could almost feel sorry for cancer,"" she jokes. She says the UK needs to radically transform both clinical trials and data sharing because ""no vital drugs have been approved for 50 years"" in brain tumour treatments and uptake of clinical trials in brain tumour patients are low. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, says on Syria the British government has made ""a real error"" because we ""hate and loathe"" Assad. He says he'd ""love a regime change to something nice"" but ""look at the opposition...my goodness me, some of them are worse than Daesh"" he says, referring to another term for the ISIS group. He says UK policy in Syria is ""a real worry and we need to think that through"". Surgical mesh debate House of CommonsParliament Jackie Doyle-Price, Health Minister, thanks everyone who has contributed their personal stories in this debate. ""It is very important that the NHS does do its best to actually make life better for those women,"" she adds, and asks MPs to contact her directly with individual cases where the NHS may not be responding to cases well. She says that NHS guidance is ""clear"" that mesh ""should not be offered as a first intervention"". The guidance will be published later this year, and completed next year, she says. ""The acceptable level of risk will differ from patient to patient,"" she says, in how doctors consider recommending this course of treatment. The government has introduced a review to look into cases and to hear from individuals, she says. Surgical mesh debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow Health Minister, Sharon Hodgson, says the stories shared by constituents with their MPs, which have been retold in the Commons this afternoon, are ""distressing"". She says that her 74-year old mother, who has been ""back and forth to the doctors"" in the past four years, has also had a procedure done to her. ""It hadn't even occured to her"" that there was a connection between the procedure she'd gone through and the symptoms she was now receiving. She says her mother is now on the ""long road"" to some reversal surgery if it is possible. ""She trusted the medical profession to do her no harm,"" she says ""but my mam is lucky, she recognises that"". She says that her symptoms have not been as bad as other people's experiences. She says that Labour are urging NICE to update the guidelines immediately before they are next due to be reviewed in 2019-20. If this was a tumble dryer which was causing harm to people in 10-15% of people, it would be recalled, she adds. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Conservative Baroness Helic says action in Syria ""must go well beyond surgical strikes"" and there needs to be a ""comprehensive strategy"" for ending the war. She says the world must fight the use of chemical weapons, and that the ""ultimate deterrent would be the sight of Syrian leaders in the dock"" at a future war crimes tribunal. She says she wants a guarantee from the minister that the UK ""will not support a peace process that includes amnesty for war crimes in Syria"", listing chemical weapons, sieges, starvation, barrel bombs, attacks on hospitals and systematic use of rape and sexual violence as crimes carried out during the seven year long Syrian Civil War. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Lord Hennessy of Nympsfield, best known for his work as a military historian, says the operation last weekend in Syria was the first test of ""Chilcot compliant"" policy making. The Chilcot report into the 2003 Iraq War suggested a ""checklist"" to aid military decision making. He says that the strikes on Syria should have been the first UK operation to be carried out using the checklist,which encourages decision makers to ask why action is proposed, what the UK knows about the situation and what the legal status of the proposed action is,external. He says he's sought answers from ministers about the use of the checklist but has not had any. ""Perhaps surprisingly"", he adds, the checklist is ""silent"" on the question of Parliamentary involvement. It may only be symbolic, but those forcing a customs union vote in the Commons hope it will add to pressure for a policy change. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Barbara Bush, matriarch of US political dynasty, dies at 92 Barbara Bush, the former US first lady and literacy campaigner, has died at the age of 92. She was the matriarchal figure of a political dynasty that included two presidents - her husband George HW Bush and son George W Bush. Mrs Bush, who was first lady from 1989 to 1993, had been in failing health for some time and had declined further medical treatment. Tributes to her poured in from across the US political establishment. Her husband, at 93, is the longest-lived US president. Their son, George, was elected in 2000 and served two terms as the nation's 43rd president. Barbara Bush, political matriarch and literacy campaigner Tributes from across US politics and society He said in a statement: ""My dear mother has passed on at age 92. Laura, Barbara, Jenna, and I are sad, but our souls are settled because we know hers was. Barbara Bush was a fabulous First Lady and a woman unlike any other who brought levity, love, and literacy to millions."" Mrs Bush pictured with her son in 2005 Mr Bush said his mother had ""kept us on our toes and kept us laughing until the end"", adding: ""I'm a lucky man that Barbara Bush was my mother. Our family will miss her dearly, and we thank you all for your prayers and good wishes."" A statement from the office of her husband described her as a ""relentless proponent of family literacy"". Mrs Bush was also the mother of Jeb Bush, who served as governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007 and unsuccessfully ran for the White House in 2016. As first lady, Mrs Bush went beyond the traditional role of a political spouse, founding the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy to help parents and children from disadvantaged communities to read and write. She was a fierce advocate of civil rights and went against many of her husband's Republican party supporters with her more liberal view on abortion rights. In a statement from the White House, President Donald Trump said Mrs Bush would be long remembered for her devotion to country and family, ""both of which she served unfailingly well"". George HW Bush and Barbara Bush were married for 73 years Barack and Michelle Obama described her as ""the rock of a family dedicated to public service"" and as ""an example of the humility and decency that reflects the very best of the American spirit"". Another former US president, Bill Clinton, said Mrs Bush was ""feisty in support of her family and friends, her country and her causes"". He said he and Hillary Clinton would ""never forget the courtesy she and President Bush showed us"". Mrs Bush was known for her snow-white hair and was dubbed ""The Silver Fox"" by her family. She once dismissed speculation that she had influenced her husband during his time in the White House, saying: ""I don't fool around with his office and he doesn't fool around with my household."" As first lady, Barbara Bush met leaders from around the world Mrs Bush also sparked a debate on gender equality in 1990 with an address to the all-women Wellesley College. She told graduates: ""Who knows, somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the president's spouse and I wish him well."" George HW Bush, who served as the 41st US president, suffers from a form of Parkinson's disease and uses a wheelchair. Barbara Bush often brought humour to an occasion, such as here in a photoshoot with celebrities It was recently announced that Mrs Bush had declined further medical treatment after a series of hospital visits, but the statement did not reveal the nature of her ailments. She said she wanted to spend her last days in ""comfort care"" with her family. Mrs Bush was born Barbara Pierce, the daughter of Marvin Pierce, publisher of McCall's magazine. She grew up in Rye, New York. Bush presidents wade into Trump furore She met her future husband in 1941 at a Christmas party in Connecticut and the couple celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary in January this year. They had six children including a daughter, Robin, who died of leukaemia aged three in 1953. As well as George and Jeb, the other Bush children are Neil, Marvin and Dorothy. Mrs Bush was one of only two women whose husband and son became US president, and the only one to have seen them both sworn in. Abigail Adams was married to the second US president, John Adams, and was the mother of the sixth, John Quincy Adams, although she did not live to see their son elected.

"This video can not be played Explained: What is the 'hostile environment' policy? Some members of the so-called Windrush generation, who arrived in the UK decades ago as children, have been incorrectly identified as illegal immigrants. Here are some of their stories. The case of Albert Thompson - not his real name - has become the focus of much coverage during the current row. The 63-year-old is not technically of the Windrush generation as he arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1973 as a teenager. Buthis case was brought to light,externalafter he was told he would have to pay Â£54,000 for prostate cancer treatment unless he could produce the right documentation. ""I was less than two weeks away from my treatment. That was really upsetting,"" he told the BBC. ""I get to the Royal Marsden and they gave me this form to fill out where they want to see passport or visa, benefits letter and bank statement. ""At the end of the day, I don't have those things to show so I've got to pay Â£54,000, which I haven't got."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has raised Mr Thompson's struggles at Prime Minister's Questions, first in March and again on Wednesday, when he accused Theresa May of declining to help him. The prime minister insisted the Home Office has been in contact with Mr Thompson's representatives, and said his NHS treatment should never have been withheld. Who are the Windrush generation? In Pictures: The Windrush generation Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? But Mr Thompson said he first heard that he would receive treatment on the TV news. ""It makes me feel a bit better but not really completely. When I get the treatment - then I'll be over the moon,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Royal Marsden Hospital in London said it had been committed to resolving Mr Thompson's eligibility for further NHS treatment with his legal advisers. They added that his cancer specialist has contacted Mr Thompson to assess him in clinic for his next stage of treatment. In response, Jeremy Bloom, Mr Thompson's lawyer, said his client had been told radiotherapy treatment would only go ahead if he paid in advance or proved he had indefinite leave to remain. The Royal Marsden disputes this. Paulette Wilson, here alongside her daughter Natalie, spent time at an immigration detention centre Paulette Wilson came to Britain from Jamaica aged 10 in the late 1960s. Now 61, she said she was confused when she received a letter saying she was in the country illegally. ""I just didn't understand it and I kept it away from my daughter for about two weeks, walking around in a daze thinking 'why am I illegal?'"" Her daughter Natalie Barnes booked an appointment with the Home Office and was told her mother had six months to leave the country. Ms Wilson then spent two years with the threat of deportation hanging over her, includinga week at Yarl's Wood immigration removal centre, which she describes as ""a nightmare"". Windrush peers attack 'incompetent' Home Office How do you prove you've been living in the UK? Her MP and a local charity intervened to prevent her removal, and she has since been given a biometric residence permit which proves she can stay in the country. ""It's not ended because I've just got a card saying I have a right to stay in England - I still have to renew it in 2024,"" she said. Ms Wilson welcomed the government's apology, but asked: ""What about all the other people who were sent away before my case became big? ""It's just upsetting to think that an ordinary person like me could go through something like that. I'm still going through hell at the moment."" This video can not be played Winston Walker has lived in the UK since he was 18 months old Winston Walker arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1966 aged 18 months, on his father's passport. ""I'm as British as anyone,"" said the 53-year-old, who grew up in Birmingham and now lives in Bristol. He ran into difficulty in 2008 when applying for a provisional driving licence. ""I kept sending documents to the DVLA and they kept on sending it back,"" he told the BBC. Mr Walker later contacted an MP to help, after which he said he was told he did not ""exist on any data in this country"". ""It was frightening. I've been schooled here - had the same National Insurance number since I was 16... To be told you don't exist, it's overwhelming."" Mr Walker was able to get a resident's permit but that does not make him a British citizen. He said he wanted a British passport, but found it ""insulting"" that it would cost him ""about Â£1,500"". ""My grandmother would be turning in her grave to find out the way her offspring had been treated,"" he added.

""Sixty years, it's a long time. I'm an Englishman,"" he told BBC Newsnight. In 2009, Mr Green tried to update his passport with the proper visa information, but was told by the Home Office he had to prove he had lived in the UK for each of the previous 10 years. His application was rejected twice. In March last year, Mr Green travelled to Jamaica to be with his dying mother, but when he tried to return to the UK in June, he was not allowed on the flight. ""I was upset - virtually in tears. I couldn't understand why,"" he said. Months passed and Mr Green's mother was repatriated to the UK, but her son was unable to return to attend her funeral. He finally came back to the UK in September, after his local MP intervened. This video can not be played Windrush migrant Nick Broderick: 'I contemplated suicide' Nick Broderick, who came to the UK as a baby in 1962, has been fighting for the past four years to prove his legal status. He was working for a recruitment company in Dunstable when his office was subject to an immigration check. ""I wrote to the Jamaican embassy, I sent Â£70 to get a birth certificate. That didn't happen 3 or 4 times... So they gave me these papers to fill out and after I filled it out, they said to me 'I'm sorry, we seem to have lost the papers that you sent in and so now you're going to be deported',"" he told Radio 4's Today programme. In the months that followed, Mr Broderick had to report to the police station every month, could not work or use his driving licence. He said he knows others, in a similar position, who have been seriously ill with cancer and denied NHS treatment. ""It was an awful, awful time"" which sent him ""into a spiral of depression"", he said. ""I always thought myself as being English. I just want to have a normal life again,"" Nick added. Whitfield Francis - here with his eldest daughter Maria - came to England with his parents at the age of nine Whitfield Francis was born in Jamaica in 1958 and came to England with his parents at the age of nine. He only realised there was an issue over his right to remain in the UK when he tried to change jobs four years ago and was unable to provide proof of his status - something he didn't have - and he hasn't been able to work since. The father-of-four says he can't afford to pay for a biometric residence permit or for legal assistance. ""No-one has given me any help,"" the 59-year-old said. ""If I haven't got these certain documents, my children could be affected. They may not be eligible for a British passport although they were born in Britain."" His former partner Helen Cappasso says the situation ""nearly destroyed him"" and being unable to provide for their four children has ""broken his heart"". ""I cannot express here what a nightmare it's been, and it's not over yet,"" she said. Mr Francis, who is currently ""sofa surfing"" in Birmingham as he is unable to rent somewhere to live, said the government's pledge to help those affected has given him renewed hope that he would finally be able to work again. Sonia Williams says she doesn't accept the government's apology Sonia Williams, who came to the UK from Barbados in 1975, aged 13, has been fighting to prove she is British for four years. She was made redundant in 2014, and lost her driving licence in 2016. ""I can't drive, I can't work, I can't claims benefits, I can't do anything,"" she said. ""Sometimes I just want to give up. ""My mum's got citizenship, my dad had right to remain. So I just presumed I had all that, because I was leaving Barbados to come and live with my family. I wasn't just coming on holiday."" May apologises to Caribbean leaders Have you been affected? She said she feels ""stressed"" and ""numb"", and doesn't accept the government's apology. ""I'm not working, I can't claim benefits, so where am I going to get this money to apply for these things that they're asking me for?"" The Home Office said it would get in touch with Ms Williams. Londoner Katrice, 18, and her mother are both unable to get British passports The impact has not only been felt by the Windrush generation, but many of their children as well. Katrice Louis, whose mother, now 59, came to England from St Lucia aged 8, was born and raised in London but is unable to get a British passport. The 18-year-old says she only found out she wasn't classed as a British citizen when her mother tried to get passports for a family holiday in 2005. Two of Katrice's older siblings, born in the 1980s, have British passports, but Katrice and two of her other sisters, born in the 1990s, are unable to get one. ""The only option we have been given is to spend thousands of pounds to apply for citizenship and a passport which we cannot afford,"" she said. ""I have never understood how I have been born and raised here, but still not classed as a British citizen and been stripped of my identity. I have been denied a job. ""I have been living in fear of being deported to a country I have never even seen."" Tanya Simms, from Sheffield, was born in the UK in 1990. Her grandparents came to the UK from Jamaica in the 1960s and settled in Reading, Berkshire. They were granted British citizenship in the late 1960s and Tanya's mother joined them in the UK in 1975. Last year Tanya applied for a passport so she could go on her friend's hen do but was turned down on the grounds that neither of her parents were settled at the time of her birth. ""I cried my heart out when I got the letter,"" she said. ""It hurts. I've put into the system, I've been educated here, paid national insurance here."" She fears for the future: ""Where would they send me and my daughter? I've never been to Jamaica. What are they going to do? Just stick me in the sea?""

"The Windrush generation are named after the Empire Windrush ship which brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948 As in every walk of life, mistakes happen in politics and policy. And mistakes can happen by accident, sometimes out of negligence, or sometimes because no-one could quite have imagined the consequences of actions that they decided to take. But what's unravelled in the last few days - where the government has been embarrassed, and the prime minister herself had to say sorry about how people whose home is Britain have been treated - is more than just a series of coincidental errors. Dozens of new Windrush cases investigated 'A nightmare, and it's not over yet' Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? The home secretary and the prime minister herself have now both apologised for the Windrush fiasco. Without question a big part of the problem has been how the Home Office has applied the policy that was set by ministers. Incompetence is an occasional feature of any enormous government department. It's not exactly unheard of for the Home Office to be not quite up to its enormous task. In fact, almost any MP will tell you about the kind of delays and frustrations they hear from some of their constituents about the Home Office's handling of immigration cases, affecting all sorts of different nationalities. But officials respond to and operate within the policies, and the climate set by their political masters. And to understand what's gone here it's worth remembering that the rules that now seem overly draconian and unnecessarily burdensome were conceived in a particular political climate. In the days of the coalition, the government's target of getting net immigration down to below 100,000 seemed pretty much unachievable. But the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, had told voters in 2010 that he would cut immigration or deserve to be kicked out. He was determined to stick to the aim, despite a myriad of warnings that it was unrealistic and misleading to suggest the government had any hope of hitting it. Theresa May was the politician charged with trying to meet what seemed an impossible goal. This video can not be played Theresa May's Windrush apology to Caribbean leaders The hunt was then on, under her leadership at the Home Office, to try to find every single possible way that could cut the levels of immigration, whether cracking down on people coming here illegally, or dealing with the problem of over-staying - where people came to the UK to study or work on time-limited visas but stayed. Of course, neither of those categories relate to the Windrush generation, but they meant that slowly but surely government policy towards anyone whose status might be unclear or undocumented became tighter and tighter. And the extent of action to try to monitor immigration extended into more areas of government activity. The rhetoric got tougher and tougher too, with David Cameron even warning illegal immigrants in 2014: ""When we find you, and we will find you, we'll make sure you are sent back to the country you came from."" At times it felt then the two main parties were in a bidding war over who could sound tougher on immigration. There was unease, particularly on the Labour side, but the political wind certainly blew towards a tougher and tougher approach. One of Nick Clegg's former advisers, Polly McKenzie, revealed online tonight how in 2012 it seemed inside government that part of the Home Office's effort to crack down on immigration was to make ""it systematically difficult to get by without papers"". This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK This was of course an effort to cut the numbers of people who were here illegally. But over time, that meant people who had every right to stay in Britain, in their home, came under pressure too. Some of the ideas were resisted. We revealed in 2016 that the now prime minister had even wanted at one stage toput the children of illegal immigrantsat the bottom of the list for school places, but push back in Cabinet stopped that idea. But it's clear that for years, there was a huge focus in government on looking for ways of cutting the levels of immigration. And it's the drive to achieve that, not just administrative mistakes in the Home Office, that is now revealed to have caused such anxiety for so many people. The Windrush fiasco is in part a by-product of a wider political trend that pushed policy over many years. The government promises now that the personal injustices it's caused will come to an end - whether it calls time on the wider culture is a different question.

"This video can not be played Barbara Bush, matriarch of US political dynasty, dies at 92 Barbara Bush, the former US first lady and literacy campaigner, has died at the age of 92. She was the matriarchal figure of a political dynasty that included two presidents - her husband George HW Bush and son George W Bush. Mrs Bush, who was first lady from 1989 to 1993, had been in failing health for some time and had declined further medical treatment. Tributes to her poured in from across the US political establishment. Her husband, at 93, is the longest-lived US president. Their son, George, was elected in 2000 and served two terms as the nation's 43rd president. Barbara Bush, political matriarch and literacy campaigner Tributes from across US politics and society He said in a statement: ""My dear mother has passed on at age 92. Laura, Barbara, Jenna, and I are sad, but our souls are settled because we know hers was. Barbara Bush was a fabulous First Lady and a woman unlike any other who brought levity, love, and literacy to millions."" Mrs Bush pictured with her son in 2005 Mr Bush said his mother had ""kept us on our toes and kept us laughing until the end"", adding: ""I'm a lucky man that Barbara Bush was my mother. Our family will miss her dearly, and we thank you all for your prayers and good wishes."" A statement from the office of her husband described her as a ""relentless proponent of family literacy"". Mrs Bush was also the mother of Jeb Bush, who served as governor of Florida from 1999 to 2007 and unsuccessfully ran for the White House in 2016. As first lady, Mrs Bush went beyond the traditional role of a political spouse, founding the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy to help parents and children from disadvantaged communities to read and write. She was a fierce advocate of civil rights and went against many of her husband's Republican party supporters with her more liberal view on abortion rights. In a statement from the White House, President Donald Trump said Mrs Bush would be long remembered for her devotion to country and family, ""both of which she served unfailingly well"". George HW Bush and Barbara Bush were married for 73 years Barack and Michelle Obama described her as ""the rock of a family dedicated to public service"" and as ""an example of the humility and decency that reflects the very best of the American spirit"". Another former US president, Bill Clinton, said Mrs Bush was ""feisty in support of her family and friends, her country and her causes"". He said he and Hillary Clinton would ""never forget the courtesy she and President Bush showed us"". Mrs Bush was known for her snow-white hair and was dubbed ""The Silver Fox"" by her family. She once dismissed speculation that she had influenced her husband during his time in the White House, saying: ""I don't fool around with his office and he doesn't fool around with my household."" As first lady, Barbara Bush met leaders from around the world Mrs Bush also sparked a debate on gender equality in 1990 with an address to the all-women Wellesley College. She told graduates: ""Who knows, somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the president's spouse and I wish him well."" George HW Bush, who served as the 41st US president, suffers from a form of Parkinson's disease and uses a wheelchair. Barbara Bush often brought humour to an occasion, such as here in a photoshoot with celebrities It was recently announced that Mrs Bush had declined further medical treatment after a series of hospital visits, but the statement did not reveal the nature of her ailments. She said she wanted to spend her last days in ""comfort care"" with her family. Mrs Bush was born Barbara Pierce, the daughter of Marvin Pierce, publisher of McCall's magazine. She grew up in Rye, New York. Bush presidents wade into Trump furore She met her future husband in 1941 at a Christmas party in Connecticut and the couple celebrated their 73rd wedding anniversary in January this year. They had six children including a daughter, Robin, who died of leukaemia aged three in 1953. As well as George and Jeb, the other Bush children are Neil, Marvin and Dorothy. Mrs Bush was one of only two women whose husband and son became US president, and the only one to have seen them both sworn in. Abigail Adams was married to the second US president, John Adams, and was the mother of the sixth, John Quincy Adams, although she did not live to see their son elected.

"Transport questions at start of day Business statement next Backbench debates on surgical mesh and cancer treatment Lords questions at 11am Lords debate on national security Richard Morris, Esther Webber and Alex Partridge HMT Empire Windrush docked in Essex in 1948, carrying passengers from the Caribbean to the UK. End of the week House of CommonsParliament After a frantic start to the week, with two emergency debates, the Commons has been altogether quieter today. Transport questions kicked off the day with questions on HS2 and train ticketing, as well as aviation and Brexit. The Leader of the House outlined upcoming business for the Commons next week. Then there have been two backbench debates on surgical mesh and cancer treatments. Baroness Jowell, pictured, sat in the Commons for the debate on cancer treatment. The Commons sits again on Monday at 2:30pm, starting with Defence questions and then the second reading of the Rating and Council Tax Bill. House of LordsParliament The House of Lords has adjourned for the day. Peers return at 2:30pm on Monday for oral questions, followed by the second day of report stage on the EU Withdrawal Bill. Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Health Minister Steve Brine says that today's debate is something which he ""will remember for a long time"". He says that as the ""current minister for cancer"", he was ""captivated"" by Baroness Jowell's speech, made to the House of Lords in January. He says that people affected by cancer ""are never just"" a cancer, in the case of Baroness Jowell she is still a mum and campaigner. ""We shouldn't underestimate what a difficult challenge brain cancer is,"" he says he is ""impatient and determined"" to ""fighting the big C"". He believes ""that this challenge is one we can overcome"". He says that funding for new research into brain tumours is now open to bids from Monday of this week. ""Due to the rarity of these many types of brain tumours it is vital we use this patient data more effectively,"" he says. The UK must start sharing patient data on brain tumours much more effectively, ""for the common good, not for the almighty shilling"". National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Addressing the airstrikes on Syrian government sites by the US, UK and France last weekend Defence Minister Earl Howe says consulting Parliament beforehand would have ""weakened our operational security"" by potentially revealing targets for a strike. He adds that the attacks were a ""limited, targeted, effective strike"" and were ""not about intervening in a civil war"". A cross-party group of MPs aims to increase pressure for a Brexit customs union deal. What does the government defeat in the House of Lords on amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill mean - and what more is to come? Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, says she lost her mother-in-law 21 years ago to breast cancer, which inspired her to join the All-Party Parliamentary Group on breast cancer. ""Tessa's optimism and and ambition has affected us all over the years,"" she says, ""today is not about politics, but patients,"" she adds, quoting Baroness Jowell. ""Cancer is not about politics,"" she says ""in the future, we can put our politics aside...to truly fight cancer together"". Brain tumours are the most common killers of adults under the age of 40 in the UK, and the most common killer of children, she says. She welcomes the announcement of Â£45m of funding for brain cancer research which the government announced in February. But the research community on brain tumors is ""fragmented"" and there are ""no clear hubs for excellence"". National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Defence Minister Earl Howe is winding up today's debate. He says the debate has emphasised some of the ""big themes"" of the current international situation, both the ""depth and breadth of the threats that we face is different"" as well as the ""range of threats from state powers, not just terrorists and insurgents"". He goes on to address Syria, where he says the government believes a ""negotiated settlement"" is the ""only appropriate outcome"". He also chides Russia for engaging in what he calls ""greyzone conflict"" using methods that ""strive to stay below our range of response"" but ""can be very serious"", including cyber attacks. Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Tulip Siddiq says ""it was Tessa who was fundamental in bringing the Olympics to London"", saying that it was Baroness Jowell who said that the Olympics would tell London to ""celebrate our diversity"". ""A cancer friends initiative could also bring profound benefits"" for cancer patients, which she says would help some sufferers in trying to find stem cell matches, for example. Only 60% of sufferers receive a ""best match"" in stem cell operations, and in the BAME community, this is much lower, she says. She says Baroness Jowell is a ""model of"" ""resilience"", ""optimism"" and a ""politician"". Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Rachel Maclean says that this debate highlights that ""we really do have more in common,"" she says that cancer's ""dark logic spares nobody"". She says that cancer has been around since 4600BC, but lived in silence until 440BC, when a slave ""recalled removing a tumour from his mistress's breast"". She says that her local NHS Trust is ""failing to meet"" their cancer statistics, and says that the health secretary first said that her Trust was one of the worst performing when she was elected. ""Breast cancer patients are now benefiting from a drastically reduced waiting time,"" thanks to simpler tests, she says. Tests are now done in house, reducing the time in waiting for results, she adds. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Glasman spent five days in Syria during the parliamentary recess, as a guest of the authorities who run the Kurdish segment of northern Syria, alongside the Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle. He says Western policy in Syria has laboured under a ""delusion"" that there is some sort of ""moderate Sunni Arab force"" the UK could ally with against Assad. But he says the Kurds exist as a ""third force"" in Syria ""that isn't Assad and isn't ISIS"", but they have been ""betrayed"". Kurdish forces have benefitted from western military support during the Syrian civil war. He says he wants to ask the minister ""whose side are we on in this? Why are we not being much more resolute in supporting our allies who have fought with consitently? Why have we stood back?"" A month ago forces backed by Turkey, a member of NATO, took the city of Afrin from mainly Kurdish forces defending it. Turkey claims it was fighting ""terrorists"". Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Former Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, who himself recently went through a procedure to remove a tumour in his lung, says ""fundamentally, a profound message of hope"" shone through from Baroness Jowell's words. He says that many speeches on cancer in Parliament can become ""sterile"" and just focus on statistics and funding. He says that Baroness Jowell's speech, focusing on ""a life well led"" broke through many typical speeches on the matter. Brain tumours are the biggest preventable cause of blindness in children, he states. There needs to be a better ""join up"" between hospitals and clinical trials. He says he ""warmly"" welcomes the announcement from the government of Â£45m of additional funding for brain tumour research from the government in conjunction with Cancer Research UK. He adds that he recently gave permission for his own tumour sample to be used for further research, in the hope that it will help others. Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Sarah Jones opens this debate on cancer treatments in the UK. She says that her father died of cancer last June, three days after she was elected to the Commons. No-one in the chamber is not ""touched by cancer,"" she adds. She pays tribute to her former boss, Baroness Jowell, who is currently undergoing treatment for an aggressive and difficult to treat form of brain cancer. Only 2% of funding for research goes to study brain tumours, she says. Baroness Jowell has ""thrown herself into her campaign"" to help people who have cancer live longer, she says. As a woman ""who walks through walls"" in her campaigns, ""you could almost feel sorry for cancer,"" she jokes. She says the UK needs to radically transform both clinical trials and data sharing because ""no vital drugs have been approved for 50 years"" in brain tumour treatments and uptake of clinical trials in brain tumour patients are low. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, says on Syria the British government has made ""a real error"" because we ""hate and loathe"" Assad. He says he'd ""love a regime change to something nice"" but ""look at the opposition...my goodness me, some of them are worse than Daesh"" he says, referring to another term for the ISIS group. He says UK policy in Syria is ""a real worry and we need to think that through"". Surgical mesh debate House of CommonsParliament Jackie Doyle-Price, Health Minister, thanks everyone who has contributed their personal stories in this debate. ""It is very important that the NHS does do its best to actually make life better for those women,"" she adds, and asks MPs to contact her directly with individual cases where the NHS may not be responding to cases well. She says that NHS guidance is ""clear"" that mesh ""should not be offered as a first intervention"". The guidance will be published later this year, and completed next year, she says. ""The acceptable level of risk will differ from patient to patient,"" she says, in how doctors consider recommending this course of treatment. The government has introduced a review to look into cases and to hear from individuals, she says. Surgical mesh debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow Health Minister, Sharon Hodgson, says the stories shared by constituents with their MPs, which have been retold in the Commons this afternoon, are ""distressing"". She says that her 74-year old mother, who has been ""back and forth to the doctors"" in the past four years, has also had a procedure done to her. ""It hadn't even occured to her"" that there was a connection between the procedure she'd gone through and the symptoms she was now receiving. She says her mother is now on the ""long road"" to some reversal surgery if it is possible. ""She trusted the medical profession to do her no harm,"" she says ""but my mam is lucky, she recognises that"". She says that her symptoms have not been as bad as other people's experiences. She says that Labour are urging NICE to update the guidelines immediately before they are next due to be reviewed in 2019-20. If this was a tumble dryer which was causing harm to people in 10-15% of people, it would be recalled, she adds. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Conservative Baroness Helic says action in Syria ""must go well beyond surgical strikes"" and there needs to be a ""comprehensive strategy"" for ending the war. She says the world must fight the use of chemical weapons, and that the ""ultimate deterrent would be the sight of Syrian leaders in the dock"" at a future war crimes tribunal. She says she wants a guarantee from the minister that the UK ""will not support a peace process that includes amnesty for war crimes in Syria"", listing chemical weapons, sieges, starvation, barrel bombs, attacks on hospitals and systematic use of rape and sexual violence as crimes carried out during the seven year long Syrian Civil War. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Lord Hennessy of Nympsfield, best known for his work as a military historian, says the operation last weekend in Syria was the first test of ""Chilcot compliant"" policy making. The Chilcot report into the 2003 Iraq War suggested a ""checklist"" to aid military decision making. He says that the strikes on Syria should have been the first UK operation to be carried out using the checklist,which encourages decision makers to ask why action is proposed, what the UK knows about the situation and what the legal status of the proposed action is,external. He says he's sought answers from ministers about the use of the checklist but has not had any. ""Perhaps surprisingly"", he adds, the checklist is ""silent"" on the question of Parliamentary involvement. It may only be symbolic, but those forcing a customs union vote in the Commons hope it will add to pressure for a policy change. Â© 2025 BBC.

Brain tumours are the most common killers of adults under the age of 40 in the UK, and the most common killer of children, she says. She welcomes the announcement of Â£45m of funding for brain cancer research which the government announced in February. But the research community on brain tumors is ""fragmented"" and there are ""no clear hubs for excellence"". National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Defence Minister Earl Howe is winding up today's debate. He says the debate has emphasised some of the ""big themes"" of the current international situation, both the ""depth and breadth of the threats that we face is different"" as well as the ""range of threats from state powers, not just terrorists and insurgents"". He goes on to address Syria, where he says the government believes a ""negotiated settlement"" is the ""only appropriate outcome"". He also chides Russia for engaging in what he calls ""greyzone conflict"" using methods that ""strive to stay below our range of response"" but ""can be very serious"", including cyber attacks. Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Tulip Siddiq says ""it was Tessa who was fundamental in bringing the Olympics to London"", saying that it was Baroness Jowell who said that the Olympics would tell London to ""celebrate our diversity"". ""A cancer friends initiative could also bring profound benefits"" for cancer patients, which she says would help some sufferers in trying to find stem cell matches, for example. Only 60% of sufferers receive a ""best match"" in stem cell operations, and in the BAME community, this is much lower, she says. She says Baroness Jowell is a ""model of"" ""resilience"", ""optimism"" and a ""politician"". Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Rachel Maclean says that this debate highlights that ""we really do have more in common,"" she says that cancer's ""dark logic spares nobody"". She says that cancer has been around since 4600BC, but lived in silence until 440BC, when a slave ""recalled removing a tumour from his mistress's breast"". She says that her local NHS Trust is ""failing to meet"" their cancer statistics, and says that the health secretary first said that her Trust was one of the worst performing when she was elected. ""Breast cancer patients are now benefiting from a drastically reduced waiting time,"" thanks to simpler tests, she says. Tests are now done in house, reducing the time in waiting for results, she adds. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Glasman spent five days in Syria during the parliamentary recess, as a guest of the authorities who run the Kurdish segment of northern Syria, alongside the Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle. He says Western policy in Syria has laboured under a ""delusion"" that there is some sort of ""moderate Sunni Arab force"" the UK could ally with against Assad. But he says the Kurds exist as a ""third force"" in Syria ""that isn't Assad and isn't ISIS"", but they have been ""betrayed"". Kurdish forces have benefitted from western military support during the Syrian civil war. He says he wants to ask the minister ""whose side are we on in this? Why are we not being much more resolute in supporting our allies who have fought with consitently? Why have we stood back?"" A month ago forces backed by Turkey, a member of NATO, took the city of Afrin from mainly Kurdish forces defending it. Turkey claims it was fighting ""terrorists"". Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Former Northern Ireland secretary, James Brokenshire, who himself recently went through a procedure to remove a tumour in his lung, says ""fundamentally, a profound message of hope"" shone through from Baroness Jowell's words. He says that many speeches on cancer in Parliament can become ""sterile"" and just focus on statistics and funding. He says that Baroness Jowell's speech, focusing on ""a life well led"" broke through many typical speeches on the matter. Brain tumours are the biggest preventable cause of blindness in children, he states. There needs to be a better ""join up"" between hospitals and clinical trials. He says he ""warmly"" welcomes the announcement from the government of Â£45m of additional funding for brain tumour research from the government in conjunction with Cancer Research UK. He adds that he recently gave permission for his own tumour sample to be used for further research, in the hope that it will help others. Cancer treatment debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Sarah Jones opens this debate on cancer treatments in the UK. She says that her father died of cancer last June, three days after she was elected to the Commons. No-one in the chamber is not ""touched by cancer,"" she adds. She pays tribute to her former boss, Baroness Jowell, who is currently undergoing treatment for an aggressive and difficult to treat form of brain cancer. Only 2% of funding for research goes to study brain tumours, she says. Baroness Jowell has ""thrown herself into her campaign"" to help people who have cancer live longer, she says. As a woman ""who walks through walls"" in her campaigns, ""you could almost feel sorry for cancer,"" she jokes. She says the UK needs to radically transform both clinical trials and data sharing because ""no vital drugs have been approved for 50 years"" in brain tumour treatments and uptake of clinical trials in brain tumour patients are low. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, says on Syria the British government has made ""a real error"" because we ""hate and loathe"" Assad. He says he'd ""love a regime change to something nice"" but ""look at the opposition...my goodness me, some of them are worse than Daesh"" he says, referring to another term for the ISIS group. He says UK policy in Syria is ""a real worry and we need to think that through"". Surgical mesh debate House of CommonsParliament Jackie Doyle-Price, Health Minister, thanks everyone who has contributed their personal stories in this debate. ""It is very important that the NHS does do its best to actually make life better for those women,"" she adds, and asks MPs to contact her directly with individual cases where the NHS may not be responding to cases well. She says that NHS guidance is ""clear"" that mesh ""should not be offered as a first intervention"". The guidance will be published later this year, and completed next year, she says. ""The acceptable level of risk will differ from patient to patient,"" she says, in how doctors consider recommending this course of treatment. The government has introduced a review to look into cases and to hear from individuals, she says. Surgical mesh debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow Health Minister, Sharon Hodgson, says the stories shared by constituents with their MPs, which have been retold in the Commons this afternoon, are ""distressing"". She says that her 74-year old mother, who has been ""back and forth to the doctors"" in the past four years, has also had a procedure done to her. ""It hadn't even occured to her"" that there was a connection between the procedure she'd gone through and the symptoms she was now receiving. She says her mother is now on the ""long road"" to some reversal surgery if it is possible. ""She trusted the medical profession to do her no harm,"" she says ""but my mam is lucky, she recognises that"". She says that her symptoms have not been as bad as other people's experiences. She says that Labour are urging NICE to update the guidelines immediately before they are next due to be reviewed in 2019-20. If this was a tumble dryer which was causing harm to people in 10-15% of people, it would be recalled, she adds. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Conservative Baroness Helic says action in Syria ""must go well beyond surgical strikes"" and there needs to be a ""comprehensive strategy"" for ending the war. She says the world must fight the use of chemical weapons, and that the ""ultimate deterrent would be the sight of Syrian leaders in the dock"" at a future war crimes tribunal. She says she wants a guarantee from the minister that the UK ""will not support a peace process that includes amnesty for war crimes in Syria"", listing chemical weapons, sieges, starvation, barrel bombs, attacks on hospitals and systematic use of rape and sexual violence as crimes carried out during the seven year long Syrian Civil War. National security situation debate House of LordsParliament Lord Hennessy of Nympsfield, best known for his work as a military historian, says the operation last weekend in Syria was the first test of ""Chilcot compliant"" policy making. The Chilcot report into the 2003 Iraq War suggested a ""checklist"" to aid military decision making. He says that the strikes on Syria should have been the first UK operation to be carried out using the checklist,which encourages decision makers to ask why action is proposed, what the UK knows about the situation and what the legal status of the proposed action is,external. He says he's sought answers from ministers about the use of the checklist but has not had any. ""Perhaps surprisingly"", he adds, the checklist is ""silent"" on the question of Parliamentary involvement. It may only be symbolic, but those forcing a customs union vote in the Commons hope it will add to pressure for a policy change. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Facebook says its face-matching tech is a way for users to learn if they are in a photo even if not tagged Facebook has started asking European and Canadian users to let it use facial recognition technology to identify them in photos and videos. Facebook originally began face-matching users outside Canada in 2011, but stopped doing so for EU citizens the following year after protests from regulators and privacy campaigners. The new request is one of several opt-in permissions being rolled out in advance of a new data privacy law. The move is likely to be controversial. The company is currently embroiled in a privacy scandal related to the use of its members' personal information by thepolitical consultancy Cambridge Analytica. The social network is also facing aclass-action lawsuit in the USfor deploying the facial recognition technology there without users' explicit consent. ""Biometric identification and tracking across the billions of photos on the platform exacerbates serious privacy risks to users,"" commented Silkie Carlo, director of UK civil liberties group Big Brother Watch. ""Facebook now has a duty to prove it has learned how to respect the law, not to prove it can take its surveillance capabilities to new depths."" Facebook facial recognition faces class-action suit Will technology destroy our democracy? University saw 'no issue' with Facebook research Users outside the EU and Canada will be prompted to review a similar set of privacy controls in the coming months, but they will continue to be subject to facial recognition unless they opt out of the system. Thefacial recognition facility works,externalby assigning each user a unique number called a template. This is calculated by analysing the way they look in their profile photograph and other images they have already been identified in. Untagged faces are then represented in a similar manner and compared to the database of templates. When a match is found, Facebook prompts both the person posting an image and the people appearing in it to apply the relevant name tags. In addition, it uses the tech to detect when a scammer is attempting to use a stolen photo as their profile picture. It also helps Facebook to offer new ""friends"" suggestions. When new connections are made, users have more reason to spend longer on Facebook's app and website. This lets the firm show them more adverts while also helping it learn more about their interests, which in turn lets it better target future ads. The new settings are being deployed ahead of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force on 25 May. The law tightens existing privacy rules, forbids the use of pre-ticked boxes for consent, and increases the amount organisations can be fined for non-compliance. Users can either agree to face recognition with a single button press or click through other pages to be given the choice of refusing Under the new system, users click a single button saying ""accept and continue"" to turn on face recognition, but have to delve deeper into the ""manage data setting"" options to confirm they want it turned off. As has previously been the case, Facebook will not include under-18s in its face-matching database. And it has said that if users opt in but subsequently change their minds, it will delete their face templates, making further matches impossible. Even so, the data watchdog involved has yet to sign off on the proposal. ""There are a number of outstanding issues on which we await further responses from Facebook,"" Ireland's data protection commissioner told the BBC. ""In particular, the Irish DPC is querying the technology around facial recognition and whether Facebook needs to scan all faces - ie those without consent as well - to use the facial recognition technology. ""The issue of compliance of this feature with GDPR is therefore not settled at this point."" Facebook will initially present the new settings pages to EU citizens before rolling versions out worldwide Facebook will also be asking for the following consent to meet its new obligations: if a member has added information about their religious views, political beliefs or sexuality, they will be asked whether they agree to continue allowing that information to be displayed to others and whether they permit Facebook to use the data to provide personalised recommendations users will be asked if they authorise data gathered from elsewhere - including third-party websites and apps - to be used to pick which ads are shown to them on Facebook and Instagram Under GDPR, children are also afforded added protections, which the EU's members can decide to limit to those under 13 or extend to those under 16. Facebook already bans under-13s from being members. But in affected countries, it will now ask under-16s for the permission of a parent or guardian to: show adverts based on their interests include their religious and political views in their profiles allow them to express their sexuality by registering whether they are ""interested in"" men, women or both To do this, the firm will either require them to send a permission request via Facebook itself or provide an email address that the older party can be reached at. In the case of the latter, the company has confirmed that it will rely on the youngsters to provide an accurate address and does not plan its own identity checks.

"A new migraine medication - one of the first bespoke drugs for decades - appears to work well even when others have failed, researchers have said . Erenumab is a monthly injection thatmight soon be offered to patients on the NHS,externalif the cost can be justified. The latest findings presented at aUS medical conference,externalsuggest it could help about a third of people with intractable migraine. Up to four other treatments had failed to prevent their pain. Erenumab reduced the average number of monthly migraine headaches by more than 50% for nearly a third of the people with hard-to-treat migraine who took part in the 12-week study. The drug works differently from other preventive ones given to migraine patients, which are often ""repurposed"" medicines originally designed to treat other conditions, such as blood pressure and epilepsy, rather than severe headache. Erenumab, like three other monoclonal antibody drugs also being tested by pharmaceutical companies, is tailor-made for migraine. It is an antibody designed to block a receptor thought to be responsible for transmitting the pain signals associated with migraine. Migraine is very common - it affects one in seven British people - and can be hard to stop. The severe throbbing pain can last for hours or days on end, making it difficult to work, rest and sleep. Some people get nauseous and sick with it. Others also get an aura - accompanying visual symptoms, such as seeing colourful shapes or experiencing tunnel vision or blind spots. Rachel Walls, 37, from the West Midlands, has had migraines since she was 17.  For the past two decades she has tried lots of different preventive medications and alternative therapies with no success. Rachel says she now gets fewer and less debilitating attacks ""I get a migraine with aura so it affects my eyesight too,"" she says. ""I see cells floating across my vision and I find smells and strong light really difficult to deal with. ""The pain is horrible. It's like having your skull crushed. You can't do anything else - just lie in a dark room and wait for it to go, and it can last for days."" She relies on strong painkillers during these attacks, which she says is unpleasant. She took part in the erenumab study and says her attacks are now fewer, shorter and less intense. ""I get about six or eight migraine attacks a month now, whereas before it was 12 to 15. ""It's not a miracle drug - but for me, it has made a difference. I started the trial last June. For the first three months I didn't know if I was given the drug or a dummy one, but since then I have been on it. ""I've been told that I can only have it for 12 months though, so I'll have to come off it soon and wait to see if it's approved before I can get it again."" Migraine is 'not just a headache' 10 things not to say to someone with a migraine I was told I'd be fired because of migraines Join the debateon our Facebook page.,external Experts hope the new monoclonal antibody treatments could prove life-changing for many of the millions of people living with migraine, but longer trials are still needed to show this. Prof Peter Goadsby, one of the lead investigators of the study and professor of neurology at King's College London, said: ""Our challenge now is to work out who is going to benefit the most from them at the get-go. ""It's really promising that it can help some of these patients who, until now, have not had an option."" Simon Evans, of Migraine Action, said: ""An option that can prevent migraine and that's well tolerated is sorely needed. ""Migraine is too often trivialised as just a headache when, in reality, it can be a debilitating, chronic condition that can destroy lives."" Erenumab and another monoclonal antibody migraine treatment called fremanezumab have been submitted for approval by US and European drug regulators. A decision is expected soon.

"The BBC coverage of a police search at Sir Cliff Richard's Berkshire home allowed ""conspiracy theorists and online trolls to have a field day"", the singer's privacy case has been told. Solicitor Gideon Benaim said the South Yorkshire Police inquiry into alleged historical sexual assault would have been shorter than 22 months if the BBC had not reported the way it did. Sir Cliff was not arrested or charged. The BBC says it reported on a story of ""legitimate public interest"". Case 'likely to have huge impact' Coverage 'invasion of privacy' Sir Cliff felt violated by BBC - Hunniford Giving evidence on the fifth day of the case, Mr Benaim told the High Court the singer's lawyers did their best to ""mitigate the damage"" caused by the BBC coverage. He told the court he believed the broadcaster's report of the raid in Sunningdale - which featured shots taken from a helicopter of officers searching the property - caused ""online chatter"" about Sir Cliff and prompted people to make up ""spurious allegations"". ""I believe it was as a direct result of the publicity generated by the BBC that various people came out of the woodwork, and those allegations came to nothing eventually,"" he said. He added that lawyers from his firm Simkins had become involved in taking action against a potential blackmailer who contacted a newspaper with his claims. In his witness statement to the court, Mr Benaim said about 13,000 emails were exchanged in total ""which highlights the sheer volume of work that this firm undertook for (Sir Cliff) during the period"". Mr Benaim said: ""We worked throughout the period alongside Sir Cliff's PR advisers, which is an entirely normal practice and indeed necessary in crisis situations, which is clearly what Sir Cliff found himself in due to the BBC's actions."" The BBC's barrister, Gavin Millar QC, took Mr Benaim through legal fees run up by Sir Cliff. Mr Millar questioned whether certain costs, such as a bill for advice about travelling to the US during the period, were a consequence of the police investigation rather than the BBC's coverage. Sir Cliff, 77, says he suffered ""profound and long-lasting damage"" and is suing the BBC over the misuse of private information and breaking data protection rules. Lawyers for the BBC says its coverage of the search was accurate and in good faith and journalists had respected Sir Cliff's ""presumption of innocence"". The judge, Mr Justice Mr Justice Mann, heard Sir Cliff's public relations representative Phil Hall had a conversation with the BBC nearly two hours before the story was first broadcast on the News at One. In his witness statement, Mr Hall said there had been no mention of ""helicopters"" or ""quasi-rolling coverage"" and the BBC representative said she did not know whether Sir Cliff would be named. He said it appeared ""there wasn't any great urgency about it because they were prepared to give me some time to prepare a statement"". Giving evidence, Mr Hall denied the BBC's assertion it told him the police search of Sir Cliff's property was in connection with an allegation of a sexual nature. He said he ""would've been straight to the lawyers... talking about an intrusive situation"" had he known a helicopter was being used by the BBC. BBC reporter Dan Johnson, who broke the story about the South Yorkshire Police investigation, is scheduled to give evidence in the afternoon.

"Jordan Worth (left) was jailed for seven-and-a-half years for coercive control and violence against her former boyfriend Alex Skeel A male domestic abuse survivor said he was ""10 days away from death"" before he was helped by police and medics. Alex Skeel, 22, from Stewartby, Bedfordshire has urged other victims in abusive relationships to speak out. His former partner, Jordan Worth, 22, subjected him to multiple physical injuries, denied him food and isolated him from his family, a court was told. Pleading guilty to grievous bodily harm and coercive controlling behaviour, she was jailed for seven-and-a-half years. The prosecution is the UK's first conviction for coercive control involving a female offender, Bedfordshire Police said. I abused a man in public and no-one cared 'She'd just start punching me at night' 'The Archers made me realise I was a victim of domestic abuse' Luton Crown Court was told Worth and Mr Skeel met at college in 2012 when they were both 16. From an early stage she had control over him, telling him what he should wear and attacking him physically. During the last nine months of their relationship, Worth subjected her partner to multiple physical injuries, often requiring hospital treatment. The abuse came to an end one evening last June when a neighbour called the police after hearing shouts from the couple's home. Ambulance staff noted injuries to his hand and burns to his arms and legs which had been self-treated with cling film. The court was told Worth had thrown boiling water over him and that he had second and third-degree burns. Mr Skeel said he had not been allowed to get treatment for his wounds. ""The hospital told me I was 10 days away from death,"" Alex Skeel said. The couple met when they were 16-years-old Worth broke all his mobile phones so he could not contact friends or family. He said on one occasion she told him her mother had received a message to say his grandfather had died. ""Half-way through me crying she said 'Do you want to go downstairs and talk to my Mum about this?' So you think, it is real,"" Mr Skeel said. But after watching him sob for two hours Worth then revealed the death had not happened before berating him for caring about his family. On another occasion he woke up after Worth had beaten him on the head with a beer bottle before chasing him and hitting him on the hands and face with a hammer. Worth deliberately tried to keep Mr Skeel isolated from his friends and family Det Ch Insp Jerry Waite said: ""Coercive control is subtle. The victim may not immediately recognise the behaviour as abuse...and (it) can lead to violence."" Mr Skeel has since had several operations on his brain, head and hands. ""You're far more of a person if you speak out. You're only going to get better if you talk about it,"" he said.

"The UK's biggest coffee chain Costa Coffee has said it will recycle as many disposable cups as it sells by 2020 in a ""cup recycling revolution"". Under the scheme, 500 million coffee cups a year would be recycled, including some sold by rivals, it said. It will encourage waste collection firms to collect the cups by paying them a supplement of Â£70 a tonne. About 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups are thrown away each year in the UK and99.75% are not recycled. They have a mixture of paper and plastic in their inner lining - designed to make them both heat- and leak-proof. Plastic recycling: Why are 99.75% of coffee cups not recycled? Waitrose to stop using disposable coffee cups Four solutions to the disposable coffee cup problem 'Latte levy': Would you pay 25p for your coffee cup? Environmental campaigners have welcomed Costa's move. Costa managing director Dominic Paul told the BBC the move was ""a cup-recycling revolution"". ""By the end of 2020, we'll effectively be cup-neutral. We'll be recycling as many cups as we put into the system,"" he said. Costa said ""misconceptions"" had arisen about whether a coffee cup could be recycled because of the plastic layer, which had ""previously been considered difficult to separate"". However, the chain, which has more than 2,380 branches in the UK,  said: ""The actual issue lies in collecting the cups once they have been disposed of correctly."" Costa and other coffee chains do have recycling collection points for cups in their branches, but most takeaway coffees are consumed elsewhere, including in offices and on the street. Under its new scheme, Costa will pay a supplement of Â£70 for every tonne of cups collected to waste collectors, plus Â£5 per tonne to to a firm that will check the scheme is running as it should. As a result, waste collectors will get on average Â£120 for every tonne of cups they collect, up from Â£50 - a 150% increase. The idea is to make it ""commercially and financially attractive"" for waste collectors to put in place infrastructure to handle the cups - from installing collection points in offices and elsewhere, to sorting them and taking them to recycling plants. Five waste collection firms have been involved in developing the new scheme: Veolia, Biffa, Suez, Grundon and First Mile. Grundon's sales and marketing director, Bradley Smith, said Costa was helping to create the right conditions for paper cups to become a valuable recycled material. ""This provides increased stability and confidence in the market, which will help waste management companies like Grundon to extend paper cup recycling services to more customers,"" he added. Welcoming the announcement, Gavin Ellis, co-founder of environmental charity Hubbub, said there had been a significant increase in the UK's recycling facilities over recent months, and ""the biggest challenge now is to make sure the used cups are collected and make it to the recycling plants"". And Environment Minister Therese Coffey congratulated Costa on taking a ""significant step to help coffee lovers do the right thing and increase recycling"".

"The government has officially confirmed that Franco-Dutch firm Gemalto will make the UK's post-Brexit blue passports. Earlier, the UK's De La Rue said it had abandoned its plan to appeal against the government's decision to award the contract to Gemalto. Chief executive Martin Sutherland told the BBC he remained ""surprised and disappointed"" by the decision. But the Passport Office said the process had been rigorous and fair. It added: ""With a contract value of approximately Â£260m, this will deliver significant savings compared to the Â£400m contract awarded in 2009 and provide value for money to the taxpayer."" The Passport Office said the contract would extend Gemalto's presence in the UK and add about 70 jobs to its existing workforce in the country. De La Rue also issued its second profit warning in less than a month. It said income would be about Â£60m to Â£65m. It blamed Â£4m in costs for tendering to continue making UK passports, as well as delays in other contracts. The burgundy passport, in use since 1988, will revert to its original blue and gold colour from October 2019. Row erupts over post-Brexit passport supplier UK passports: 'The blue belongs to us' De La Rue's Mr Sutherland had initially said the decision to award the contract to Gemalto was ""shocking"" and pledged to appeal. But he told the BBC's Today programme that the firm had now reconsidered. He added: ""We're a business, we have to make pragmatic business decisions. ""We've done our homework, we've taken legal advice, we've looked at, frankly, the likelihood of overturning the decision and the sensible thing for us to do is to refocus our efforts elsewhere and to move forward."" The government granted a two-week extension to the process to decide who would make UK passports after Brexit. That appeal process ended at midnight on Tuesday. A spokesperson for De La Rue, said: ""As we initially announced, we have looked at all possible avenues open to us, and thoroughly evaluated all our options. ""Following four weeks of intense consideration and clear legal advice, we have taken the decision not to challenge the award of the UK passport contract."" This video can not be played De la Rue boss Martin Sutherland claimed: ""It is surprising the British government does not support British industry."" De La Rue has held the contract to manufacture British passports since 2009. It claimed that it had been ""undercut on price"" by Gemalto. The company makes British passports at its Gateshead factory, where it employs around 600 people. Mr Sutherland said: ""We have the contract for another 18 months, that gives us plenty of time to take stock, refocus and drive forward on the international front so we haven't made any decisions about jobs in Gateshead."" De La Rue's share price fell by 4.17% to 471.5p following the announcement which also included its second profit warning since March. Full-year operating profit will fall short of Â£70.2m in operating income for the previous 12 months. As well as the cost of bidding to make post-Brexit passports, it said there had been ""delays in the shipment of certain contracts"" in the last week of the financial year.

"Facebook says its face-matching tech is a way for users to learn if they are in a photo even if not tagged Facebook has started asking European and Canadian users to let it use facial recognition technology to identify them in photos and videos. Facebook originally began face-matching users outside Canada in 2011, but stopped doing so for EU citizens the following year after protests from regulators and privacy campaigners. The new request is one of several opt-in permissions being rolled out in advance of a new data privacy law. The move is likely to be controversial. The company is currently embroiled in a privacy scandal related to the use of its members' personal information by thepolitical consultancy Cambridge Analytica. The social network is also facing aclass-action lawsuit in the USfor deploying the facial recognition technology there without users' explicit consent. ""Biometric identification and tracking across the billions of photos on the platform exacerbates serious privacy risks to users,"" commented Silkie Carlo, director of UK civil liberties group Big Brother Watch. ""Facebook now has a duty to prove it has learned how to respect the law, not to prove it can take its surveillance capabilities to new depths."" Facebook facial recognition faces class-action suit Will technology destroy our democracy? University saw 'no issue' with Facebook research Users outside the EU and Canada will be prompted to review a similar set of privacy controls in the coming months, but they will continue to be subject to facial recognition unless they opt out of the system. Thefacial recognition facility works,externalby assigning each user a unique number called a template. This is calculated by analysing the way they look in their profile photograph and other images they have already been identified in. Untagged faces are then represented in a similar manner and compared to the database of templates. When a match is found, Facebook prompts both the person posting an image and the people appearing in it to apply the relevant name tags. In addition, it uses the tech to detect when a scammer is attempting to use a stolen photo as their profile picture. It also helps Facebook to offer new ""friends"" suggestions. When new connections are made, users have more reason to spend longer on Facebook's app and website. This lets the firm show them more adverts while also helping it learn more about their interests, which in turn lets it better target future ads. The new settings are being deployed ahead of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force on 25 May. The law tightens existing privacy rules, forbids the use of pre-ticked boxes for consent, and increases the amount organisations can be fined for non-compliance. Users can either agree to face recognition with a single button press or click through other pages to be given the choice of refusing Under the new system, users click a single button saying ""accept and continue"" to turn on face recognition, but have to delve deeper into the ""manage data setting"" options to confirm they want it turned off. As has previously been the case, Facebook will not include under-18s in its face-matching database. And it has said that if users opt in but subsequently change their minds, it will delete their face templates, making further matches impossible. Even so, the data watchdog involved has yet to sign off on the proposal. ""There are a number of outstanding issues on which we await further responses from Facebook,"" Ireland's data protection commissioner told the BBC. ""In particular, the Irish DPC is querying the technology around facial recognition and whether Facebook needs to scan all faces - ie those without consent as well - to use the facial recognition technology. ""The issue of compliance of this feature with GDPR is therefore not settled at this point."" Facebook will initially present the new settings pages to EU citizens before rolling versions out worldwide Facebook will also be asking for the following consent to meet its new obligations: if a member has added information about their religious views, political beliefs or sexuality, they will be asked whether they agree to continue allowing that information to be displayed to others and whether they permit Facebook to use the data to provide personalised recommendations users will be asked if they authorise data gathered from elsewhere - including third-party websites and apps - to be used to pick which ads are shown to them on Facebook and Instagram Under GDPR, children are also afforded added protections, which the EU's members can decide to limit to those under 13 or extend to those under 16. Facebook already bans under-13s from being members. But in affected countries, it will now ask under-16s for the permission of a parent or guardian to: show adverts based on their interests include their religious and political views in their profiles allow them to express their sexuality by registering whether they are ""interested in"" men, women or both To do this, the firm will either require them to send a permission request via Facebook itself or provide an email address that the older party can be reached at. In the case of the latter, the company has confirmed that it will rely on the youngsters to provide an accurate address and does not plan its own identity checks.

"For the first time in 10 years, global malaria cases are no longer falling, sparking concerns about a resurgence of the too often deadly disease. Experts, and philanthropist Bill Gates, are urging country leaders gathering at the Commonwealth summit in London to pledge more money to fight the illness. In 2016, nearly half of the world's population was at risk of malaria. There were 216 million cases of malaria in 91 countries, an increase of five million compared with 2015. Without more investment and preventive action, we could see even more malaria and rising deaths, experts warn. Malaria cases have been increasing in some parts of the Americas, South-East Asia, Western Pacific and Africa, although in many other regions infections are stable or going down. Speaking on the Today programme, on Radio 4, Bill Gates said the mosquitoes had started adapting but the goal was still to cut cases in half. ""If we stand still, the insecticides we use stop working, the drugs stop working because the parasite itself evolves around that, so this is a game where you are either falling behind or getting ahead."" He said that with new money, better surveillance and ""great scientists"" working on how to combat the disease, there was hope. ""This kills hundreds of thousands of children in Africa so unless we make big progress here we won't be doing what we owe Africa,"" Mr Gates said. 'Malaria killed my daughter, I'm protecting others now' Part of the problem is that the mosquitoes and parasites that cause and spread malaria are developing resistance to the weapons we use to fight them - insecticides and antimalarial drugs. New treatments are on the horizon. The first malaria vaccine, Mosquirix, will be used to protect young children in selected areas of three African countries, which is home to 90% of malaria cases and 91% of malaria deaths. But developments take time and money - and global funding to combat malaria has plateaued. A new commitment to halve malaria cases over the next five years could save 650,000 lives across the Commonwealth, according to experts. The UK government has said it will invest Â£500m a year for the next three years to help fight malaria. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will extend its investments in malaria by an additional $1bn (Â£700m) through to 2023. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The job is not yet done. Today there are millions still at risk, economies held back and a child's life needlessly taken every two minutes from this disease. This is why I am championing a new Commonwealth commitment to halve malaria across member countries by 2023."" James Whiting, from Malaria No More UK, said: ""The malaria campaign is at a crossroads. ""It is a disease that has probably killed more human beings than any in history. ""Malaria is not something that stands still.""

"A new migraine medication - one of the first bespoke drugs for decades - appears to work well even when others have failed, researchers have said . Erenumab is a monthly injection thatmight soon be offered to patients on the NHS,externalif the cost can be justified. The latest findings presented at aUS medical conference,externalsuggest it could help about a third of people with intractable migraine. Up to four other treatments had failed to prevent their pain. Erenumab reduced the average number of monthly migraine headaches by more than 50% for nearly a third of the people with hard-to-treat migraine who took part in the 12-week study. The drug works differently from other preventive ones given to migraine patients, which are often ""repurposed"" medicines originally designed to treat other conditions, such as blood pressure and epilepsy, rather than severe headache. Erenumab, like three other monoclonal antibody drugs also being tested by pharmaceutical companies, is tailor-made for migraine. It is an antibody designed to block a receptor thought to be responsible for transmitting the pain signals associated with migraine. Migraine is very common - it affects one in seven British people - and can be hard to stop. The severe throbbing pain can last for hours or days on end, making it difficult to work, rest and sleep. Some people get nauseous and sick with it. Others also get an aura - accompanying visual symptoms, such as seeing colourful shapes or experiencing tunnel vision or blind spots. Rachel Walls, 37, from the West Midlands, has had migraines since she was 17.  For the past two decades she has tried lots of different preventive medications and alternative therapies with no success. Rachel says she now gets fewer and less debilitating attacks ""I get a migraine with aura so it affects my eyesight too,"" she says. ""I see cells floating across my vision and I find smells and strong light really difficult to deal with. ""The pain is horrible. It's like having your skull crushed. You can't do anything else - just lie in a dark room and wait for it to go, and it can last for days."" She relies on strong painkillers during these attacks, which she says is unpleasant. She took part in the erenumab study and says her attacks are now fewer, shorter and less intense. ""I get about six or eight migraine attacks a month now, whereas before it was 12 to 15. ""It's not a miracle drug - but for me, it has made a difference. I started the trial last June. For the first three months I didn't know if I was given the drug or a dummy one, but since then I have been on it. ""I've been told that I can only have it for 12 months though, so I'll have to come off it soon and wait to see if it's approved before I can get it again."" Migraine is 'not just a headache' 10 things not to say to someone with a migraine I was told I'd be fired because of migraines Join the debateon our Facebook page.,external Experts hope the new monoclonal antibody treatments could prove life-changing for many of the millions of people living with migraine, but longer trials are still needed to show this. Prof Peter Goadsby, one of the lead investigators of the study and professor of neurology at King's College London, said: ""Our challenge now is to work out who is going to benefit the most from them at the get-go. ""It's really promising that it can help some of these patients who, until now, have not had an option."" Simon Evans, of Migraine Action, said: ""An option that can prevent migraine and that's well tolerated is sorely needed. ""Migraine is too often trivialised as just a headache when, in reality, it can be a debilitating, chronic condition that can destroy lives."" Erenumab and another monoclonal antibody migraine treatment called fremanezumab have been submitted for approval by US and European drug regulators. A decision is expected soon.

"For the first time in 10 years, global malaria cases are no longer falling, sparking concerns about a resurgence of the too often deadly disease. Experts, and philanthropist Bill Gates, are urging country leaders gathering at the Commonwealth summit in London to pledge more money to fight the illness. In 2016, nearly half of the world's population was at risk of malaria. There were 216 million cases of malaria in 91 countries, an increase of five million compared with 2015. Without more investment and preventive action, we could see even more malaria and rising deaths, experts warn. Malaria cases have been increasing in some parts of the Americas, South-East Asia, Western Pacific and Africa, although in many other regions infections are stable or going down. Speaking on the Today programme, on Radio 4, Bill Gates said the mosquitoes had started adapting but the goal was still to cut cases in half. ""If we stand still, the insecticides we use stop working, the drugs stop working because the parasite itself evolves around that, so this is a game where you are either falling behind or getting ahead."" He said that with new money, better surveillance and ""great scientists"" working on how to combat the disease, there was hope. ""This kills hundreds of thousands of children in Africa so unless we make big progress here we won't be doing what we owe Africa,"" Mr Gates said. 'Malaria killed my daughter, I'm protecting others now' Part of the problem is that the mosquitoes and parasites that cause and spread malaria are developing resistance to the weapons we use to fight them - insecticides and antimalarial drugs. New treatments are on the horizon. The first malaria vaccine, Mosquirix, will be used to protect young children in selected areas of three African countries, which is home to 90% of malaria cases and 91% of malaria deaths. But developments take time and money - and global funding to combat malaria has plateaued. A new commitment to halve malaria cases over the next five years could save 650,000 lives across the Commonwealth, according to experts. The UK government has said it will invest Â£500m a year for the next three years to help fight malaria. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will extend its investments in malaria by an additional $1bn (Â£700m) through to 2023. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""The job is not yet done.

" The boat was barely seaworthy and heavily overloaded with men and equipment. For seven days and nights, the crew had attempted to navigate the treacherous seas but the ship was unfit and letting in water. Almost all the men on board were unwell – seasick or weak with hunger and thirst. Now, arriving two days later than planned and miles from the rendezvous, the ship had run aground in thick mud. A Cuban postage stamp celebrates the Granma's voyage As Che Guevara would later observe, the supposedly triumphant return to Cuban soil of Fidel Castro and his revolutionary force in December 1956 “wasn’t a landing, it was a shipwreck”. In all, 82 men stepped off that vessel, Granma, bedraggled and dispirited. It soon got worse. In the foothills of the Sierra Maestra they were ambushed by the Cuban army and reduced to just a handful of guerrillas, among them Fidel Castro and his younger brother, Raúl. From that ignominious start, they eventually defeated Fulgencio Batista’s military regime. Facing 40,000 men and far superior weaponry, it was one of the most successful guerrilla campaigns of the 20th Century. (Below: Fidel Castro waves to crowds in the Cuban capital  Havana in January 1959, shortly after his victory over Batista) Perhaps more incredibly, though, they have stayed in power until today. Between them, the Castro brothers have spent almost 60 years at the helm. The mark they have left on the island, shaping it into a one-party communist-run state, is indelible. Fidel and Raúl in 1999 Now, a turning point beckons. The Father of the Revolution, Fidel Castro, died in late 2016 and Raúl Castro is retiring from the presidency. Cuba is about to be governed by someone other than a Castro for the first time since 1959. So, after six decades, what kind of country will they pass on? As the elderly Castro slipped into his final moments, he could reflect on a long and contented life. Though frail in body, he’d stayed mentally agile until the very end and his adoring children and grandchildren were at his bedside. He was stubborn - a family trait - and a fighter to the last. For nearly nine hours the doctors attempted to save him. But it was not to be. This was Mártin Castro, half-brother of Fidel and Raúl, and he died in September 2017 only a stone’s throw from where he was born - in Birán. He had suffered an aneurysm, aged 87, a year after Fidel’s death. Mártin Castro, pictured in 2016 Although the two men shared a father and played together as children, there were perhaps no two lives in Cuba quite so different as theirs. One became the founder of the Cuban Revolution. The other never left home. An icon of the Cold War, Fidel Castro led Cuba for almost 50 years, installing communism on an island barely 90 miles off the coast of Florida. “Right under the noses of the imperialists,” as he would later famously say. After the revolution, in 1959, his little-known half brother Mártin was offered the chance to move to Havana to take up a role in government. He turned it down. A simple man, Mártin was happier among his animals and the sugar cane fields of their hometown. “I often wonder what would have happened if Dad had joined with Fidel,” says his daughter, Josefa Beatriz, her grief still evident, “but he never wanted to.” A Castro family photo featuring Mártin and Raúl “My father never studied but he shared their intelligence,"" she recalls with fondness, passing a finger lovingly over his photograph. The family resemblance, especially to Raúl, is striking. Mártin Castro's daughter, Josefa Beatriz Castro López: “I often wonder what would have happened if Dad had joined with Fidel, but he never wanted to.” The Castro family home, Finca Las Manacas, is now a museum, painstakingly restored as a monument to Fidel and Raúl's rural roots. The town’s historian, Antonio López, guides me around the estate. Finca Las Manacas, the Castro family estate Birán, he says, was the town that Castro built. Fidel’s father, Ángel Castro, first came to Cuba in the 1890s from the Spanish region of Galicia as a conscript to defend colonial rule during the Spanish-American War. When he returned to the island shortly after its independence in 1898, he began working in the mines and later the sugar cane plantations for the American giant, United Fruit Company. Ángel Castro, father of Fidel By the early 1910s, he was on the path to wealth. He had bought a little land on the side of the Camino Real, a muddy route between Santiago de Cuba and Nipe Bay on the northern coast. Little by little, that farm grew into a fiefdom typical of the era: a school, a general store, a lumberyard, a bar, a blacksmith, rustic huts for the Haitian sugar cane and timber workers. Antonio shows me the tiny schoolroom where Fidel first sat in on classes before being sent to study under the Jesuit priests in Santiago and Havana. As one guide walks past, she repeats the official story to tourists - how the impoverished conditions of the indentured Haitian sugar cane cutters left a lasting impression on Fidel and Raúl. “Fidel once said he was glad to be the son, not the grandson, of a landowner as there still wasn’t a family culture of privilege or entitlement,” says Antonio. Ángel wouldn’t live to see the victory of the socialist revolution nor his sons become the two most powerful men on the island. He died in 1956 and is buried alongside Fidel and Raúl's mother, Lina, in Finca Las Manacas. However, for at least one other son, life never really changed much from those early days of rural tranquillity. Over sugary black coffee in her living room, Josefa explains how Mártin had left them a little land, a few head of cattle and the cramped but welcoming home where we are sitting. Birán retains its sleepy village life. Men gather in the tiny plaza around the state-run shop, sharing a little rum after a morning in the fields or buying fizzy drinks and cheap ham sandwiches in the subsidised cafeteria. Mártin's rudimentary concrete house was part of a plan by Fidel to build 400 homes for the townsfolk, in contrast to the workers’ flimsy wooden huts on his father’s estate. Rectangular and boxy, with a bathroom hidden behind a curtain, all along the street the homes are uniform, except for a few which stand out with bright pink, yellow or green facades. Most have a narrow front porch. Mártin used to sit on his in a rocking chair and watch Birán go by. In the end only 218 of the 400 were completed. At the wake, it seemed like neighbours from all of those 218 turned up to pay their respects, his daughter recalls. “Everyone knew him, would stop by and chat to him. People used to ask me why I didn’t take him to live in Havana but he was happy here. “He’d say, ‘I don’t want wealth. These are my riches’,” and she motions towards the fields. The ferry to Cayo Granma can get pretty crowded. Just one Cuban peso (5 US cents; 3p) each way, it is the easiest and cheapest way to reach the island, which lies at the mouth of the Bay of Santiago. The deck is full of boxes of frozen chicken thighs from Brazil, a motorbike rests precariously against the railings and on the benches inside a group of high school kids are giggling and shouting over one another. Few tourists venture out to the sleepy fishing village but one suspects most locals prefer it that way. “They’ll have to set me on fire before I leave this island,” jokes Rosa Caridad Valverde, who has lived on the tiny islet her whole life. “Then, after they put me out, I’d swim back to the Cayo!” Now in her late 70s, she is suffering from high blood pressure. Nothing serious, she insists, but she has come to see the family doctor to pick up a repeat prescription for her pills. Rosa is sitting in the shade waiting for Dr Clara Luaces, who is attending to her patients inside a spotlessly clean clinic. “Given how cut off this island is from the city, we have the basic equipment needed to treat people,” explains the doctor, her stethoscope still around her neck. Clara is a very direct but warm woman in her 50s who takes pride in living among the community itself, something she says is key to the concept of primary healthcare in Cuba. “There are 651 inhabitants living here,” she says, nodding at the wood-and-tin houses which snake up the hillside towards the church. “There is a launch to take emergency cases or pregnant women to the mainland, although we have saved several lives here on the island ourselves,” she adds with a hint of pride. Rosa Caridad is thankful for the service. Unprompted, she offers glowing revolutionary praise: “The greatest thing for a country is not food or clothes, it’s health and education. And we get both of them for free.” Dr Clara Luaces These are the two pillars of the Cuban Revolution, the social achievements most synonymous with Cuba under the Castros. In fact, to suggest that there are inadequacies in either - to point out that they are in dire need of investment and modernisation - borders on blasphemy to some government officials in Cuba. Asked what she would most want from Raúl's successor, Clara speaks carefully. She is only prepared to say that bureaucracy remains an obstacle in Cuba and that it isn’t easy to get by on a salary of about US$35 a month. Even then she quickly corrects herself: “But I’ve seen my wages increase more than most in recent years.” Plus, she adds dutifully, the US economic embargo on Cuba should be lifted. It’s a refrain that is repeated endlessly across Cuba. From supplies of medicines to new strains of seeds, the embargo – or “blockade” as Cubans call it – is now in its 58th year and is blamed for much of the island’s economic stagnation. But there are, of course, several homegrown challenges facing Cuba’s healthcare system. Off the record, some doctors and nurses will say that infection inside hospitals is a significant problem. And while treatment remains completely free, a significant burden of care falls to the families. They must provide the sheets, pillows, and sometimes even source the meals and basic antibiotics their loved ones require. Nevertheless, Clara says, in the rest of Latin America very few can count on the same free medical attention that Cuban doctors provide. The Pan-American Health Organization, among others, has been fulsome in its praise, especially in the fight against infectious disease on the island. Back on the mainland, I visit the spot where it all began, where the opening salvo of the Cuban Revolution was fired - the Moncada Barracks. On 26 July 1953, Fidel and Raúl led an ill-equipped uprising in Santiago against Batista’s brutal regime by attacking the barracks. The attempted coup was crushed within hours and the plotters rounded up and tortured. The Castro brothers were fortunate not to be among them. In a flourish typical of the Castros, once they took power, they turned the military base into a school. Today it houses several schools under one roof as well as a museum about the uprising. Education is another source of huge pride in Cuba. The country eradicated illiteracy in rural regions in the early 1960s and its commitment to higher education and scientific research is internationally recognised. At the turn of the 21st Century,a World Bank study of Latin America and the Caribbeanfound that Cuba ranked first in maths and science at all school grades and for both males and females. The report also described Cuba’s schools as the “equals” of schools in many OECD countries. Education remains a key tenet of the revolution. But today resources are scarce, budgets stretched thin and official statistics suggest a worsening teacher shortage. Thousands of teachers are absent or have apparently abandoned the profession altogether in favour of the private sector, where more can be made in a day renting rooms to tourists or giving private classes than in a month as a state educator. In the shaded patio at Moncada, the children are lined up in neat rows besides a plaque marking the spot where the bodies of the revolutionaries killed in the Moncada attack were laid out. “Pioneers of communism,” calls a child to the entire student body assembled before her. “We will be like Che!” comes their resounding response. It is the slogan chanted every morning by schoolchildren across the island, a lifelong dedication to the values of socialism as personified by Che Guevara. Afterwards, we are ushered into a classroom to see the children at work. “Who can conjugate this in the past tense?” asks the teacher, writing the verb “to study” on the board. A volley of hands go up and, typically, she picks one of the kids whose hand stayed down. We're told we can interview the children but from experience they invariably just recite revolutionary mantras under the watchful eye of their teachers. So instead I ask the head teacher herself what she says to critics, especially in Miami, who say that such heavy rhetoric at school amounts to indoctrination. “It’s absurd to argue there’s brainwashing here,” says Elaine Infante. “Our revolution is very humanitarian and we think about the well-being of all children here.” “That’s why we come to work. Not to turn them into militants, no. But to prepare them for the future, to make them into good men and women who can serve their society.” Don Manolo worked the land until his knees could take no more. By then he was 90. He had grown coffee in the Sierra Maestra mountains for his entire life but two years ago the ravages of time forced him to return his deeds to the state in exchange for a pension. “We began as squatters, with no titles to the land.” His gnarled hands grip a cane for support and a wide-brimmed straw hat protects him from the harsh Caribbean sun. Before the revolution, Manolo used to give a third of every harvest to the local landowner, he explains. One day a group of bearded men appeared on his plot. “A lot of us wanted to fight but Fidel said not all thecampesinos(peasant farmers) could join the rebel army as we were needed to produce their food,” he recalls. The rebels promised that Manolo and other farmers would soon own their land. He was 33, the same age as Fidel, and the two men would meet again a few months later when the leader of the revolution returned to the region to give out the promised deeds. Under the reforms, all landholdings over a certain size were confiscated and redistributed as small plots to the peasant farmers or turned into state-run communes. All major landowners - from wealthy Cuban families to foreign multinationals like Coca-Cola and the United Fruit Company - had their lands nationalised. Sugar plantations could no longer be foreign-owned - one of the early decisions which first set Cuba at loggerheads with Washington. Castro supposedly even confiscated some of his family’s estate at Finca Las Manacas, much to his mother’s fury. The law remains the basis of Cuba’s agricultural model. “We held a party with a horse parade in Caney de las Mercedes that day they gave us the titles,” recalls Manolo. “We were happy because now no-one could throw us off the land.” (Below: Don Manolo poses for a photo with a replica of the paperwork he received from – and 57 years later returned to – the Cuban state) In the foothills of the Sierra Maestra the microclimate is perfect for growing coffee. At a point called Polo Norte - North Pole - lives Lérido Medina, another of the original recipients of the land titles. He doesn’t have the paperwork now, though - he donated his deeds to a museum in Havana. Wearing a thick woollen shirt in the cool mountain air, the 92-year-old explains that he now relies on his wife, Aida, and his son to do the manual work on the farm. “The hardest part has been cutting back the forest to sow,” says Lérido. “There is no mechanisation whatsoever, it’s all by hand – pickaxe, machete, brute force.” The entirety of the family’s crop is sold to the state - coffee cannot be sold on the open market. To this day, most farmers like Lérido  see the agrarian reform as the bedrock law that gave them autonomy. But critics say it tied them to the state for life. Lérido Medina The economic rules have eased a little under Raúl's presidency and although they’re far from being private enterprises, the coffee farmers in Polo Norte joined forces to create a co-operative. It has allowed them to pool their resources and wield a little more collective bargaining power, explains Lérido's eldest son, Eziquiel. But whether farming mountainous coffee plantations or the sugar cane and tobacco fields that dot the countryside, almost everyone involved in agriculture appears to agree on the limitations of the technology. Much of the farming equipment still used on the island is from the 19th Century - oxen and plough, horse and cart, machete. “In the plains you can use tractors but not up here. It’s a tough life for the campesino but the work must be done,” says Lérido. Despite Raúl's changes, the state-run model still forms the basis of Cuba’s agriculture. For many farmers, growth has been sluggish at best since the collapse of the Soviet Union and about three-quarters of Cuba’s domestic food requirements are imported. However, hunger has largely been eradicated and it’s highly unlikely that a future leader would unpick one of the revolution’s founding principles in agricultural production. While coffee is important to Cuba, sugar has traditionally been the island’s main export crop and at the centre of its economy. On the road passing through Camaguey province, we stop to speak to a group of sugar cane farmers as they harvest the crop. “We’re aiming for 40,000 tonnes this year,” says Osvany Iglesias, the leader of the harvest platoon, before echoing the complaint over working with Soviet-era machines. “That was made in 1972, that one in 1975, and this is the most modern, from 1994,” he says pointing at the combine harvesters as they roar past. “The lack of parts is difficult and the Chinese replacements aren’t good quality.” But he shrugs and laughs. There’s little choice but to make do. “GIRÓN: THE FIRST DEFEAT OF THE YANKEE IMPERIALISTS IN LATIN AMERICA” proclaims the sign at the side of the road as you drive into the town. Revolutionary hyperbole aside, it is basically true. Washington had never really lost a battle in Latin America until the bungled invasion at the Bay of Pigs, or Playa Girón, in 1961. For months, the CIA trained Cuban exiles in southern Florida and secret bases in Guatemala to prepare them for the invasion. On 15 April 1961, Douglas B-26 bombers with false flag markings attacked airfields outside Havana and in Santiago. 1961: Fighting during the unsuccessful US invasion at Bay of Pigs Then came the invasion from the sea. Some 1,400 men came ashore at Girón and two other nearby beaches. It was a debacle from the start, with instructions going awry and the counter-revolutionaries getting lost and entangled in the harsh mangroves along the coast. Fidel took control of the Cuban armed forces himself and, once Washington’s hand was revealed to be behind the attack, President John F Kennedy opted against sending in US air support. The invasion was crushed, Castro had won a crucial victory and the Kennedy administration suffered a humiliating defeat. Che Guevara would later send Kennedy a thank you note for the invasion saying: “The revolution was weak. Now it is stronger than ever.” The entire story, from a staunchly pro-revolutionary perspective of course, can be seen at a small museum in Playa Girón . There’s a smattering of American accents in the tour groups going round. But if they really want to hear the story of what happened that fateful week, they should probably leave the museum and find Dolores Fis. She lives nearby in a simple home with a cement floor, which remains surprisingly cool in Girón's swampy heat. One of her daughters lives next door and a nephew lives opposite. She welcomes me like an old relative - this isn’t the first time I’ve paid her a visit. Dolores is one of the few remaining residents who were in Girón during the 1961 invasion. Now 84, her stories are unique and spellbinding. An ordinary person tied up in a moment that pierced the national psyche, her life story a microcosm of Cuba’s revolution. I interviewed her shortly before President Obama visited Cuba in 2016. She retold the moment of the attack, of how she woke her husband whispering “they’re firing on the beach!” She was prepared to stay and fight but eventually her husband persuaded her and her sister-in-law to take the children and hide in the hills. They had to break into an abandoned house to grab what little food they could. But this time she talks about how Playa Girón has changed. “There used to be nothing here. But now I don’t know half of the homes because so many people have come from all over. From Oriente, from Camaguey, from Havana, from everywhere to live here.” That’s because there’s decent money to be made in the sleepy coastal village. As you drive into Girón, every other house has the distinctive blue-and-white symbol outside which denotes private accommodation where foreigners can stay. ‘Casas particulares’, as they are known in Cuba, have become one of the most popular private enterprises among ordinary Cubans. Although the government has frozen the issuing of new business licences for almost a year now, tourist accommodation remains the easiest way for many Cuban families to break into the private sector, and earn much more than their state wages without having to invest a fortune to covert their homes. Deynier Suarez, known as ‘Jimmy’, moved to Girón from the capital as the tourism boom in the area started to grow. He began as a chef in the state-run hotel near the beach but moved into the private sector when one of the most successful casa particulares in the town was looking for a manager. “Business has been OK this year, but down on the previous two”, he explains. He attributes the downturn to two factors: Hurricane Irma, which wrought devastation on parts of Cuba’s northern coast. It left the southern coastline basically untouched but Jimmy thinks the television images of the storm gave the impression of chaos across Cuba and put off people from visiting. Deynier “Jimmy” Suarez: Tourism has fallen because of Donald Trump The other factor, he says, was Donald Trump. “It’s been pretty noticeable”, he remarks of the stricter travel rules imposed by the Trump Administration following the warmer ties under the Obama presidency. “Very few Americans are coming, you hardly see them. And Europeans, well, we hope they keep coming. We’re not worried yet but it would help if Trump changed his decisions.” Beyond the revolutionary history, the average tourist comes to Girón  for birdwatching or diving, with the Cienaga de Zapata National Park offering some of the best ecotourism on the island. Just outside Girón is the Cueva de los Peces, a popular spot for diving and snorkelling. Our instructor, Rey, takes us out to the largely undamaged reef. A group of Canadians enjoy investigating a sunken boat. Two decades ago, Fidel essentially considered foreign tourists a necessary evil, a useful way of bringing in much-needed foreign currency. Today, however, tourism has been earmarked as the solution for the island’s economic future and the government hopes for even more visitors in the coming years. That has already brought some noticeable economic inequalities, a challenge the next president will have to bear in mind. There is a growing disconnection between Cubans who earn in the “convertible peso”, the currency used by most foreigners, and those who earn in the local “Cuban pesos”. Some of those who work in state-run enterprises of the tourism sector are keen to spread their wings and set up their own businesses. Privately-owned diving shops, for example, are currently prohibited under the strict economic rules. “There are a lot of us who are interested in going private,” insists Rey. “But things will stay the same for a while yet. This model suits the state.” As the sun goes down it casts long shadows across the beach at the Bay of Pigs. Groups of tourists lounge under the palm trees, sipping on cold beers or drinking Cuban rum out of coconut husks sold by the locals. Few looking on the scene can fail to reflect on the invasion of tourists - an obvious metaphor, but an accurate one. The question for the people of Girón is how much they will be allowed to harness it for their own ends. As Raúl was preparing to step down, Cuba held an election. Across the country, people dutifully turned out to cast their ballots for members of the national assembly. On 19 April those national assembly members chose Miguel Díaz-Canel, the vice-president, to replace Raúl as president. In turns painted as a moderniser and a stalwart hardliner, he is the first non-Castro to govern the island since 1959. Sounds straightforward enough. But in reality, on the ballots cast by Cuban voters there was exactly the same number of candidates as seats in parliament - 605. And, of course, under Cuba’s strict one-party system, no other choices of political colours were on offer. Last year, a number of dissidents and opposition figures attempted to stand as municipal candidates, including members of a group called Otro 18. They claim they were prevented from registering their nominations through repressive tactics by the police and state security officers. As I watched people vote, I was reminded of Raúl's comments in 2014. Barely five days after the historic agreement with President Obama to re-establish diplomatic ties, there was a genuine sense of expectation in the air. Addressing parliament, Raúl quickly referred to the changing relationship with Washington saying: “We shouldn't expect that in order for relations to improve with the United States, Cuba is renouncing the ideas for which we have fought for more than a century and for which our people have spilled so much blood and run such great risks.” The message was simple - political continuation. Open dissent or multi-party politics weren’t about to emerge in Cuba. They still aren’t. A decade ago, the state’s modus operandi against its opponents and dissidents was to give them long jail sentences. Today, that practice has largely ended. In its place is a system of control under which critics and independent journalists are frequently held under short-term arbitrary detentions. For its part, the Cuban government accuses those critics of being “mercenaries” in the pay of anti-Castro groups from Washington and Miami. Few can doubt that there were some on both sides of the Florida Straits who had their misgivings about improved relations between the US and Cuba. On the Miami side, the thaw was loudly decried by the standard-bearers for anti-Castro policy, in particular Florida Senator Marco Rubio. On the Cuban side too, there were plenty of ideologues who were uncomfortable with the sight of the US president visiting Havana, the old enemy now playing nice on Cuban soil. “I come to bury the remnants of the Cold War in the Americas,” said President Obama during his historic trip. He spoke of families - pulled apart by decades of hostility - being reunited amid a new spirit of friendship. “I just burst into tears,” one woman watching at home told me later. 2016: President Obama's visit to Cuba Fidel wrote an editorial warning of President Obama’s “honeyed words” and asking revolutionaries not to let their guard down. A number of hard-line elements in the government strongly agreed with him and wanted to push back against the growing tide of pro-Americanism on the island. Then, Donald Trump won the US presidency. In the hours following Fidel's death, President-elect Trump took to Twitter to mark the passing of, as he put it, a “brutal dictator” whose “legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights”. The stage was set for a return to hostility. That is where things remain today. The rapidly deteriorating relationship was then complicated further by a chapter straight out of a spy novel. More than 20 US diplomats in Havana began to suffer unexplained health problems, everything from hearing loss and nausea to mild concussion. The State Department claims its embassy staff had been the victims of so-called “health attacks” and blamed Cuba for failing to protect the diplomats, if not necessarily carrying out the alleged acts. Havana has denied any knowledge of the incidents and says the entire episode is a combination of cover story and mass hysteria. The intention was, they claimed, to undo the recent goodwill and justify a more hostile diplomatic and political relationship with the island. Either way, the US drew down its staff in Havana to a bare minimum and today relations could barely be further from the heady years of thaw during the Obama administration. This is the context in which Raúl's replacement takes over the reins. Does any of this matter to ordinary Cubans, like 92-year-old coffee grower Lérido, or Rey, the diving instructor who wants to open his own business? One could argue very little. Certainly the most committed revolutionaries continually insist that everything will be fine. That the Cuban Revolution is in safe hands and that, in essence, everything will carry on as before. It is undoubtedly true that no future government in Cuba would dare meddle with the key pillars of the revolution, especially the free healthcare and education or subsidies to the rural poor. But when you ask how Cuba will pay for it in when its close socialist ally, Venezuela, is on its knees economically or when Cuba’s export earnings are low, you’re generally met with a smile and a shrug of the shoulders. Few can provide specifics on how the island will face the next set of economic challenges. “We’ve been through worse. The collapse of the Soviet bloc and the ‘Special Period’,” one party official in Bayamo told me, referring to the economic hardships in Cuba of the 1990s. “If we can survive that, we can survive anything.” This is where the blind trust in the system comes in, where true revolutionaries place their unwavering faith in the revolution to provide a solution. Under Fidel and Raúl, it was enough for many people. But an older man I meet in the coastal town of Manzanillo, Pedro Rodríguez , his glasses held together with a sticking plaster, is evidently tired of such an approach. The port in the town is no longer vibrant, he complains, and the state-run enterprises are poorly run and inefficient. “No-one produces anything here any more,” the former accountant says with the resignation of a man who has seen the decades come and go. “People just wait for the ripe mangoes to fall.” A harsh assessment? Perhaps. Millions of Cubans face a daily struggle under trying circumstances to make ends meet. There’s still much that they are proud of - especially the social achievements under the Castros that many larger and wealthier countries struggle to reproduce. But as Cubans’ demands for improved living standards grow, the challenges for the state institutions - and the island’s new leadership - will increase with them.

"The government has officially confirmed that Franco-Dutch firm Gemalto will make the UK's post-Brexit blue passports. Earlier, the UK's De La Rue said it had abandoned its plan to appeal against the government's decision to award the contract to Gemalto. Chief executive Martin Sutherland told the BBC he remained ""surprised and disappointed"" by the decision. But the Passport Office said the process had been rigorous and fair. It added: ""With a contract value of approximately Â£260m, this will deliver significant savings compared to the Â£400m contract awarded in 2009 and provide value for money to the taxpayer."" The Passport Office said the contract would extend Gemalto's presence in the UK and add about 70 jobs to its existing workforce in the country. De La Rue also issued its second profit warning in less than a month. It said income would be about Â£60m to Â£65m. It blamed Â£4m in costs for tendering to continue making UK passports, as well as delays in other contracts. The burgundy passport, in use since 1988, will revert to its original blue and gold colour from October 2019. Row erupts over post-Brexit passport supplier UK passports: 'The blue belongs to us' De La Rue's Mr Sutherland had initially said the decision to award the contract to Gemalto was ""shocking"" and pledged to appeal. But he told the BBC's Today programme that the firm had now reconsidered. He added: ""We're a business, we have to make pragmatic business decisions. ""We've done our homework, we've taken legal advice, we've looked at, frankly, the likelihood of overturning the decision and the sensible thing for us to do is to refocus our efforts elsewhere and to move forward."" The government granted a two-week extension to the process to decide who would make UK passports after Brexit. That appeal process ended at midnight on Tuesday. A spokesperson for De La Rue, said: ""As we initially announced, we have looked at all possible avenues open to us, and thoroughly evaluated all our options. ""Following four weeks of intense consideration and clear legal advice, we have taken the decision not to challenge the award of the UK passport contract."" This video can not be played De la Rue boss Martin Sutherland claimed: ""It is surprising the British government does not support British industry."" De La Rue has held the contract to manufacture British passports since 2009. It claimed that it had been ""undercut on price"" by Gemalto. The company makes British passports at its Gateshead factory, where it employs around 600 people. Mr Sutherland said: ""We have the contract for another 18 months, that gives us plenty of time to take stock, refocus and drive forward on the international front so we haven't made any decisions about jobs in Gateshead."" De La Rue's share price fell by 4.17% to 471.5p following the announcement which also included its second profit warning since March. Full-year operating profit will fall short of Â£70.2m in operating income for the previous 12 months. As well as the cost of bidding to make post-Brexit passports, it said there had been ""delays in the shipment of certain contracts"" in the last week of the financial year.

"Mr Pompeo's mission reportedly was to prepare for the Trump-Kim summit CIA director Mike Pompeo travelled to Pyongyang for a secret meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, US President Donald Trump has confirmed. A ""good relationship"" was formed at the meeting last week, Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday. News of the visit first emerged on Tuesday. US officials were quoted as saying the aim was to prepare a summit between Mr Trump and Mr Kim. Mr Trump had earlier alluded to high-level direct talks with Pyongyang. But the unexpected and clandestine meeting marks the highest level US contact with North Korea since 2000. ""We have had direct talks at... extremely high levels,"" Mr Trump said from Florida, where he is hosting Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The president added that he gave his ""blessing"" for talks between the South and North to discuss a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War. North Korea crisis in 300 words The political gamble of the 21st Century South Korea has also signalled that it may pursue a formal resolution of the conflict. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in and Mr Kim are due to meet next week. The two sides have agreed to broadcast parts of the summit live, the South's state news agency Yonhap reported. The news that Mr Pompeo had travelled to North Korea fora clandestine meeting with Mr Kim,externalwas first reported by The Washington Post. The trip took place shortly after Mr Pompeo was nominated by Mr Trump to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, two anonymous sources ""with direct knowledge of the trip"" told the newspaper. Later Reuters news agency said the report had been confirmed to them by senior officials. Early on Wednesday, Mr Trump confirmed the reports with a tweet. Allow Twitter content?

Very little is known about the talks other than that they were to prepare for the forthcoming Trump-Kim summit. Mr Pompeo is predicted to be confirmed as the top US diplomat by the Republican-controlled Senate in coming weeks. This is despite mounting speculation that he will, unusually, fail to receive the backing of the bipartisan Senate Foreign Relations Committee followinga grilling of more than five hoursby the committee last week. The US does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, although diplomats have visited in the past and there are some so-called ""back channels"" used to communicate with Pyongyang. Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? Mr Pompeo's trip was the highest level meeting with a North Korean leader since 2000 when then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader, in Pyongyang. This video can not be played Trump takes credit for the success of the Winter Olympics in South Korea In 2014, the then-head of National Intelligence James Clapper visited North Korea in a secret mission to negotiate the release of two US citizens. Mr Clapper did not meet the North Korean leader during his trip. Mr Trump stunned the international community last month by accepting Pyongyang's suggestion for direct talks. It would be unprecedented for a sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader. He said the summit would take place either in early June or ""a little before that"" and that several sites were under consideration but that none of them were in the US. Analysts have speculated that a location for talks could be the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea, Beijing, another Asian country, Europe or even a vessel in international waters. North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws and UN sanctions. It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles that it says could reach the US. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics in February gave an unexpected window for diplomacy, and in the weeks since there have been a flurry of visits to the North from China, South Korea and now the US. North Korea's surge of friendly visitors The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit Mr Trump's estimate that a meeting could take place in June or earlier appears to be one the administration is taking seriously. But news of Mr Pompeo's visit is also likely to overshadow delicate talks with Japan, a key US ally and neighbour of North Korea. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders (left) was on hand for the meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Abe There have been fears in Tokyo that Mr Trump's plans for bilateral talks could sideline Japan, and Mr Abe is currently in Florida for talks with the US leader. Relations between the two men appeared cordial on this, the second time that Mr Trump has welcomed Mr Abe to his Mar-a-Lago resort. Japan's worries about the Korean detente Mr Trump insisted on Tuesday that the two countries were ""very unified on the subject of North Korea"", and Mr Abe praised the US president's handling of the North Korea issue. However, observers say Mr Abe's goal for his US trip will be to persuade the US president as much as he can not to sway from the West's hard line on Pyongyang. The Japanese prime minister has repeatedly sought to portray a close personal relationship with Mr Trump and was the first foreign leader to meet him in New York after his election victory in 2016.

"This video can not be played A series of questions about Windrush immigration end with heated exchanges between Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May Theresa May has said the decision to destroy the landing cards of Windrush migrants was taken under Labour. The prime minister told MPs she was not home secretary when the move was approved, saying it happened in 2009. She apologised for the distress caused to anyone told they must leave the UK. Labour has disputed her claim, saying the Home Office had said on Tuesday that the decision was taken in 2010 - and is demanding ""clarification"" from Mrs May and Home Secretary Amber Rudd. The Windrush row erupted after it emerged that some children of Caribbean migrants who settled in the UK from the late 1940s to the 1970s had been declared illegal immigrants and threatened with deportation. A Home Office task force,externalset up in response to the outcry is now looking at 113 cases as a result of calls to a new hotline. Prime Minister's Questions: The key bits and the verdict Who are the Windrush generation? 'A nightmare, and it's not over yet' Reality Check: Could you prove you've been living in the UK? Landing cards were filled in by Commonwealth citizens arriving from the West Indies and elsewhere, and were used by officials to help subsequent generations prove they had a right to remain in the UK. They had been stored in a basement for decades but Downing Street says the UK Border Agency approved a business case in June 2009 to dispose of paper records, including the cards. The decision to destroy the cards themselves was taken in October 2010, after the coalition came to power. Mrs May was not involved in the decision, which was taken at official level, said No 10. Anthony Bryan, who came to Britain from Jamaica in 1965, has been detained twice Changes to migration rules introduced when Mrs May was home secretary mean those who lack documents are now being told they need evidence to continue working, access key services or even remain in the UK. Sixty-year-old Anthony Bryan lost his job when he received a letter informing him he had no right to remain in the UK. He says: ""It was a shock because I have always thought I was legal, I was British. I have been here from when I was eight. I didn't give it another thought."" Mr Bryan, who came to Britain from Jamaica in 1965, was held in a detention centre twice for nearly three weeks last year. He has since been given leave to remain, but is still waiting for legal paperwork to confirm his right to stay. This video can not be played A look back at life when the Windrush generation arrived in the UK The Windrush row dominated Prime Minister's Questions, with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accusing the PM of ""pandering to bogus immigration targets"" when she was home secretary and said her efforts to create a ""hostile environment"" for illegal immigrants had caused ""such pain for a whole generation"". ""It led to British citizens being denied NHS treatment, losing their jobs, homes and pensions, thrown into detention centres like criminals and even deported, vital historical records shredded and ministers blaming officials,"" he said. He said the government had shown itself to be ""callous and incompetent"" in the way it had destroyed the Windrush landing cards. The PM said she would not be called ""callous"" by a leader who ""allows anti-Semitism to run rife in his party"". Windrush warning over EU citizens' rights Downing Street said new information was coming to light about the handling of the landing cards all the time, which was why there was a discrepancy between information given out on Tuesday and Wednesday. But a Labour Party spokesman said the government's story was ""shifting by the hour"". ""First Downing Street claimed the decision to destroy the Windrush-era landing cards was made by the Home Office in 2010 for data protection reasons. Then the Home Office passed the buck to a 2010 decision by the UK Border Agency. ""At PMQs, the prime minister tried to shift the blame onto the last Labour government but was undermined by her own spokesperson minutes later, who then stated it was an operational decision, which Labour ministers would not have been aware of. Her spokesperson couldn't even say when the cards were destroyed."" Jacqui Smith, who was Labour home secretary until replaced by Alan Johnson in June 2009, told the BBC that it was ""not a policy decision she had made"". Mr Johnson also said he ""had absolutely no recollection at all of being involved"" in the landing card decision. Albert Thompson was told he would have to pay for his cancer treatment unless he could produce the right documentation The prime minister and Mr Corbyn also clashed over the case of a man denied the NHS cancer treatment to which he was entitled because he did not have the right documentation. Mrs May said Albert Thompson would get the treatment he needed, although he was not a member of the Windrush generation. He is understood to have arrived in the UK from Jamaica in 1973. Mr Corbyn, who first raised his case a month ago, said he was still waiting. Mr Thompson's MP, Chuka Umunna, later suggested the prime minister had ""misled"" MPs over the case. 'I'm an Englishman': Windrush stories The prime minister had begun the session with a fresh apology to the Windrush migrants, saying: ""These people are British. They are part of us."" There was no question of forcing anyone who had made their life in the UK and was here legally to leave, she said. The prime minister also defended Home Secretary Amber Rudd amid Labour calls for her to ""consider her position"". Earlier, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott accused Ms Rudd of withholding information about how many people have been wrongly detained or deported. Allow Twitter content?

"How do you get ready for unprecedented meeting between two wildly unpredictable men. And is there time? Back in September, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un vowed to ""tame"" Donald Trump, deriding the president as a ""mentally deranged US dotard"". President Trump replied by calling Mr Kim a ""maniac"" and a ""madman"", and warning he would be ""tested like never before"". Later they traded barbs over who had a bigger nuclear button. Six months on, those high-stakes playground spats form part of a bizarre diplomatic backdrop to a summit no-one saw coming. Mr Trump surprised the world on Thursday when he announced, via a South Korean official, that he had agreed to meet Mr Kim. The major negotiating point of their meeting will be de-nuclearisation of the North Korean regime. Beyond that, little is yet known about potential objectives and concessions on either side. It is a remarkable gamble by the US president, one that would make him the first American leader to meet a North Korean counterpart. The careful choreography and delicate diplomacy required by international talks have not always come naturally to the Trump team, and now its staff have on their hands one of the most high-profile bilateral summits in US history. The talks are scheduled to take place within two months. For both sides, preparation will be key, but how do you prepare for an unprecedented meeting between two wildly unpredictable men? Reading between the lines of talks announcement The South Korean envoys behind a diplomatic breakthrough Kim's concern for South Korean leader's welfare The US will begin with key Korea positions in the state department vacant. Chief North Korea envoy Joseph Yun resigned in February and the widely expected appointment of Victor Cha as ambassador to Seoul fell through the same month, over a policy disagreement. ""I expect they are going to face a few problems,"" said Jim Hoare, a former British charge d'affaires in Pyongyang, of the American effort. ""If they had a proper apparatus to deal with East Asia, it might be different. But they have only an acting officer in charge of East Asian matters, the state department has been battered and there's no ambassador in South Korea. So I don't know who Trump is talking to about North Korea, I'm not sure anybody does."" The decision to agree to the historic meeting is said to have unfolded in an impulsive and haphazard way not uncommon to the new administration. The New York Times reports that the president, upon hearing that South Korean official Chung Eui-yong was in the White House, summoned Mr Chung to the Oval office and asked about Mr Kim. This video can not be played The South's Chung Eui-yong talks to reporters at the White House When Mr Chung said the North Korean leader wanted to meet Mr Trump, the president immediately agreed and told the South Korean official to make the announcement to the press. Not for the first time, Mr Trump's own Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, was caught on the hop. ""In terms of direct talks... we're a long ways from negotiations,"" Mr Tillerson had told reporters just hours before the surprise announcement. Previous presidents have resisted visiting North Korea, leery of conferring prestige on the regime. Bill Clinton reportedly considered a trip to Pyongyang in late 2000, shortly after a visit by then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had laid potential groundwork, but ultimately focused on late-term priorities elsewhere. This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un ""A meeting with the US president is the coin of the realm,"" said Christopher Hill, a former US ambassador to South Korea, ""and here we have a president just prepared to do it without too many details of what the North Koreans have in mind."" But the president's oft-derided impulsiveness may prove to be an asset in this case, said Stephen Hadley, a former national security adviser to George W Bush. ""His style has already produced a breakthrough,"" said Mr Hadley. ""He was much criticised for rhetoric on North Korea that was viewed as irresponsible and bellicose but it got both North Korea's attention and China's attention. ""The trick now is to convince China that the status quo is not sustainable and convince North Korea that holding on to nuclear weapons might be more of a risk to their security than giving them up. ""And I think Trump's approach has had a pretty good impact in both of those directions already."" The speed of the decision leaves significant details up in the air. The location presents an interesting conundrum. Mr Kim has not left North Korea since becoming leader and is unlikely to accept an invitation to Washington. A visit by Mr Trump to Pyongyang would be a considerable PR gift to the North Koreans and is equally unlikely. ""It's going to be difficult getting the protocol right, who defers to who and under what circumstances etc, so it's important to find a place that's neutral,"" said Mr Hoare. Possible contenders include China, the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas and somewhere in international waters. In 1989, George HW Bush met the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, on a Soviet cruise ship off the coast of Malta. More important still than the location for Mr Trump will be a meticulous understanding of both the US and North Korean objectives. For a president known to struggle with dense briefing papers - preferring instead short, image-led presentations - preparation could be a challenge. ""If he doesn't do the homework he's going to have a problem,"" said Mr Hoare. ""He will be facing people who have been working on US matters for years and years and years. They won't speak but they will have briefed Mr Kim very thoroughly."" Another key consideration will be the way things look. The summit will take place in a media ecosystem completely different to that of 1961, when President John Kennedy met Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna, or of 1972 when Richard Nixon made his famous overture to China. Every word will be covered in real time on cable news, every stray bit of body language subjected to rigorous analysis. But if Mr Trump can avoid diplomatic gaffes and get along well enough with Mr Kim, his straight-shooting style of politics may prove to be as much of an asset in dealing with North Korea as it has been a liability elsewhere. ""He has already surprised a lot of people by bringing Kim to the table,"" said Mr Hadley. ""It just might be that his unconventional style produces a surprising result from the meeting.""

"South Korean President Moon Jae-in - dupe or genius? South Korean leader Moon Jae-in is either a diplomatic genius or a communist set on destroying his country and US President Donald Trump is either a master of brinkmanship or a pawn in a more devious game - depending on who you speak to. But it is the other actor in this saga, Kim Jong-un, the only one who has yet to make a direct statement, who may just be the most significant player in this most extraordinary of political gambles. From the moment he extended an apparent olive branch to the South in his new year message to the cordial delegations to Pyeongchang for the Winter Olympics, it became clear that Kim Jong-un had mastered the most sophisticated crafts of propaganda. Some will viewhis personal invitation to Mr Trump to hold talks with him- as well as the commitment to freeze further nuclear tests - as the real diplomatic masterstroke after a year that was unprecedented for the level of naked hostility the US and the North bared toward one another. But the risk here belongs to both Moon Jae-in and Donald Trump. In a situation where neither can claim sole mastery of the narrative, without a clear exit strategy, and when there are so many definitions for both success and failure, a lot is at stake. Mr Moon is viewed by his supportersas the negotiator-in-chief who has now skilfully managed to get Mr Kim to at least talk about getting rid of nuclear weapons. He is the one who spotted the opportunity duringthe North Korean leader's speech in January- which offered a glimmer of hope that the reclusive state was willing to engage with the South - and grabbed it with both hands. This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un The dizzying level of diplomacy and a frenzy of visits between North and South has now delivered - it seems. ""People are calling this the North Korean charm offensive, I actually think this is a South Korean charm offensive. This is something President Moon Jae-in clearly wanted,"" John Delury from Yonsei University said to me even before the talks were announced. Mr Moon knew his envoys would have to extract the word ""denuclearisation"" from Mr Kim when they visited Pyongyang. He also knew having two of his top level government ministers looking cosy with the North Korean leader would not go down well in Washington or Tokyo. But it was worth the risk. The US would not have considered talking to the communist state without that meeting. His chosen delegates got what they needed. The South Korean leader is also attempting the role of honest broker, handling Mr Trump and Mr Kim at the same time. He is choosing his words carefully and keeping his cards close to his chest while flattering those who respond to the spotlight. Is North Korea just playing the US? US ties any N Korea talks to nuclear arms In his New Year's address he said Mr Trump deserved ""huge credit"" for talks between the two Koreas, knowing it would please him. He is also using language that will reassure a concerned Republican administration.The language of the South Korean statement announcing the talkswas also fulsome in its admiration for Trump's handling of the situation leading up to this moment. Sanctions will stay in place, Mr Moon had said earlier, and Mr Trump has now confirmed that. But everybody knows it wasn't always like that. Just six months ago Mr Trump waspromising to rain down ""fire and fury like the world has never seen""on North Korea if it dare threaten the US. Prof Haksoon Paik, lead researcher at the Sejong Institute, said that threat level felt ""totally unprecedented"". ""President Moon was very much concerned about nuclear threat of war. Kim Jong-un was in the same situation. We were hearing from the likes of the US Senator Lindsay Graham that lives will be lost over here. Donald Trump's unorthodox and unstable leadership had both Korean leaders worried about the potential of military options."" The US has always maintained that the permanent denuclearisation of North Korea is the endgame. Even with all the surprises up to this point, few believe Mr Kim would agree to that so if they don't achieve that what options does Trump have? South Korean officials held a landmark meeting with Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang this week So is Moon Jae-in - and indeed Donald Trump - being manipulated by a North Korea which has fooled the world before? ""By dangling before the US once again 'denuclearization of the Korean peninsula' and 'moratorium on nuclear and missile tests', Kim seeks to weaken sanctions, pre-empt US military pre-emption, and condition the world into accepting North Korea as a legitimate nuclear state,"" says Prof Lee Sung-yoon from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University. For Mr Trump this could be about one of the boldest and most historic moves a US leader has made in foreign relations. If this gamble works out, Mr Trump could credit himself as the president who sorted out North Korea. His administration has had very few victories, despite promising his voters there would ""so much winning."" He believes his ""maximum pressure"" strategy and his work to get China on side and help squeeze Pyongyang economically is working. Protesters in Seoul called for peace talks between the US and North Korea in November Reporters say he casually mentioned in the White House briefing room that he hoped they would give him credit for Kim Jong-un's offer. His voters certainly will. But meeting Mr Kim risks treating the communist leader as an equal. It could be a PR disaster. The date set is also only a few months away - a short time frame to achieve diplomatic goals with a leaderhe mocked as ""little rocket man"" just a few months ago. Prof Robert E Kelly at Busan University in South Korea tweeted: ""Trump doesn't study or even read. He tends to fly wildly off script. And May means there's almost no time for all the staff prep necessary."" Pyongyang has been playing this game for decades. Mr Trump is new to it. He may see a big win on the horizon, but his Art of the Deal book will not be the guide he needs to deal with Kim Jong-un. For Mr Moon this is about history and it is also personal. He played a part in previous attempts to negotiate with North Korea as chief of staff to President Roh Moo-hyun when he met Mr Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, in 2007. That was the last time the leaders of the two Koreas held a summit. A satellite launch by Pyongyang ended the talks. By then around $4.5bn of aid had been sent North during the policy of engagement. Critics believe that money helped to accelerate the weapons programme. North Korea crisis in 300 words Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations? The politics behind the 'peace Olympics' Having failed once before, Mr Moon is trying to complete the work he started, says Duyeon Kim, a senior fellow at the Korean Peninsula Forum. ""He's basically following the same playbook as his two liberal predecessors. It's exactly the kind of thing he would want to pick up and continue."" The border between the North and South is demarcated at the truce village of Panmunjom As a son of refugees from the North, Mr Moon is also aware of the effects of conflict on the peninsula. His parents fled North Korea aboard a UN supply ship in 1950 at the start of the Korean War alongside thousands of other refugees. He told reporters during his election campaign: ""My father fled from the North, hating communism. I myself hate the communist North Korean system. That doesn't mean I should let the people in the North suffer under an oppressive regime."" North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Meet North Korea's first family President Moon has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. Duyeon Kim believes there is a high probability that at the end of this negotiating process, all parties will fail, and North Korea will decide it wants to keep its nuclear weapons. And yet... ""You just don't know. I don't think it's ever a lost cause, in spite of all the doubts and scepticism all parties should go in with clear eyes, but negotiate hard."" North Korea says its long-range missiles protect all of Korea from ""US aggressors"" President Moon's approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. He may suffer politically if this fails but maybe for him, this is not about scoring political points. This is what he told Time magazine last year when he was presidential candidate: ""My mother is the only one [of her family] who fled to the South. [She] is 90 years old. Her younger sister is still in the North alive. My mother's last wish is to see her again."" These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel peace prize. If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship.

"The government has officially confirmed that Franco-Dutch firm Gemalto will make the UK's post-Brexit blue passports. Earlier, the UK's De La Rue said it had abandoned its plan to appeal against the government's decision to award the contract to Gemalto. Chief executive Martin Sutherland told the BBC he remained ""surprised and disappointed"" by the decision. But the Passport Office said the process had been rigorous and fair. It added: ""With a contract value of approximately Â£260m, this will deliver significant savings compared to the Â£400m contract awarded in 2009 and provide value for money to the taxpayer."" The Passport Office said the contract would extend Gemalto's presence in the UK and add about 70 jobs to its existing workforce in the country. De La Rue also issued its second profit warning in less than a month. It said income would be about Â£60m to Â£65m. It blamed Â£4m in costs for tendering to continue making UK passports, as well as delays in other contracts. The burgundy passport, in use since 1988, will revert to its original blue and gold colour from October 2019. Row erupts over post-Brexit passport supplier UK passports: 'The blue belongs to us' De La Rue's Mr Sutherland had initially said the decision to award the contract to Gemalto was ""shocking"" and pledged to appeal. But he told the BBC's Today programme that the firm had now reconsidered. He added: ""We're a business, we have to make pragmatic business decisions. ""We've done our homework, we've taken legal advice, we've looked at, frankly, the likelihood of overturning the decision and the sensible thing for us to do is to refocus our efforts elsewhere and to move forward."" The government granted a two-week extension to the process to decide who would make UK passports after Brexit. That appeal process ended at midnight on Tuesday. A spokesperson for De La Rue, said: ""As we initially announced, we have looked at all possible avenues open to us, and thoroughly evaluated all our options. ""Following four weeks of intense consideration and clear legal advice, we have taken the decision not to challenge the award of the UK passport contract."" This video can not be played De la Rue boss Martin Sutherland claimed: ""It is surprising the British government does not support British industry."" De La Rue has held the contract to manufacture British passports since 2009. It claimed that it had been ""undercut on price"" by Gemalto. The company makes British passports at its Gateshead factory, where it employs around 600 people. Mr Sutherland said: ""We have the contract for another 18 months, that gives us plenty of time to take stock, refocus and drive forward on the international front so we haven't made any decisions about jobs in Gateshead."" De La Rue's share price fell by 4.17% to 471.5p following the announcement which also included its second profit warning since March. Full-year operating profit will fall short of Â£70.2m in operating income for the previous 12 months. As well as the cost of bidding to make post-Brexit passports, it said there had been ""delays in the shipment of certain contracts"" in the last week of the financial year.

"Yulia and Sergei Skripal were critically ill for several weeks The poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal will be discussed at a meeting of the global chemical weapons watchdog later. A report by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on the toxic substance used in Salisbury confirmed the UK's analysis of the type of nerve agent involved. The UK says Russia was behind the attack, but Moscow denies involvement. The meeting in the Netherlands will give Russia and the UK a platform to build their international support. OPCW's summary report, released earlier this month, did not name the nerve agent as Novichok, but said it agreed with the UK's findings on its identity. It does identify the toxic chemical by its complex formula, but only in the classified report that has not been made public. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Who is Sergei Skripal? Yulia Skripal: No-one speaks for me Skripal nerve agent 'was in liquid form' Russian and British ambassadors in the Netherlands are due to attend the OPCW meeting. BBC News foreign correspondent Anna Holligan said at the UK will probably propose a resolution asking for the report's findings to be adopted. The UK has already called for a UN Security Council meeting on the OPCW report, which could be held this week. ""But there's a sense, after Salisbury, and with heightened tensions in Syria, neither side has much appetite for an escalation,"" our correspondent added. The OPCW does not have the power to apply sanctions or assign blame. It comes after the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the nerve agent used in Salisbury was delivered ""in a liquid form"". Only ""a very small amount"" was used on Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who were found unconscious on a bench on 4 March. A massive clean-up operation is beginning to decontaminate nine sites in the city - it will take several months and cost millions of pounds. Mr Skripal, 66, is said to be recovering slowly but is expected to be discharged eventually.His 33-year-old daughter left hospital earlier this month. Defra said the highest concentration of military grade Novichok nerve agent was found at Mr Skripal's house, but eight other sites are known, or thought, to be contaminated. They include ambulance stations and a police car compound, as well as a Zizzi restaurant and the Mill pub, where the Skripals spent time on the day they fell ill. The nerve agent does not evaporate or disappear over time, experts said, and intense cleaning with caustic chemicals is required to get rid of it. The Skripals' poisoning has triggered a diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West, with more than 20 countries expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK.

"The UK's biggest coffee chain Costa Coffee has said it will recycle as many disposable cups as it sells by 2020 in a ""cup recycling revolution"". Under the scheme, 500 million coffee cups a year would be recycled, including some sold by rivals, it said. It will encourage waste collection firms to collect the cups by paying them a supplement of Â£70 a tonne. About 2.5 billion disposable coffee cups are thrown away each year in the UK and99.75% are not recycled. They have a mixture of paper and plastic in their inner lining - designed to make them both heat- and leak-proof. Plastic recycling: Why are 99.75% of coffee cups not recycled? Waitrose to stop using disposable coffee cups Four solutions to the disposable coffee cup problem 'Latte levy': Would you pay 25p for your coffee cup? Environmental campaigners have welcomed Costa's move. Costa managing director Dominic Paul told the BBC the move was ""a cup-recycling revolution"". ""By the end of 2020, we'll effectively be cup-neutral. We'll be recycling as many cups as we put into the system,"" he said. Costa said ""misconceptions"" had arisen about whether a coffee cup could be recycled because of the plastic layer, which had ""previously been considered difficult to separate"". However, the chain, which has more than 2,380 branches in the UK,  said: ""The actual issue lies in collecting the cups once they have been disposed of correctly."" Costa and other coffee chains do have recycling collection points for cups in their branches, but most takeaway coffees are consumed elsewhere, including in offices and on the street. Under its new scheme, Costa will pay a supplement of Â£70 for every tonne of cups collected to waste collectors, plus Â£5 per tonne to to a firm that will check the scheme is running as it should. As a result, waste collectors will get on average Â£120 for every tonne of cups they collect, up from Â£50 - a 150% increase. The idea is to make it ""commercially and financially attractive"" for waste collectors to put in place infrastructure to handle the cups - from installing collection points in offices and elsewhere, to sorting them and taking them to recycling plants. Five waste collection firms have been involved in developing the new scheme: Veolia, Biffa, Suez, Grundon and First Mile. Grundon's sales and marketing director, Bradley Smith, said Costa was helping to create the right conditions for paper cups to become a valuable recycled material. ""This provides increased stability and confidence in the market, which will help waste management companies like Grundon to extend paper cup recycling services to more customers,"" he added. Welcoming the announcement, Gavin Ellis, co-founder of environmental charity Hubbub, said there had been a significant increase in the UK's recycling facilities over recent months, and ""the biggest challenge now is to make sure the used cups are collected and make it to the recycling plants"". And Environment Minister Therese Coffey congratulated Costa on taking a ""significant step to help coffee lovers do the right thing and increase recycling"".

"Facebook says its face-matching tech is a way for users to learn if they are in a photo even if not tagged Facebook has started asking European and Canadian users to let it use facial recognition technology to identify them in photos and videos. Facebook originally began face-matching users outside Canada in 2011, but stopped doing so for EU citizens the following year after protests from regulators and privacy campaigners. The new request is one of several opt-in permissions being rolled out in advance of a new data privacy law. The move is likely to be controversial. The company is currently embroiled in a privacy scandal related to the use of its members' personal information by thepolitical consultancy Cambridge Analytica. The social network is also facing aclass-action lawsuit in the USfor deploying the facial recognition technology there without users' explicit consent. ""Biometric identification and tracking across the billions of photos on the platform exacerbates serious privacy risks to users,"" commented Silkie Carlo, director of UK civil liberties group Big Brother Watch. ""Facebook now has a duty to prove it has learned how to respect the law, not to prove it can take its surveillance capabilities to new depths."" Facebook facial recognition faces class-action suit Will technology destroy our democracy? University saw 'no issue' with Facebook research Users outside the EU and Canada will be prompted to review a similar set of privacy controls in the coming months, but they will continue to be subject to facial recognition unless they opt out of the system. Thefacial recognition facility works,externalby assigning each user a unique number called a template. This is calculated by analysing the way they look in their profile photograph and other images they have already been identified in. Untagged faces are then represented in a similar manner and compared to the database of templates. When a match is found, Facebook prompts both the person posting an image and the people appearing in it to apply the relevant name tags. In addition, it uses the tech to detect when a scammer is attempting to use a stolen photo as their profile picture. It also helps Facebook to offer new ""friends"" suggestions. When new connections are made, users have more reason to spend longer on Facebook's app and website. This lets the firm show them more adverts while also helping it learn more about their interests, which in turn lets it better target future ads. The new settings are being deployed ahead of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which comes into force on 25 May. The law tightens existing privacy rules, forbids the use of pre-ticked boxes for consent, and increases the amount organisations can be fined for non-compliance. Users can either agree to face recognition with a single button press or click through other pages to be given the choice of refusing Under the new system, users click a single button saying ""accept and continue"" to turn on face recognition, but have to delve deeper into the ""manage data setting"" options to confirm they want it turned off. As has previously been the case, Facebook will not include under-18s in its face-matching database. And it has said that if users opt in but subsequently change their minds, it will delete their face templates, making further matches impossible. Even so, the data watchdog involved has yet to sign off on the proposal. ""There are a number of outstanding issues on which we await further responses from Facebook,"" Ireland's data protection commissioner told the BBC. ""In particular, the Irish DPC is querying the technology around facial recognition and whether Facebook needs to scan all faces - ie those without consent as well - to use the facial recognition technology. ""The issue of compliance of this feature with GDPR is therefore not settled at this point."" Facebook will initially present the new settings pages to EU citizens before rolling versions out worldwide Facebook will also be asking for the following consent to meet its new obligations: if a member has added information about their religious views, political beliefs or sexuality, they will be asked whether they agree to continue allowing that information to be displayed to others and whether they permit Facebook to use the data to provide personalised recommendations users will be asked if they authorise data gathered from elsewhere - including third-party websites and apps - to be used to pick which ads are shown to them on Facebook and Instagram Under GDPR, children are also afforded added protections, which the EU's members can decide to limit to those under 13 or extend to those under 16. Facebook already bans under-13s from being members. But in affected countries, it will now ask under-16s for the permission of a parent or guardian to: show adverts based on their interests include their religious and political views in their profiles allow them to express their sexuality by registering whether they are ""interested in"" men, women or both To do this, the firm will either require them to send a permission request via Facebook itself or provide an email address that the older party can be reached at. In the case of the latter, the company has confirmed that it will rely on the youngsters to provide an accurate address and does not plan its own identity checks.

"Wish claims to have more than 300 million users worldwide A US online retailer has been reprimanded for promoting an explicit ad for a penis extender strap within video games played by children. UK watchdog the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) said that Wish.com had behaved ""irresponsibly"" and must ensure its adverts were properly targeted at appropriate age groups in the future. It marks the third time in five months that the San Francisco-based firm has been found to have breached the rules. In each case it has failed to respond. The powers the ASA has to punish offenders are limited, but it told the BBC it would ""continue to apply pressure on Wish.com where necessary"". An animated version of these images appeared within the games (the black boxes have been added by the BBC) The latest ruling concerns an advert that appeared on 26 November. It showed an animated image of a penis above a second animation of the strap being applied. Members of the public reported seeing the imagery in two puzzle-themed apps: Zynga's Crazy Cake Swap and Ketchapp's 2048. Both have a Pegi 3 rating, meaning they had been judged to be suitable for all ages by Europe's video games ratings authority. In addition, the ad was also spotted in Peel Smart Remote, a TV remote control app. Ketchapp said it believed that it should not be held responsible for ads served up in its software, but added that it had increased the age rating of all of its games in response to the complaint. Crazy Cake Swap challenges players to solve puzzles to become ""the best baker in the land"" The ASA said that Zynga did not respond to its inquiries while Peel Technologies' reply was not substantive. ""We considered that given the content of the apps, they were likely to have a broad appeal to all ages including children,"" the watchdog's ruling stated. ""The ad must not appear again in an untargeted medium."" Tom Daley swimming pool selfie advert banned Amazon ads 'misled' customers over savings Poundland's naughty elf deemed 'irresponsible' Wish did not reply to the BBC's request for comment. The ruling comes just a week after the ASA upheld other complaints made against Wish and its parent Contextlogic. These followed itspromotion of adverts,externalfeaturing a baby wearing ripped shorts that exposed its bottom ""for no reason that was relevant to the product"". In some cases the photo appeared alongside a picture of a woman wearing an unzipped cat suit, who was also exposing parts of her buttocks. These adverts had appeared on Facebook as well as an unidentified app, and were judged to be ""offensive"". Prior to this, the ASA criticised Wish in November for an ad featuring a ""red and bloody"" temporary tattoo placed on a woman's shoulder. It had appearedin the game Simon's Cat Crunch Timelast July. The authority said that children who had seen it might have suffered distress. This Wish.com ad was spotted within the game app on 24 July The ASA does not have the power to impose fines. However, it told the BBC it had taken other action to tackle the problem. ""In all three rulings against Wish.com, we have directly contacted the media owners and planners who have been involved in the placement of Wish.com's ads,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""We have since received assurances from these media owners and planners that they will either refuse future advertising from Wish.com or adapt their processes to ensure more appropriate ad targeting.""

"Yulia and Sergei Skripal were critically ill for several weeks The poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal will be discussed at a meeting of the global chemical weapons watchdog later. A report by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons on the toxic substance used in Salisbury confirmed the UK's analysis of the type of nerve agent involved. The UK says Russia was behind the attack, but Moscow denies involvement. The meeting in the Netherlands will give Russia and the UK a platform to build their international support. OPCW's summary report, released earlier this month, did not name the nerve agent as Novichok, but said it agreed with the UK's findings on its identity. It does identify the toxic chemical by its complex formula, but only in the classified report that has not been made public. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Who is Sergei Skripal? Yulia Skripal: No-one speaks for me Skripal nerve agent 'was in liquid form' Russian and British ambassadors in the Netherlands are due to attend the OPCW meeting. BBC News foreign correspondent Anna Holligan said at the UK will probably propose a resolution asking for the report's findings to be adopted. The UK has already called for a UN Security Council meeting on the OPCW report, which could be held this week. ""But there's a sense, after Salisbury, and with heightened tensions in Syria, neither side has much appetite for an escalation,"" our correspondent added. The OPCW does not have the power to apply sanctions or assign blame. It comes after the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the nerve agent used in Salisbury was delivered ""in a liquid form"". Only ""a very small amount"" was used on Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia, who were found unconscious on a bench on 4 March. A massive clean-up operation is beginning to decontaminate nine sites in the city - it will take several months and cost millions of pounds. Mr Skripal, 66, is said to be recovering slowly but is expected to be discharged eventually.His 33-year-old daughter left hospital earlier this month. Defra said the highest concentration of military grade Novichok nerve agent was found at Mr Skripal's house, but eight other sites are known, or thought, to be contaminated. They include ambulance stations and a police car compound, as well as a Zizzi restaurant and the Mill pub, where the Skripals spent time on the day they fell ill. The nerve agent does not evaporate or disappear over time, experts said, and intense cleaning with caustic chemicals is required to get rid of it. The Skripals' poisoning has triggered a diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West, with more than 20 countries expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK.

"Left out in the cold by the US? It is no exaggeration to say that the bolt out of the blue commitment by US President Donald Trump to sit down for talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has had a severe impact on Japan's government. A carefully crafted, US-Japan co-ordinated strategy - of unremitting political and economic pressure on North Korea - has been a replaced by a new unilateral US policy of (albeit perhaps temporary) moderation. The shift is informed by Mr Trump's confident optimism that he will be able to reach a deal to negotiate away the North's nuclear weapons and advanced missile programme. But the unexpected talks will have an impact in Japan not unlike the July 1971 announcement by then President Richard Nixon that he planned to travel to Beijing to meet Chairman Mao Zedong. At that time, Japan's leaders experienced the ""nightmare"" they had struggled to avoid for the best part of two decades. In an instant, and with barely 20 minutes of advance notice, the Japanese government had been informed that the Cold War policy of ""containment"" of China - that it had loyally sought to adhere to at the prompting of successive US administrations since 1950 - had been unilaterally ditched. Japan was left isolated and betrayed by its senior allied partner, creating a residue of distrust that rattled bilateral ties between Washington and Tokyo for years to come. For Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,Mr Trump's diplomatic handbrake turn on North Koreacould not have come at a worse time. Mr Abe met Donald Trump even before he was sworn in Having rushed to Washingtonto be the first foreign leader to meet with the president-elect in November of 2016, and relying on careful diplomatic preparation to better understand and manage America's new, mercurial and self-regarding leader, Abe may be forgiven for confidently thinking that his successful Trump Tower visit had given him an advantage with the president. This confidence has suddenly evaporated. The Abe administration now appears not only dismayed by the lack of consultation from their US partner, but also deeply alarmed by two potential scenarios. Historically, Japan has worried about the twin danger of being either abandoned or entrapped by its US ally. These fears are now dominating Japan's anxious assessment of what may happen at the May summit between Mr Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un. When Trump meets Kim: The political gamble of the 21st Century The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit US-N Korea talks: What could happen now? Fear number one is that a transactional Trump, intent on getting an agreement with Kim to succeed where his presidential predecessors have failed, and to deflect attention away from his domestic political troublesarising from the Robert Mueller investigation, will sell the US-Japan alliance short. The worry for Japan is that the president, in order to meet the North Korean demand for a security guarantee, will agree either to a dramatic reduction of US forces from the region (some or all of the 28,500 troops in South Korea or the 50,000 or so troops in Japan) or focus exclusively on US strategic interests at the expense of alliance interests. Mr Trump may confine himself to the long-range nuclear-armed missile challenge to the US, and he may be tempted to ignore or overlook the medium-range missile threat to Japan or other political concerns, including the unresolved fate of Japan's ""abductees"", citizens kidnapped from Japan by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s. North Korea's history of foreign assassinations and kidnappings North Korea-Trump talks in 400 words What damage could North Korea do? Fear number two is that the May summit will fail to produce an agreement, and that a disgruntled Trump, having run out of diplomatic road, will feel that he has no choice but to order a military attack against the North. War on the peninsula will then drag Japan, as America's ally, into a hugely costly and destructive war that will expose the country and its citizens to massive existential risk. Trump's latest decision to replace the diplomacy-favouring Secretary of State Rex Tillersonwith a more hawkish Mike Pompeo, who backs using military force against the North, has only heightened these fears of alliance entrapment. Where it went wrong for Rex Battles ahead after another Trump sacking Compounding this strategic, international crisis, is Mr Abe's exposure on the home front. A long-simmering corruption and influence-peddling scandal dating from 2017 has suddenly re-surfaced, precisely at the same time as the Korea crisis. The scandal risks implicating the prime minister's wife Akie Abe. She allegedly helped lobby for a deal allowing a controversial Osaka based school, Moritomo Gakuen, to buy state-owned land at massively reduced prices (86% below market value) on which to build a primary school. Critics say the school paid far less than market price for the land in Osaka Reports in early March by Japan's progressive daily newspaper, Asahi Shimbun, suggest that officials from Japan's finance ministry, which was responsible for managing the land-deal, had selectively and deliberately removed from a number of documents submitted to Japan's parliament critical details highlighting the role of Mrs Abe and some of the questionable circumstances surrounding the land deal. The scandal has already had a number of dramatic effects. On 9 March a local official from the Osaka finance bureau killed himself, prompting suggestions that it was a result of the scandal. At the national level, the controversy has created sharp tensions between the cabinet and the parliament, with leading opposition politicians arguing that the government has actively sought to deceive the legislature - a grave charge in a political system that places a premium on parliamentary scrutiny. In response, a senior bureaucrat, Nobuhisa Sagawa, the former head of the national tax agency and previously in charge of the finance ministry section responsible for handling the land-sale, has been forced to resign. His immediate boss, Taro Aso - the finance minister and deputy prime minister - is also under pressure to resign, not only from opposition politicians but even from some of his colleagues in the governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). The worry for Mr Abe is that the scandal will lead to demands for his resignation and potentially might even bring down his cabinet. When the scandal first emerged in February of 2017, he publicly stated he would resign if it was revealed that either he or his wife had influenced the land-sale. The latest revelations make it harder for him to dispel the impression that there may have been some undue influence, if only implicitly. For now, Mr Aso, the finance minister, has made it clear that he has no intention to go, and Abe has defended keeping him in post in order to get to the bottom of the procedural irregularities in the finance ministry. However, there are two more compelling reasons for the prime minister to protect his colleague: First, so long as Mr Aso stays in post, he acts as a political human shield for the prime minister, insulating him from direct criticism. Second, Mr Aso leads the second largest of the LDP's political factions and as such can deliver a critical number of party votes for the forthcoming LDP presidential election in September of this year. Tensions over North Korea might unite voters behind Mr Abe Mr Abe hopes to win the election, securing in the process a third term as party leader and a minimum of three more years as prime minister. It is too early to tell how much damage this second crisis will inflict on Mr Abe. The latest opinion polls reveal a 6% drop in the popularity of the government from 54% to 48%. While bad news for the prime minister,the drop has not been as fast or as pronounced as that which took place in 2017when the scandal first broke. Moreover, there is little evidence, so far, that the controversy is boosting the position of the opposition parties, which remain far less popular than the LDP. Paradoxically, the lifeline for the prime minister may be the North Korean crisis. The Japanese public is made increasingly anxious by developments on the peninsula and remains eager to see the May summit talks succeed. From the perspective of Japan's voters, success here most likely requires a stable and experienced government at the helm in Tokyo. Good governance, good relationships (whether personal or national) and effective alliances depend on trust. It remains to be seen whether trust can be restored and maintained between both the governments of the United States and Japan and between Mr Abe and the Japanese electorate.

"The US and China have imposed tariffs on each other's goods. But will a skirmish between the world's two biggest economies turn into a full-on trade war? Perhaps it has already started. Both sides have struck initial blows. The US has imposed tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium. Countries accounting for the bulk of those imports have been exempted (possibly temporarily), but China is not among them. For its part, China has struck back with tariffs on US goods including pork, wine, fruit and nuts. So, when does a series of commercial skirmishes become a trade war? There's no real quantitative definition, but the US and China have taken steps and engaged in rhetoric - with the potential for the war of words to escalate into an economically serious conflict. Despite this, the amount of trade affected by these measures so far is fairly modest. Last year, the US imported something in the region of $3bn (Â£2.12bn) worth of steel and aluminium from China.  That's less than 1% of total US imports of Chinese goods. China's retaliation is aimed at about the same amount of trade, but it is a larger share of total imports from the US (about 2%). It's also arguable that the steel and aluminium tariffs are not really trade war measures, as they are not specifically directed at China. The US has justified the action on national security grounds, suggesting that the country's military should not be so dependent on imports of the metals.  And China is not the only country on the receiving end of the new measures, even after all the exemptions. But there are more measures in the pipeline. The scope is larger and it is very much directed at China. US President Donald Trump has proposed additional tariffs specifically on Chinese goods, with the objective of persuading China to end what he calls the theft of American intellectual property - such as technology and copyright. It's one element in a wider complaint (shared with many others inside the US and beyond) that China trades unfairly. The proposal would affect more than 10 times as much trade. China has responded with proposals that would affect a similar amount of imports from the US, including soybeans and cars. This second round of proposals really does have the potential to have a bigger impact.  In the case of China's threat, it would cover more than one third of the goods it currently buys from the US. But, unlike the steel and aluminium spat, so far they are just proposals. In the 1960s, chicken became the focus of a major dispute US officials have said are they are ready to talk with China. It's also striking that both sides are making use of the procedures available in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to reduce the risks of disputes escalating. The US, for example, has asked for consultations with China on intellectual property - the first stage in the WTO's dispute system, which can lead to an independent panel being established to rule on whether the rules have been broken.  These panels can authorise a country sinned against to retaliate with its own tariffs. It must be said that both sides appear reluctant to give the WTO's dispute procedure time to reach a conclusion. It does take many months - sometimes years. And of course the judgement won't inevitably be what the complaining country wants. Even if they do retaliate without having been authorised by the WTO, the fact that both are making use of the procedure suggests they attach some value to the rules-based system that the organisation manages. Trade rows in the 1930s have been blamed for worsening the Great Depression There have been many trade spats before. George W Bush announced steel tariffs early in his presidency and the EU got as far as drawing up a list of products for retaliatory tariffs, in addition to filing a complaint in the WTO along with several other countries. But the retaliation didn't actually happen, as the US withdrew the steel tariffs after an adverse ruling from the WTO. There was askirmish in the 1960s known as the ""chicken war"".,externalGermany and France imposed tariffs on chicken imports in response to cheap imports from the US. The US fought back with tariffs on potato starch, dextrin, brandy and light trucks.  Half a century on most of this is history. But the 25% tariff on light trucks into the US remains. The really big dispute was during the 1930s, when many countries raised trade barriers. That probably aggravated and prolonged the Great Depression. There's no question that the rhetoric this time round is heated. But the blows actually struck have not yet been that severe.  That could change. But the relatively mild reaction of financial markets suggests investors at least think there is a decent chance of avoiding an all-out trade war.

"South Korean President Moon Jae-in - dupe or genius? South Korean leader Moon Jae-in is either a diplomatic genius or a communist set on destroying his country and US President Donald Trump is either a master of brinkmanship or a pawn in a more devious game - depending on who you speak to. But it is the other actor in this saga, Kim Jong-un, the only one who has yet to make a direct statement, who may just be the most significant player in this most extraordinary of political gambles. From the moment he extended an apparent olive branch to the South in his new year message to the cordial delegations to Pyeongchang for the Winter Olympics, it became clear that Kim Jong-un had mastered the most sophisticated crafts of propaganda. Some will viewhis personal invitation to Mr Trump to hold talks with him- as well as the commitment to freeze further nuclear tests - as the real diplomatic masterstroke after a year that was unprecedented for the level of naked hostility the US and the North bared toward one another. But the risk here belongs to both Moon Jae-in and Donald Trump. In a situation where neither can claim sole mastery of the narrative, without a clear exit strategy, and when there are so many definitions for both success and failure, a lot is at stake. Mr Moon is viewed by his supportersas the negotiator-in-chief who has now skilfully managed to get Mr Kim to at least talk about getting rid of nuclear weapons. He is the one who spotted the opportunity duringthe North Korean leader's speech in January- which offered a glimmer of hope that the reclusive state was willing to engage with the South - and grabbed it with both hands. This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un The dizzying level of diplomacy and a frenzy of visits between North and South has now delivered - it seems. ""People are calling this the North Korean charm offensive, I actually think this is a South Korean charm offensive. This is something President Moon Jae-in clearly wanted,"" John Delury from Yonsei University said to me even before the talks were announced. Mr Moon knew his envoys would have to extract the word ""denuclearisation"" from Mr Kim when they visited Pyongyang. He also knew having two of his top level government ministers looking cosy with the North Korean leader would not go down well in Washington or Tokyo. But it was worth the risk. The US would not have considered talking to the communist state without that meeting. His chosen delegates got what they needed. The South Korean leader is also attempting the role of honest broker, handling Mr Trump and Mr Kim at the same time. He is choosing his words carefully and keeping his cards close to his chest while flattering those who respond to the spotlight. Is North Korea just playing the US? US ties any N Korea talks to nuclear arms In his New Year's address he said Mr Trump deserved ""huge credit"" for talks between the two Koreas, knowing it would please him. He is also using language that will reassure a concerned Republican administration.The language of the South Korean statement announcing the talkswas also fulsome in its admiration for Trump's handling of the situation leading up to this moment. Sanctions will stay in place, Mr Moon had said earlier, and Mr Trump has now confirmed that. But everybody knows it wasn't always like that. Just six months ago Mr Trump waspromising to rain down ""fire and fury like the world has never seen""on North Korea if it dare threaten the US. Prof Haksoon Paik, lead researcher at the Sejong Institute, said that threat level felt ""totally unprecedented"". ""President Moon was very much concerned about nuclear threat of war. Kim Jong-un was in the same situation. We were hearing from the likes of the US Senator Lindsay Graham that lives will be lost over here. Donald Trump's unorthodox and unstable leadership had both Korean leaders worried about the potential of military options."" The US has always maintained that the permanent denuclearisation of North Korea is the endgame. Even with all the surprises up to this point, few believe Mr Kim would agree to that so if they don't achieve that what options does Trump have? South Korean officials held a landmark meeting with Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang this week So is Moon Jae-in - and indeed Donald Trump - being manipulated by a North Korea which has fooled the world before? ""By dangling before the US once again 'denuclearization of the Korean peninsula' and 'moratorium on nuclear and missile tests', Kim seeks to weaken sanctions, pre-empt US military pre-emption, and condition the world into accepting North Korea as a legitimate nuclear state,"" says Prof Lee Sung-yoon from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University. For Mr Trump this could be about one of the boldest and most historic moves a US leader has made in foreign relations. If this gamble works out, Mr Trump could credit himself as the president who sorted out North Korea. His administration has had very few victories, despite promising his voters there would ""so much winning."" He believes his ""maximum pressure"" strategy and his work to get China on side and help squeeze Pyongyang economically is working. Protesters in Seoul called for peace talks between the US and North Korea in November Reporters say he casually mentioned in the White House briefing room that he hoped they would give him credit for Kim Jong-un's offer. His voters certainly will. But meeting Mr Kim risks treating the communist leader as an equal. It could be a PR disaster. The date set is also only a few months away - a short time frame to achieve diplomatic goals with a leaderhe mocked as ""little rocket man"" just a few months ago. Prof Robert E Kelly at Busan University in South Korea tweeted: ""Trump doesn't study or even read. He tends to fly wildly off script. And May means there's almost no time for all the staff prep necessary."" Pyongyang has been playing this game for decades. Mr Trump is new to it. He may see a big win on the horizon, but his Art of the Deal book will not be the guide he needs to deal with Kim Jong-un. For Mr Moon this is about history and it is also personal. He played a part in previous attempts to negotiate with North Korea as chief of staff to President Roh Moo-hyun when he met Mr Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, in 2007. That was the last time the leaders of the two Koreas held a summit. A satellite launch by Pyongyang ended the talks. By then around $4.5bn of aid had been sent North during the policy of engagement. Critics believe that money helped to accelerate the weapons programme. North Korea crisis in 300 words Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations? The politics behind the 'peace Olympics' Having failed once before, Mr Moon is trying to complete the work he started, says Duyeon Kim, a senior fellow at the Korean Peninsula Forum. ""He's basically following the same playbook as his two liberal predecessors. It's exactly the kind of thing he would want to pick up and continue."" The border between the North and South is demarcated at the truce village of Panmunjom As a son of refugees from the North, Mr Moon is also aware of the effects of conflict on the peninsula. His parents fled North Korea aboard a UN supply ship in 1950 at the start of the Korean War alongside thousands of other refugees. He told reporters during his election campaign: ""My father fled from the North, hating communism. I myself hate the communist North Korean system. That doesn't mean I should let the people in the North suffer under an oppressive regime."" North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Meet North Korea's first family President Moon has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. Duyeon Kim believes there is a high probability that at the end of this negotiating process, all parties will fail, and North Korea will decide it wants to keep its nuclear weapons. And yet... ""You just don't know. I don't think it's ever a lost cause, in spite of all the doubts and scepticism all parties should go in with clear eyes, but negotiate hard."" North Korea says its long-range missiles protect all of Korea from ""US aggressors"" President Moon's approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. He may suffer politically if this fails but maybe for him, this is not about scoring political points. This is what he told Time magazine last year when he was presidential candidate: ""My mother is the only one [of her family] who fled to the South. [She] is 90 years old. Her younger sister is still in the North alive. My mother's last wish is to see her again."" These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read.

"Mr Pompeo's mission reportedly was to prepare for the Trump-Kim summit CIA director Mike Pompeo travelled to Pyongyang for a secret meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, US President Donald Trump has confirmed. A ""good relationship"" was formed at the meeting last week, Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday. News of the visit first emerged on Tuesday. US officials were quoted as saying the aim was to prepare a summit between Mr Trump and Mr Kim. Mr Trump had earlier alluded to high-level direct talks with Pyongyang. But the unexpected and clandestine meeting marks the highest level US contact with North Korea since 2000. ""We have had direct talks at... extremely high levels,"" Mr Trump said from Florida, where he is hosting Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The president added that he gave his ""blessing"" for talks between the South and North to discuss a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-1953 Korean War. North Korea crisis in 300 words The political gamble of the 21st Century South Korea has also signalled that it may pursue a formal resolution of the conflict. South Korea's President Moon Jae-in and Mr Kim are due to meet next week. The two sides have agreed to broadcast parts of the summit live, the South's state news agency Yonhap reported. The news that Mr Pompeo had travelled to North Korea fora clandestine meeting with Mr Kim,externalwas first reported by The Washington Post. The trip took place shortly after Mr Pompeo was nominated by Mr Trump to replace Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, two anonymous sources ""with direct knowledge of the trip"" told the newspaper. Later Reuters news agency said the report had been confirmed to them by senior officials. Early on Wednesday, Mr Trump confirmed the reports with a tweet. Allow Twitter content?

Very little is known about the talks other than that they were to prepare for the forthcoming Trump-Kim summit. Mr Pompeo is predicted to be confirmed as the top US diplomat by the Republican-controlled Senate in coming weeks. This is despite mounting speculation that he will, unusually, fail to receive the backing of the bipartisan Senate Foreign Relations Committee followinga grilling of more than five hoursby the committee last week. The US does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea, although diplomats have visited in the past and there are some so-called ""back channels"" used to communicate with Pyongyang. Did sanctions push N Korea into US talks? Mr Pompeo's trip was the highest level meeting with a North Korean leader since 2000 when then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met Kim Jong-il, the father of the current leader, in Pyongyang. This video can not be played Trump takes credit for the success of the Winter Olympics in South Korea In 2014, the then-head of National Intelligence James Clapper visited North Korea in a secret mission to negotiate the release of two US citizens. Mr Clapper did not meet the North Korean leader during his trip. Mr Trump stunned the international community last month by accepting Pyongyang's suggestion for direct talks. It would be unprecedented for a sitting US president to meet a North Korean leader. He said the summit would take place either in early June or ""a little before that"" and that several sites were under consideration but that none of them were in the US. Analysts have speculated that a location for talks could be the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea, Beijing, another Asian country, Europe or even a vessel in international waters. North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its well-documented human rights abuses and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws and UN sanctions. It has carried out six nuclear tests, and has missiles that it says could reach the US. But South Korea's hosting of the Winter Olympics in February gave an unexpected window for diplomacy, and in the weeks since there have been a flurry of visits to the North from China, South Korea and now the US. North Korea's surge of friendly visitors The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit Mr Trump's estimate that a meeting could take place in June or earlier appears to be one the administration is taking seriously. But news of Mr Pompeo's visit is also likely to overshadow delicate talks with Japan, a key US ally and neighbour of North Korea. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders (left) was on hand for the meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Abe There have been fears in Tokyo that Mr Trump's plans for bilateral talks could sideline Japan, and Mr Abe is currently in Florida for talks with the US leader. Relations between the two men appeared cordial on this, the second time that Mr Trump has welcomed Mr Abe to his Mar-a-Lago resort. Japan's worries about the Korean detente Mr Trump insisted on Tuesday that the two countries were ""very unified on the subject of North Korea"", and Mr Abe praised the US president's handling of the North Korea issue. However, observers say Mr Abe's goal for his US trip will be to persuade the US president as much as he can not to sway from the West's hard line on Pyongyang. The Japanese prime minister has repeatedly sought to portray a close personal relationship with Mr Trump and was the first foreign leader to meet him in New York after his election victory in 2016.

"How do you get ready for unprecedented meeting between two wildly unpredictable men. And is there time? Back in September, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un vowed to ""tame"" Donald Trump, deriding the president as a ""mentally deranged US dotard"". President Trump replied by calling Mr Kim a ""maniac"" and a ""madman"", and warning he would be ""tested like never before"". Later they traded barbs over who had a bigger nuclear button. Six months on, those high-stakes playground spats form part of a bizarre diplomatic backdrop to a summit no-one saw coming. Mr Trump surprised the world on Thursday when he announced, via a South Korean official, that he had agreed to meet Mr Kim. The major negotiating point of their meeting will be de-nuclearisation of the North Korean regime. Beyond that, little is yet known about potential objectives and concessions on either side. It is a remarkable gamble by the US president, one that would make him the first American leader to meet a North Korean counterpart. The careful choreography and delicate diplomacy required by international talks have not always come naturally to the Trump team, and now its staff have on their hands one of the most high-profile bilateral summits in US history. The talks are scheduled to take place within two months. For both sides, preparation will be key, but how do you prepare for an unprecedented meeting between two wildly unpredictable men? Reading between the lines of talks announcement The South Korean envoys behind a diplomatic breakthrough Kim's concern for South Korean leader's welfare The US will begin with key Korea positions in the state department vacant. Chief North Korea envoy Joseph Yun resigned in February and the widely expected appointment of Victor Cha as ambassador to Seoul fell through the same month, over a policy disagreement. ""I expect they are going to face a few problems,"" said Jim Hoare, a former British charge d'affaires in Pyongyang, of the American effort. ""If they had a proper apparatus to deal with East Asia, it might be different. But they have only an acting officer in charge of East Asian matters, the state department has been battered and there's no ambassador in South Korea. So I don't know who Trump is talking to about North Korea, I'm not sure anybody does."" The decision to agree to the historic meeting is said to have unfolded in an impulsive and haphazard way not uncommon to the new administration. The New York Times reports that the president, upon hearing that South Korean official Chung Eui-yong was in the White House, summoned Mr Chung to the Oval office and asked about Mr Kim. This video can not be played The South's Chung Eui-yong talks to reporters at the White House When Mr Chung said the North Korean leader wanted to meet Mr Trump, the president immediately agreed and told the South Korean official to make the announcement to the press. Not for the first time, Mr Trump's own Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, was caught on the hop. ""In terms of direct talks... we're a long ways from negotiations,"" Mr Tillerson had told reporters just hours before the surprise announcement. Previous presidents have resisted visiting North Korea, leery of conferring prestige on the regime. Bill Clinton reportedly considered a trip to Pyongyang in late 2000, shortly after a visit by then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had laid potential groundwork, but ultimately focused on late-term priorities elsewhere. This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un ""A meeting with the US president is the coin of the realm,"" said Christopher Hill, a former US ambassador to South Korea, ""and here we have a president just prepared to do it without too many details of what the North Koreans have in mind."" But the president's oft-derided impulsiveness may prove to be an asset in this case, said Stephen Hadley, a former national security adviser to George W Bush. ""His style has already produced a breakthrough,"" said Mr Hadley. ""He was much criticised for rhetoric on North Korea that was viewed as irresponsible and bellicose but it got both North Korea's attention and China's attention. ""The trick now is to convince China that the status quo is not sustainable and convince North Korea that holding on to nuclear weapons might be more of a risk to their security than giving them up. ""And I think Trump's approach has had a pretty good impact in both of those directions already."" The speed of the decision leaves significant details up in the air. The location presents an interesting conundrum. Mr Kim has not left North Korea since becoming leader and is unlikely to accept an invitation to Washington. A visit by Mr Trump to Pyongyang would be a considerable PR gift to the North Koreans and is equally unlikely. ""It's going to be difficult getting the protocol right, who defers to who and under what circumstances etc, so it's important to find a place that's neutral,"" said Mr Hoare. Possible contenders include China, the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas and somewhere in international waters. In 1989, George HW Bush met the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, on a Soviet cruise ship off the coast of Malta. More important still than the location for Mr Trump will be a meticulous understanding of both the US and North Korean objectives. For a president known to struggle with dense briefing papers - preferring instead short, image-led presentations - preparation could be a challenge. ""If he doesn't do the homework he's going to have a problem,"" said Mr Hoare. ""He will be facing people who have been working on US matters for years and years and years. They won't speak but they will have briefed Mr Kim very thoroughly."" Another key consideration will be the way things look. The summit will take place in a media ecosystem completely different to that of 1961, when President John Kennedy met Nikita Khrushchev in Vienna, or of 1972 when Richard Nixon made his famous overture to China. Every word will be covered in real time on cable news, every stray bit of body language subjected to rigorous analysis. But if Mr Trump can avoid diplomatic gaffes and get along well enough with Mr Kim, his straight-shooting style of politics may prove to be as much of an asset in dealing with North Korea as it has been a liability elsewhere. ""He has already surprised a lot of people by bringing Kim to the table,"" said Mr Hadley. ""It just might be that his unconventional style produces a surprising result from the meeting.""

"Specialist officers in protective clothing, seen here in March, will remain in Salisbury for the clean-up The nerve agent used to poison former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia was delivered ""in a liquid form"", the Department for Environment says. Only ""a very small amount"" was used on the pair, who were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury on 4 March. A massive clean-up operation is beginning to decontaminate nine sites in the city - it will take several months and cost millions of pounds. The UK says Russia was behind the attack, but Moscow denies involvement. Yulia, 33, left hospital earlier this month.Her 66-year-old father is said to be recovering more slowly but is expected to eventually be discharged. What happened to Sergei and Yulia Skripal? Who is Sergei Skripal? Yulia Skripal: No-one speaks for me The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said the highest concentration of military grade Novichok nerve agent was found at Mr Skripal's house, but eight other sites are known, or thought, to be contaminated. They include ambulance stations and a police car compound, as well as a Zizzi restaurant and the Mill pub, where the Skripals spent time on the day they fell ill. The nerve agent does not evaporate or disappear over time, experts said, and intense cleaning with caustic chemicals is required to get rid of it. Hoardings will go up in public places in the next few days for the clean-up to begin. Grass and stones will be removed from public areas around the Maltings shopping centre, and all material found to be contaminated will be incinerated. Almost 200 military personnel will help with the work, which is expected to take a number of months. A 10th site - a section of London Road cemetery - has now been reopened to the public after tests established it was not contaminated. The cemetery contains the remains of Mr Skripal's wife and son. Yulia and Sergei Skripal were critically ill for several weeks Defra's chief scientific adviser Ian Boyd said the ""number one priority is making these sites safe for the public, so they can be returned to use for the people of Salisbury"". The BBC's Duncan Kennedy, in Salisbury, said authorities are stressing that the risk to the public remains very low. The Skripals' poisoning has triggered a diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West, with more than 20 countries expelling Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK. The international watchdog, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons,has backed the UK's findingsregarding the substance responsible. The UK has called for a UN Security Council meeting on the OPCW report, which could be held this week. Moscow has attempted to gain access to Yulia Skripal, butshe has so far rejected offers of assistancefrom the Russian embassy. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok's existence was revealed by chemist Dr Vil Mirzayanov in the 1990s, via Russian media. He says the nerve agents were designed to escape detection by international inspectors. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea.
