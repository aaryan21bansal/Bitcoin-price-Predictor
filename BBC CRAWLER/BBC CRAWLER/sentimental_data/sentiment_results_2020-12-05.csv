"Sir Keir Starmer - pictured on a visit earlier this week - is not showing any symptoms Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is having to self isolate after a member of his staff tested positive for coronavirus. In line with government advice, Sir Keir will now have to stay at home for 14 days since his last contact with the affected person. A spokesman for Sir Keir said this means he will come out of self-isolation on Wednesday 16 December. They added the party leader was ""well and not showing any symptoms"". Will a vaccine give us our old lives back? What is self-isolation and who has to do it? It is the second time Sir Keir has had to isolate because of coronavirus. In September,a member of his family showed symptoms of the virus. But they later tested negative, allowing Sir Keir to get back to Westminster. It also comes a week afterPrime Minister Boris Johnson came out of his own isolation period, having had contact with an MP who tested positive with the virus. Sir Keir's spokesman said during this latest period of self-isolation, the Labour leader will continue to work from home.

"The royal couple asked ""doodle boy"" Joe Whale to mark the three-day tour with a drawing The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are embarking on a three-day tour on board the royal train to thank community workers and frontline staff in the UK. Prince William and Catherine will meet care home staff, teachers, pupils and volunteers to hear about the challenges they have faced during the pandemic. A spokeswoman said they were ""looking forward to shining a spotlight on the incredible work that has been done"". The 1,250 mile-journey will include stops in England, Scotland and Wales. The duke and duchess will board the royal train on Sunday, for what is believed to be Catherine's first official journey on board. Prince William has used the train a number of times, including on the day of his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales' funeral, in 1997 - when the prince travelled from London to the princess's ancestral home in Northamptonshire for her burial. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's tour will celebrate community achievements during the pandemic A Kensington Palace spokeswoman said the morale-boosting tour, which ends on Tuesday, would give the royal couple the chance to ""share their gratitude on behalf of the nation"" for all those supporting their local communities ahead of the Christmas holidays. The UK's arts sector, which has been badly hit during the pandemic, will also be celebrated, with a number of festive performances. All visits and official events will be conducted in line with government's coronavirus guidance. At the request of the royal couple, the forthcoming trip has been immortalised in a drawing by schoolboy artist Joe Whale, better known as the ""doodle boy"", who found worldwide fame during lockdown with his YouTube tutorials. Prince Charles's study on the royal train, as pictured in 2010 Queen Victoria was the first monarch to use the royal train, travelling from Slough to Paddington station on 13 June 1842, with Isambard Kingdom Brunel riding on the footplate. In her diary, the 23-year-old queen described the 25-minute journey as ""delightful and so quick"" The present train has nine carriages and came into service for the Queen's Silver Jubilee, in 1977. It includes private carriages for the Queen and the Prince of Wales The train is described as more functional than palatial, with one royal aide suggesting it has bathroom fixtures ""you could find in Homebase or B&Q"" Only three trips - two by the Prince of Wales and one by the Queen - were taken on the royal train in the 2019/2020 financial year, but the total cost was more than Â£63,000. When the Queen toured the UK on the train for her Golden Jubilee in 2002, it cost Â£872,000 In 2000, a royal bodyguard discharged his gun on the train while the Queen was sleeping.

"The sheriff's department said the images were photoshopped on to the tree A sheriff's department in the US state of Alabama has come under fire over a Facebook photo showing a Christmas tree adorned with mugshots of suspects. It called the decorations ""thugshots"" in a Facebook post on Thursday that drew thousands of negative comments. Local civil liberties groups have described the post as ""despicable"". A sheriff spokeswoman for Mobile County Sheriff's Department defended the image, saying it represented criminals who were repeat offenders. In a Facebook post sharing the image, the department said: ""We have decorated our Tree with THUGSHOTS to show how many Thugs we have taken off the streets of Mobile this year! We could not have done it without our faithful followers!"" The post, which has since been removed, drew 7,900 comments, according to the Associated Press news agency. While some of the reaction was positive, many people responded saying the decorations were demeaning and cruel, the agency reports. Bernard Simelton, president of Alabama's National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,criticised the ""despicable behaviour"" of the police department,external, Al.com news website reported. The American Civil Liberties Union of Alabama (ACLU) has condemned the tree, calling it ""divisive and cruel"".

"This video can not be played Professor Lisa Harvey-Smith: The asteroid sample is ''exciting key'' to the origins of the Solar System A capsule containing the first significant quantities of rock from an asteroid is in ""perfect"" shape, according to scientists. The container with material from a space rock called Ryugu parachuted down near Woomera in South Australia on Saturday evening (GMT). A recovery team in Australia found the spacecraft lying on the sandy ground, with its parachute draped over a bush. The samples were originally collected by the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa-2. The spacecraft spent more than a year investigating Ryugu before returning to Earth. As it approached our planet, Hayabusa-2 released the capsule with the samples and fired its engines to push off in another direction. The 16kg capsule, meanwhile, entered the Earth's atmosphere. The official Hayabusa-2 Twitter accountreported that the capsule and its parachute had been found,externalat 19:47 GMT. ""Hayabusa-2 is home,"" Dr Yuichi Tsuda, project manager for the mission, said at a press conference on Sunday morning (GMT) in Sagamihara, Japan. ""We collected the treasure box,"" he said, adding: ""The capsule collection was perfectly done."" Rocks from an asteroid set for delivery to Earth Asteroid mission exploring a 'rubble pile' He said there was no damage to the container. A team member carries the capsule, which contains samples from an asteroid Dr Hitoshi Kuninaka, director general of Japan's Institute for Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), said: ""We started development of Hayabusa-2 in 2011. I think the dream has come true."" Addressing journalists, he acknowledged past missions that had experienced technical problems, but said: ""Regarding Hayabusa-2, we did everything according to the schedule - 100%. And we succeeded in sample return as planned. As a result, we can move on to the next stage in space development."" The next stage includes a mission called MMX, which will aim to bring back samples from Mars' largest moon Phobos. Earlier on Saturday, the capsule was picked up by cameras as a dazzling fireball streaking over Australia's Coober Pedy region. Screaming towards Earth at 11km/s, it deployed parachutes to slow its descent. The capsule then began transmitting a beacon with information about its position. The capsule is packed into a protective box for transport to the ""quick look facility"" Cameras in Australia captured the fireball as the capsule re-entered the atmosphere The spacecraft touched down on the vast Woomera range, operated by the Royal Australian Air Force. At around 18:07 GMT (04:37 local time), the recovery team identified the position of the capsule on the ground. A helicopter, equipped with an antenna to pick up the beacon, took to the air shortly afterwards. Satoru Nakazawa, Hayabusa-2 sub-manager at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa), who was part of the operation at Woomera, described the search: ""We went there with the helicopter and it was emitting the beacon signal. But at that time, it was still dark, so it was unclear [where it was]. I was very, very nervous. ""We flew over the area [where it landed] many times and I thought maybe that was where it was. Then the Sun rose and we could visually confirm the existence of the capsule. We thought: 'Wow, we found it!"" ""But we had a very jittery, frustrating time until sunrise."" The capsule was then taken to a ""quick-look facility"" for inspection. On Monday, Jaxa said it had collected gases from inside the container for analysis, adding that it was still not known whether they come from the Ryugu sample. Allow Twitter content?

Afterwards, the capsule will be airlifted to Japan, where it will be transported to a curation chamber at Jaxa in Sagamihara for analysis and storage. The mission planned to collect a sample of more than 100mg from the asteroid Ryugu. Japan probe touches down on asteroid New asteroid rover images released Prof Alan Fitzsimmons, from Queen's University Belfast, said the sample would ""reveal a huge amount, not only about the history of the Solar System, but about these particular objects as well"". Asteroids are essentially leftover building materials from the formation of the Solar System. They're made of the same stuff that went into forming the Earth, but they avoided being incorporated into planets. ""Having samples from an asteroid like Ryugu will be really exciting for our field. We think Ryugu is made up of super-ancient rocks that will tell us how the Solar System formed,"" Prof Sara Russell, leader of the planetary materials group at London's Natural History Museum, told BBC News. Studying the samples from Ryugu could tell us how water and the ingredients for life were delivered to the early Earth. A rover deployed by Hayabusa-2 sent back this image from the surface of Ryugu It had long been thought that comets delivered much of the Earth's water in the early days of the Solar System. Alan Fitzsimmons said the chemical profile of water in comets was sometimes rather different from the profile of water in our planet's oceans. The water composition of some asteroids in the outer Solar System, however, is a much closer match. Ryugu probably originated in this cold zone, before migrating inwards to its current orbit, closer to Earth. ""It may be that we've been looking to comets all this time for delivering water to Earth in the early Solar System. Perhaps we should have been looking a bit closer to home, at these primitive but rather rocky asteroids,"" Prof Fitzsimmons told BBC News. ""Indeed that's something that will be looked at very carefully in these Ryugu samples."" Researchers from around Japan, and other countries, will be working with the samples. In the UK, Prof Russell's team at the Natural History Museum and scientists from the universities of Manchester and Glasgow will get to study the material. Dr Sarah Crowther is one of several researchers at Manchester expecting to receive samples next year. She explained: ""Different labs contribute different expertise, which all helps in understanding the material collected."" The Hayabusa-2 spacecraft, which bypassed the Earth after releasing its capsule, is being sent on another mission. It will now travel to a much smaller, 30m-wide asteroid, reaching it in 2031.

Many of us are desperately hoping new and effective coronavirus vaccines will soon transport us back to our pre-Covid lives. But many scientists are warning that their arrival probably won't mean throwing our face masks in the bin anytime soon. Scroll down  ↓ to find out how vaccines work and why they need to reach a huge number of people in order to see an end to our socially distanced lives. Vaccines are widely considered to be one of the greatest medical achievements of the modern world. Every year they stop an estimated two to three million deaths, preventing more than 20 life-threatening diseases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Childhood illnesses that were common less than a generation ago are increasingly rare. And smallpox - which killed hundreds of millions of people - has been completely eradicated. But these successes have taken decades to achieve - and many of us are now expecting effective coronavirus vaccines to have similar results in a radically shorter time frame. News that some of the emerging vaccines are more than 90% effective - meaning about nine in 10 people receiving them would be protected from developing Covid-19 - has led many to believe we could soon be ditching social distancing and throwing away our face masks. In the US and the UK, where regulatory approval for the jabs is being granted quickly and mass vaccination programmes planned, some have even suggested life could be back to normal by spring. But many scientists and global health experts are warning that vaccines, with limited initial supplies and roll-out to selected groups, although protecting vulnerable groups and front-line health workers, are unlikely to transport us back to our old way of living anytime soon. Tedros Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, has said as much himself. ""A vaccine will complement the other tools we have, not replace them,"" he said. ""A vaccine on its own will not end the pandemic."" An explanation for this gap in expectations - between the optimism of some politicians and the public on the one hand and the hesitancy of many science professionals on the other - could be, partly, down to a lack of appreciation of how big a task it is to get enough vaccine to enough people. What many of us may not realise is that when we are talking about infectious diseases - those that pass from person to person - to truly protect everyone, we need to inoculate in very large numbers. This is because the power of a vaccine is not just in its ability to protect us as individuals, it is in its capacity to protect the people around us and the communities in which we live. Take Shona, here, for example. The problem for Shona, us and our communities is that no vaccine is ever 100% effective. The measles vaccine is one of the best and protects 95%-98% of people. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines and their 90%+ efficacy also fall short and we don't yet know whether that percentage will drop over time or outside clinical trial conditions. This means about one in 10 people would not be protected against Covid-19 - even if we vaccinated everyone. Without 100% coverage, which is unlikely in any vaccination programme, the number of people at risk would be higher. They could be among the most vulnerable - we already know older people tend to have a weaker response to vaccination, although the coronavirus vaccines have shown encouraging results in this regard. On top of this, some people in our communities, for health reasons, such as those undergoing some forms of cancer treatment, may not be able to get vaccinated at all. This means a significant pool of people around us will always be left at risk. Some of our friends and family may be among them. But there is still a way of ensuring we indirectly protect everyone - and that is to harness the power of mass vaccination. If we vaccinate enough people within our community an incredible thing happens. We create multiple invisible shields that disrupt a germ's chain of transmission, indirectly protecting our vulnerable friends and family. This is sometimes referred to as population protection or herd immunity. Here's how it works. What we do not yet know - and this is crucial to reaching herd protection levels - is how far the current Covid-19 vaccine contenders are able to prevent transmission, or offer sterilising immunity. We may have to wait some time to know this for sure, but the scientist behind the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine suggeststhere is a chancethat at least one of them could help reduce the risk. But even if we assume they do help block transmission, the number of people who would need to receive the vaccine in order to fully protect the vulnerable is high. This is because even with significant levels of inoculation with an effective vaccine, a large number of people are still left exposed, says Prof David Salisbury, a former director of immunisation at the UK Department of Health and associate fellow at the Chatham House think tank. And this is down to some simple maths, he explains. This is why scientists are pointing out that until we have enough vaccine to go beyond vaccinating at risk groups against Covid-19 and reach a large proportion of the population, we won't see an end to social distancing. ""If you just protect the vulnerable, you will stop deaths that are happening in the vulnerable and you will reduce the burden of hospital cases, but it won't stop transmission,"" says Prof Salisbury. Transmission will continue between people who haven't been vaccinated, who can then spread it to unvaccinated vulnerable people and vulnerable people who have been vaccinated but have not made a protective immune response, he says. This inevitably means that in order to avoid pockets of transmission developing and exposing vulnerable friends and family within our communities, we need to achieve high levels of vaccination across all ages in all geographical areas. Given how interconnected the world is in terms of movement of people and trade, this also means doing the same in every country across the world. ""This is a global pandemic, this isn't a national epidemic, so you've got to stop the virus everywhere and, until you do, nowhere remains safe,"" says Prof Salisbury. Currently the global plan for roll-out means those most at risk and healthcare workers will receive the limited number of available vaccine doses first. But some countries have already indicated they plan to vaccinate beyond at-risk groups when supplies allow, including the US and the UK. The head of the UK's National Health Service (NHS) has said itcould take until Aprilfor all those most at-risk to receive doses - but the government's eventual aim is to vaccinate as many people over the age of 16 as possible. Overall, the WHO estimates that between 65% and 70% of people will need to be immune before transmission is interrupted, herd protection achieved and everyone and everywhere declared safe. Prof Azra Ghani, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London who specialises in the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases, thinks we need to reach 70% to be ""on the safe side"". She believes achieving this will, ultimately, return our lives to normal, but getting there will be a difficult process, even without any unforeseen obstacles. ""It will end the pandemic, it is just a question of when, and that's the hardest bit to anticipate because getting this vaccine out that is the biggest challenge."" Immunising a large chunk of the UK's 68 million people will be an immense task, never mind reaching most of the globe's 7.8 billion residents. Nothing on this scale has ever been attempted before. The vaccines and their equipment - such as the vials to house them - need to be manufactured in mass quantities. Vaccine supply may not be able to meet demand for some time. The vaccines then need to be transported from factories and delivered to health centres - including those in isolated, hard-to-reach communities across the world. Some of the vaccines are also likely to require cold storage, for example the Pfizer vaccine needs to bekept at temperatures of -70C (-94F). The UK's NHS is setting up a network of vaccination centres to manage the logistical task after the country became the first in the world to approve the Pfizer jab as well as one made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. But for others the challenge will be greater. German logistics giant Deutsche Post DHL has warned that large parts of Africa, Asia and South America have insufficient cooling facilities in the ""last mile"" delivery stages as well as not enough storage, which would""pose the biggest challenge""to delivering a vaccine at scale. And there is yet another barrier that could slow the task of reaching enough people to protect the vulnerable. Health officials will have to overcome a rising tide of ""vaccine hesitancy"" - growing numbers of people who are reluctant to have inoculations - a phenomenon regarded as one of the top 10 threats to global health by the WHO. In the UK, about36% of peoplesaid they were either uncertain or very unlikely to agree to be vaccinated, a report by scientific institutions the British Academy and the Royal Society found. Similar figureswere recorded by a YouGov poll in November. This vaccine hesitancy, along with the growth of misinformation around vaccination - the so-called anti-vax movement - could make herd protection by vaccination harder to attain in many countries. Prof Ghani suggests reassuring people who would normally get vaccinated but who are currently feeling ""a little bit nervous"" about how quickly Covid-19 vaccines have been developed, will be crucial to mass roll-out in the UK. The task of winning over populations and getting people to turn up for appointments may mean we move towards herd protection levels ""at a slower timescale"", she says. Despite the scientific and practical challenges of delivering an effective vaccine accross the UK and also the world, the good news is that it looks likely the first-generation vaccines will have a significant impact on the global battle against Covid-19. In the short term they will help prevent the most vulnerable in our communities from developing severe disease and dying, especially older people with pre-existing conditions and front-line health workers. Pfizer/BioNTech's announcement that their vaccine appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old is an important boost to this work. The bad news is that it could well take months or possibly years to vaccinate enough of the global population to make the whole interconnected world safe and reach a point where we can all return to full normal. Suggestions that vaccines will be able to take us back to where we were pre-Covid by Easter have given people an unrealistic expectation, says Prof Salisbury, and such an outcome, in the absence of the interruption of transmission, is ""unlikely"". Even countries with strong health infrastructure and experience of mass vaccination programmes - like the UK - will find reaching enough people to break the chain of transmission a challenge, he says. While the outlook for at-risk groups will be ""undoubtedly brighter"" in 2021, Prof Salisbury says, the rest of us look likely to be taking extra measures for some time to come, something he refers to as ""vaccine plus"". Prof Ghani agrees and estimates it will take two more years to ""to get the whole world back to normal"", but with the process likely to be quicker for high-income countries like the UK. But she warns that while vaccines will ultimately end the pandemic, they will not ""get rid of the virus"" and the world will need to ""keep vaccinating"" just as it does with other diseases. So with a new era of ""vaccine plus"" possibly now dawning in the battle against Covid-19, 2021 is likely to require us to continue to dig deep for a number of months to come - and possibly beyond.

"This video can not be played Police clash with protesters in Paris over new security law Dozens of protesters have clashed with police in the French capital Paris in fresh demonstrations against a controversial draft security law. Police fired tear gas after hooded protesters smashed shop windows and set several vehicles alight. Nearly 100 rallies were planned nationwide on Saturday over the draft bill that would outlaw taking photos of police with malevolent intent. Opponents say the bill undermines press freedom to document police brutality. France has seenweekly nationwide protestsover the draft bill, which intensified after footage emerged of three white policemen beating a black music producer, whom they allegedly also abused racially. Macron 'shame' at police beating of black man Responding to the backlash, President Emmanuel Macron's ruling party said last week thatparts of the law would be rewritten. However, this has not done enough to assuage its opponents. On Friday Mr Macron acknowledged ""there are police who are violent"" and said ""they need to be punished"", in a live interview with Brut, a youth-focused news portal site. Thousands of people, including members of the anti-government Yellow Vest movement, had been marching peacefully in the capital when pockets of protesters, dressed in black and with their faces covered, started launching projectiles at riot police, Reuters reports. The windows of a supermarket, property agency and bank were smashed, according to the AFP news agency, and police responded to the violence by firing tear gas. Paris saw clashes over the security law for a second consecutive weekend A number of vehicles were set on fire in Paris on Saturday Some of the demonstrators set up impromptu barricades in the street which they set on fire, it added. Paris police, quoted by BFM TV, said some 500 rioters had infiltrated the protest. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said22 people had been detained,externalover the incidents. Police had been heavily deployed to the capital in a bid to avoida repeat of the violent clashes seen there last weekendover the same law, which left dozens wounded. ""When will there be a vaccine against police violence?"" one protester's placard reads Peaceful protests were staged elsewhere across France, including Marseille, Lyon and Rennes. In his interview with Brut on Friday, President Macron lashed out at earlier violence in Paris, which he blamed on ""crazy people"". He said an online national platform would be launched for people to flag up unnecessary police checks, and that police would be wearing body cameras more widely from June 2021. Article 24 of the proposed bill makes it a criminal offence to publish images of on-duty police officers with the intent to harm their ""physical or psychological integrity"". It says offenders could face up to a year in prison and be fined â¬45,000 (Â£40,500; $54,000). Advocates say the article will protect police from harassment and targeting on social media. But critics say media freedom and citizens' right to film police action must not be impeded, as the French police are now under intense scrutiny for alleged racism. Images of music producer Michel Zecler being kicked and punched at his Paris studio last month by three white policemen shocked the nation, and further enraged opponents to the bill. This video can not be played Music producer Michel Zecler is seen being beaten up by officers in his studio Since then, four officers have been placed under criminal investigation and members of President Macron's ruling party have pledged to ""completely"" rewrite part of the new law. ""We know that doubts persist about it...while we can never tolerate any reduction of press freedom or images,"" said Christophe Castaner, who heads Mr Macron's group of centrist MPs in parliament.

"This video can not be played Professor Lisa Harvey-Smith: The asteroid sample is ''exciting key'' to the origins of the Solar System A capsule containing the first significant quantities of rock from an asteroid is in ""perfect"" shape, according to scientists. The container with material from a space rock called Ryugu parachuted down near Woomera in South Australia on Saturday evening (GMT). A recovery team in Australia found the spacecraft lying on the sandy ground, with its parachute draped over a bush. The samples were originally collected by the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa-2. The spacecraft spent more than a year investigating Ryugu before returning to Earth. As it approached our planet, Hayabusa-2 released the capsule with the samples and fired its engines to push off in another direction. The 16kg capsule, meanwhile, entered the Earth's atmosphere. The official Hayabusa-2 Twitter accountreported that the capsule and its parachute had been found,externalat 19:47 GMT. ""Hayabusa-2 is home,"" Dr Yuichi Tsuda, project manager for the mission, said at a press conference on Sunday morning (GMT) in Sagamihara, Japan. ""We collected the treasure box,"" he said, adding: ""The capsule collection was perfectly done."" Rocks from an asteroid set for delivery to Earth Asteroid mission exploring a 'rubble pile' He said there was no damage to the container. A team member carries the capsule, which contains samples from an asteroid Dr Hitoshi Kuninaka, director general of Japan's Institute for Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), said: ""We started development of Hayabusa-2 in 2011. I think the dream has come true."" Addressing journalists, he acknowledged past missions that had experienced technical problems, but said: ""Regarding Hayabusa-2, we did everything according to the schedule - 100%. And we succeeded in sample return as planned. As a result, we can move on to the next stage in space development."" The next stage includes a mission called MMX, which will aim to bring back samples from Mars' largest moon Phobos. Earlier on Saturday, the capsule was picked up by cameras as a dazzling fireball streaking over Australia's Coober Pedy region. Screaming towards Earth at 11km/s, it deployed parachutes to slow its descent. The capsule then began transmitting a beacon with information about its position. The capsule is packed into a protective box for transport to the ""quick look facility"" Cameras in Australia captured the fireball as the capsule re-entered the atmosphere The spacecraft touched down on the vast Woomera range, operated by the Royal Australian Air Force. At around 18:07 GMT (04:37 local time), the recovery team identified the position of the capsule on the ground. A helicopter, equipped with an antenna to pick up the beacon, took to the air shortly afterwards. Satoru Nakazawa, Hayabusa-2 sub-manager at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa), who was part of the operation at Woomera, described the search: ""We went there with the helicopter and it was emitting the beacon signal. But at that time, it was still dark, so it was unclear [where it was]. I was very, very nervous. ""We flew over the area [where it landed] many times and I thought maybe that was where it was. Then the Sun rose and we could visually confirm the existence of the capsule. We thought: 'Wow, we found it!"" ""But we had a very jittery, frustrating time until sunrise."" The capsule was then taken to a ""quick-look facility"" for inspection. On Monday, Jaxa said it had collected gases from inside the container for analysis, adding that it was still not known whether they come from the Ryugu sample. Allow Twitter content?

Afterwards, the capsule will be airlifted to Japan, where it will be transported to a curation chamber at Jaxa in Sagamihara for analysis and storage. The mission planned to collect a sample of more than 100mg from the asteroid Ryugu. Japan probe touches down on asteroid New asteroid rover images released Prof Alan Fitzsimmons, from Queen's University Belfast, said the sample would ""reveal a huge amount, not only about the history of the Solar System, but about these particular objects as well"". Asteroids are essentially leftover building materials from the formation of the Solar System. They're made of the same stuff that went into forming the Earth, but they avoided being incorporated into planets. ""Having samples from an asteroid like Ryugu will be really exciting for our field. We think Ryugu is made up of super-ancient rocks that will tell us how the Solar System formed,"" Prof Sara Russell, leader of the planetary materials group at London's Natural History Museum, told BBC News. Studying the samples from Ryugu could tell us how water and the ingredients for life were delivered to the early Earth. A rover deployed by Hayabusa-2 sent back this image from the surface of Ryugu It had long been thought that comets delivered much of the Earth's water in the early days of the Solar System. Alan Fitzsimmons said the chemical profile of water in comets was sometimes rather different from the profile of water in our planet's oceans. The water composition of some asteroids in the outer Solar System, however, is a much closer match. Ryugu probably originated in this cold zone, before migrating inwards to its current orbit, closer to Earth. ""It may be that we've been looking to comets all this time for delivering water to Earth in the early Solar System. Perhaps we should have been looking a bit closer to home, at these primitive but rather rocky asteroids,"" Prof Fitzsimmons told BBC News. ""Indeed that's something that will be looked at very carefully in these Ryugu samples."" Researchers from around Japan, and other countries, will be working with the samples. In the UK, Prof Russell's team at the Natural History Museum and scientists from the universities of Manchester and Glasgow will get to study the material. Dr Sarah Crowther is one of several researchers at Manchester expecting to receive samples next year. She explained: ""Different labs contribute different expertise, which all helps in understanding the material collected."" The Hayabusa-2 spacecraft, which bypassed the Earth after releasing its capsule, is being sent on another mission. It will now travel to a much smaller, 30m-wide asteroid, reaching it in 2031.

"Hens, turkeys and other captive birds in Britain will have to be kept indoors from 14 December to prevent the spread of bird flu, the government has said. The chief vets for England, Scotland and Wales made the decision after a number of cases were detected among both captive and wild birds. The risk to humans is ""very low"",the government said,external, and should ""not affect the consumption of poultry products"". But in a joint statement, veterinary chiefs said ""swift action"" was needed. ""Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, from 14 December onwards you will be legally required to keep your birds indoors, or take appropriate steps to keep them separate from wild birds,"" read the statement. ""We have not taken this decision lightly but it is the best way to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease."" Turkeys to be culled after bird flu found at farm Bird flu killed wild birds in south west England From the archives: What's the threat of bird flu to humans? There are numerous strains of bird flu. Most either do not affect humans, or are not easily caught and spread by humans. Deaths have been recorded outside of the UK related to some strains, but the H5N8 strain - which makes up the bulk of the UK's current cases - has not infected any humans worldwide to date,the NHS said.,external A turkey farm in Norfolk is among those tofound to have had an outbreak of the H5N8 bird flu strain.The birds will now be slaughtered to prevent the spread. While the news will be of particular concern to poultry farmers in the run-up to Christmas, the new rules will apply to all bird owners in Britain. However, despite the concern, the Department for Environment Farming and Rural Affairs said poultry products - including eggs - are still safe to consume. Poultry includes chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, pigeon (bred for meat), partridge, quail, guinea fowl and pheasants. No end date for the measures has been given, but Defra said they would be kept under ""regular review"". Farmers forced to move their birds indoors in circumstances such as these may continue to market the meat as ""free range"" as long as the measures do not last longer than 12 weeks. For eggs, this deadline is slightly longer - 16 weeks. After this point, the eggs must be downgraded to ""barn produced"". Aimee Mahony, chief poultry adviser for the National Farmers' Union, said the new rules were ""a logical next step"". ""These new measures mean that every poultry keeper, whether you have one hen in the garden or a large poultry business, must house their birds indoors and I would urge everyone with poultry to take these measures seriously,"" she said.

He was held with four other men as part of an investigation into the awarding of building contracts in the city. The Labour Party has suspended Mr Anderson pending the outcome of the case. Merseyside Police said all five people ""have been released on condition bail, pending further inquiries."" Their year-long investigation, Operation Aloft, has focused on a number of property developers. On Friday,Mr Anderson, 62, was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation. In a statement, he said he was ""interviewed for six hours"" and that he was ""co-operating fully"" with the police. Mr Anderson said he would be ""talking to my cabinet colleagues over the weekend to ensure the challenges our city faces with the Covid pandemic continue to receive the focus they deserve"". He also said he supported Labour's decision to suspend him while the police inquiry continues. ""I have been bailed to return in one month's time. Given the investigation is continuing, and there are bail conditions, I will not be making any further comments."" Councillor Richard Kemp, leader of the opposition Liberal Democrat group on Liverpool City Council, said that Mr Anderson should follow ""other senior figures in such cases"" and ""step away"" from the council and mayoralty during the legal process. Police said they detained two other men, from Liverpool and Ainsdale, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit bribery and witness intimidation.

"This video can not be played Professor Lisa Harvey-Smith: The asteroid sample is ''exciting key'' to the origins of the Solar System A capsule containing the first significant quantities of rock from an asteroid is in ""perfect"" shape, according to scientists. The container with material from a space rock called Ryugu parachuted down near Woomera in South Australia on Saturday evening (GMT). A recovery team in Australia found the spacecraft lying on the sandy ground, with its parachute draped over a bush. The samples were originally collected by the Japanese spacecraft Hayabusa-2. The spacecraft spent more than a year investigating Ryugu before returning to Earth. As it approached our planet, Hayabusa-2 released the capsule with the samples and fired its engines to push off in another direction. The 16kg capsule, meanwhile, entered the Earth's atmosphere. The official Hayabusa-2 Twitter accountreported that the capsule and its parachute had been found,externalat 19:47 GMT. ""Hayabusa-2 is home,"" Dr Yuichi Tsuda, project manager for the mission, said at a press conference on Sunday morning (GMT) in Sagamihara, Japan. ""We collected the treasure box,"" he said, adding: ""The capsule collection was perfectly done."" Rocks from an asteroid set for delivery to Earth Asteroid mission exploring a 'rubble pile' He said there was no damage to the container. A team member carries the capsule, which contains samples from an asteroid Dr Hitoshi Kuninaka, director general of Japan's Institute for Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), said: ""We started development of Hayabusa-2 in 2011. I think the dream has come true."" Addressing journalists, he acknowledged past missions that had experienced technical problems, but said: ""Regarding Hayabusa-2, we did everything according to the schedule - 100%. And we succeeded in sample return as planned. As a result, we can move on to the next stage in space development."" The next stage includes a mission called MMX, which will aim to bring back samples from Mars' largest moon Phobos. Earlier on Saturday, the capsule was picked up by cameras as a dazzling fireball streaking over Australia's Coober Pedy region. Screaming towards Earth at 11km/s, it deployed parachutes to slow its descent. The capsule then began transmitting a beacon with information about its position. The capsule is packed into a protective box for transport to the ""quick look facility"" Cameras in Australia captured the fireball as the capsule re-entered the atmosphere The spacecraft touched down on the vast Woomera range, operated by the Royal Australian Air Force. At around 18:07 GMT (04:37 local time), the recovery team identified the position of the capsule on the ground. A helicopter, equipped with an antenna to pick up the beacon, took to the air shortly afterwards. Satoru Nakazawa, Hayabusa-2 sub-manager at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa), who was part of the operation at Woomera, described the search: ""We went there with the helicopter and it was emitting the beacon signal. But at that time, it was still dark, so it was unclear [where it was]. I was very, very nervous. ""We flew over the area [where it landed] many times and I thought maybe that was where it was. Then the Sun rose and we could visually confirm the existence of the capsule. We thought: 'Wow, we found it!"" ""But we had a very jittery, frustrating time until sunrise."" The capsule was then taken to a ""quick-look facility"" for inspection. On Monday, Jaxa said it had collected gases from inside the container for analysis, adding that it was still not known whether they come from the Ryugu sample. Allow Twitter content?

Afterwards, the capsule will be airlifted to Japan, where it will be transported to a curation chamber at Jaxa in Sagamihara for analysis and storage. The mission planned to collect a sample of more than 100mg from the asteroid Ryugu. Japan probe touches down on asteroid New asteroid rover images released Prof Alan Fitzsimmons, from Queen's University Belfast, said the sample would ""reveal a huge amount, not only about the history of the Solar System, but about these particular objects as well"". Asteroids are essentially leftover building materials from the formation of the Solar System. They're made of the same stuff that went into forming the Earth, but they avoided being incorporated into planets. ""Having samples from an asteroid like Ryugu will be really exciting for our field. We think Ryugu is made up of super-ancient rocks that will tell us how the Solar System formed,"" Prof Sara Russell, leader of the planetary materials group at London's Natural History Museum, told BBC News. Studying the samples from Ryugu could tell us how water and the ingredients for life were delivered to the early Earth. A rover deployed by Hayabusa-2 sent back this image from the surface of Ryugu It had long been thought that comets delivered much of the Earth's water in the early days of the Solar System. Alan Fitzsimmons said the chemical profile of water in comets was sometimes rather different from the profile of water in our planet's oceans. The water composition of some asteroids in the outer Solar System, however, is a much closer match. Ryugu probably originated in this cold zone, before migrating inwards to its current orbit, closer to Earth. ""It may be that we've been looking to comets all this time for delivering water to Earth in the early Solar System. Perhaps we should have been looking a bit closer to home, at these primitive but rather rocky asteroids,"" Prof Fitzsimmons told BBC News. ""Indeed that's something that will be looked at very carefully in these Ryugu samples."" Researchers from around Japan, and other countries, will be working with the samples. In the UK, Prof Russell's team at the Natural History Museum and scientists from the universities of Manchester and Glasgow will get to study the material. Dr Sarah Crowther is one of several researchers at Manchester expecting to receive samples next year. She explained: ""Different labs contribute different expertise, which all helps in understanding the material collected."" The Hayabusa-2 spacecraft, which bypassed the Earth after releasing its capsule, is being sent on another mission. It will now travel to a much smaller, 30m-wide asteroid, reaching it in 2031.

"UK and EU leaders have agreed to resume talks to try to find an agreement on a post-Brexit trade deal UK PM Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke earlier A joint statement issued afterwards said ""significant differences"" remain between the UK and EU Three ""critical issues"" need to be resolved - fishing rights, competition rules and how a deal is enforced The negotiating teams will meet in Brussels on Sunday The UK left the EU on 31 January, but remains under its trading rules until the end of the year If a deal is not agreed by then, tariffs - or taxes on goods - could come into force Johanna Howitt, Kate Whannel and George Bowden We're going to pause our live coverage now. Before we leave you, here is a quick summary of what has happened with Brexit over the last 24 hours or so.  So all eyes on Brussels tomorrow for any hint of a compromise from either side. UK chief Brexit negotiator David Frost and his EU counterpart Michel Barnier at start of the first round of post-Brexit talks in March 2020 And, so that's all from us. On the team with you tonight were George Bowden, Hamish Mackay, Kate Whannel, Johanna Howitt and Joshua Nevett. Thanks for joining us. Macron has said he wants to maintain French access to British fishing waters Itâs worth remembering that, should a UK-EU trade deal materialise, it would need to be approved by the UK Parliament, and all 27 of the EU's member states. As we reported earlier, France has been keen to ensure its fishing industry will not lose too much access to British waters. On Friday, France's Europe minister ClÃ©ment Beaune suggested his country could veto a deal if it was not in the countryâs best interests. ""We must prepare for a risk of 'no deal' but this is not what we want,â Beaunetold Europe 1,external. âI still hope that we can have an agreement but we will not accept an agreement that is bad for France. If there was an agreement and it was not good, we would oppose it with a right of veto.â But commentators say it is unlikely that France will veto any deal without support from other countries. With talks set to resume on Sunday, uncertainty around what the UK and European Union's future relationship looks like continues. But we already know some things will change from 1 January 2021. From trips to Europe and queues at the border, to duty-free shopping and lots of new rules - here are some of the most important things you might want to think about (and a couple of others which are still unresolved). Read more here. We can bring you some more reaction to todayâs Brexit negotiations from Europe. German MEP Manfred Weber - who is also the head of the European Parliament's conservative EPP grouping -  has said: âwe are running out of timeâ to agree a post-Brexit trade deal. There is now less than a month left before the end of the so-called transition period, in which the UK remains under EU trading rules. ""Boris Johnson needs to make a choice between the ideology of Brexit and the realism of people's daily lives,"" Weber wrote on Twitter. ""In the middle of the Covid crisis we owe it to our citizens and businesses to find an agreement. âIt is now or neverâ. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Transition period, withdrawal agreement, level playing field? The Brexit process has been nothing if not jargon-heavy. And it is unlikely to get any better over the next 48 hours. If you need to brush up or are coming to this for the first time,here is our Brexit Jargon Buster. So this is what tonight is all about - UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke on the phone in a bid to break the Brexit stalemate. Following the call they released this joint statement: âIn a phone call today on the on-going negotiations between
the European Union and the United Kingdom, we welcomed the fact that progress
has been achieved in many areas. ""Nevertheless, significant differences remain
on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and fisheries. ""Both
sides underlined that no agreement is feasible if these issues are not
resolved. âWhilst recognising the seriousness of these differences, we
agreed that a further effort should be undertaken by our negotiating teams to
assess whether they can be resolved. âWe are therefore instructing our chief negotiators to
reconvene tomorrow in Brussels. âWe will speak again on Monday evening.â Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Itâs not over, not yet. The
two sides in this complicated and drawn out process have agreed that it is
worth trying one last time, to find a way through their profound differences. But the statements from the prime minister and the EU chief, Ursula Von Der
Leyen tonight, signal clearly that a trade deal is out of reach right now,
spelling out that if no one budges in the next few days itâs simply not going
to happen. A feature of Brexit negotiations has often been the last minute stand off, the
political emergency, before suddenly, lo and behold, a deal emerges from the
wreckage. By Monday night, that tradition may have been proven again. Yet it
seems there is a lot more to be done than ironing out a few last minute
glitches. The two sides are still stuck over the
fundamental, political question, who really calls the shots. It was Theresa
May, who coined the phrase, âno deal is better than a bad dealâ. In the next 48
hours, Boris Johnson and the European Union have to decide if they want to test
if she was right. More reaction to tonight's Brexit news... As the trade negotiations prepare to resume on Sunday, Brexit Party leader and former UK MEP Nigel Farage said: ""I do hope that this lack of an agreement does not mean we are heading for an extension,"" he says. ""After four and a half years, Brexit voters won't tolerate that."" So, the UK and EU say there are ""significant differences"" between them, as they try to thrash out a post-Brexit future. But what if they fail to agree a trade deal by 31 December? The two sides will start to trade on World Trade
Organisation rules. In this scenario the UK and EU would impose tariffs â or taxes on
imported goods. The average EU tariff is pretty low (about 2.8% for
non-agricultural products) but in some sectors tariffs can be quite high. Cars could be taxed at 10% and some agricultural tariffs could
be even higher â for example 35% for dairy products. You can read more about what a no-deal scenario might mean here.  What happens next? Katya AdlerEurope Editor The EU side very tight-lipped, not much optimism in the air. Sense in Brussels (again) that if talks succeed or not it largely depends on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and instructions he gives or - doesnât give - to his chief negotiator, David Frost, ahead of talks resuming tomorrow. Tiger is back in the tank, but unless the negotiators have been given a nod and wink by their bosses to make key compromises, what is the point of shoving negotiating teams together to go round same issues that have bedevilled talks for months? Fisheries have proved to be a major sticking point in the negotiations As the UK and EU attempt to hash out a post-Brexit trade deal, significant differences remain in three key areas: competition, governance and fisheries. Fisheries has been a particularly touchy subject in France, which wants access for EU fishermen in UK waters. But one Belgian Green MEP, Philippe Lamberts, told the BBC earlier that the issue had been given too much importance during the negotiations. Although fishing is âa highly symbolicâ industry, its value to the French and British economies should not be overstated, he said. âThe problem is the fishing issue has been overdone, both by France and the UK,â Lamberts said. âWe should cut it down to size, it should not be allowed to derail a good deal.â Read more:Why France is raising the stakes over fishing More reaction is coming in after tonight's announcement that EU-UK Brexit talks will continue. Labour's Rachel Reeves, the shadow cabinet office minister, says both sides should ""get on with reaching an agreement"". ""The British people were promised a deal and, with time running out, we urge both sides to get on with reaching an agreement,"" she says. âWe can then focus on the job at hand which is securing the economy and rebuilding our country from the pandemic."" Need a quick recap? Here's a reminder of how we got to this point... The UK left the EU on 31 January but the rules didnât change
immediately because the UK has continued to follow EU trading rules. This will be the case until the ""transition period"" ends on 31 December. The transition period - also know as the implementation period - was put in place to give EU and UK leaders time to
negotiate a trade deal. Negotiations have been going on for ten
months, but the two sides remained far apart on fishing rights, competition
rules and arrangements for policy any deal reached. On Friday night UK and EU negotiators said there were ""significant divergences"" and announced that the talks would be paused. And now, the talks are back on following a conversation between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The post-Brexit trade talks between the UK and the EU are going down to the wire. They were never going to be easy. But what are the sticking points? First of all, there is what is known as the level playing field. That means measures to ensure businesses on one side don't have an unfair advantage over their competitors on the other. Then there is fisheries: the EU is pushing for maximum access for its boats to continue fishing in UK waters. So could a basic deal be done in time?Read more from Chris here. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier A bit of reaction  has been coming in to the news that the Brexit talks are resuming: The European Commission's chief negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted: ""We will see if there is a way forward. Work continues tomorrow."" And Ireland's Taoiseach (or prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin tweeted: ""I welcome the fact that negotiators will resume their discussions on an EU and UK trade deal in Brussels tomorrow. ""An agreement is in everyone's best interests. Every effort should be made to reach a deal."" Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin Boris Johnson in a call with Ursula Von Der Leyen Here is a full transcript of joint statement release by the two leaders: âIn a phone call today on the on-going
negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom, we welcomed the
fact that progress has been achieved in many areas. ""Nevertheless, significant differences remain
on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and fisheries. ""Both sides underlined that no agreement is

put on hold on Friday night. The development comes after a phone call between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In a joint statement, the leaders agreed there were âsignificant
differencesâ with fishing rights, rules on state subsidies for
business and arrangements for policing remaining the key sticking
points. They said âfurther effortâ was needed and instructed their chief
negotiators to resume talks on Sunday. Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen will speak again on Monday
evening. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0

"When deciding what lockdown tiers an area should be in, scientists looked closely at the number of cases in over-60s Controversial restrictions came into place in England this week, as a month-long lockdown ended. Areas have been placed in one of three tiers. But how was it decided which tier was right for which area? One of the key factors is the rate of coronavirus cases among people over the age of 60. The BBC has analysed the latest figures for areas with both the highest infection rates among the over-60s, and places where the virus is more common in older people than those younger. In the week to 29 NovemberBoston, in Lincolnshire, had the highest number of coronavirus cases among the over-60s, at about 564 per 100,000 people. This was higher than the rate among people under 60, which was about 515 per 100,000 over the same period. Among all cases, the area had the third highest infection rate in England. Lincolnshire moved into Tier 3 when the England-wide lockdown ended on Wednesday. The county seeing the most areas with the highest infection rates in over-60s wasKent. Swale, Gravesham, Thanet and Medway all had more than 300 cases per 100,000 among the over-60s, with Maidstone recording a rate of 247. Coronavirus: Your tributes to those who have died How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? First vaccines 'could cut 99% of deaths' - Van-Tam Most of the areas seeing the highest infection rates in older people have even higher rates in those under 60. However, there have been some places where the opposite was true. East Northamptonshirehad the largest gap between its infection rates among older and younger people. The rate in older people in the week to 28 November was about 207 cases per 100,000 people, nearly double the rate in under-60s of about 106. It is hard to say what causes the virus to spread from one age group to another, as causes can be unique to different parts of the country. Officials said outbreaks in care homes could account for some spikes in older populations but community transmission has also played a large role. The virus has been said to movefrom younger people to oldermore often. This could be partly explained by the high number of people over 60 receiving care from those in younger age groups. However, public health teams said the current figures broadly reflected infections acquired as England entered the second national lockdown and could have been a result oflast-minute excursionsbefore venues such as pubs and non-essential shops closed. The NHS has said although coronavirus can make anyone seriously ill, the risk would increase as patients were older. Older people tend to have more underlying health conditions, or have received treatment that could make them vulnerable. Officials have also voiced concerns about the potential impact on hospital capacity if cases rose among the over-60s. Since the pandemic began many hospitals have had fewer beds available for patients, because of extra safety precautious taken to limit the spread of the virus. In many facilities treatment has been divided into Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 zones. Higher numbers of cases among older people in particular would usually mean increased critical care admissions. The knock-on effect of this would be to further reduce hospital capacity to treat non-Covid-19 patients, as hospitals adjusted to cope with the additional strain. The government's recentcoronavirus impact assessment,externalsaid if the NHS in a part of the country were to be overwhelmed - if an area had more patients that needed critical care than it had capacity for - this could result in deaths that may have been prevented, had there been fewer patients. The government has said it looked at several criteria when deciding on what tiers to put each part of England in following the second national lockdown: Total number of Covid-19 cases in an area The number of cases among over-60s The rate at which cases were rising or falling The proportion of test results coming back positive Pressure on the NHS In its assessment of each area it outlined places where it was concerned about the number of infections among older people. Of the 46 county and wider areas used to assign tiers, 23 were highlighted as having ""high"" or ""very high"" case rates in the over-60s. It based its research on figures covering the two weeks up to 19 November. Coronavirus restrictions are set to be eased around Christmas, allowing people in all tiers to mix with slightly wider circles of family and friends. ""Christmas bubbles"",limited to three households, are due to last from 23-27 December in England. Academics have said seeing friends and family at Christmas may be a real benefit to the mental health of older people during an already difficult time. But the UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has warned people ""have to have sense"" this year and avoid hugging and kissing older relatives ""if you want them to survive to be hugged again"". ""It's not against the law, and that's the whole point. You can do it within the rules that are there,"" he said. ""But it does not make sense because you could be carrying the virus.""

"This video can not be played In December the BBC's Sarah Rainsford went to a Moscow clinic where the Sputnik V vaccine was being given to patients Russia is starting its Covid-19 vaccination programme, with clinics in the capital Moscow inoculating those most at risk from the virus. Its own vaccine Sputnik V, which was registered in August, is being used. Developers say it is 95% effective and causes no major side effects, but it is still undergoing mass testing. Thousands of people have already registered to get the first of two jabs over the weekend, but it is unclear how much Russia can manufacture. Producers are expected to only make two million doses of the vaccine by the end of the year. Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, who announced the programme earlier in the week, said it was being offered to people in the city of 13 million who work in schools and the health service, and social workers. He said the list would grow as more of the vaccine became available. An online registration service allows city residents in the above professions aged 18-60 to book free appointments at 70 sites around the city. Russia pins hopes on own vaccines and huge hospitals Russia Covid-19 vaccine 'triggers immune response' Putin: Russia's Covid-19 vaccine approved for use They will operate from 08:00 until 20:00 local time (05:00-17:00 GMT). Hospitals across Russia are overstretched with queues such as this one in Omsk, Siberia People who have received injections in the last 30 days or who have had respiratory diseases within the last two weeks will be excluded, as will those with certain chronic illnesses, and pregnant and breastfeeding women. Each person will receive two injections, the second 21 days after the first. By Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Moscow We've seen a handful of health workers and teachers getting vaccinated at this smart, central Moscow clinic. They were all calm enough about receiving Sputnik V, even though it's still undergoing mass trials to test its safety and efficacy. One doctor said she'd seen enough Covid patients at her own hospital to prefer taking her chances with the vaccine. When I asked another woman whether she was worried about the experimental injection, she reasoned that ""everything has to start somewhere"". Everyone said they'd signed up voluntarily. Patients are asked a few general health questions before getting the vaccine, which is removed from the deep freeze around 15 minutes before use. A leaflet warns of possible side effects, though it suggests those are most likely to be mild and last a couple of days at most. Reactions among the public to the vaccine rollout have been mixed, however. ""I like it because this is a chance to turn the tide, to reduce the infection rate,"" resident Igor Krivobokov told Reuters news agency. Nightmare spreads through Russia's care homes Russian spies 'target coronavirus vaccine' But another, Sergei Grishin, said he did not plan to get the jab. ""This process will take a long time. Only a small amount of the vaccine has been produced... Let everyone else get vaccinated, and if they will - I will survive,"" he said. So far Russia has recorded 2,431,731 cases of the virus, and 42,684 deaths. On Saturday it reported a record daily high of 28,782 new cases. Hospitals all over the country have been overstretched. Moscow is the centre of the pandemic in Russia, recording thousands of cases and dozens of deaths daily. The total number of cases for the past 24 hours was 7,993. Russia's government has ruled out a lockdown, but in November Mr Sobyanin introduced restrictions in Moscow on opening hours for bars and clubs, moved higher education students to distance learning and reduced cultural and sporting events.

"Daca protects young people who entered the US without documents as children A US judge has ordered the Trump administration to fully reinstate a scheme that protects immigrants brought to the country illegally as children from being deported. The administration had moved to close the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme to new applicants earlier this year. But District Judge Nicholas Garaufis on Friday ruled against the restrictions. He told the administration to announce the full resumption of Daca by Monday. The Daca programme was introduced by former Democratic President Barack Obama in 2012. He set it up to help some of the more than 10 million immigrants who as young people entered the US illegally or overstayed a visa. Trump: 'I have great love' for Daca Dreamers 'Daca means continuing to live the American dream' Most of the children protected by the Daca programme are from Mexico and other Latin American countries. These migrants are known as ""Dreamers"". The scheme protected an estimated 700,000 people, offering temporary permits for work and study. But as part of his efforts to curb immigration, US President Donald Trump sought to end the programme in 2017, calling it unconstitutional. This video can not be played Daca recipients: 'Life in the US is like a rollercoaster' The Supreme Court took up the case after lower courts ruled the administration did not adequately explain why it was ending the programme, criticising the White House's ""capricious"" explanations. In June this year,the Supreme Court upheld lower court rulingsthat found Mr Trump's move to rescind Daca was ""unlawful"". Despite this ruling, the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf issued a memo to limit the programme to those who were already enrolled. Now Judge Garaufis of the US District Court in Brooklyn has ruled that Mr Wolf was not acting within his legal authority and that the scheme should resume. A protester demonstrating in support of the scheme holds up a placard that reads: I am an American The Center for American Progress, a think tank, said more than 300,000 new applicants could now be eligible for Daca. ""This is a really big day for Daca recipients and immigrant young people,"" Karen Tumlin, director of the Justice Action Center, told AFP news agency. Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office on 20 January, has said he plans to revitalise Daca. His campaign said he will try to legislate to give a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the US, although such a move would need to be approved by Congress.

"Meredith Kercher was an exchange student at the University of Perugia in 2007 The man convicted of killing 21-year-old UK student Meredith Kercher will finish his sentence doing community service, an Italian court has ruled. Born in London in 1985, Ms Kercher went to the University of Perugia in 2007 as an exchange student. On 1 November that year she was sexually assaulted and stabbed to death in her flat, accommodation she shared with American student Amanda Knox. Rudy Guede was convicted in 2008. He denies murdering Ms Kercher. Ms Knox and her then-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito were separately convicted of Ms Kercher's murder in 2009. Their arrests and the guilty verdicts generated international media attention. The pair served four years behind bars before those convictions were overturned. Who was Meredith Kercher? After a number of appeals and retrials Italy's highest court acquitted them both for good in March 2015. Guede left Perugia and travelled to Germany in the days after her killing. After his extradition back to Italy he chose a fast-track trial, held in a closed session without journalists present, and was subsequently convicted of the murder after his DNA was found at the scene. Rudy Guede, centre, was convicted of Ms Kercher's murder in 2008 The Ivory Coast-born 33-year-old has repeatedly claimed he is innocent. He was initially jailed for 30 years, later reduced to 16, on appeal. On Friday, a court ruled that Guede could now complete that term doing community service. He had already been given partial prison release in 2017, and his lawyer told local media after the ruling that his client was ""calm and socially well integrated"".

"The teams negotiating a deal on trade and other issues between the UK and the EU are still locked in talks, with time running short. There have been cautious reports of progress but also of serious, remaining differences - political leaders on both sides say they do not know if an agreement will emerge. They are certainly leaving it very late - the UK/EU transition period (during which rules and trade have stayed the same) ends on 31 December. So, what are the issues still to be resolved? Even though fishing makes up only a tiny part of the economy on both sides, it was central to the Leave campaign that won the Brexit referendum in the UK in 2016. It's also an important issue in several EU countries - such as France. The EU is pushing for maximum access for its boats to continue operating in UK waters, where they currently catch nearly Â£600m worth of fish every year. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK wants most of that business back and says it will prioritise its own boats after 1 January when it will become an independent coastal state, outside the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). So, the dispute is not just about access, but also about a bigger share of the fishing quota for the UK fleet - not just where you can fish, but what you can catch. And if the UK gains, which countries' fishing fleets will lose the most? These are really tricky issues to resolve. There's also been disagreement about the length of a potential transition period, before new measures come into full force. Any compromise lies somewhere between the EU asking for eight years and the UK offering three. Brexit trade deal: What do the UK and the EU want? Who really owns UK fishing quotas? If there is no agreement on access to fishing waters, the UK won't get full access to the EU market, without tariffs (or taxes), to sell its fish there. Last year, around three quarters of UK fish exports went to the EU. This is all about rules on fair competition for billions of pounds of business, now and in the future. The idea of level playing field measures, which appear in most free trade agreements, is to ensure businesses on one side don't have an unfair advantage over their competitors on the other. Brexit: What is a level playing field? If you cut regulations it can be cheaper to produce things, making some companies more competitive than others, and the EU is worried that the UK could do that in the future. That's why the EU wants the UK to stick particularly closely to EU rules on things like workers' rights, the environmental regulations that companies have to follow and state aid (financial subsidies given by government to businesses). The UK, on the other hand, says the whole point of Brexit was to break free from following EU rules. The two sides appear to have agreed a common baseline of regulations on some issues, which neither of them would go below. But the EU has also been insisting on a system which would mean if one side raised standards the other could face penalties, if failing to follow suit resulted in unfair competition. That raises the question of defining precisely what constitutes unfair competition. The EU has also tried but failed to persuade the UK to mirror its rules on subsidies. The UK says it is determined to assert and defend its sovereignty. This is mainly about how the rules of the deal will be enforced in future and what happens if one side breaks them. The EU may have conceded that it will not have a unilateral right to impose penalties, but it wants a strong and independent arbitration system that has real teeth. It has been pushing for powers to retaliate against the UK breaking rules in one area, by hitting back in another - for example, imposing tariffs or taxes where it thinks they might hurt most. Such powers would of course cut both ways. There's also the question of who might adjudicate disputes and where precisely the European Court of Justice will fit in. These are all hugely sensitive issues which will set the tone for the future relationship for years to come and only a few people behind the scenes know all the details of where the negotiations have got to. It's still possible that a basic trade deal can be done in the short time that remains. But both sides are going to have to make concessions quickly. It's also worth remembering that the negotiations are not just about trade with the EU (which accounted for 43% of UK exports in 2019 and 51% of UK imports). There is the important issue, for example, of police and security co-operation as well. The UK had wanted to maintain the same access to shared databases that it has now but the EU says that isn't on offer to non-members. A deal would provide better access, though, than no deal at all. There has been important progress on Northern Ireland - the subject of months of separate negotiations on how to implementthe agreement already signed with the EUon keeping the land border as open as it is now. People protesting between Newry and Dundalk about a possible hard border, in March 2019 On 8 December, the two sides announced""an agreement in principle"",externalon issues including border control posts at Northern Irish ports (for trade with Great Britain), the supply of food and medicines, and state aid. Some of the arrangements for Northern Ireland would be easier to implement if a trade deal was done, but either way trade between Northern Ireland and the EU will not face tariffs (or taxes) on goods crossing the border. Without a deal, trade between Great Britain and the EU would be subject to tariffs in both directions. Any deal would still need to be ratified by parliaments on both sides, but the time to scrutinise it properly has all but run out. That's a problem for such an important agreement between close neighbours. EU law does allow agreements of this kind to be applied provisionally by member states if necessary - but that's never been done before for a trade deal, and there would be opposition in the European parliament to doing that now. And if the trade talks fall apart, don't expect much meaningful agreement on anything else. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"The first Covid-19 vaccine has arrived in Scotland, the health secretary has confirmed. Jeane Freeman said the vaccination programme would begin on Tuesday. The first vaccinations will be given to priority groups including care home residents and staff, the elderly and frontline health workers. The news comes as it was announced a further 22 people who tested positive for coronavirus had been recorded to have died in the past 24 hours. There are currently 965 people in hospital with a positive Covid test and 64 of those are in ICU. Scottish government figures,externalshow the total number of positive cases in Scotland has risen by 777 since Friday, which is 4.5% of those tested. First Scottish vaccinations to start next week When will I be vaccinated against Covid? NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde has 210 new cases, while there are 149 in NHS Lothian and 117 in NHS Lanarkshire. The remainder of the positive cases are split between the other eight mainland health boards. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said the new Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness - is safe to roll out, and immunisations for people in priority groups will start within days. Jeane Freeman said the vaccinations would start on Tuesday Ms Freeman said: ""I am pleased to announce that the vaccine is now in Scotland and being stored safely in order for vaccinations to begin on Tuesday. Science has given us hope and we are starting on a journey which will eventually allow us to escape this terrible virus. ""Following clinical advice from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation (JCVI) we will begin with those groups which have been prioritised to address 99% of preventable deaths associated with Covid-19. These include the elderly, care home residents and staff, and frontline health and social care workers. ""I ask everyone to be patient as we work through these groups as vaccine supply allows. I urge you to go for the vaccine when it's your turn, but continue to follow the rules as set out in FACTS. And we will eventually reach the end of this pandemic by working together."" The UK government has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, with two shots each. About 800,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to be available in the UK next week, with about 65,500 being made available for Scotland. Half of the initial supplies of the vaccine that arrive in Scotland in December will be held back for the second dose. The Scottish government has bought 23 ultra-low temperature freezers to store the vaccine. They will be based at all major acute hospitals across the country and on Scotland's islands. It has been confirmedcare home residents in Scotland will be able to receive the vaccinefrom 14 December. There had been fears that homes would not be able to receive the first batch of doses due to logistical challenges caused by the vaccine having to be stored at -70C. But Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said on Thursday that confirmation on how the vaccine can be transported and stored meant it would now be possible to deliver them to care homes. Dr Carey Lunan hopes over-80s can receive a vaccine at GP surgeries before Christmas Dr Carey Lunan, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs in Scotland, hopes the over-80s can start receiving the Oxford-Astrazenica vaccine from GPs from 21 December. She told BBC Scotland: ""GPs will have a really crucial role to play in vaccinating the over-80s. ""We recognise that for that group of people, who've also got underlying health conditions or are more frail, it's not as appropriate for them to be going to the mass vaccination centres and they will be invited to come into their GP practices."" She added that vaccination uptake was lower in areas of higher social deprivation and among some ethnic groups. ""There's a lot of thinking and planning that needs to be done to make sure that everyone is able to get this vaccine,"" she said. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Tram lines in Edinburgh were engulfed by water Heavy rainfall has caused extensive flooding in parts of Scotland, with train and tram lines being engulfed by water. ScotRail services between Aberdeen and Inverness have been disrupted after a landslip near Huntly. Train services were also affected by flooding on the line at Livingston and at Hartwood in North Lanarkshire. Hartwood services have now resumed. Tram lines in Edinburgh were also swamped with water. Engineers were struggling to deal with floodwater affecting trams Edinburgh Trams said the flooding was near Edinburgh Airport and between the Gyle Centre and Edinburgh Gateway. It said: ""Our engineers are working around the clock to minimise the effects of the heavy rainfall to ensure we are able to commence full route reservices as soon as the flooding subsides. ""They continue to pump excess water, however with the nearby Gogar Burn and River Almond at or above capacity, this is having little impact."" Disruption after 'thundersnow' hits Scotland Tram customers can use their tickets on Lothian buses. Services from Inverness affected by the landslip will terminate and start back from Elgin and services from Aberdeen will terminate and start back from Huntly. Customers are advised to use valid tickets on Stagecoach East. ScotRail services between Aberdeen and Inverness have been suspended after the landslip near Huntly Flooding at Livingston and at Hartwood in North Lanarkshire affected rail services Network Rail used pumps to reduce the water levels near Hartwood A number of roads in Edinburgh were also closed due to flooding. Affected areas included those around the  River Almond in Kirkliston and the Water of Leith in Stockbridge and Roseburn. Edinburgh City Council staff worked through the night dealing with problems caused by the heavy rain.

"UK and EU leaders have agreed to resume talks to try to find an agreement on a post-Brexit trade deal UK PM Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke earlier A joint statement issued afterwards said ""significant differences"" remain between the UK and EU Three ""critical issues"" need to be resolved - fishing rights, competition rules and how a deal is enforced The negotiating teams will meet in Brussels on Sunday The UK left the EU on 31 January, but remains under its trading rules until the end of the year If a deal is not agreed by then, tariffs - or taxes on goods - could come into force Johanna Howitt, Kate Whannel and George Bowden We're going to pause our live coverage now. Before we leave you, here is a quick summary of what has happened with Brexit over the last 24 hours or so.  So all eyes on Brussels tomorrow for any hint of a compromise from either side. UK chief Brexit negotiator David Frost and his EU counterpart Michel Barnier at start of the first round of post-Brexit talks in March 2020 And, so that's all from us. On the team with you tonight were George Bowden, Hamish Mackay, Kate Whannel, Johanna Howitt and Joshua Nevett. Thanks for joining us. Macron has said he wants to maintain French access to British fishing waters Itâs worth remembering that, should a UK-EU trade deal materialise, it would need to be approved by the UK Parliament, and all 27 of the EU's member states. As we reported earlier, France has been keen to ensure its fishing industry will not lose too much access to British waters. On Friday, France's Europe minister ClÃ©ment Beaune suggested his country could veto a deal if it was not in the countryâs best interests. ""We must prepare for a risk of 'no deal' but this is not what we want,â Beaunetold Europe 1,external. âI still hope that we can have an agreement but we will not accept an agreement that is bad for France. If there was an agreement and it was not good, we would oppose it with a right of veto.â But commentators say it is unlikely that France will veto any deal without support from other countries. With talks set to resume on Sunday, uncertainty around what the UK and European Union's future relationship looks like continues. But we already know some things will change from 1 January 2021. From trips to Europe and queues at the border, to duty-free shopping and lots of new rules - here are some of the most important things you might want to think about (and a couple of others which are still unresolved). Read more here. We can bring you some more reaction to todayâs Brexit negotiations from Europe. German MEP Manfred Weber - who is also the head of the European Parliament's conservative EPP grouping -  has said: âwe are running out of timeâ to agree a post-Brexit trade deal. There is now less than a month left before the end of the so-called transition period, in which the UK remains under EU trading rules. ""Boris Johnson needs to make a choice between the ideology of Brexit and the realism of people's daily lives,"" Weber wrote on Twitter. ""In the middle of the Covid crisis we owe it to our citizens and businesses to find an agreement. âIt is now or neverâ. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Transition period, withdrawal agreement, level playing field? The Brexit process has been nothing if not jargon-heavy. And it is unlikely to get any better over the next 48 hours. If you need to brush up or are coming to this for the first time,here is our Brexit Jargon Buster. So this is what tonight is all about - UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen spoke on the phone in a bid to break the Brexit stalemate. Following the call they released this joint statement: âIn a phone call today on the on-going negotiations between
the European Union and the United Kingdom, we welcomed the fact that progress
has been achieved in many areas. ""Nevertheless, significant differences remain
on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and fisheries. ""Both
sides underlined that no agreement is feasible if these issues are not
resolved. âWhilst recognising the seriousness of these differences, we
agreed that a further effort should be undertaken by our negotiating teams to
assess whether they can be resolved. âWe are therefore instructing our chief negotiators to
reconvene tomorrow in Brussels. âWe will speak again on Monday evening.â Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Itâs not over, not yet. The
two sides in this complicated and drawn out process have agreed that it is
worth trying one last time, to find a way through their profound differences. But the statements from the prime minister and the EU chief, Ursula Von Der
Leyen tonight, signal clearly that a trade deal is out of reach right now,
spelling out that if no one budges in the next few days itâs simply not going
to happen. A feature of Brexit negotiations has often been the last minute stand off, the
political emergency, before suddenly, lo and behold, a deal emerges from the
wreckage. By Monday night, that tradition may have been proven again. Yet it
seems there is a lot more to be done than ironing out a few last minute
glitches. The two sides are still stuck over the
fundamental, political question, who really calls the shots. It was Theresa
May, who coined the phrase, âno deal is better than a bad dealâ. In the next 48
hours, Boris Johnson and the European Union have to decide if they want to test
if she was right. More reaction to tonight's Brexit news... As the trade negotiations prepare to resume on Sunday, Brexit Party leader and former UK MEP Nigel Farage said: ""I do hope that this lack of an agreement does not mean we are heading for an extension,"" he says. ""After four and a half years, Brexit voters won't tolerate that."" So, the UK and EU say there are ""significant differences"" between them, as they try to thrash out a post-Brexit future. But what if they fail to agree a trade deal by 31 December? The two sides will start to trade on World Trade
Organisation rules. In this scenario the UK and EU would impose tariffs â or taxes on
imported goods. The average EU tariff is pretty low (about 2.8% for
non-agricultural products) but in some sectors tariffs can be quite high. Cars could be taxed at 10% and some agricultural tariffs could
be even higher â for example 35% for dairy products. You can read more about what a no-deal scenario might mean here.  What happens next? Katya AdlerEurope Editor The EU side very tight-lipped, not much optimism in the air. Sense in Brussels (again) that if talks succeed or not it largely depends on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and instructions he gives or - doesnât give - to his chief negotiator, David Frost, ahead of talks resuming tomorrow. Tiger is back in the tank, but unless the negotiators have been given a nod and wink by their bosses to make key compromises, what is the point of shoving negotiating teams together to go round same issues that have bedevilled talks for months? Fisheries have proved to be a major sticking point in the negotiations As the UK and EU attempt to hash out a post-Brexit trade deal, significant differences remain in three key areas: competition, governance and fisheries. Fisheries has been a particularly touchy subject in France, which wants access for EU fishermen in UK waters. But one Belgian Green MEP, Philippe Lamberts, told the BBC earlier that the issue had been given too much importance during the negotiations. Although fishing is âa highly symbolicâ industry, its value to the French and British economies should not be overstated, he said. âThe problem is the fishing issue has been overdone, both by France and the UK,â Lamberts said. âWe should cut it down to size, it should not be allowed to derail a good deal.â Read more:Why France is raising the stakes over fishing More reaction is coming in after tonight's announcement that EU-UK Brexit talks will continue. Labour's Rachel Reeves, the shadow cabinet office minister, says both sides should ""get on with reaching an agreement"". ""The British people were promised a deal and, with time running out, we urge both sides to get on with reaching an agreement,"" she says. âWe can then focus on the job at hand which is securing the economy and rebuilding our country from the pandemic."" Need a quick recap? Here's a reminder of how we got to this point... The UK left the EU on 31 January but the rules didnât change
immediately because the UK has continued to follow EU trading rules. This will be the case until the ""transition period"" ends on 31 December. The transition period - also know as the implementation period - was put in place to give EU and UK leaders time to
negotiate a trade deal. Negotiations have been going on for ten
months, but the two sides remained far apart on fishing rights, competition
rules and arrangements for policy any deal reached. On Friday night UK and EU negotiators said there were ""significant divergences"" and announced that the talks would be paused. And now, the talks are back on following a conversation between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The post-Brexit trade talks between the UK and the EU are going down to the wire. They were never going to be easy. But what are the sticking points? First of all, there is what is known as the level playing field. That means measures to ensure businesses on one side don't have an unfair advantage over their competitors on the other. Then there is fisheries: the EU is pushing for maximum access for its boats to continue fishing in UK waters. So could a basic deal be done in time?Read more from Chris here. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier A bit of reaction  has been coming in to the news that the Brexit talks are resuming: The European Commission's chief negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted: ""We will see if there is a way forward. Work continues tomorrow."" And Ireland's Taoiseach (or prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin tweeted: ""I welcome the fact that negotiators will resume their discussions on an EU and UK trade deal in Brussels tomorrow. ""An agreement is in everyone's best interests. Every effort should be made to reach a deal."" Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin Boris Johnson in a call with Ursula Von Der Leyen Here is a full transcript of joint statement release by the two leaders: âIn a phone call today on the on-going
negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom, we welcomed the
fact that progress has been achieved in many areas. ""Nevertheless, significant differences remain
on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and fisheries. ""Both sides underlined that no agreement is

put on hold on Friday night. The development comes after a phone call between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In a joint statement, the leaders agreed there were âsignificant
differencesâ with fishing rights, rules on state subsidies for
business and arrangements for policing remaining the key sticking
points. They said âfurther effortâ was needed and instructed their chief
negotiators to resume talks on Sunday. Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen will speak again on Monday
evening. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,2.5088065e-08
"The mass use of rapid Covid tests has been defended by a senior NHS adviser, amid concerns over their accuracy. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to NHS Test and Trace, said the lateral flow tests could identify many cases of infection in people without symptoms. Speaking to the BBC, she accepted there had been ""false negatives"" but stressed the policy was a ""game-changer"". A study found the tests missed 50% of cases and some scientists fear people could start to ignore health advice. Meanwhile, a further 397 new coronavirus deaths were recorded in the UK on Saturday, with another 15,539 cases reported. Mass testing is being introduced in England's tier-three ""high-risk"" areas and isstarting in one of the areas hardest-hit by Covid-19 in Wales. And more than millionrapid tests are being sent to care homesin England over the next month to allow safe indoor visits. However, anarticle in the BMJ medical journal,externalraised concerns about the effects of rapid testing in Liverpool, where a pilot scheme was carried out. The lateral flow tests, which do not require processing in a laboratory, were reported to have missed half of all cases and a third of those with a high viral load who were likely to be the most infectious. Dr Hopkins told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the tests had ""limitations"" but said they were helping diagnose asymptomatic cases that would otherwise have gone undetected. She added: ""What we are doing here is case detection. We are not saying people do not have the disease if their test is negative. ""We are trying to say [to people who test positive] 'You do have the disease and now we want you to go and isolate for 10 days.' That is a whole different game-changer."" Will there be mass testing in your area? Safety fears pause Manchester care home testing When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? UK coronavirus cases up by 16,298 on Friday However, Dr Hopkins said mass testing did not end the need for social distancing. ""We are also very clear that until we get a much lower prevalence of disease in this country that we shouldn't be changing our behaviours,"" she said. By Katharine Da Costa, BBC health correspondent The pregnancy-style lateral flow tests are cheap to produce and provide results on the spot, unlike the standard nose and throat swabs which have to be sent off to a lab. However, the higher number of false negative results means people may wrongly think they are not infectious. Some scientists worry those people may go on to mix with more vulnerable people, putting them at risk. But the government says the Liverpool trial showed rapid tests could break chains of transmission, and they will start to use them for the first time next week in Wolverhampton - where Covid cases are more than twice the average level in England. Dr Hopkins' comments came as the UK's chief medical officers warned the winter could be ""especially hard"" for the health service because of coronavirus. Officials arepreparing to begin using the Pfizer/BioNTechCovid-19 vaccine as early as Tuesday, with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying supplies have arrived in Scotland. But in a letter to NHS staff, the chief medical officers of England (Prof Chris Whitty), Scotland (Dr Gregor Smith), Wales (Dr Frank Atherton) and Northern Ireland (Dr Michael McBride) said: ""Although the very welcome news about vaccines means that we can look forward to 2021 with greater optimism, vaccine deployment will have only a marginal impact in reducing numbers coming into the health service with Covid over the next three months."" TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters The rapid lateral flow tests work by taking a nose and throat swab, shaking it in fluid until any viral particles come off, and then dropping the fluid onto a plastic stick. They take about half an hour to show a result. Some councils have raised concerns over their use, withGreater Manchester councils the latest to pause rapid testingfor care home visitors. Prof Jon Deeks, of Birmingham University, said lateral flow tests could not detect low levels of the virus and were being used in ways for which they were never intended. ""We can't see why the government is progressing with using this test when it is missing so many people,"" he told the BBC. ""They have been sold to people with the idea that if you are negative you will be able to go and visit people, you will be able to be clear that you haven't got Covid, and that is really dangerous."" Prof Calum Semple, from Liverpool University and a member of the government's Scientific Advisory group for Emergencies, defended their use, saying more than a thousand coronavirus ""transmission chains"" had been broken during the pilot scheme in the city.

"The first Covid-19 vaccine has arrived in Scotland, the health secretary has confirmed. Jeane Freeman said the vaccination programme would begin on Tuesday. The first vaccinations will be given to priority groups including care home residents and staff, the elderly and frontline health workers. The news comes as it was announced a further 22 people who tested positive for coronavirus had been recorded to have died in the past 24 hours. There are currently 965 people in hospital with a positive Covid test and 64 of those are in ICU. Scottish government figures,externalshow the total number of positive cases in Scotland has risen by 777 since Friday, which is 4.5% of those tested. First Scottish vaccinations to start next week When will I be vaccinated against Covid? NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde has 210 new cases, while there are 149 in NHS Lothian and 117 in NHS Lanarkshire. The remainder of the positive cases are split between the other eight mainland health boards. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said the new Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine - which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness - is safe to roll out, and immunisations for people in priority groups will start within days. Jeane Freeman said the vaccinations would start on Tuesday Ms Freeman said: ""I am pleased to announce that the vaccine is now in Scotland and being stored safely in order for vaccinations to begin on Tuesday. Science has given us hope and we are starting on a journey which will eventually allow us to escape this terrible virus. ""Following clinical advice from the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation (JCVI) we will begin with those groups which have been prioritised to address 99% of preventable deaths associated with Covid-19. These include the elderly, care home residents and staff, and frontline health and social care workers. ""I ask everyone to be patient as we work through these groups as vaccine supply allows. I urge you to go for the vaccine when it's your turn, but continue to follow the rules as set out in FACTS. And we will eventually reach the end of this pandemic by working together."" The UK government has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people, with two shots each.

Many of us are desperately hoping new and effective coronavirus vaccines will soon transport us back to our pre-Covid lives. But many scientists are warning that their arrival probably won't mean throwing our face masks in the bin anytime soon. Scroll down  ↓ to find out how vaccines work and why they need to reach a huge number of people in order to see an end to our socially distanced lives. Vaccines are widely considered to be one of the greatest medical achievements of the modern world. Every year they stop an estimated two to three million deaths, preventing more than 20 life-threatening diseases, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Childhood illnesses that were common less than a generation ago are increasingly rare. And smallpox - which killed hundreds of millions of people - has been completely eradicated. But these successes have taken decades to achieve - and many of us are now expecting effective coronavirus vaccines to have similar results in a radically shorter time frame. News that some of the emerging vaccines are more than 90% effective - meaning about nine in 10 people receiving them would be protected from developing Covid-19 - has led many to believe we could soon be ditching social distancing and throwing away our face masks. In the US and the UK, where regulatory approval for the jabs is being granted quickly and mass vaccination programmes planned, some have even suggested life could be back to normal by spring. But many scientists and global health experts are warning that vaccines, with limited initial supplies and roll-out to selected groups, although protecting vulnerable groups and front-line health workers, are unlikely to transport us back to our old way of living anytime soon. Tedros Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, has said as much himself. ""A vaccine will complement the other tools we have, not replace them,"" he said. ""A vaccine on its own will not end the pandemic."" An explanation for this gap in expectations - between the optimism of some politicians and the public on the one hand and the hesitancy of many science professionals on the other - could be, partly, down to a lack of appreciation of how big a task it is to get enough vaccine to enough people. What many of us may not realise is that when we are talking about infectious diseases - those that pass from person to person - to truly protect everyone, we need to inoculate in very large numbers. This is because the power of a vaccine is not just in its ability to protect us as individuals, it is in its capacity to protect the people around us and the communities in which we live. Take Shona, here, for example. The problem for Shona, us and our communities is that no vaccine is ever 100% effective. The measles vaccine is one of the best and protects 95%-98% of people. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna Covid-19 vaccines and their 90%+ efficacy also fall short and we don't yet know whether that percentage will drop over time or outside clinical trial conditions. This means about one in 10 people would not be protected against Covid-19 - even if we vaccinated everyone. Without 100% coverage, which is unlikely in any vaccination programme, the number of people at risk would be higher. They could be among the most vulnerable - we already know older people tend to have a weaker response to vaccination, although the coronavirus vaccines have shown encouraging results in this regard. On top of this, some people in our communities, for health reasons, such as those undergoing some forms of cancer treatment, may not be able to get vaccinated at all. This means a significant pool of people around us will always be left at risk. Some of our friends and family may be among them. But there is still a way of ensuring we indirectly protect everyone - and that is to harness the power of mass vaccination. If we vaccinate enough people within our community an incredible thing happens. We create multiple invisible shields that disrupt a germ's chain of transmission, indirectly protecting our vulnerable friends and family. This is sometimes referred to as population protection or herd immunity. Here's how it works. What we do not yet know - and this is crucial to reaching herd protection levels - is how far the current Covid-19 vaccine contenders are able to prevent transmission, or offer sterilising immunity. We may have to wait some time to know this for sure, but the scientist behind the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine suggeststhere is a chancethat at least one of them could help reduce the risk. But even if we assume they do help block transmission, the number of people who would need to receive the vaccine in order to fully protect the vulnerable is high. This is because even with significant levels of inoculation with an effective vaccine, a large number of people are still left exposed, says Prof David Salisbury, a former director of immunisation at the UK Department of Health and associate fellow at the Chatham House think tank. And this is down to some simple maths, he explains. This is why scientists are pointing out that until we have enough vaccine to go beyond vaccinating at risk groups against Covid-19 and reach a large proportion of the population, we won't see an end to social distancing. ""If you just protect the vulnerable, you will stop deaths that are happening in the vulnerable and you will reduce the burden of hospital cases, but it won't stop transmission,"" says Prof Salisbury. Transmission will continue between people who haven't been vaccinated, who can then spread it to unvaccinated vulnerable people and vulnerable people who have been vaccinated but have not made a protective immune response, he says. This inevitably means that in order to avoid pockets of transmission developing and exposing vulnerable friends and family within our communities, we need to achieve high levels of vaccination across all ages in all geographical areas. Given how interconnected the world is in terms of movement of people and trade, this also means doing the same in every country across the world. ""This is a global pandemic, this isn't a national epidemic, so you've got to stop the virus everywhere and, until you do, nowhere remains safe,"" says Prof Salisbury. Currently the global plan for roll-out means those most at risk and healthcare workers will receive the limited number of available vaccine doses first. But some countries have already indicated they plan to vaccinate beyond at-risk groups when supplies allow, including the US and the UK. The head of the UK's National Health Service (NHS) has said itcould take until Aprilfor all those most at-risk to receive doses - but the government's eventual aim is to vaccinate as many people over the age of 16 as possible. Overall, the WHO estimates that between 65% and 70% of people will need to be immune before transmission is interrupted, herd protection achieved and everyone and everywhere declared safe. Prof Azra Ghani, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London who specialises in the mathematical modelling of infectious diseases, thinks we need to reach 70% to be ""on the safe side"". She believes achieving this will, ultimately, return our lives to normal, but getting there will be a difficult process, even without any unforeseen obstacles. ""It will end the pandemic, it is just a question of when, and that's the hardest bit to anticipate because getting this vaccine out that is the biggest challenge."" Immunising a large chunk of the UK's 68 million people will be an immense task, never mind reaching most of the globe's 7.8 billion residents. Nothing on this scale has ever been attempted before. The vaccines and their equipment - such as the vials to house them - need to be manufactured in mass quantities. Vaccine supply may not be able to meet demand for some time. The vaccines then need to be transported from factories and delivered to health centres - including those in isolated, hard-to-reach communities across the world. Some of the vaccines are also likely to require cold storage, for example the Pfizer vaccine needs to bekept at temperatures of -70C (-94F). The UK's NHS is setting up a network of vaccination centres to manage the logistical task after the country became the first in the world to approve the Pfizer jab as well as one made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. But for others the challenge will be greater. German logistics giant Deutsche Post DHL has warned that large parts of Africa, Asia and South America have insufficient cooling facilities in the ""last mile"" delivery stages as well as not enough storage, which would""pose the biggest challenge""to delivering a vaccine at scale. And there is yet another barrier that could slow the task of reaching enough people to protect the vulnerable. Health officials will have to overcome a rising tide of ""vaccine hesitancy"" - growing numbers of people who are reluctant to have inoculations - a phenomenon regarded as one of the top 10 threats to global health by the WHO. In the UK, about36% of peoplesaid they were either uncertain or very unlikely to agree to be vaccinated, a report by scientific institutions the British Academy and the Royal Society found. Similar figureswere recorded by a YouGov poll in November. This vaccine hesitancy, along with the growth of misinformation around vaccination - the so-called anti-vax movement - could make herd protection by vaccination harder to attain in many countries. Prof Ghani suggests reassuring people who would normally get vaccinated but who are currently feeling ""a little bit nervous"" about how quickly Covid-19 vaccines have been developed, will be crucial to mass roll-out in the UK. The task of winning over populations and getting people to turn up for appointments may mean we move towards herd protection levels ""at a slower timescale"", she says. Despite the scientific and practical challenges of delivering an effective vaccine accross the UK and also the world, the good news is that it looks likely the first-generation vaccines will have a significant impact on the global battle against Covid-19. In the short term they will help prevent the most vulnerable in our communities from developing severe disease and dying, especially older people with pre-existing conditions and front-line health workers. Pfizer/BioNTech's announcement that their vaccine appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old is an important boost to this work. The bad news is that it could well take months or possibly years to vaccinate enough of the global population to make the whole interconnected world safe and reach a point where we can all return to full normal. Suggestions that vaccines will be able to take us back to where we were pre-Covid by Easter have given people an unrealistic expectation, says Prof Salisbury, and such an outcome, in the absence of the interruption of transmission, is ""unlikely"". Even countries with strong health infrastructure and experience of mass vaccination programmes - like the UK - will find reaching enough people to break the chain of transmission a challenge, he says. While the outlook for at-risk groups will be ""undoubtedly brighter"" in 2021, Prof Salisbury says, the rest of us look likely to be taking extra measures for some time to come, something he refers to as ""vaccine plus"". Prof Ghani agrees and estimates it will take two more years to ""to get the whole world back to normal"", but with the process likely to be quicker for high-income countries like the UK. But she warns that while vaccines will ultimately end the pandemic, they will not ""get rid of the virus"" and the world will need to ""keep vaccinating"" just as it does with other diseases. So with a new era of ""vaccine plus"" possibly now dawning in the battle against Covid-19, 2021 is likely to require us to continue to dig deep for a number of months to come - and possibly beyond.

"Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen have spoken as they try to break the post-Brexit trade deal stalemate. The leaders were called in after negotiators for the two sides said ""significant divergences"" remained following a week of intensive talks. ""If there is still a way, we will see,"" EU negotiator Michel Barnier said. Sticking points include fishing rights, rules on state subsidies for business and arrangements for policing any deal. The BBC understands the call between the two leaders began at 16:30 GMT. President Von Der Leyen will make a statement shortly. The UK left the EU on 31 January but remains under EU trading rules until a transition period ends on 31 December. One source close to the negotiations on the UK side suggested there had been a more optimistic outlook earlier in the week but pointed to demands for EU fishing boats to have 10-year access to UK waters as one issue that derailed progress -as had been reported in the Telegraph.,external This video can not be played Michel Barnier: ""If there is still a way, we will see"" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the pattern of recent UK negotiations with the EU was for victory to be snatched from the verge of defeat at the very last moment - but that one member of the government was now putting the chances of a deal at around 50-50. She said it would be complacent to think it would all automatically fall into place after a last bit of political scrapping. Speaking to reporters in London as he prepared to return to Brussels, Mr Barnier said: ""We keep calm, as always, and if there is still a way, we will see."" Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? France's Europe minister suggested his country could veto a deal if it was not satisfied. French President Emmanuel Macron has been keen to ensure the fishing industry will not lose too much access to British waters. But Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts said the fishing issue had been ""overdone"" by both the UK and France, adding: ""We should cut it down to size. It should not be allowed to derail a good deal."" Mr Lamberts said the main issues that remain were competition and governance. He said: ""These are much more important and this is a very tough nut to crack, and it will really depend on whether Boris Johnson wants to limit the economic damage caused by Brexit."" Meanwhile, the spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was ""always room for compromise"". And Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin said he ""fervently hoped"" a trade deal can be agreed. Former UK Brexit Secretary David Davis told BBC Breakfast the probability of a deal was ""still high"" but there would be compromise on both sides and the ""big decisions won't be this afternoon between the prime minister and president of the commission but in wires running hot between Berlin and Paris and other capitals"". He said: ""My suspicion is when it gets to the end of the month there is no time to ratify... so they will have to do some sort of freeze in place of current customs arrangements to take us through the few months until everybody from the European Parliament to the Walloon parliament actually give their opinion."" Positive-minded readers might consider that, even if the EU-UK deal were almost agreed, the European Commission president and arguably, especially Boris Johnson, who has aligned himself so personally to ""getting Brexit done"", would want to put their personal stamp on things. Confirmation that they will call each other on Saturday afternoon could therefore be seen as a ""good"" sign. Although sources in the EU and UK warn not to expect news of the conclusive Big Breakthrough following their chat. Cynics might nod their heads too when I say that - considering the uncomfortable political compromises both sides have to make to reach a deal - one more ""crisis"", aka the current stop in talks, is quite useful to demonstrate to the public back home that you're hanging on in there, fighting for their interests. That's certainly the way to interpret France's threat to use its veto if a deal is agreed, and it doesn't like it. Emmanuel Macron has enjoyed the role of Brexit bad cop throughout. It plays well domestically. And ""France the frenemy"" is an easy headline in the UK too. But reality is more nuanced. Paris trumpets more brashly what is the belief in all EU capitals, and in the UK government: Yes to this deal but not at any cost. Read more from Katya here. Releasing identical statements on Friday evening, Mr Barnier and his UK counterpart, Lord Frost, said: ""After one week of intense negotiation in London, the two chief negotiators agreed today that the conditions for an agreement are not met, due to significant divergences on level playing field, governance and fisheries.

And the 27 EU national parliaments could also need to ratify an agreement -  depending on the actual contents of the deal. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

"The UK and EU have decided to return to the negotiating table to try to agree a post-Brexit trade deal, despite ""significant differences"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen made the decision during a phone call on Saturday. A statement said there were three ""critical issues"" to address. Negotiating teams will reconvene in Brussels on Sunday, and the leaders will speak again on Monday evening. In the joint statement from Mr Johnson and Ms Von der Leyen,external, they said fishing rights, competition rules and how any deal is enforced were still causing problems, with the statement adding: ""Both sides underlined that no agreement is feasible if these issues are not resolved."" But the leaders continued: ""Whilst recognising the seriousness of these differences, we agreed that a further effort should be undertaken by our negotiating teams to assess whether they can be resolved."" The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said the next meeting ""feels like a last roll of the dice, rather than ironing out a few last minute glitches"", and the next 48 hours would be ""critical"". LIVE: Leaders agree to resume post-Brexit trade talks What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: What is a level playing field? The UK left the EU on 31 January but remains under EU trading rules until the end of the year. The two sides have been holding talks since March in an attempt to secure a deal before this time, which is called the transition period, ends on 31 December. If a deal is not agreed by that point, tariffs - or taxes on goods - could come into force. But the same three sticking points have stopped negotiating teams coming to an agreement, and on Friday, talks came to an end with both sides saying ""significant divergences"" remained. This video can not be played Ursula Von Der Leyen: 'Significant differences remain' in Brexit trade deal In their statement, Mr Johnson and Ms Von der Leyen said they ""welcomed the fact that progress has been achieved in many areas"". But, they added: ""Nevertheless, significant differences remain on three critical issues: level playing field, governance and fisheries. Both sides underlined that no agreement is feasible if these issues are not resolved. ""Whilst recognising the seriousness of these differences, we agreed that a further effort should be undertaken by our negotiating teams to assess whether they can be resolved."" Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are on again:The UK and the EU have until 31 December to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, tweeted after the statement was published, saying: ""We will see if there is a way forward."" Ireland's Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Micheal Martin also took to Twitter, welcoming the news that the teams would resume trade talks. He said: ""An agreement is in everyone's best interests. Every effort should be made to reach a deal."" Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said: ""The British people were promised a deal and, with time running out, we urge both sides to get on with reaching an agreement."" It's not over, not yet. The two sides in this complicated and drawn out process have agreed that it is worth trying one last time to find a way through their profound differences. But the statements from the prime minister and the EU chief, Ursula von der Leyen, signal clearly that a trade deal is out of reach right now - spelling out that if no-one budges in the next few days, it's simply not going to happen. A feature of Brexit negotiations has often been the last minute stand off, the political emergency, before suddenly, lo and behold, a deal emerges from the wreckage. By Monday night, that tradition may have been proven again. Yet it seems there is a lot more to be done than ironing out a few last minute glitches. Read more from Laura here. If an agreement is reached it will need to be turned into legal text and translated into all EU languages, then ratified by the European Parliament. The UK government is likely to introduce legislation implementing parts of any deal reached, which MPs will be able to vote on. And the 27 EU national parliaments could also need to ratify an agreement -  depending on the actual contents of the deal. But before that, there are even more hurdles to overcome. After the talks between the teams on Sunday and the further leaders' call on Monday, the UK Internal Market Bill will return to the Commons. Certain clauses allow the government to override elements of the original treaty with the EU for Brexit - the withdrawal agreement - which, if implemented, would break international law. The EU are unhappy with it, as are the House of Lords, who voted to scrap those clauses of the bill. But the government is still backing its measures, which could cause tensions in the trade talks, and they are expected to push them through on Monday night. Another bill with similar provisions - the Taxation (Post-Transition Period) Bill - will also return to the Commons this week. In addition, EU leaders will be meeting in Brussels on Thursday.

"So, after a week of super intensive, last-ditch talks, EU and UK negotiators are going their separate ways. The EU's chief envoy Michel Barnier heads back to Brussels on Saturday morning. His UK counterpart, David Frost, is to brief the prime minister on why the pause button was pressed. Is this the end of the road for talks, or are we just round the corner to a Happy Ever After? Probably neither. Just yet. If you're in favour of this post-Brexit EU-UK trade deal and you're looking for clues to be upbeat, I'd say it's significant that the two chief negotiators issued a joint statement before parting ways. What happens next with Brexit? Brexit: Seven things that will change on 1 January What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? This wasn't a case of each stomping off to a separate corner before briefing negatively about the other. That differences remain on the three key issues: fishing rights in UK waters, competition regulations and the governance of a deal (ie how to ensure both sides stick to the agreement or face penalties) should come as no surprise. It was ever thus. Limited progress was made this week on all fronts in talks, but as I, and many other Brexit commentators, have long suggested, you need political involvement at the highest levels to make the final, most difficult compromises. Or to publicly declare an agreement is just not possible, and a no deal scenario is heading our way. Positive-minded readers of this blog might also consider that, even if the EU-UK deal were almost agreed, the European Commission president and arguably, especially Boris Johnson, who has aligned himself so personally to ""getting Brexit done"", would want to put their personal stamp on things. Confirmation that they will call each other on Saturday afternoon could therefore be seen as a ""good"" sign.

It plays well domestically. And ""France the frenemy"" is an easy headline in the UK too. How many trade deals has the UK done so far? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? But reality is more nuanced. Paris trumpets more brashly what is the belief in all EU capitals, and in the UK government: Yes to this deal but not at any cost. The priority in Brussels is to protect the single market. The EU hoped to contain UK competition with a common rulebook. But the UK wants to be nimble and competitive; to compromise post-Brexit sovereignty as little as possible. Otherwise, government figures ask, what was the point of leaving the European Union? If you're looking for some certainty in all this, here you go: Neither side will sign on the dotted line if they can't sell this deal as a victory. Negotiations will likely become even thornier if they re-start next week. The government'sInternal Market Billwas expected to return to the House of Commons on Monday. And thelong-awaited Finance Bill, scheduled to be tabled on Tuesday. Both could contain clauses contradicting the Protocol on Northern Ireland, signed with the EU last year as part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. The government insists the clauses are necessary, as a safety net, to ensure the smooth circulation of goods within the United Kingdom, in case of a no deal situation with the EU. But the European Parliament has warned it will veto any deal with the UK, if Downing Street includes the clauses. Breaking the treaty is unacceptable, says the EU. Safety net or not. So the pressure is on. On all sides. We're witnessing that last minute, five to midnight scramble for a deal, widely predicted, but which the UK and EU always said was the last thing they wanted.

"Hannah Gaves was sentenced to three years in jail in August A former prison guard who tried to smuggle crack cocaine into prison in her underwear has had her jail term increased by the Court of Appeal. Hannah Gaves, 27, from Bristol, was found carrying it and cannabis on her way into work at Erlestoke Prison near Devizes. She admitted a series of offences and was jailed for three years in August. Lord Justice Davis ruled her sentence was ""unduly lenient"" and increased the term to four years and eight months. Hannah Gaves smuggled cannabis into HMP Erlestoke Gaves, of Butlers Close, St George, had pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply a Class A drug, possession with intent to supply a Class B drug and attempting to bring tobacco into prison. The court heard Gaves had been working as a prison officer for just under a year when she was caught with the drugs on 27 January 2019. CCTV footage showed her ""spending a considerable period of time in a cell of a particular prisoner"" and a decision was made to stop and search her. When she was told she would be searched and was asked if she had any prohibited items, said ""she answered, 'yes, weed and tobacco""'. But the judge said: ""That was not the whole truth because when she was searched, not only was a quantity of cannabis (found) ... in addition, and hidden in her underwear, was a lump of a white substance wrapped in cling film."" Cocaine was found concealed in Hannah Gaves' underwear Gaves told police she felt she had ""no option"" and the unnamed individual who asked her to bring drugs into the jail ""knew where she lived and had contacted her on social media"". But Lord Justice Davis said: ""If threats are made to (prison officers) they know that their responsibility is to report that threat."" Increasing Gaves' sentence, Lord Justice Davis said the three-year term was ""not simply lenient, it is undoubtedly unduly lenient"". In a statement after the hearing, Solicitor General Michael Ellis QC said: ""Gaves intentionally smuggled contraband into prison with the intention of supplying dangerous drugs.

"Testing began on Saturday morning Mass coronavirus testing has started in one of the areas hardest-hit by Covid-19 in Wales in a bid to bring the virus under control. People living or working in the Lower Cynon Valley - which includes Abercynon, Penrhiwceiber and parts of Mountain Ash and Aberaman - will be offered tests. Test centres will run from Saturday until 20 December. It is the second place in Wales to have mass testing after Merthyr Tydfil. Residents in Mountain Ash East and West, and Aberaman South residents, are also eligible for the tests, which give results in 30 minutes. Dr Kelechi Nnoaham: ""People in the Lower Cynon Valley can play a major role in protecting everyone in our communities"" Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board public health director, Dr Kelechi Nnoaham, said: ""The rate of Covid-19 infection is still very high in our communities, and by engaging with this testing programme, people in the Lower Cynon Valley can play a major role in protecting everyone in our communities."" Covid-19: Merthyr sees 977 mass-tested for coronavirus NHS Wales front-line staff to get twice-weekly Covid tests Student Covid testing begins for Christmas exodus The main test centres are at Cynon Valley Indoor Bowls Centre, Mountain Ash and Abercynon Sports Centre. John Collins took his test at the bowls centre John Collins, 88, from Penrhiwceiber, who took a test at the bowls centre, said: ""At my age you have to try and avoid getting this virus."" The testing programme will use so-called lateral flow devices which can get results in about 20-30 minutes. If a person tests positive, they will be asked to return home so they can self-isolate immediately. Concerns have been raised by some expertsthat people who are declared negative could have a misplaced sense of reassurance. If someone tests negative, they should still follow the rules, and maintain social distancing, hand hygiene and mask wearing. Rhondda Cynon Taf council leader Andrew Morgan said about 27,000 people could be tested in the Lower Cynon Valley. ""Unfortunately, over the last week or so, we are seeing our cases starting to increase at quite a concerning rate,"" he told BBC Radio WalesBreakfast with Oliver Hides. Mass coronavirus testing will run until 20 December in the Lower Cynon Valley He said the area had seen 300 positive cases in the last two days so it was ""important"" to identify and isolate those who were asymptomatic within communities to break ""chains of transmission"". ""This is an integral part of our fight against the virus, as it gives us a greater understanding of the prevalence and level of transmission within our communities,"" he said. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""I would encourage the people of Lower Cynon Valley to get tested."" The Merthyr pilot for mass testing, which launched last month, will run until 11 December. The case rate in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) is 368.5 per 100,000, reporting 889 new positive tests in the past week. The south Wales valleyshad been dominating for highest case ratesand having fallen back early in November, the rates have now started to move up again. In the most recent comparable week, Torfaen, Blaenau Gwent and Neath Port Talbot have been among the 10 highest case rate areas in the UK.

"This video can not be played Diana Isajeva has taken social media in her search to find a live kidney donor ""I am faced with the reality that my heart may stop and I might not wake up tomorrow."" Diana Isajeva has taken to Facebook and social networking app Nextdoor in her search to find a live kidney donor. The 27-year-old, from Leckwith, Cardiff, had complete kidney failure during the coronavirus lockdown. The Welsh Government said doctors had to balance the need for a transplant with the ""challenges of widespread community transmission of Covid"". Originally from Lithuania, Diana has lived in Cardiff since she was 15. She was in her first year studying law when she woke up one morning with neck pain: ""I just thought I had slept funny, but then my joints started to swell and I couldn't eat or sleep or walk, and was in complete agony."" Organ donation: 'Mum said we don't do it. So we don't' Saved By The Bell apologises for Selena Gomez kidney transplant joke After several tests and a biopsy, she was diagnosed with an extremely aggressive form oflupus,external, which turned out to be life-threatening, and her organs started to fail. ""At 19 years old, the doctors saved my life, and I had to have chemotherapy in order to continue to live, this is what has affected my kidneys,"" she said. ""Eight years of chemotherapy takes its toll on the body and unfortunately my kidneys couldn't be saved."" Her usual monthly blood tests were postponed for four months due to the pandemic and she said her chemotherapy was delayed for 10 weeks. ""I understand why the ward was turned into a Covid ward and the kidney doctors had to work to help those who had Covid, but the pandemic made it that my condition deteriorated a lot quicker."" Diana Isajeva said it would be ""an absolute miracle,"" to find a kidney donor for Christmas With the considerable decline in her kidney function, doctors said her best bet to live a healthy life was a transplant. ""Getting that news was awful, basically being told you are dying and then not being able to hug anyone or see anyone who could support was so, so hard,"" she said Diana's family all live abroad so cannot donate and her fiancÃ©, Sandeep Singh Randhawa, is not a match, so she has decided to turn to the public. Woman's Facebook search for sperm donor Wales' opt-out system 'did not boost donors' Her blood type - O - is universal,meaning donors can give to people with blood types A, B and AB,external, but can only have a transplant from someone who is type O. ""I read an article where a stranger donated a kidney and it inspired me, so I asked my doctor if I could run a campaign and she said she would support me, so I posted on Facebook and it is slowly picking up,"" she said. ""I have had responses from all over the world, it's been mixed but mostly positive. Some people have been sceptical and I have had a few offers from people offering to sell me a kidney but its mainly been messages of kindness and support. ""It would change my life, it would be the biggest gift that I could receive and would be like having a second birthday. I would be able to get married and pursue my career."" Diana said, without a live donor, she would need dialysis, which would shorten her life expectancy: ""Dialysis wears out your heart, and cadaver transplants are full of toxins which make it harder to recover. ""With a live donor, the kidney can last a lifetime as it works much better and for a longer time, it would give me the opportunity to live a happy and healthy life."" Because of the backlog of people waiting for surgeries of kidney transplants after the pandemic, Diana said she was not able to be put back on the waiting list. Wales' only transplant centre was temporarily closedduring the UK-wide lockdown earlier this year. Diana said her ordeal ""made me realise how important life is and to cherish those closest around you"" Fiona Loud, policy director of Kidney Care UK, said transplants were ""down by 800 year-on-year, and the overall drop in transplants was 73%"". Diana is having more chemotherapy in January, but said it was ""only to prolong my life until I get a transplant"". She added: ""I'm just trying to live my life as long as I can, hoping that I can hold on and a match is found, I am so afraid with the realisation that my heart may stop and I may not wake up tomorrow."" Ms Loud said: ""A kidney transplant is the gold-star treatment for kidney failure yet there are always more people waiting for a transplant than there are donor organs available. ""Hospitals need to prioritise kidney surgery and ensure they are doing everything they can to support people whose kidneys have failed."" The Welsh Government said: ""We are unable to comment on people's individual circumstances but we are sorry to hear about this woman's situation and we wish the best for her ongoing treatment and care. ""Kidney transplants were suspended at the start of the pandemic but have been resumed over the summer. Renal services staff have also worked hard to ensure the active monitoring of people under their care has been maintained throughout the pandemic. ""However, transplant teams need to balance the patient's need for transplant against the additional challenges of wide spread community transmission of Covid and being immuno-suppressed at this time.""

"It's not really possible for one photo to convey the scale of A68a An RAF aircraft has obtained images of the world's biggest iceberg as it drifts through the South Atlantic. The A400m transporter flew low over the 4,200-sq-km block, known as A68a, to observe its increasingly ragged state. The pictures reveal multiple cracks and fissures, innumerable icy chunks that have fallen off, and what appear to be tunnels extending under the waterline. The Antarctic berg is currently bearing down on theBritish Overseas Territory of South Georgia,external. A68a is now just 200km from the island and there is a real possibility it could become stuck in shallow coastal waters. World's biggest iceberg is fraying at its edges Huge iceberg on collision path with wildlife haven This cliff face is 30m high, but the berg probably reaches under water for 200m The latest satellite imagery: A68a and South Georgia are about the same size The British Forces South Atlantic Island (BFSAI) reconnaissance flight was sent out to assess the situation. ""Guided by satellite tracking, the A400M can get under the weather and closer to the iceberg, enabling more detailed observations,"" Squadron Leader Michael Wilkinson, Officer Commanding 1312 Flt, said in aBFSAI Facebook posting,external. ""I know I speak on behalf of all of the crew involved when I say this is certainly a unique and unforgettable task to be involved in."" Some of the separated blocks are significant bergs in their own right Satellite images acquired in recent weeks have also suggested that A68a's edges are crumbling rapidly. Relentless wave action is breaking off countless small fragments, so-called ""bergy bits"" and ""growlers"". But some of the pieces being calved are significant objects in their own right and will need tracking because of the additional hazard they will now pose to shipping. The A400m's new imagery - stills and video - will be analysed to try to understand how the berg might behave in the coming weeks and months. Blue whales have 'rediscovered' South Georgia South Georgia: New map traces Shackleton's footsteps There is now a mass of icy debris around A68a Although currently heading straight at South Georgia, A68a is being carried in fast-moving waters that should divert the bloc in a loop around the southern part of the island. There is considerable interest in whether the berg might then ground on the territory's continental shelf. Should that happen, it could cause considerable difficulties for the island's seals and penguins as they try to get out to sea to forage for fish and krill. When A68a broke away from an ice shelf in Antarcticain July 2017, it measured nearly 6,000 sq km - about a quarter of the size of Wales. At 4,200 sq km, it now has an area closer to that of an English county like Somerset. Experts are surprised the iceberg hasn't lost more of its bulk. Many thought it would have shattered into several large pieces long before now. The flight saw what appeared to be tunnels extending under the waterline With a draft of about 200m, A68a has the potential to catch on the shallow shelf around the island Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk,externaland follow me on Twitter:@BBCAmos,external At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Charley Oliver-Holland said the number of different social media channels meant ""bullying just doesn't stop"" Warning: This report contains offensive language. ""I went online to make friends with people who were similar to me, so I could be myself, but when the other kids in school found my profile they made fun out of me."" About one in five children aged 10-15 in England and Wales suffered at least one form of online bullying in the year to March 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Charley Oliver-Holland was 12 when she started getting bullied. She always had friends, but did not really fit in at high school. ""I had an Instagram page that I made of my favourite band and it allowed me to make friends online with similar interests, but when people from school found the page, I ended up getting so much grief,"" she said. The 17-year-old from Caldicot, Monmouthshire, remembers being called dyke, emo, fat, as well as being told to die and go cut herself by people at her school, as well as total strangers. ""People saw I was different and expressing myself and didn't like it, because I didn't fit in, they would call me all sorts of names. ""It would be random people, I wouldn't even know them and they would post awful things. As a 12-year-old it's not a nice thing to hear and you take it to heart."" Charley was targeted by bullies after posting pictures online of herself with black lipstick and hair She said people got a feeling of invincibility when online, prompting them to say things they never would in person. ""All you need is an email address and you can make a fake account and say what you want about whoever. There were so many people in school who, when one account was shut down, they would just make another, it's really scary. ""People can be really horrible when they don't think there are consequences to their actions, they come across lovely in person but when they are on their phone in their bedroom they change. ""At school, you get bullied and can go home and escape from it, but with online it's constant, you can't escape from it, it is always there."" Charley said some of her friends did not go into school due to the severity of the online bullying they suffered and there were times when she did not want to go in either. ""I would just feel like an outcast and that people would hold that against me. At 12 years old it feels like the worst thing that can happen to you,"" she said. ""At that age there aren't many things that are important, but your social status is and how you are viewed by other people, everyone talking about me, I just didn't want to be there, school just seemed like such a toxic environment."" Instagram now asks bullies: 'Are you sure?' Online trolls made Little Mix's Jesy Nelson 'want to die' Charley feels online bullying behaviour is normalised and - because so many people get involved - it makes it harder to stop or report. The ONS report - which featured new data it said should be interpreted with caution - showed more than half of those children who experienced online bullying would not describe what happened as bullying, while one in four did not report it to anyone. 2,200 children surveyed 19%children aged 10 to 15 years in England and Wales experienced at least one type of online bullying 52%of those children said they would not describe these behaviours as ""bullying"" 26%did not report their experiences 72%of children who experienced online bullying experienced some of it at school or during school time ""I didn't feel like I could tell anyone, it feels like there is nothing you can do, once it's happening. If you report it to the school what are they going to do? I did tell my mum about it and she did tell me to get off my phone, but it's difficult. ""It consumes you, I was always on my phone, trying to see what people were saying about me, what nasty messages were being posted. ""At that age social media is so important, you beg your parents to allow you to have a profile because you don't want to be the odd one out. ""I just felt alone, people would say nasty comments about my weight, about my sexuality, saying I had no friends, just putting me down. People would bully others for the phone that they have, it would be anything."" Charley says she suffered ""relentless"" bullying at school and online Charley said she was now more careful with what she posts online, but the bullying she experienced five years ago still stays with her. ""Walking past a group of boys, it takes me back to when I was in school, and I worry if they are going to say something,"" she added. ""I think there needs to be better education in schools for young people about online bullying and taking a break from social media. ""I also think that to use those accounts you should have to submit proof to prove who you are, so you can't have fake accounts and are held accountable for what you say."" Olivia Barbieri said online bullying leaves people with ""no switch-off and no safe place"" Olivia Barbieri said she has always been different and was bullied throughout her school life, but when she got her own social media accounts at the age of 13, she felt it got even worse. ""Face-to-face bullying is horrible and I have experienced that with people from work, but online is 100% worse. People have so much more confidence online and say whatever they want."" The 18-year-old from Caldicot has anxiety and said she did not experience anything really bad until a couple of weeks ago. ""I did an Instagram Live event with this guy and it just was awful, people were commenting on my appearance, saying I belonged in a mental asylum, that I should be aborted, just stuff that was irrelevant,"" she said. ""I had people I considered as friends sending me death threats. I ended up deleting all my social media channels and changing my name on my profiles, I had to because hedoxxedme. It was really horrible. ""It's not just about one post or one video, it's everything, it all adds up, and online it's so difficult to report - social media platforms need to take more responsibility. ""If it wasn't for my family, partner and close friends, feeling I could turn to them and speak with them I don't know if I would be here today."" In a statement, Facebook, which owns Instagram, said: ""We are committed to leading the industry in the fight against online bullying. We have invested in technology to detect and remove offensive content from Instagram, expanded our dedicated safety and security team to over 35,000 people, and built strong partnerships with experts to help keep people safe."" Instagram 'will overtake Twitter as a news source' Can this technology put an end to bullying? Founder of charity BulliesOut, Linda James, said the ONS statistics reflected what she had seen, but feels the true number of victims could be much higher. ""A lot of people hide bullying under the guise of banter and joking when it isn't, so I fear that the percentages of those being bullied online could be much higher than the figures seen by ONS,"" she said. ""We as a charity are seeing the trends that online bullying is increasing, and this is then spilling into other forms of bullying including physical. ""Online bullying is much more emotionally damaging and traumatising for young people than other forms as it is 24/7, it's relentless, it will have a massive impact on their mental health as they are unable to switch off. ""With more young people at home [due to coronavirus] they are online more and online for longer, there is nothing for them to do apart from being online and the impact this is going to have on them on their self-esteem and confidence is going to be horrific."" She feels more education is needed to understand and support young people: ""It isn't one person's responsibility, parents need to monitor their children and schools need to take responsibility when it comes to online bullying and have a zero-tolerance policy to all forms of bullying. ""There needs to be more education about what you do online and your digital footprint, so young people are mindful of their behaviour online."" Dr Sangeet Bhullar, executive director of WISE KIDS, which promotes safe internet use, said: ""We need to look at creating a culture of support where a young person feels comfortable talking about the social media platforms they access and what interaction they have. There needs to be greater accountability with schools and parents. ""I think we are in a better situation than we have been in as there is a lot more awareness about the situation, but we need to look at developing a sense of wellbeing and self-worth in young people, which will strengthen their ability to deal with uncomfortable situations such as online bullying."" The Welsh Government said: ""Challenging bullying within education remains a key priority for us and we are committed to ensuring all our learners are properly supported to achieve their full potential. ""It has never been more important to equip our children and young people with the knowledge, skills and resilience to navigate the online world. ""Protecting children and young people from harmful activity online is critical and it is therefore vital that we provide an education system that enables our learners to embrace technology and contribute positively online.""

"Hens, turkeys and other captive birds in Britain will have to be kept indoors from 14 December to prevent the spread of bird flu, the government has said. The chief vets for England, Scotland and Wales made the decision after a number of cases were detected among both captive and wild birds. The risk to humans is ""very low"",the government said,external, and should ""not affect the consumption of poultry products"". But in a joint statement, veterinary chiefs said ""swift action"" was needed. ""Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, from 14 December onwards you will be legally required to keep your birds indoors, or take appropriate steps to keep them separate from wild birds,"" read the statement. ""We have not taken this decision lightly but it is the best way to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease."" Turkeys to be culled after bird flu found at farm Bird flu killed wild birds in south west England From the archives: What's the threat of bird flu to humans? There are numerous strains of bird flu. Most either do not affect humans, or are not easily caught and spread by humans. Deaths have been recorded outside of the UK related to some strains, but the H5N8 strain - which makes up the bulk of the UK's current cases - has not infected any humans worldwide to date,the NHS said.,external A turkey farm in Norfolk is among those tofound to have had an outbreak of the H5N8 bird flu strain.The birds will now be slaughtered to prevent the spread. While the news will be of particular concern to poultry farmers in the run-up to Christmas, the new rules will apply to all bird owners in Britain. However, despite the concern, the Department for Environment Farming and Rural Affairs said poultry products - including eggs - are still safe to consume. Poultry includes chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, pigeon (bred for meat), partridge, quail, guinea fowl and pheasants. No end date for the measures has been given, but Defra said they would be kept under ""regular review"". Farmers forced to move their birds indoors in circumstances such as these may continue to market the meat as ""free range"" as long as the measures do not last longer than 12 weeks. For eggs, this deadline is slightly longer - 16 weeks. After this point, the eggs must be downgraded to ""barn produced"". Aimee Mahony, chief poultry adviser for the National Farmers' Union, said the new rules were ""a logical next step"". ""These new measures mean that every poultry keeper, whether you have one hen in the garden or a large poultry business, must house their birds indoors and I would urge everyone with poultry to take these measures seriously,"" she said.

"Hannah Gaves was sentenced to three years in jail in August A former prison guard who tried to smuggle crack cocaine into prison in her underwear has had her jail term increased by the Court of Appeal. Hannah Gaves, 27, from Bristol, was found carrying it and cannabis on her way into work at Erlestoke Prison near Devizes. She admitted a series of offences and was jailed for three years in August. Lord Justice Davis ruled her sentence was ""unduly lenient"" and increased the term to four years and eight months. Hannah Gaves smuggled cannabis into HMP Erlestoke Gaves, of Butlers Close, St George, had pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply a Class A drug, possession with intent to supply a Class B drug and attempting to bring tobacco into prison. The court heard Gaves had been working as a prison officer for just under a year when she was caught with the drugs on 27 January 2019. CCTV footage showed her ""spending a considerable period of time in a cell of a particular prisoner"" and a decision was made to stop and search her. When she was told she would be searched and was asked if she had any prohibited items, said ""she answered, 'yes, weed and tobacco""'. But the judge said: ""That was not the whole truth because when she was searched, not only was a quantity of cannabis (found) ... in addition, and hidden in her underwear, was a lump of a white substance wrapped in cling film."" Cocaine was found concealed in Hannah Gaves' underwear Gaves told police she felt she had ""no option"" and the unnamed individual who asked her to bring drugs into the jail ""knew where she lived and had contacted her on social media"". But Lord Justice Davis said: ""If threats are made to (prison officers) they know that their responsibility is to report that threat."" Increasing Gaves' sentence, Lord Justice Davis said the three-year term was ""not simply lenient, it is undoubtedly unduly lenient"". In a statement after the hearing, Solicitor General Michael Ellis QC said: ""Gaves intentionally smuggled contraband into prison with the intention of supplying dangerous drugs.

"The explosion happened at a house in Green Lane, Illingworth Three people have been taken to hospital following an explosion at a house in West Yorkshire. Onlookers said the home, in Green Lane, Illingworth, near Halifax, was ""completely destroyed"" in the blast, which sounded ""like a bomb went off"". A woman suffered severe burns and a man was seriously injured, West Yorkshire Police said. A second woman sustained minor injuries. The force said it was continuing to investigate the cause of the blast.

West Yorkshire Fire & Rescue said six nearby homes had been evacuated. Andy Sykes, who lives nearby, said: ""It's been completely destroyed. It's a real mess. ""The house is at the end of a row of three and and it just looks like it is completely gone. It's like a bomb has gone off."" This video can not be played Footage from the scene shows a large fire at the explosion site Candice Nevison described hearing a ""massive bang"". ""I saw people jumping out of the house, literally there was no front to the house,"" she said. ""I heard people saying get the old lady out who lives next door.

An investigation into the cause of the explosion is under way Benjy Bush, group manager for West Yorkshire Fire & Rescue said about 20 firefighters were sent to the incident following reports of an explosion at 07:30 GMT. ""Crews on the ground reported scenes of fire and extensive damage to the property,"" he said. ""We had reports that there were three adults in the property. Those adults got out of the property and they were being dealt with by Yorkshire Ambulance Service on the scene and then they were transported to hospital."" Firefighters were likely to be on the scene for some time and an investigation had been launched, he added. A fundraiser for those affected by the blast has been set up, with people offering to donate clothes and food to the family through local businesses and charities. Mr Sykes, who works at the Noah's Ark Centre, in nearby Ovenden, said the charity was helping to co-ordinate fundraising. ""We've had lots of people contacting us wanting to make donations,"" he said. ""I'm sure over the course of the next 24 hours the community will rally round and we will end up with a good bit of support.""

"Sir Keir Starmer - pictured on a visit earlier this week - is not showing any symptoms Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is having to self isolate after a member of his staff tested positive for coronavirus. In line with government advice, Sir Keir will now have to stay at home for 14 days since his last contact with the affected person. A spokesman for Sir Keir said this means he will come out of self-isolation on Wednesday 16 December. They added the party leader was ""well and not showing any symptoms"". Will a vaccine give us our old lives back? What is self-isolation and who has to do it? It is the second time Sir Keir has had to isolate because of coronavirus. In September,a member of his family showed symptoms of the virus. But they later tested negative, allowing Sir Keir to get back to Westminster. It also comes a week afterPrime Minister Boris Johnson came out of his own isolation period, having had contact with an MP who tested positive with the virus.

"Hens, turkeys and other captive birds in Britain will have to be kept indoors from 14 December to prevent the spread of bird flu, the government has said. The chief vets for England, Scotland and Wales made the decision after a number of cases were detected among both captive and wild birds. The risk to humans is ""very low"",the government said,external, and should ""not affect the consumption of poultry products"". But in a joint statement, veterinary chiefs said ""swift action"" was needed. ""Whether you keep just a few birds or thousands, from 14 December onwards you will be legally required to keep your birds indoors, or take appropriate steps to keep them separate from wild birds,"" read the statement. ""We have not taken this decision lightly but it is the best way to protect your birds from this highly infectious disease."" Turkeys to be culled after bird flu found at farm Bird flu killed wild birds in south west England From the archives: What's the threat of bird flu to humans? There are numerous strains of bird flu. Most either do not affect humans, or are not easily caught and spread by humans. Deaths have been recorded outside of the UK related to some strains, but the H5N8 strain - which makes up the bulk of the UK's current cases - has not infected any humans worldwide to date,the NHS said.,external A turkey farm in Norfolk is among those tofound to have had an outbreak of the H5N8 bird flu strain.The birds will now be slaughtered to prevent the spread. While the news will be of particular concern to poultry farmers in the run-up to Christmas, the new rules will apply to all bird owners in Britain. However, despite the concern, the Department for Environment Farming and Rural Affairs said poultry products - including eggs - are still safe to consume. Poultry includes chickens, ducks, turkeys, geese, pigeon (bred for meat), partridge, quail, guinea fowl and pheasants. No end date for the measures has been given, but Defra said they would be kept under ""regular review"". Farmers forced to move their birds indoors in circumstances such as these may continue to market the meat as ""free range"" as long as the measures do not last longer than 12 weeks. For eggs, this deadline is slightly longer - 16 weeks. After this point, the eggs must be downgraded to ""barn produced"". Aimee Mahony, chief poultry adviser for the National Farmers' Union, said the new rules were ""a logical next step"". ""These new measures mean that every poultry keeper, whether you have one hen in the garden or a large poultry business, must house their birds indoors and I would urge everyone with poultry to take these measures seriously,"" she said.

"Hannah Gaves was sentenced to three years in jail in August A former prison guard who tried to smuggle crack cocaine into prison in her underwear has had her jail term increased by the Court of Appeal. Hannah Gaves, 27, from Bristol, was found carrying it and cannabis on her way into work at Erlestoke Prison near Devizes. She admitted a series of offences and was jailed for three years in August. Lord Justice Davis ruled her sentence was ""unduly lenient"" and increased the term to four years and eight months. Hannah Gaves smuggled cannabis into HMP Erlestoke Gaves, of Butlers Close, St George, had pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply a Class A drug, possession with intent to supply a Class B drug and attempting to bring tobacco into prison. The court heard Gaves had been working as a prison officer for just under a year when she was caught with the drugs on 27 January 2019. CCTV footage showed her ""spending a considerable period of time in a cell of a particular prisoner"" and a decision was made to stop and search her. When she was told she would be searched and was asked if she had any prohibited items, said ""she answered, 'yes, weed and tobacco""'. But the judge said: ""That was not the whole truth because when she was searched, not only was a quantity of cannabis (found) ... in addition, and hidden in her underwear, was a lump of a white substance wrapped in cling film."" Cocaine was found concealed in Hannah Gaves' underwear Gaves told police she felt she had ""no option"" and the unnamed individual who asked her to bring drugs into the jail ""knew where she lived and had contacted her on social media"". But Lord Justice Davis said: ""If threats are made to (prison officers) they know that their responsibility is to report that threat."" Increasing Gaves' sentence, Lord Justice Davis said the three-year term was ""not simply lenient, it is undoubtedly unduly lenient"". In a statement after the hearing, Solicitor General Michael Ellis QC said: ""Gaves intentionally smuggled contraband into prison with the intention of supplying dangerous drugs.

"The mass use of rapid Covid tests has been defended by a senior NHS adviser, amid concerns over their accuracy. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to NHS Test and Trace, said the lateral flow tests could identify many cases of infection in people without symptoms. Speaking to the BBC, she accepted there had been ""false negatives"" but stressed the policy was a ""game-changer"". A study found the tests missed 50% of cases and some scientists fear people could start to ignore health advice. Meanwhile, a further 397 new coronavirus deaths were recorded in the UK on Saturday, with another 15,539 cases reported. Mass testing is being introduced in England's tier-three ""high-risk"" areas and isstarting in one of the areas hardest-hit by Covid-19 in Wales. And more than millionrapid tests are being sent to care homesin England over the next month to allow safe indoor visits. However, anarticle in the BMJ medical journal,externalraised concerns about the effects of rapid testing in Liverpool, where a pilot scheme was carried out. The lateral flow tests, which do not require processing in a laboratory, were reported to have missed half of all cases and a third of those with a high viral load who were likely to be the most infectious. Dr Hopkins told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the tests had ""limitations"" but said they were helping diagnose asymptomatic cases that would otherwise have gone undetected. She added: ""What we are doing here is case detection. We are not saying people do not have the disease if their test is negative. ""We are trying to say [to people who test positive] 'You do have the disease and now we want you to go and isolate for 10 days.' That is a whole different game-changer."" Will there be mass testing in your area? Safety fears pause Manchester care home testing When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? UK coronavirus cases up by 16,298 on Friday However, Dr Hopkins said mass testing did not end the need for social distancing. ""We are also very clear that until we get a much lower prevalence of disease in this country that we shouldn't be changing our behaviours,"" she said. By Katharine Da Costa, BBC health correspondent The pregnancy-style lateral flow tests are cheap to produce and provide results on the spot, unlike the standard nose and throat swabs which have to be sent off to a lab. However, the higher number of false negative results means people may wrongly think they are not infectious. Some scientists worry those people may go on to mix with more vulnerable people, putting them at risk. But the government says the Liverpool trial showed rapid tests could break chains of transmission, and they will start to use them for the first time next week in Wolverhampton - where Covid cases are more than twice the average level in England. Dr Hopkins' comments came as the UK's chief medical officers warned the winter could be ""especially hard"" for the health service because of coronavirus. Officials arepreparing to begin using the Pfizer/BioNTechCovid-19 vaccine as early as Tuesday, with Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying supplies have arrived in Scotland. But in a letter to NHS staff, the chief medical officers of England (Prof Chris Whitty), Scotland (Dr Gregor Smith), Wales (Dr Frank Atherton) and Northern Ireland (Dr Michael McBride) said: ""Although the very welcome news about vaccines means that we can look forward to 2021 with greater optimism, vaccine deployment will have only a marginal impact in reducing numbers coming into the health service with Covid over the next three months."" TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters The rapid lateral flow tests work by taking a nose and throat swab, shaking it in fluid until any viral particles come off, and then dropping the fluid onto a plastic stick. They take about half an hour to show a result. Some councils have raised concerns over their use, withGreater Manchester councils the latest to pause rapid testingfor care home visitors. Prof Jon Deeks, of Birmingham University, said lateral flow tests could not detect low levels of the virus and were being used in ways for which they were never intended. ""We can't see why the government is progressing with using this test when it is missing so many people,"" he told the BBC. ""They have been sold to people with the idea that if you are negative you will be able to go and visit people, you will be able to be clear that you haven't got Covid, and that is really dangerous."" Prof Calum Semple, from Liverpool University and a member of the government's Scientific Advisory group for Emergencies, defended their use, saying more than a thousand coronavirus ""transmission chains"" had been broken during the pilot scheme in the city.

"Tram lines in Edinburgh were engulfed by water Heavy rainfall has caused extensive flooding in parts of Scotland, with train and tram lines being engulfed by water. ScotRail services between Aberdeen and Inverness have been disrupted after a landslip near Huntly. Train services were also affected by flooding on the line at Livingston and at Hartwood in North Lanarkshire. Hartwood services have now resumed. Tram lines in Edinburgh were also swamped with water. Engineers were struggling to deal with floodwater affecting trams Edinburgh Trams said the flooding was near Edinburgh Airport and between the Gyle Centre and Edinburgh Gateway. It said: ""Our engineers are working around the clock to minimise the effects of the heavy rainfall to ensure we are able to commence full route reservices as soon as the flooding subsides. ""They continue to pump excess water, however with the nearby Gogar Burn and River Almond at or above capacity, this is having little impact."" Disruption after 'thundersnow' hits Scotland Tram customers can use their tickets on Lothian buses. Services from Inverness affected by the landslip will terminate and start back from Elgin and services from Aberdeen will terminate and start back from Huntly. Customers are advised to use valid tickets on Stagecoach East. ScotRail services between Aberdeen and Inverness have been suspended after the landslip near Huntly Flooding at Livingston and at Hartwood in North Lanarkshire affected rail services Network Rail used pumps to reduce the water levels near Hartwood A number of roads in Edinburgh were also closed due to flooding.

"The explosion happened at a house in Green Lane, Illingworth Three people have been taken to hospital following an explosion at a house in West Yorkshire. Onlookers said the home, in Green Lane, Illingworth, near Halifax, was ""completely destroyed"" in the blast, which sounded ""like a bomb went off"". A woman suffered severe burns and a man was seriously injured, West Yorkshire Police said. A second woman sustained minor injuries. The force said it was continuing to investigate the cause of the blast. Ch Supt Sarah Baker said officers were conducting inquiries alongside the fire service, local council, Health and Safety Executive and Northern Gas Networks. West Yorkshire Fire & Rescue said six nearby homes had been evacuated. Andy Sykes, who lives nearby, said: ""It's been completely destroyed. It's a real mess. ""The house is at the end of a row of three and and it just looks like it is completely gone. It's like a bomb has gone off."" This video can not be played Footage from the scene shows a large fire at the explosion site Candice Nevison described hearing a ""massive bang"". ""I saw people jumping out of the house, literally there was no front to the house,"" she said. ""I heard people saying get the old lady out who lives next door. They managed to get her out, I saw them carrying her over their shoulder. ""It was just like something out of a horror story.""

""Crews on the ground reported scenes of fire and extensive damage to the property,"" he said. ""We had reports that there were three adults in the property. Those adults got out of the property and they were being dealt with by Yorkshire Ambulance Service on the scene and then they were transported to hospital."" Firefighters were likely to be on the scene for some time and an investigation had been launched, he added. A fundraiser for those affected by the blast has been set up, with people offering to donate clothes and food to the family through local businesses and charities. Mr Sykes, who works at the Noah's Ark Centre, in nearby Ovenden, said the charity was helping to co-ordinate fundraising. ""We've had lots of people contacting us wanting to make donations,"" he said. ""I'm sure over the course of the next 24 hours the community will rally round and we will end up with a good bit of support.""

"One of the 13 prisoners deported from the UK to Jamaica on Wednesday has tested positive for Covid-19, the Jamaican government has told the BBC. The man is being held in isolation at a hospital in the capital, Kingston. The Home Office said he was on the flight, but has not made a statement in relation to the test. The flight has already attracted controversy, with critics warning that people might be wrongly removed, as in the Windrush scandal. Who are the Windrush generation? Call to review foreign-born offender deportations UK 'unlawfully ignored' Windrush warnings The plane, containing 13 convicted criminals, took off on Wednesday. Twenty-three other prisoners were left off it following legal challenges. The man, who did not want to be named on safety grounds, told the BBC he was tested for Covid-19 three days ago on arrival to Jamaica and on Friday received confirmation that he had coronavirus. He has been taken under police escort to the St Joseph's medical facility in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, where he will be held under quarantine for 14 days. The Home Office said all 13 men were offered tests on arrival, but could not confirm if the men had been tested before being deported from the UK last Wednesday. Ninety public figures, including model Naomi Campbell and actress Thandie Newton, signed an open letter last month calling on airlines not to carry out Wednesday's flight. Warning that issues linked to Windrush have ""not been resolved,"" they argued the planned deportation flight brought ""credible risks of unlawful and wrongful deportations"" and urged airlines to boycott it. The campaigners warned the UK ""frequently"" seeks to deport people whose crimes are linked to forced labour, and processes for identifying victims of trafficking were in ""disarray"". A separate letter last month signed by over 60 mostly Labour MPs and peers also called for the flight to be cancelled. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the references to Windrush were""deeply offensive"". She said she made no apologies for seeking to remove what Downing Street has termed ""dangerous foreign criminals"". Ms Patel previouslytold the Daily Mail,externalthat it was ""misjudged and upsetting"" for ""ill-informed Labour politicians and do-gooding celebrities"" to invoke Windrush in their campaign. The scandal - which came to light in 2018 - revealed that many people from Commonwealth countries, who had legally entered and settled in the UK, had been threatened with deportation and some had been  wrongly deported by the Home Office.

"Testing began on Saturday morning Mass coronavirus testing has started in one of the areas hardest-hit by Covid-19 in Wales in a bid to bring the virus under control. People living or working in the Lower Cynon Valley - which includes Abercynon, Penrhiwceiber and parts of Mountain Ash and Aberaman - will be offered tests. Test centres will run from Saturday until 20 December. It is the second place in Wales to have mass testing after Merthyr Tydfil. Residents in Mountain Ash East and West, and Aberaman South residents, are also eligible for the tests, which give results in 30 minutes. Dr Kelechi Nnoaham: ""People in the Lower Cynon Valley can play a major role in protecting everyone in our communities"" Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board public health director, Dr Kelechi Nnoaham, said: ""The rate of Covid-19 infection is still very high in our communities, and by engaging with this testing programme, people in the Lower Cynon Valley can play a major role in protecting everyone in our communities."" Covid-19: Merthyr sees 977 mass-tested for coronavirus NHS Wales front-line staff to get twice-weekly Covid tests Student Covid testing begins for Christmas exodus The main test centres are at Cynon Valley Indoor Bowls Centre, Mountain Ash and Abercynon Sports Centre. John Collins took his test at the bowls centre John Collins, 88, from Penrhiwceiber, who took a test at the bowls centre, said: ""At my age you have to try and avoid getting this virus."" The testing programme will use so-called lateral flow devices which can get results in about 20-30 minutes. If a person tests positive, they will be asked to return home so they can self-isolate immediately. Concerns have been raised by some expertsthat people who are declared negative could have a misplaced sense of reassurance. If someone tests negative, they should still follow the rules, and maintain social distancing, hand hygiene and mask wearing. Rhondda Cynon Taf council leader Andrew Morgan said about 27,000 people could be tested in the Lower Cynon Valley. ""Unfortunately, over the last week or so, we are seeing our cases starting to increase at quite a concerning rate,"" he told BBC Radio WalesBreakfast with Oliver Hides. Mass coronavirus testing will run until 20 December in the Lower Cynon Valley He said the area had seen 300 positive cases in the last two days so it was ""important"" to identify and isolate those who were asymptomatic within communities to break ""chains of transmission"". ""This is an integral part of our fight against the virus, as it gives us a greater understanding of the prevalence and level of transmission within our communities,"" he said. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: ""I would encourage the people of Lower Cynon Valley to get tested."" The Merthyr pilot for mass testing, which launched last month, will run until 11 December. The case rate in Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) is 368.5 per 100,000, reporting 889 new positive tests in the past week. The south Wales valleyshad been dominating for highest case ratesand having fallen back early in November, the rates have now started to move up again. In the most recent comparable week, Torfaen, Blaenau Gwent and Neath Port Talbot have been among the 10 highest case rate areas in the UK.

"One of the 13 prisoners deported from the UK to Jamaica on Wednesday has tested positive for Covid-19, the Jamaican government has told the BBC. The man is being held in isolation at a hospital in the capital, Kingston. The Home Office said he was on the flight, but has not made a statement in relation to the test. The flight has already attracted controversy, with critics warning that people might be wrongly removed, as in the Windrush scandal. Who are the Windrush generation? Call to review foreign-born offender deportations UK 'unlawfully ignored' Windrush warnings The plane, containing 13 convicted criminals, took off on Wednesday. Twenty-three other prisoners were left off it following legal challenges. The man, who did not want to be named on safety grounds, told the BBC he was tested for Covid-19 three days ago on arrival to Jamaica and on Friday received confirmation that he had coronavirus. He has been taken under police escort to the St Joseph's medical facility in the Jamaican capital, Kingston, where he will be held under quarantine for 14 days. The Home Office said all 13 men were offered tests on arrival, but could not confirm if the men had been tested before being deported from the UK last Wednesday. Ninety public figures, including model Naomi Campbell and actress Thandie Newton, signed an open letter last month calling on airlines not to carry out Wednesday's flight. Warning that issues linked to Windrush have ""not been resolved,"" they argued the planned deportation flight brought ""credible risks of unlawful and wrongful deportations"" and urged airlines to boycott it. The campaigners warned the UK ""frequently"" seeks to deport people whose crimes are linked to forced labour, and processes for identifying victims of trafficking were in ""disarray"". A separate letter last month signed by over 60 mostly Labour MPs and peers also called for the flight to be cancelled. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the references to Windrush were""deeply offensive"". She said she made no apologies for seeking to remove what Downing Street has termed ""dangerous foreign criminals"". Ms Patel previouslytold the Daily Mail,externalthat it was ""misjudged and upsetting"" for ""ill-informed Labour politicians and do-gooding celebrities"" to invoke Windrush in their campaign. The scandal - which came to light in 2018 - revealed that many people from Commonwealth countries, who had legally entered and settled in the UK, had been threatened with deportation and some had been  wrongly deported by the Home Office.

"Fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or on arrival. The prime minister has announced thathe intends to remove England's remaining Covid restrictions at the end of the month. Fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s no longer need to take a test either before or after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. To qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with""approved proof of vaccination"".,externalThis now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February. Will travel return to normal this summer? What Covid rules remain across the UK? Unvaccinated travellers still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before departure. They must also take a post-arrival PCR test two days after arrival. This must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately froma government-approved list of providers.,external If this is positive, they need toself-isolate. However, unvaccinated travellers no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. All unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete apassenger locator form,externalbefore departure. Digital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're inEngland,external,Scotland,external,Wales,externalorNorthern Ireland,external. Test results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish. European Union residents can use theEU Digital Covid Certificateto show their vaccination status or test results. Since 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England have also been able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass. Where do I need to use a Covid passport? You are responsible forchecking the entry requirements for any other countries you wish to visit,,externalas well as the local Covid restrictions which are in force. These can change quickly. Many UK familieshave cancelled half-term trips to mainland Spain and the Canary Islandsbecause children over 12 must be double vaccinated to enter. Very few countries allow unrestricted access to those who have not been vaccinated. It is thought more than 80 holiday destinations around the world still require all UK travellers to take a pre-departure PCR test before arrival. UK-issuedCovid passes can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination- either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated after than 1 November 2021).

"The Environment Agency was at the scene earlier The Environment Agency has forced its way on to a section of a river after reports it had been ""bulldozed"" in what the local wildlife trust described as a ""crime against the environment"". The protected stretch of the River Lugg had been ""completely obliterated"", Herefordshire Wildlife Trust said. It added the work would have ""huge repercussions for wildlife downstream"". The Environment Agency is leading an investigation into what it said was a ""series of unconsented works"". West Mercia Police, Natural England and the Forestry Commission are also involved. Bulldozers are said to have caused damage to the area, Herefordshire Wildlife Trust said Emma Johnson, from Natural England, said: ""I'm shocked by the destruction I've seen to this very special river."" The wildlife trust said all habitats had been badly affected after a one-mile stretch (1.5km) of the river and its banks were ""bulldozed, straightened and re-profiled into a sterile canal"". Wildlife affected is believed to include crayfish, otters, salmon, lampreys and dragonflies. Dave Throup, area manager for the Environment Agency, said it was ""treating this very seriously"" and had ""taken immediate action in an attempt to prevent any further works at the site"". The wildlife trust said it hoped for a prosecution after it claimed a 16-tonne bulldozer was used by people ""well aware"" the river was a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The River Lugg is a protected site ""The bank-side trees are all grubbed out and burnt, the river gravels have been scraped away, and the beautiful meanders of the river have been straightened and re-profiled,"" Chief Executive Helen Stace said. ""This is a crime against the environment. Swift action needs to be taken."" They are formal conservation areas, that often contain important habitats such as grasslands, parkland and woodland. Some contain ancient woodland and ancient trees. The areas have high conservation value and need to be protected. Natural England determine which sites should have SSSI status. England has more than 4,100 sites covering more than 4,200 square miles. Over half of this area is internationally important for wildlife. Source:Woodland Trust,external A legal notice requiring the works to stop immediately had been served to the landowner by Natural England, the Environment Agency said. Mr Throup added: ""This is a beautiful part of the world. To see the changes from last week to this is terrible. We're working closely with our partners to ensure this is thoroughly investigated.""
