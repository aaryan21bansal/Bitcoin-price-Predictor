"Sophie Moss's brother said she had been ""taken advantage of and exploited"" The sentence given to a man who choked a woman to death during sex is being reviewed by the Attorney General to decide if it was unduly lenient. Sam Pybus, 32, wasjailed for four yearsand eight months after admitting the manslaughter of Sophie Moss, 33, at her home in Darlington on 7 February. Campaigners said the ""outrageous"" sentence sent a ""dreadful message"". Referring the sentence for review, MP Harriet Harman said it ""fails to reflect the gravity of the crime"". A spokesperson for the Attorney General's Office said the review under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme would take place within 28 days and, if successful, the case would be referred to the Court of Appeal. Ms Harman said Pybus' ""disgraceful mitigation"" that Ms Moss, a mother of two young boys, encouraged strangulation during sex made it sound as if it was ""her fault"". ""[Pybus] sought to shift the responsibility for Sophie's death from himself to her claiming that she both encouraged and enjoyed his placing pressure on her neck,"" Ms Harman said. Pybus had drunk 24 bottles of lager before he visited Sophie Moss, Teesside Crown Court heard The MP said: ""The sentence fails to reflect the gravity of the crime, the impact of her death on her family, his sole culpability for her death, his cynical shifting of the responsibility from himself to her and sends out the message that killing your girlfriend during sex is a minor matter."" We Can't Consent To This, a campaign group set up in response to so-called ""consensual"" violence claims against women, also criticised the sentence. Spokeswoman Fiona Mackenzie said: ""It seems that strangling a woman to death is still viewed in law as an unfortunate accident, rather than terrible serious violence. ""This sends a dreadful message to women - four years and eight months is an outrageous sentence. The Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme allows anyone to lobby the Attorney General to send a case to the Court of Appeal for review. Very experienced senior judges then consider the term given to an offender and how it compares to any relevant guidelines on sentencing and previous similar crimes. Judge Paul Watson reduced Pybus' initial sentence of seven years because the law required him to give the killer a discount for his early admission that he was guilty of manslaughter - the crime of unintentionally causing Ms Moss' death. Pybus said he never intended to kill, leading to the Crown Prosecution Service ruling out a murder charge. But he could not avoid a manslaughter conviction by claiming it was ""rough sex gone wrong"". Some 28 years ago, the UK's then most senior judges declared that nobody can consent to serious harm as part of sado-masochistic sex -a ruling that was recently reasserted in the 2021 Domestic Abuse Act,external. Pybus, who was married, had been seeing Ms Moss for sex about six times a year for three years without his wife's knowledge,  Teesside Crown Court previously heard. On 6 February he had drunk 24 bottles of Amstel lager over 10 hours, and drove to Ms Moss's flat after his wife went to bed. At 04:43 GMT the following morning he drove to Darlington police station and told staff he believed he had strangled Ms Moss. He said that during sex he would apply pressure to her neck, ""an act he said she encouraged"", but added he would never hurt her. The claim she encouraged strangulation during sex was confirmed by her long-term partner, the court heard. Instead of giving Ms Moss first aid, Pybus went to his car and thought about what to do for 15 minutes before driving to the police station, the court was told. On Tuesday Judge Paul Watson QC said he accepted Pybus, of Water View, Middleton St George, Darlington, did not intend to kill and believed he had genuine remorse. In a victim statement Ms Moss's brother said she had been ""taken advantage of and exploited"". Follow BBC North East & Cumbria onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

"Elizabeth Holmes is charged with 12 counts of fraud Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes ""lied and cheated"" for money and fame, prosecutors alleged on the first day of the former Silicon Valley star's trial. Ms Holmes faces 12 fraud charges over her role at the now-defunct blood-testing firm which was once worth $9bn. She is accused of deceiving investors and patients by claiming Theranos could detect common illnesses using just a few drops of blood from a finger prick. Her lawyers said she was simply a naive businesswoman whose firm failed. ""Failure is not a crime. Trying your hardest and coming up short is not a crime,"" Lance Wade, a lawyer for the defence said in his opening statement on Wednesday. In what will be a closely watched trial in San Jose, California, Ms Holmes denies all the charges against her but could face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty. Former Theranos executive Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani - who was romantically involved with Ms Holmes for years - faces the same charges but will be tried separately next year. He has also pleaded not guilty. Ms Holmes, who founded Theranos in 2003 aged 19, was dubbed the world's youngest self-made female billionaire and the ""next Steve Jobs"" thanks to her technology. However, she fell from grace in 2015 when it emerged her blood-testing devices did not work and Theranos was doing most of its testing on commercially available machines made by other manufacturers. Elizabeth Holmes: The boss accused of duping Silicon Valley On Wednesday, prosecutor Robert Leach said Ms Holmes and Mr Balwani turned to fraud in 2009 after big pharmaceutical firms declined to back Theranos and they ran out of cash. They lied about the tests and exaggerated the firm's performance to secure millions of dollars of investment between 2010 and 2015. This included falsely claiming the tests had been vetted by the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and that the technology was being used by the US military in the field, Mr Leach said. Ms Holmes came into the court surrounded by her legal team. There's huge interest in the case here. Journalists had been queuing up since 5am to try and get into court. Many didn't get in. Eschewing the black turtleneck she had become famous for, Ms Holmes wore a grey suit and blue mask. In court, she sat bolt upright, poised, attentive, as she listened to the case against her. The prosecution didn't mince its words. The word ""lies"" was mentioned liberally. Ms Holmes watched on passively. The case will probably take months and at some point it's possible that Ms Holmes herself will take the stand. If she does it will be a huge risk for her defence. But with so much evidence that the tech she flaunted didn't work she may feel it's a risk worth taking. Ms Holmes also ""dazzled"" firms such as Walgreens, the pharmacy chain, into agreeing testing partnerships, despite being fully aware the tests were ""plagued by issues and repeatedly failing quality control"", he said. It brought her fame and adoration, Mr Leach added. ""She had become, as she sought, one of the most celebrated CEOs in Silicon Valley and the world. But under the facade of Theranos' success there were significant problems brewing."" Ms Holmes claims Mr Balwani controlled and abused her. He denies the claims However, the defence's Mr Wade said Ms Holmes did not intend to defraud, but instead ""naively underestimated"" the challenges her business faced. ""In the end, Theranos failed and Ms Holmes walked away with nothing,"" he told the jurors in San Jose. He added that the former executive was motivated by Theranos's mission, not money, and ""committed to that mission until that very last day"". ""By the time this trial is over, you will see that the villain the government just presented is actually a living, breathing human being who did her very best each and every day. And she is innocent."" According to court filings unsealed last month, Ms Holmes has alleged Mr Balwani abused her emotionally and psychologically for years. Mr Balwani has denied the allegations. Her lawyers have said she is ""highly likely"" to take the witness stand and testify about how the relationship affected her mental state. As boss of Theranos Ms Holmes is alleged to have duped a host of powerful people who invested around $700m in the company. Henry Kissinger and four star general James Mattis sat on the company's board while Rupert Murdoch invested Â£120m. Her story has become the subject of documentaries, podcasts and books. A TV miniseries and a Hollywood film based her life are in the works. The defence and prosecution have identified more than 140 potential witnesses in the case, including investors and former Theranos employees.

"The small bowl was found on a chest of drawers during a house clearance A porcelain bowl thought to have been worth just Â£500 has sold at auction for Â£320,000 after it turned out to be a rare Chinese relic. The 900-year-old bowl was owned by a Lincolnshire couple and was among items being sold after their deaths. The 5in (13cm) tall item is thought to be previously undocumented Ru ware, prompting a flurry of bidders. Jessica Wall, from Stamford Auction Rooms, said it was ""totally unexpected"". The rare bowl sat on a chest of drawers at the home of the late couple, who were seemingly unaware of its true worth. It was initially expected to fetch between Â£500 and Â£800 with Chinese ware being notoriously tricky to value, Ms Wall said. Auctioneer Jessica Wall said it was a ""dream"" to be surprised by an item selling for so much money ""There was no indication it would fly in the way that it did,"" Ms Wall added, with the item finally fetching Â£320,000, before fees. It is thought to have been made during China's Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD) with only a small number of similar pieces being in private hands. The bowls are known for being undecorated with a bluish or greenish-grey glaze, with a fine network of cracks. More stories from across Lincolnshire Recounting the moment the hammer came down on the auction two weeks ago, Ms Wall said: ""It was quite a moment. ""When it got to about Â£10,000, I thought it was interesting and a good result but that it would stop there. It kept going and I started to get butterflies."" The family of the deceased are said to be ""blown away"" by the sale, the auction house said. The eventual buyer, who travelled from London to Stamford for the auction, has chosen to remain anonymous. ""It's extremely rare for such a big surprise like this, but it's every auctioneer's dream,"" Ms Wall added. A similar piece sold at auction in 2017 for $38m.

"Anne says she is not yet anywhere near the standard of her son at playing Fortnite The mum of one of the world's best professional Fortnite players has signed a contract with a gaming organisation to develop her own career. Anne Fish, 58, has managed her son Benjy ""Benjyfishy"" Fish, since he went professional three years ago. The British gamer says she began playing the game in February to improve her understanding. She quickly amassed a large following online and has now signed a paid contract with an esports firm. ""I never thought in a million years that I would ever be playing Fortnite or streaming online or ever be in a position to be able to be signed by an organisation, so it's really exciting,"" she said. Anne streams her games on Twitch to her 430,000 followers and puts out videos of her matches to her growing YouTube fanbase of 165,000. Anne has her own set-up in the room next door to her son's gaming room ""Next step is a million,"" she says, speaking from the same room in which she streams to her fans, with her collection of owls, stuffed toys and teddy bears on display, next to her shiny 100,000 YouTube subscribers award. Anne, who lives in Sunbury-on-Thames, will now be paid per month by esports and gaming influencer organisation Galaxy Racer. Details weren't given about the contract, but Anne will now be paid for videos of herself playing and talking to fans on various social networks. Anne says she hadn't picked up a controller since playing her on her eldest son's Nintendo 64 about 15 years ago before she tried Fortnite. ""I was really bad at first. I just sort of camped and hid from other players in case I got killed. ""Slowly, you know, I started to get better. My reflexes aren't as good as young players, so I have to be more strategic. I thought it'd be really cool to see if I could get to champions division as a solo, which I did. ""I've been doing various competitions but not yet won any cash cups and I've got a long way to go, but I'm trying."" Galaxy Racer CEO, Paul Roy, explained why the company has signed her: ""We are thrilled to announce mamabenjyfishy as the newest addition to Galaxy Racer's content creator team. ""Having proved her Fortnite skills at our recent tournament, The Aubameyang Cup, her years of experience in the industry, including managing Benjyfishy, and a shared passion for nurturing greater inclusivity within gaming and esports, we are proud to welcome Anne into the Galaxy Racer family."" Anne's son Benjy says ""it's pretty mad"" that his mum is now a signed gamer. ""Yeah I mean it's pretty weird because obviously back in the day I always wanted to be a gamer, and the fact that my mum is now like technically a pro game streamer is pretty sick. ""I never would have thought this could happen three years ago. If you had told me that I wouldn't believe it - it's pretty mad."" Anne began gaming to find out what Fortnite was all about but quickly amassed followers Benjyfishy is ranked as one of the top 10 players in the world by multiple websites and was one of a handful of British players to make it to the Fortnite World Cup in New York in 2019. He says he's given his mum a few tips but that he mainly ""lets her get on with it"" in the room next door to where he plays in high-level tournaments for thousands of pounds in prize money. Anne said she dreams of being good enough to challenge her son in the battle arena but says it would be a mountain to climb. ""It would be super good if I could compete against him at a World Cup or something, but there is such a skill gap between the likes of Benjy and myself that I don't think I could ever quite make it to that level. But I'll try!"" Epic v Apple: What have we learned? Ariana Grande sings in Fortnite's metaverse.

"Online shopping giant Amazon has said it is ""proud"" of its contribution to the UK economy, as it reveals its latest financial results. The firm paid Â£492m in direct taxation as its sales rose 50% to Â£20.63bn, amid a Covid-driven surge in demand. Amazon and other tech firms, which pay tax on profits not sales, have faced scrutiny over the level of their tax bills in the UK. But Amazon said it had invested Â£32bn in UK infrastructure since 2010. ""We are proud of the significant economic contribution we are making to the UK economy,"" Amazonsaid in a statement.,external ""Looking ahead, we know that the UK remains full of opportunity and we continue to be excited by the potential to continue to invest, create jobs, develop talent and have a positive impact in communities across the country,"" the statement added. Amazon's total sales in the UK, rose to Â£20.63bn during 2020 - up by more than 50% from Â£13.73bn in 2019. The direct tax bill was up by more than two-thirds compared with the Â£293m it paid in the previous year. The firm, which employs 55,000 people in the UK, said the taxes included business rates, stamp duty, corporation tax and other contributions. Amazon to recruit 55,000 staff for expansion drive WhatsApp issued second-largest GDPR fine Amazon said employers' national insurance taxes accounted for the majority of the bill as it took on 22,000 more staff over the course of the last year. The company's indirect tax bill came to Â£1.06bn, up from Â£854m, driven by VAT on increased sales and employee taxes, as it took on more people and increased wages. Amazon said that when both direct and indirect taxation were taken into account, it had contributed Â£1.55bn, up from Â£1.15bn. GMB, the union for Amazon workers, said the company's tax bill was ""frankly insulting"" and said firms that had profited from the pandemic should pay more. Mick Rix, GMB National Officer, said:""Amazon workers suffer unsafe, dehumanising work practices; breaking bones, falling unconscious and being taken away in ambulances. ""Ministers must get a grip of this runaway company and make sure pandemic profiteers pay more. ""Amazon's key UK business paid just Â£3.8m more corporation tax last year than in 2019, even as sales increased by Â£1.89bn."" In April last year, the UK government launched a 2% tax on digital sales amid concerns that big tech firms were re-routing their profits through low tax jurisdictions. The Digital Services Tax is also included in the Â£492m figure. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said in June last year that the coronavirus crisis had made tech giants even ""more powerful and more profitable"". Other global tech firms have facedsimilar scrutiny,externalover their tax bills. French tax authorities recently settled disputes with Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon over their operations in the country over the last decade. Last year, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said he recognised the public's frustration over the amount of tax paid by tech firms and backed plans by think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to find a global solution. ""As usual the accounts are legally compliant but opaque and lack the crucial information about intra-group transactions which enable the company to shift profits is not there,"" said Labour peer and emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Sheffield and University of Essex, Prem Sikka. ""Therefore it's impossible to know what their true economic profit is,"" Prof Sikka said. Given the profits declared by competitors, Prof Sikka said Amazon's tax bill ""seems very low"", whereas, for retailers such as supermarket chains, tax bills as a proportion of sales were much higher. ""We need a complete change in accounting regulations which currently increase opacity rather than transparency,"" Prof Sikka added. Professor of taxation law at King's College London, Ann Mumford agreed and said that there was a lack of public discussion around the rules which led to this amount of tax. ""It seems that Amazon realised that they would need to pay a respectable amount - and, are hoping that an increase of Â£3.8 million sounds like a lot of money,"" Prof Mumford added. The pandemic has accelerated the shift towards online shopping and Amazon has been one of the biggest winners amid those changing consumer trends. As Covid closed physical stores during successive lockdowns, sales at the internet giant rocketed. Today's numbers will raise further questions about how tech giants operate, the level of tax they pay and their impact on the struggling High Street. Amazon moved to fend off criticism by pointing out that its direct tax bill increased by more than two-thirds from the Â£293m it paid in 2019. Critics say that's still nowhere near enough given the surge in sales. The firm's been on a hiring spree to meet soaring demand, offering a Â£1,000 joining bonus to encourage staff to work in its fulfilment centres in the north east of England.

"MPs vote by 319 to 248 to raise taxes to fund the NHS and social care There will be a new 1.25% tax on workers and employers to fund health and social care This breaks a Tory manifesto commitment not to increase taxes National Insurance will increase from April 2022, with a separate tax introduced in 2023 It has been criticised by some Conservative backbenchers and opposition parties The amount individuals have to spend on their care will be capped at Â£86,000 - not including accommodation costs Labour says the change ""hammers"" working people, leave people still facing losing their homes to pay for care, and it may not clear NHS backlogs Edited by Rob Corp We've reached the end of the debating, and the subsequent passing of the health and social care levy in the House of Commons, so our live coverage will stop here. Thanks for joining us on what's been a busy day withnews of the tax riseand anoverhaul of the coronavirus foreign travel traffic light system. Your updates were written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans, Mary O'Connor, Justin Parkinson, Kate Whannel and Sinead Wilson. The page was edited by Martha Buckley and Rob Corp. Have a good evening and we will be back with more live updates tomorrow. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on need to address NHS wait times In an interview with the BBC, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted the government must make ""the investment now"" with the health and social care levy if NHS treatment backlogs are to be cleared. He tells the BBC's Health Editor Hugh Pym, that around 9 million NHS treatments could be funded by proposed government investment, but did not give details of targets. The new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and a social care reform is through. The Tories say it will bring an investment of Â£36bn in the health and care system over the next three years. This, according to chief secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay, will pay for the social care system to be reformed ""ending unpredictable and catastrophic care costs faced by thousands and making the system fairer for all"". The new tax means people will no longer pay more than Â£86,000 in care costs - not including food and accommodation - over their lifetime, from October 2023. Labour were against the plan with leader Sir Keir Starmer saying it wasunfair on working people. He says: ""Under his plan, a landlord renting out dozens of properties won't pay a penny more, while their tenants in work will face tax rises of hundreds of pounds a year."" The SNP also opposed the move, with its Westminster leader Ian Blackford calling it a ""regressive tax"" on millions of Scottish workers without consultation. And Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey - who is also a carer for his disabled son - said the plan ""forgot family carers"" who just want ""a fair deal"". We've got the key changeshereand you can work out how it will affect youhere. MPs have voted for an extra tax to fund social care in England - and help the NHS recover after the pandemic. There had been criticism - including from within the Conservative Party - that it will be unfair on younger people and the lower paid. Under the proposals, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April 2022. From April 2023, National Insurance will return to its current rate, and the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. This levy - unlike National Insurance - will also be paid by state pensioners who are still working. National Insurance is a UK-wide tax - and while Boris Johnson's announcement focuses on funding health and social care in England - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional Â£2.2bn to spend on their services. You can read morehere. MPs back the government's plan to raise taxes to fund spending on the NHS and social care. It gets through by 319 votes to 248 - that's a margin of 71. MPs have voted against a Labour amendment calling for an assessment of the plan to bring in a new 1.25% tax for the NHS and social care. They will now go to a vote on the substantive measure. If it goes through National Insurance will increase from April 2022, with a separate tax introduced in 2023 We will bring you the result as soon as we have it. While we wait why not read up on what it could mean:Whatâs the new Health and Social Care tax and how will it affect me? The debate is over after nearly five hours and MPs have gone to vote on a Labour amendment to the government's plan to bring in a new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and social care. Labour want the government to carry out an assessment on what the impact of the tax will be on jobs. We will bring you the result as soon as we have it. Steve Barclay, chief secretary to the Treasury, has been summing up the government's case for introducing a new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and to reform social care. ""The pandemic has put unprecedented pressure on the NHS with the number of people waiting for surgery or treatment in England is now at a record high of 5.5 million and if left unchecked this could rise to 13 million,"" he says. He says at the same time the country is facing a long-standing challenge to the social care system. ""Typically around one in seven must pay over Â£100,000 for care, with bills falling indiscriminately on some of the sickest and most vulnerable in society,"" he says. The government's plan would mean an investment of Â£36bn in the health and care system over the next three years, he says. ""The social care system will finally be reformed ending unpredictable and catastrophic care costs faced by thousands and making the system fairer for all,"" he says. Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson is summing up now. She says while it's been a good debate, what's been most striking is how ""inadequate a basis it has been for a change of this magnitude to the tax system of our country"". There have been a number of ""sharp and insightful"" contributions from Labour MPs, including the point that the measures would not improve the lot of care workers, who were now facing a tax rise, she says. Phillipson cites the views of other MPs that the proposals do not represent a proper plan for the NHS or for social care. ""It is instead a broken promise, two-and-a-half million working households hit by the Tory double whammy of cuts to Universal Credit and an increase in National Insurance,"" she adds. Phillipson reiterates the point that it is ""ludicrous"" that landlords will not have to ""pay a penny"" more under the new tax, but that tenants, many who might be working in the NHS, ""are about to be clobbered by a tax rise"" - adding that about 95% of the revenue will come from taxing workers' wages. She criticises the lack of notice given to MPs to approve the government's plans, saying it lacks the scrutiny needed for plans that have such ""universal"" impact. Phillipson says as well as a ""strong and skilled social care workforce"", Labour would deliver a ""new deal"" for care workers to create a ""well motivated and properly rewarded workforce"" that would give support to unpaid carers. Tory MP Jack Brereton says he has been contacted by hundreds of constituents about the need for more investment in social care and the challenges they face of accessing healthcare and medical treatment. ""No decision to invest more to the scale required is going to be easy - and money must come from somewhere. ""I think what we've arrived at is probably the least worst option. ""The approach taken will ensure this burden is spread as broadly as possible, so all those with earned income streams must contribute and protections are in place to protect those on lowest incomes."" Veteran Conservative MP Peter Bone says the government was ""creating a new tax...without having the detail."" He says: ""Whilst I support the idea of more money for the NHS - and I have no objection to it being done through National Insurance - I absolutely object to saying that this has got anything to do with the care bill because that hasn't been introduced. ""Social care should be paid for separately. There should have been a social care bill, we should have had the bill, we should have been able to debate the principle of that and then immediately afterwards voted on the ways and means but we've got this mixed up."" Conservative MP Huw Merriman reiterates the need to ""act now"" to reform health and social care in England and welcomes the ""decisive action"" being taken by the government. However he says he has concerns around the new tax - with the first being the political difficulty of getting the money initially being funnelled into the NHS into social care. He tells the Commons: ""We know how difficult it is to convince people that a temporary lift to Universal Credit was just temporary, how on earth are we going to challenge the equivalence of Marcus Rashford when it comes to the NHS in persuading people that this wasn't a cut but just a plan for a period of time and then we move the money to social care?"" He also cites the ""inter-generational unfairness"" of expecting young people without a home of their own to fund social care through a hike in National Insurance, rather than the older people with nest eggs or their own homes who would be using the service sooner. Thirdly, he says the Tories will have to look to ""rein in"" public spending and allocate money for the NHS with ""strict criteria"" on how it is going to be spent. Merriman indicates he will support the government in the vote but wants them to look at some of the alternative measures he's suggested. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The emergency of the pandemic, which demanded spending and borrowing that busted all norms, has faded. But the prime minister's fondness for splurging billions when he sees fit has not. The last 24 hours have sealed Boris Johnson's existing reputation: a Conservative who says he'd love low taxes, but when there's spending that he perceives is popular, that affection swiftly disappears. Read Laura's blog in full Tory MP Ben Everitt says he's going to try to be optimistic and pull out the good things in the hard choices the government faces. He says there are never any good options for raising taxes but ""raising taxes on having a job is possibly the thing that should be at the bottom of the list when we look at new areas of income"". He says: ""The Â£86,000 cap needs to be met and tweaked with a regional house price element to recognise that houses are worth more in one area of the country than others."" ""I will vote for this. Our job in this place is to make good laws and we need to do that at every stage and this is a tricky problem."" MPs have been debating a new 1.25% tax - initially through National Insurance - to pay for health and social care for about three and a half hours. Here are some of the main points that have been made:  MPs are expected to vote around 19:00 BST and we will bring you the result as soon as we have it. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says the government's plan for social care fails Labour's two tests - that it will fix the problems in the sector and is being funded in a fair way. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, she says Labour would ask those with the ""broadest shoulders"" to contribute more ""and not just go to those who go out to work and earn a wage"". Asked what taxes Labour would raise in their plan to fix social care, she said the party would set out those details in ""due course"" but that the party would seek to tax ""all forms of income"", not just those who work. Challenged on why ex-Labour PMGordon Brown used National Insurance to increase NHS funding back in 2002, she insists there were ""very different economic circumstances"" back then. She adds that while Brown had ""come forward with a plan"" to cut waiting times and get health spending up to the European average - today's Tory government lacked any ""clear plan"" in its proposals. ""The government can't even say when the backlog of operations will be clear, they can't even say when the money will go into our social care system, and they can't even meet the test that no one will have to sell their home to pay for social care,"" she says. Jim Shannon of the Democratic Unionist Party asks for guarantees that the money Northern Ireland will receive from the tax will be used only to help reform health and social care and not for anything else. Reading from a document, he says Northern Ireland is due to get around Â£420m a year from the new tax, but ""there is no indication that the Northern Ireland executive will be required to spend it on the purpose for which it was raised, since the government, it appears, cannot ring-fence the money"". He asks if Northern Ireland's share can be ring-fenced for health and social care and whether this will apply to all future monies sent there. ""What guarantees do we have that every single employed person, every single pensioner, every single business owner, that their sacrifice will bring about necessary change, and not be lost in the ether of politics at Stormont?"" Conservative Dr Andrew Murrison says this could be a historic moment in which we sort out the problems in health and social care and he will be voting ""enthusiastically"" with the government later. And using National Insurance to raise the extra funds is progressive, he adds. But the challenge for ministers is to turn the money going to providers in to better outcomes for patients, he adds. Improving productivity in the NHS has to be a priority and sickness levels need to be driven down, he argues.  Anna George's 91-year-old mother has been in a British Legion Care Home since October 2019, where she lives in a dementia unit. She says her mother's home was sold to pay the Â£4778.43 cost of her care over a 31-day month. But the family are worried as there is only enough money left to fund 10 more months of care. Anna, 68, who lives in Northamptonshire, says: âWhen we get down to the final Â£23,000 we inform social services and we then pay a percentage to contribute to the continued care. I donât know how much. âItâs pretty scary for us because itâs not that far away now for us now."" She welcomes the new tax, but argues it has come ""too late"" for her family. âMy parents worked hard to own their home and to have something to give their children but their hopes are dashed now. âI know people think this tax is unfair on younger, working people but weâre losing our inheritance. Hopefully, with this new system that wonât happen for the younger generation when they reach the stage in life of needing social care."" Reality Check At prime ministerâs questions, Boris Johnson was asked by
the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, whether his previous guarantee that âno one who needs care has to sell their home to
pay for itâ still stood. Mr Johnson did not confirm whether it did. The pledge was
in the Conservativesâ 2019 manifesto. When the Health Secretary, Sajid Javid, was asked about on
the BBCâs Today programme he said: ""We will also make sure that everyone
is able to access what's called the deferred payment agreement... which means
no one will ever have to sell their housein their life time."" Weâve looked at the pledge, how the language has changed
and whether it can be met under the new plans. You can read what we foundhere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,3.019981e-09
"Sophie Moss's brother said she had been ""taken advantage of and exploited"" The sentence given to a man who choked a woman to death during sex is being reviewed by the Attorney General to decide if it was unduly lenient. Sam Pybus, 32, wasjailed for four yearsand eight months after admitting the manslaughter of Sophie Moss, 33, at her home in Darlington on 7 February. Campaigners said the ""outrageous"" sentence sent a ""dreadful message"". Referring the sentence for review, MP Harriet Harman said it ""fails to reflect the gravity of the crime"". A spokesperson for the Attorney General's Office said the review under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme would take place within 28 days and, if successful, the case would be referred to the Court of Appeal. Ms Harman said Pybus' ""disgraceful mitigation"" that Ms Moss, a mother of two young boys, encouraged strangulation during sex made it sound as if it was ""her fault"". ""[Pybus] sought to shift the responsibility for Sophie's death from himself to her claiming that she both encouraged and enjoyed his placing pressure on her neck,"" Ms Harman said. Pybus had drunk 24 bottles of lager before he visited Sophie Moss, Teesside Crown Court heard The MP said: ""The sentence fails to reflect the gravity of the crime, the impact of her death on her family, his sole culpability for her death, his cynical shifting of the responsibility from himself to her and sends out the message that killing your girlfriend during sex is a minor matter."" We Can't Consent To This, a campaign group set up in response to so-called ""consensual"" violence claims against women, also criticised the sentence. Spokeswoman Fiona Mackenzie said: ""It seems that strangling a woman to death is still viewed in law as an unfortunate accident, rather than terrible serious violence. ""This sends a dreadful message to women - four years and eight months is an outrageous sentence. The Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme allows anyone to lobby the Attorney General to send a case to the Court of Appeal for review. Very experienced senior judges then consider the term given to an offender and how it compares to any relevant guidelines on sentencing and previous similar crimes. Judge Paul Watson reduced Pybus' initial sentence of seven years because the law required him to give the killer a discount for his early admission that he was guilty of manslaughter - the crime of unintentionally causing Ms Moss' death. Pybus said he never intended to kill, leading to the Crown Prosecution Service ruling out a murder charge. But he could not avoid a manslaughter conviction by claiming it was ""rough sex gone wrong"". Some 28 years ago, the UK's then most senior judges declared that nobody can consent to serious harm as part of sado-masochistic sex -a ruling that was recently reasserted in the 2021 Domestic Abuse Act,external. Pybus, who was married, had been seeing Ms Moss for sex about six times a year for three years without his wife's knowledge,  Teesside Crown Court previously heard. On 6 February he had drunk 24 bottles of Amstel lager over 10 hours, and drove to Ms Moss's flat after his wife went to bed. At 04:43 GMT the following morning he drove to Darlington police station and told staff he believed he had strangled Ms Moss. He said that during sex he would apply pressure to her neck, ""an act he said she encouraged"", but added he would never hurt her. The claim she encouraged strangulation during sex was confirmed by her long-term partner, the court heard. Instead of giving Ms Moss first aid, Pybus went to his car and thought about what to do for 15 minutes before driving to the police station, the court was told. On Tuesday Judge Paul Watson QC said he accepted Pybus, of Water View, Middleton St George, Darlington, did not intend to kill and believed he had genuine remorse.

"MPs vote by 319 to 248 to raise taxes to fund the NHS and social care There will be a new 1.25% tax on workers and employers to fund health and social care This breaks a Tory manifesto commitment not to increase taxes National Insurance will increase from April 2022, with a separate tax introduced in 2023 It has been criticised by some Conservative backbenchers and opposition parties The amount individuals have to spend on their care will be capped at Â£86,000 - not including accommodation costs Labour says the change ""hammers"" working people, leave people still facing losing their homes to pay for care, and it may not clear NHS backlogs Edited by Rob Corp We've reached the end of the debating, and the subsequent passing of the health and social care levy in the House of Commons, so our live coverage will stop here. Thanks for joining us on what's been a busy day withnews of the tax riseand anoverhaul of the coronavirus foreign travel traffic light system. Your updates were written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans, Mary O'Connor, Justin Parkinson, Kate Whannel and Sinead Wilson. The page was edited by Martha Buckley and Rob Corp. Have a good evening and we will be back with more live updates tomorrow. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on need to address NHS wait times In an interview with the BBC, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted the government must make ""the investment now"" with the health and social care levy if NHS treatment backlogs are to be cleared. He tells the BBC's Health Editor Hugh Pym, that around 9 million NHS treatments could be funded by proposed government investment, but did not give details of targets. The new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and a social care reform is through. The Tories say it will bring an investment of Â£36bn in the health and care system over the next three years. This, according to chief secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay, will pay for the social care system to be reformed ""ending unpredictable and catastrophic care costs faced by thousands and making the system fairer for all"". The new tax means people will no longer pay more than Â£86,000 in care costs - not including food and accommodation - over their lifetime, from October 2023. Labour were against the plan with leader Sir Keir Starmer saying it wasunfair on working people. He says: ""Under his plan, a landlord renting out dozens of properties won't pay a penny more, while their tenants in work will face tax rises of hundreds of pounds a year."" The SNP also opposed the move, with its Westminster leader Ian Blackford calling it a ""regressive tax"" on millions of Scottish workers without consultation. And Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey - who is also a carer for his disabled son - said the plan ""forgot family carers"" who just want ""a fair deal"". We've got the key changeshereand you can work out how it will affect youhere. MPs have voted for an extra tax to fund social care in England - and help the NHS recover after the pandemic. There had been criticism - including from within the Conservative Party - that it will be unfair on younger people and the lower paid. Under the proposals, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April 2022. From April 2023, National Insurance will return to its current rate, and the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. This levy - unlike National Insurance - will also be paid by state pensioners who are still working. National Insurance is a UK-wide tax - and while Boris Johnson's announcement focuses on funding health and social care in England - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional Â£2.2bn to spend on their services. You can read morehere. MPs back the government's plan to raise taxes to fund spending on the NHS and social care. It gets through by 319 votes to 248 - that's a margin of 71. MPs have voted against a Labour amendment calling for an assessment of the plan to bring in a new 1.25% tax for the NHS and social care. They will now go to a vote on the substantive measure. If it goes through National Insurance will increase from April 2022, with a separate tax introduced in 2023 We will bring you the result as soon as we have it. While we wait why not read up on what it could mean:Whatâs the new Health and Social Care tax and how will it affect me? The debate is over after nearly five hours and MPs have gone to vote on a Labour amendment to the government's plan to bring in a new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and social care. Labour want the government to carry out an assessment on what the impact of the tax will be on jobs. We will bring you the result as soon as we have it. Steve Barclay, chief secretary to the Treasury, has been summing up the government's case for introducing a new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and to reform social care. ""The pandemic has put unprecedented pressure on the NHS with the number of people waiting for surgery or treatment in England is now at a record high of 5.5 million and if left unchecked this could rise to 13 million,"" he says. He says at the same time the country is facing a long-standing challenge to the social care system. ""Typically around one in seven must pay over Â£100,000 for care, with bills falling indiscriminately on some of the sickest and most vulnerable in society,"" he says. The government's plan would mean an investment of Â£36bn in the health and care system over the next three years, he says. ""The social care system will finally be reformed ending unpredictable and catastrophic care costs faced by thousands and making the system fairer for all,"" he says. Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson is summing up now. She says while it's been a good debate, what's been most striking is how ""inadequate a basis it has been for a change of this magnitude to the tax system of our country"". There have been a number of ""sharp and insightful"" contributions from Labour MPs, including the point that the measures would not improve the lot of care workers, who were now facing a tax rise, she says. Phillipson cites the views of other MPs that the proposals do not represent a proper plan for the NHS or for social care. ""It is instead a broken promise, two-and-a-half million working households hit by the Tory double whammy of cuts to Universal Credit and an increase in National Insurance,"" she adds. Phillipson reiterates the point that it is ""ludicrous"" that landlords will not have to ""pay a penny"" more under the new tax, but that tenants, many who might be working in the NHS, ""are about to be clobbered by a tax rise"" - adding that about 95% of the revenue will come from taxing workers' wages. She criticises the lack of notice given to MPs to approve the government's plans, saying it lacks the scrutiny needed for plans that have such ""universal"" impact. Phillipson says as well as a ""strong and skilled social care workforce"", Labour would deliver a ""new deal"" for care workers to create a ""well motivated and properly rewarded workforce"" that would give support to unpaid carers. Tory MP Jack Brereton says he has been contacted by hundreds of constituents about the need for more investment in social care and the challenges they face of accessing healthcare and medical treatment. ""No decision to invest more to the scale required is going to be easy - and money must come from somewhere. ""I think what we've arrived at is probably the least worst option.

MPs have been debating a new 1.25% tax - initially through National Insurance - to pay for health and social care for about three and a half hours.

"A cap on the amount people in England pay for social care is to be postponed by two years. Councils had warned adult care services could worsen if the rollout was not delayed. The cap on care costs was due to be introduced in October 2023. The delay was announced in Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's Autumn Statement. It means some people will continue to pay more than Â£86,000 for lifelong care needs. Following concern overchallenges including staffing and financial pressures, the government said an extra Â£2.8bn would be available for adult social care next year and Â£4.7bn the following year. This includes delaying the cap on social care costs, allowing councils to increase council tax by up to 5% and Â£1bn of extra funding next year, followed by Â£1.7bn the next year. Money for schools, care and NHS - but is it enough? Health Secretary Stephen Barclay said 200,000 more care packages would be delivered with this funding. Sir Andrew Dilnot, who helped to devise the care cap plan, said the delay was ""extraordinarily disappointing"". He said Mr Hunt had broken the government's2019 manifesto commitment,externalto fix social care. However, the National Care Forum - which represents not-for-profit health and social care providers - said funding increases were welcome, but ""much more is needed to put the sector on a sustainable long-term footing"". People would no longer pay more than Â£86,000 towards their care during their lifetime. The Â£86,000 limit, or cap, would only cover personal care, such as help washing or dressing. It would not cover living costs such as food, energy bills or accommodation After people reach the Â£86,000 cap, personal care would be paid for by local authorities People with assets under Â£20,000 wouldn't have to contribute to care costs (compared with Â£14,250 now). However, they might have to contribute from their income. Assets are things you own - like a house or savings Those with between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 would get help towards costs from their local council. This would be means-tested - so, it depends on things like income and property MPs back change to social care funding in England What are the challenges facing social care? Critics warned that people with fewer savings might end up using a bigger proportion of their own assets than better-off people. For example, after reaching the Â£86,000 cap, someone with a Â£100,000 house would be left with Â£20,000 - 20% of the value. (The first Â£20,000 of someone's assets is protected under the proposals). However, someone with a Â£500,000 house would be left with Â£414,000 after reaching the cap - leaving them about 83% of the value. Also under the proposals: Means-tested help that people get from their local councilwould not count towards the Â£86,000 cap,external Only money from someone's own income or savings would count So, if someone's care costs Â£860 a week and they were meeting the cost themselves, it would take 100 weeks to hit the cap. However, if the same person received council help it would take longer than 100 weeks. That means poorer people receiving means-tested help would make contributions from their own money for longer. The cap wouldn't cover living costs, like rent, food and utility bills. The guidance says people would have to meet these themselves - ""including after they reach the cap"".

"A cap on the amount people in England pay for social care is to be postponed by two years. Councils had warned adult care services could worsen if the rollout was not delayed. The cap on care costs was due to be introduced in October 2023. The delay was announced in Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's Autumn Statement. It means some people will continue to pay more than Â£86,000 for lifelong care needs. Following concern overchallenges including staffing and financial pressures, the government said an extra Â£2.8bn would be available for adult social care next year and Â£4.7bn the following year. This includes delaying the cap on social care costs, allowing councils to increase council tax by up to 5% and Â£1bn of extra funding next year, followed by Â£1.7bn the next year. Money for schools, care and NHS - but is it enough? Health Secretary Stephen Barclay said 200,000 more care packages would be delivered with this funding. Sir Andrew Dilnot, who helped to devise the care cap plan, said the delay was ""extraordinarily disappointing"". He said Mr Hunt had broken the government's2019 manifesto commitment,externalto fix social care. However, the National Care Forum - which represents not-for-profit health and social care providers - said funding increases were welcome, but ""much more is needed to put the sector on a sustainable long-term footing"". People would no longer pay more than Â£86,000 towards their care during their lifetime. The Â£86,000 limit, or cap, would only cover personal care, such as help washing or dressing. It would not cover living costs such as food, energy bills or accommodation After people reach the Â£86,000 cap, personal care would be paid for by local authorities People with assets under Â£20,000 wouldn't have to contribute to care costs (compared with Â£14,250 now). However, they might have to contribute from their income. Assets are things you own - like a house or savings Those with between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 would get help towards costs from their local council. This would be means-tested - so, it depends on things like income and property MPs back change to social care funding in England What are the challenges facing social care? Critics warned that people with fewer savings might end up using a bigger proportion of their own assets than better-off people. For example, after reaching the Â£86,000 cap, someone with a Â£100,000 house would be left with Â£20,000 - 20% of the value. (The first Â£20,000 of someone's assets is protected under the proposals). However, someone with a Â£500,000 house would be left with Â£414,000 after reaching the cap - leaving them about 83% of the value. Also under the proposals: Means-tested help that people get from their local councilwould not count towards the Â£86,000 cap,external Only money from someone's own income or savings would count So, if someone's care costs Â£860 a week and they were meeting the cost themselves, it would take 100 weeks to hit the cap. However, if the same person received council help it would take longer than 100 weeks. That means poorer people receiving means-tested help would make contributions from their own money for longer. The cap wouldn't cover living costs, like rent, food and utility bills. The guidance says people would have to meet these themselves - ""including after they reach the cap"".

"MPs have voted 319 to 248 for a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance for workers and employers to help fund health and social care. Boris Johnson hopes the tax increase, which breaks a Conservative manifesto pledge, will raise Â£12bn a year. The prime minister said his plan would deal with ""catastrophic costs"" faced by those who need care. But Labour raised concerns that people could still have to sell their home in order to pay for the help they need. During a House of Commons debate, some Conservative MPs also raised objections to the proposals. Former minister Steve Baker called on his party to ""rediscover what it stands for"" rather than ""every time there is a squeeze on the public finances, coming back for higher taxes"". Opposition MPs voted against the rise but the government, which has a majority of more than 80, comfortably won the vote. Five Conservatives - Sir Christopher Chope, Philip Davies, Neil Hudson, Esther McVey and John Redwood - voted against the changes. Thirty-seven Conservative MPs abstained. However, while some abstained due to concerns about the tax rise, others may simply been given permission to miss the vote. What would a National Insurance rise mean for me? Social care changes at-a-glance PM bets on imperfect care solution over inaction Politicians have long agreed on the need to reform England's social care system, which helps older and working-age people with high care needs to carry out tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication. The key proposals of the new plan are: People will no longer pay more than Â£86,000 in care costs - not including food and accommodation - over their lifetime, from October 2023 Once people have reached this cap, ongoing costs for personal care will be paid for by local authorities Those with between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 in assets will get means-tested help towards costs from their local council Those with less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay towards care costs from their assets at all, but might have to contribute from their income The tax will be raised through a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance - which working people and their employers pay - from next April Income from share dividends - earned by those who own shares in companies - will also see a 1.25% tax rate increase The NI rise will cost Â£255 a year for someone earning Â£30,000, and Â£505 a year for someone on Â£50,000, the government says Currently workers pay 12% National Insurance on earnings between Â£9,564 and Â£50,268. However, anything earned above this amount attracts a rate of just 2%. Mr Johnson has said the majority of the Â£36bn fund raised by the tax rise will go towards catching up on the backlog in the NHS created by Covid. A smaller portion of the money - Â£5.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that. The UK-wide tax will be focused on funding health and social care in England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional Â£2.2bn to spend on their services. From 2023, the increase in National Insurance will become a separate levy, while the National Insurance rates will return to their previous level. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said that under Mr Johnson's plan ""someone with a house worth Â£186,000 would still have to pay Â£86,000 even with this cap - and that's before living costs of going into a care home."" ""How does the chancellor suggest they pay those fees without selling their home?"" she asked. Along with Labour, the SNP also voted against the government's proposals, with its Westminster leader Ian Blackford accusing the Conservatives of ""taxing Scottish workers twice"" and ""forcing them to pay the bill for social care in England as well as at home in Scotland"". And Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the prime minister had failed to come up with a plan to tackle care staff vacancies or help unpaid family carers. Conservative MP Jake Berry was among the critical voices from the government's own backbench, warning ministers that ""throwing other people's money down a bottomless pit doesn't become a good idea if you put the NHS logo next to it"". Mr Johnson sought to reassure his own MPs ahead of the vote, telling a meeting of backbenchers: ""We should never forget we are the party of low taxation.""

"The government's reversal of the 1.25p in the pound rise in National Insurance (NI) has come into effect. It means many people will keep more of their pay. NI went up by 1.25p in the pound in April and went back to its previous level on 6 November. For employees under pension age who earn less than Â£12,570 a year, the move will make no difference - because they don't pay NI. Above that income level, the amount saved increases as earnings do. So higher earners stand to benefit more than people on lower incomes - although higher earners will still contribute more tax overall. The majority of businesses will also see a reduction in their NI bills. Each business will save an average of Â£9,600 each in 2023-24,according to the government,external. National Insurance rise to be reversed in November NI is a tax paid by employees, employers and the self-employed: employees pay NI on their wages as well as income tax employers pay extra NI contributions for staff the self-employed pay NI on their profits NI contributes to the cost of benefits and the state pension. However, the government can borrow from the NI fund to help pay for other projects. NI raises a lot of money: Â£158bn last yearaccording to HMRC,external. Whether you receive the full state pensiondepends on your NI record,external. Why do we pay National Insurance? Since 6 April, workers and employers have been paying an extra 1.25p in the pound. The increase was part of the government's plan to fund the NHS and social care. It took the rate of NI to 13.25%. That meant the government went back on its 2019 election manifesto promise not to raise the tax. The NI increase was due to be replaced by a new Health and Social Care Levy - at a rate of 1.25% - in April 2023. But the government has now scrapped these plans, putting the NI rate back to 12%. That rate is paid by employees earning between Â£12,570 a year and just over Â£50,000 a year. Above that level, the rate has gone back down from 3.25% to 2.0%. The 1.25 percentage point increase in NI was supposed to raise Â£12bn a year. The government said the extra money would initially go towards easing pressure on the NHS. Some would then be moved into the social care system. This mainly helps older people and people with high care needs, with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication. The government has said that funding for health and social care services will be maintained at the same level as if the levy was in place. The funding for health and social care will now come from general taxation. A proportion of the NI increase was supposed to fund the social care system. The social care system is under pressure because of an ageing population and the effects of the pandemic. At the same time, it has also been hit by staff shortages and falling government spending. The government wants to ensure that people in England pay no more than Â£86,000 in care costs from October 2023 (not including accommodation and food). People with assets - such as a home, savings or investments - worth less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay for care out of those assets, but may still have to contribute from their income. Those with assets worth between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 may have their care costs subsidised. What could care changes cost you and your family? Social care: Nine challenges facing the system NI is a UK-wide tax. Although the government decided to increase it in order to fund health and social care in England, the tax increase was also expected to raise extra money that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland could have chosen to spend on those services.

"Boris Johnson has defended his plan to raise National Insurance to fund health and social care, saying it deals with ""catastrophic costs"" faced by millions. In a testy exchange in Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pressed him on whether he stood by his promise that no one who needed care would have to sell their home. The PM did not answer directly, saying his party was taking tough decisions. MPs are debating the plan in the Commons and will vote at 19:00 BST. In the manifesto-breaking move, the prime minister hopes to raise Â£12bn a year to tackle the health backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and boost social care. What would a National Insurance rise mean for me? Social care changes at-a-glance PM bets on imperfect care solution over inaction Mr Johnson saidhis plan,external- which includes capping care costs in England at Â£86,000 - was broad-based and progressive according to the economic think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies. ""The plan deals - after decades - with catastrophic costs faced by millions of people, the risks that they face, the threat they could face the loss of their homes, their possessions, their ability to pass on anything to their children,"" he said. He added it was the first time the state had stepped in to deal with the threat of such costs and meant insurance companies would now be able to help protect people against the costs of care. But Sir Keir said the tax was unfair on working people, adding: ""Under his plan, a landlord renting out dozens of properties won't pay a penny more, while their tenants in work will face tax rises of hundreds of pounds a year. ""A care worker earning the minimum wage doesn't get a pay rise under this plan but does get a tax rise. In what world is that fair?"" Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, confirmed during the debate that the party would be voting against the tax. A handful of Conservative MPs are also expected to vote against, including former minister Steve Baker, who called on his party to ""rediscover what it stands for"" rather than ""every time there is a squeeze on the public finances, coming back for higher taxes."" But with an 80-seat majority, Mr Johnson's plan is still expected to pass. This video can not be played Starmer: People with broadest shoulders should pay fair share The SNP also oppose the move, with its Westminster leader Ian Blackford calling it a ""regressive tax"" on millions of Scottish workers without consultation. And Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey - who is also carer for his disabled son - said the plan ""forgot family carers"" who just want ""a fair deal"". It is widely agreed that major changes are needed to England's social care system, which helps older and working-age people with high care needs to carry out day-to-day tasks, such as washing, dressing, eating and medication. The key proposals of the new plan are: People will no longer pay more than Â£86,000 in care costs - not including food and accommodation - over their lifetime, from October 2023 Once people have reached this cap, ongoing costs for personal care will be paid for by local authorities Those with between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 in assets will get means-tested help towards costs from their local council Those with less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay towards care costs from their assets at all, but might have to contribute from their income The tax will be raised through a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance - which working people and their employers pay to ensure benefits like the state pension - from next April This will cost Â£255 a year for someone earning Â£30,000, and Â£505 a year for someone on Â£50,000, the government says Mr Johnson has said the majority of the Â£36bn fund raised by the tax rise will go towards catching up on the backlog in the NHS created by Covid - increasing hospital capacity and creating space for nine million more appointments, scans and operations. A smaller portion of the money - Â£5.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that. But there has been anger from the social care sector over the amount they had been promised. The UK Home Care Association, which represents home care providers, said it was ""nowhere near enough"", while Unison, a union for care workers, said the money ""doesn't even come close"" and those in need of care would be feeling ""extremely let down"". Chairman of the Independent Care Group Mike Padgham also said the plan did not address the staffing crisis which was ""sending the sector into meltdown on a daily basis as care providers struggle to cover shifts"". Asked about staff shortages and low pay, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the levy would mean local authorities could pay more for care and a new staff training and development programme would be introduced. From those who work in, commission services or have their lives shaped by the care they get, the reactions to the prime minister's plans to reform this crumbling system have been mixed. The fact there is a plan is welcome because it means there is something to work with, but charities, councils and the people who run home care and care homes, are worried by the lack of a vision of what a future care system should be trying to achieve. And there is even more concern about the money. One senior local Conservative politician described the mood in local government to me in one word - ""despair"". Councils are facing a significant increase in people asking for help already, but there is no extra money now. There's scepticism about whether the funding given to the NHS in the short term will actually be released to social care in three years' time. The politician said the authority feared that as the new levy comes in, their costs will go up as they expect more people will be eligible for council support (with more generous means-testing) and wage bills will rise for them and care providers. They worry that people believe the social care system is fixed now, but the situation may have just got worse. The new tax will begin as a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance from next April, paid by both employers and workers, and will then become a separate tax on earned income from 2023 - calculated in the same way as National Insurance and appearing on an employee's payslip. This will be paid by all working adults, including older workers. The government says it will be ""legally ring-fenced"" to go only towards health and social care costs. Income from share dividends - earned by those who own shares in companies - will also see a 1.25% tax rate increase, to stop people getting round the tax by taking more earnings in the form of dividends rather than salary. This video can not be played Ben Zaranko from the IFS: 'If the NHS needs more money, that leaves less for social care' The Institute for Fiscal Studies also said the Â£12bn a year extra for health and social care risked being swallowed up by the NHS. It suggested that the experiences of the past 40 years showed NHS spending plans were almost always topped up, meaning that health would continue to require the bulk of the revenue raised by the new tax, which ""could leave little if any of the tax rises announced available for social care"". The UK-wide tax will be focused on funding health and social care in England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional Â£2.2bn to spend on their services. Mr Johnson said no Conservative government wanted to raise taxes but defended the move as ""the right, reasonable and fair approach"" in light of the pandemic, which saw the government spend upwards of Â£407bn on support. While he said he did not want to raise taxes further, he did not rule out more increases before the next election. Why the cap on care costs is not all it seems What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? Sir Edward Leigh said as a ""low tax Conservative"" MP, it would be ""easy to attack"" the new levy, warning it could end up ""subsidising"" wealthy pensioners in the south east of England at the expense of those elsewhere. But during Wednesday's debate, he said it was ""much more difficult to provide an alternative"" when the funding was needed for care and the NHS now. The Tory backbencher did warn the leadership, however, not to think they can ""solve these problems by becoming a tax and spend party"" to cheers from his colleagues, adding: ""It is simply not going to wash"".

"Sophie Moss's brother said she had been ""taken advantage of and exploited"" The sentence given to a man who choked a woman to death during sex is being reviewed by the Attorney General to decide if it was unduly lenient. Sam Pybus, 32, wasjailed for four yearsand eight months after admitting the manslaughter of Sophie Moss, 33, at her home in Darlington on 7 February. Campaigners said the ""outrageous"" sentence sent a ""dreadful message"". Referring the sentence for review, MP Harriet Harman said it ""fails to reflect the gravity of the crime"". A spokesperson for the Attorney General's Office said the review under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme would take place within 28 days and, if successful, the case would be referred to the Court of Appeal. Ms Harman said Pybus' ""disgraceful mitigation"" that Ms Moss, a mother of two young boys, encouraged strangulation during sex made it sound as if it was ""her fault"". ""[Pybus] sought to shift the responsibility for Sophie's death from himself to her claiming that she both encouraged and enjoyed his placing pressure on her neck,"" Ms Harman said. Pybus had drunk 24 bottles of lager before he visited Sophie Moss, Teesside Crown Court heard The MP said: ""The sentence fails to reflect the gravity of the crime, the impact of her death on her family, his sole culpability for her death, his cynical shifting of the responsibility from himself to her and sends out the message that killing your girlfriend during sex is a minor matter."" We Can't Consent To This, a campaign group set up in response to so-called ""consensual"" violence claims against women, also criticised the sentence. Spokeswoman Fiona Mackenzie said: ""It seems that strangling a woman to death is still viewed in law as an unfortunate accident, rather than terrible serious violence. ""This sends a dreadful message to women - four years and eight months is an outrageous sentence. The Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme allows anyone to lobby the Attorney General to send a case to the Court of Appeal for review. Very experienced senior judges then consider the term given to an offender and how it compares to any relevant guidelines on sentencing and previous similar crimes. Judge Paul Watson reduced Pybus' initial sentence of seven years because the law required him to give the killer a discount for his early admission that he was guilty of manslaughter - the crime of unintentionally causing Ms Moss' death. Pybus said he never intended to kill, leading to the Crown Prosecution Service ruling out a murder charge. But he could not avoid a manslaughter conviction by claiming it was ""rough sex gone wrong"". Some 28 years ago, the UK's then most senior judges declared that nobody can consent to serious harm as part of sado-masochistic sex -a ruling that was recently reasserted in the 2021 Domestic Abuse Act,external. Pybus, who was married, had been seeing Ms Moss for sex about six times a year for three years without his wife's knowledge,  Teesside Crown Court previously heard. On 6 February he had drunk 24 bottles of Amstel lager over 10 hours, and drove to Ms Moss's flat after his wife went to bed. At 04:43 GMT the following morning he drove to Darlington police station and told staff he believed he had strangled Ms Moss. He said that during sex he would apply pressure to her neck, ""an act he said she encouraged"", but added he would never hurt her. The claim she encouraged strangulation during sex was confirmed by her long-term partner, the court heard. Instead of giving Ms Moss first aid, Pybus went to his car and thought about what to do for 15 minutes before driving to the police station, the court was told. On Tuesday Judge Paul Watson QC said he accepted Pybus, of Water View, Middleton St George, Darlington, did not intend to kill and believed he had genuine remorse. In a victim statement Ms Moss's brother said she had been ""taken advantage of and exploited"". Follow BBC North East & Cumbria onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played Yevgeny Zinichev was filmed inspecting the Arctic drill on Tuesday Russia's Emergencies Minister Yevgeny Zinichev has died in an accident during a big Arctic civil defence exercise. The ministry said Zinichev, 55, had died in the Norilsk area while trying to save someone's life. A cameraman had fallen off a cliff during an interview, according to Margarita Simonyan, the head of Russian broadcaster RT. ""He and the cameraman were on the edge of a cliff. The cameraman slipped and fell into the water,"" she said. ""Zinichev rushed after the fallen man and died after hitting a protruding rock."" The cameraman, later named as film director Alexander Melnik, 63, also died. Russian media said the accident happened at the Kitabo Oron waterfall in the Putorana nature reserve in northern Siberia, some 165km (100 miles) west of Norilsk. Zinichev had been emergencies minister since 2018 and for years was reportedly a key member of President Vladimir Putin's security detail. For most of his career he worked in state security, beginning with the Soviet KGB and eventually rising to number two in Russia's federal security service in 2016. A Kremlin statement said Mr Putin had shared many years working with Zinichev and spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was a great loss. Melnik was a director and screenwriter and was known for his 2015 Arctic adventure film Territory. The film was shot on the Putorana plateau where he died. He was planning a documentary on the development of the Arctic and Russia's Northern Sea Route. Some 6,000 people were taking part in the large-scale Arctic drill Russian media say they had been filming a training video in the Krasnoyarsk region for the ministry at the time of the accident. Deputy emergencies minister Andrei Gurovich told Rossiya 24 TV that his boss had acted spontaneously ""not like a minister, but like a rescuer. This is how he lived all his life"". Zinichev's body was being flown back to Moscow hours after the accident, which is said to have happened early on Wednesday morning. The unprecedented two-day exercise was organised by Zinichev's department and stretched across seven regions in the Russian Arctic. He said on Tuesday that the ""format, geography and involved units are unique"". They were reportedly ordered by President Putin to prevent crisis situations in the Arctic and involved 6,000 specialists covering a dozen emergency situations. Earlier, the minister had visited a search and rescue team and the site of a new fire station in Norilsk. Minister was filmed before fatal Arctic accident.

"Online shopping giant Amazon has said it is ""proud"" of its contribution to the UK economy, as it reveals its latest financial results. The firm paid Â£492m in direct taxation as its sales rose 50% to Â£20.63bn, amid a Covid-driven surge in demand. Amazon and other tech firms, which pay tax on profits not sales, have faced scrutiny over the level of their tax bills in the UK. But Amazon said it had invested Â£32bn in UK infrastructure since 2010. ""We are proud of the significant economic contribution we are making to the UK economy,"" Amazonsaid in a statement.,external ""Looking ahead, we know that the UK remains full of opportunity and we continue to be excited by the potential to continue to invest, create jobs, develop talent and have a positive impact in communities across the country,"" the statement added. Amazon's total sales in the UK, rose to Â£20.63bn during 2020 - up by more than 50% from Â£13.73bn in 2019. The direct tax bill was up by more than two-thirds compared with the Â£293m it paid in the previous year. The firm, which employs 55,000 people in the UK, said the taxes included business rates, stamp duty, corporation tax and other contributions. Amazon to recruit 55,000 staff for expansion drive WhatsApp issued second-largest GDPR fine Amazon said employers' national insurance taxes accounted for the majority of the bill as it took on 22,000 more staff over the course of the last year. The company's indirect tax bill came to Â£1.06bn, up from Â£854m, driven by VAT on increased sales and employee taxes, as it took on more people and increased wages. Amazon said that when both direct and indirect taxation were taken into account, it had contributed Â£1.55bn, up from Â£1.15bn. GMB, the union for Amazon workers, said the company's tax bill was ""frankly insulting"" and said firms that had profited from the pandemic should pay more. Mick Rix, GMB National Officer, said:""Amazon workers suffer unsafe, dehumanising work practices; breaking bones, falling unconscious and being taken away in ambulances. ""Ministers must get a grip of this runaway company and make sure pandemic profiteers pay more. ""Amazon's key UK business paid just Â£3.8m more corporation tax last year than in 2019, even as sales increased by Â£1.89bn."" In April last year, the UK government launched a 2% tax on digital sales amid concerns that big tech firms were re-routing their profits through low tax jurisdictions. The Digital Services Tax is also included in the Â£492m figure. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said in June last year that the coronavirus crisis had made tech giants even ""more powerful and more profitable"". Other global tech firms have facedsimilar scrutiny,externalover their tax bills. French tax authorities recently settled disputes with Facebook, Google, Apple and Amazon over their operations in the country over the last decade. Last year, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said he recognised the public's frustration over the amount of tax paid by tech firms and backed plans by think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to find a global solution. ""As usual the accounts are legally compliant but opaque and lack the crucial information about intra-group transactions which enable the company to shift profits is not there,"" said Labour peer and emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Sheffield and University of Essex, Prem Sikka. ""Therefore it's impossible to know what their true economic profit is,"" Prof Sikka said. Given the profits declared by competitors, Prof Sikka said Amazon's tax bill ""seems very low"", whereas, for retailers such as supermarket chains, tax bills as a proportion of sales were much higher. ""We need a complete change in accounting regulations which currently increase opacity rather than transparency,"" Prof Sikka added. Professor of taxation law at King's College London, Ann Mumford agreed and said that there was a lack of public discussion around the rules which led to this amount of tax. ""It seems that Amazon realised that they would need to pay a respectable amount - and, are hoping that an increase of Â£3.8 million sounds like a lot of money,"" Prof Mumford added. The pandemic has accelerated the shift towards online shopping and Amazon has been one of the biggest winners amid those changing consumer trends. As Covid closed physical stores during successive lockdowns, sales at the internet giant rocketed. Today's numbers will raise further questions about how tech giants operate, the level of tax they pay and their impact on the struggling High Street. Amazon moved to fend off criticism by pointing out that its direct tax bill increased by more than two-thirds from the Â£293m it paid in 2019. Critics say that's still nowhere near enough given the surge in sales. The firm's been on a hiring spree to meet soaring demand, offering a Â£1,000 joining bonus to encourage staff to work in its fulfilment centres in the north east of England.

"MPs vote by 319 to 248 to raise taxes to fund the NHS and social care There will be a new 1.25% tax on workers and employers to fund health and social care This breaks a Tory manifesto commitment not to increase taxes National Insurance will increase from April 2022, with a separate tax introduced in 2023 It has been criticised by some Conservative backbenchers and opposition parties The amount individuals have to spend on their care will be capped at Â£86,000 - not including accommodation costs Labour says the change ""hammers"" working people, leave people still facing losing their homes to pay for care, and it may not clear NHS backlogs Edited by Rob Corp We've reached the end of the debating, and the subsequent passing of the health and social care levy in the House of Commons, so our live coverage will stop here. Thanks for joining us on what's been a busy day withnews of the tax riseand anoverhaul of the coronavirus foreign travel traffic light system. Your updates were written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans, Mary O'Connor, Justin Parkinson, Kate Whannel and Sinead Wilson. The page was edited by Martha Buckley and Rob Corp. Have a good evening and we will be back with more live updates tomorrow. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on need to address NHS wait times In an interview with the BBC, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted the government must make ""the investment now"" with the health and social care levy if NHS treatment backlogs are to be cleared. He tells the BBC's Health Editor Hugh Pym, that around 9 million NHS treatments could be funded by proposed government investment, but did not give details of targets. The new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and a social care reform is through. The Tories say it will bring an investment of Â£36bn in the health and care system over the next three years. This, according to chief secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay, will pay for the social care system to be reformed ""ending unpredictable and catastrophic care costs faced by thousands and making the system fairer for all"". The new tax means people will no longer pay more than Â£86,000 in care costs - not including food and accommodation - over their lifetime, from October 2023. Labour were against the plan with leader Sir Keir Starmer saying it wasunfair on working people. He says: ""Under his plan, a landlord renting out dozens of properties won't pay a penny more, while their tenants in work will face tax rises of hundreds of pounds a year."" The SNP also opposed the move, with its Westminster leader Ian Blackford calling it a ""regressive tax"" on millions of Scottish workers without consultation. And Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey - who is also a carer for his disabled son - said the plan ""forgot family carers"" who just want ""a fair deal"". We've got the key changeshereand you can work out how it will affect youhere. MPs have voted for an extra tax to fund social care in England - and help the NHS recover after the pandemic. There had been criticism - including from within the Conservative Party - that it will be unfair on younger people and the lower paid. Under the proposals, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April 2022. From April 2023, National Insurance will return to its current rate, and the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. This levy - unlike National Insurance - will also be paid by state pensioners who are still working. National Insurance is a UK-wide tax - and while Boris Johnson's announcement focuses on funding health and social care in England - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional Â£2.2bn to spend on their services. You can read morehere. MPs back the government's plan to raise taxes to fund spending on the NHS and social care. It gets through by 319 votes to 248 - that's a margin of 71. MPs have voted against a Labour amendment calling for an assessment of the plan to bring in a new 1.25% tax for the NHS and social care. They will now go to a vote on the substantive measure. If it goes through National Insurance will increase from April 2022, with a separate tax introduced in 2023 We will bring you the result as soon as we have it. While we wait why not read up on what it could mean:Whatâs the new Health and Social Care tax and how will it affect me? The debate is over after nearly five hours and MPs have gone to vote on a Labour amendment to the government's plan to bring in a new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and social care. Labour want the government to carry out an assessment on what the impact of the tax will be on jobs. We will bring you the result as soon as we have it. Steve Barclay, chief secretary to the Treasury, has been summing up the government's case for introducing a new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and to reform social care. ""The pandemic has put unprecedented pressure on the NHS with the number of people waiting for surgery or treatment in England is now at a record high of 5.5 million and if left unchecked this could rise to 13 million,"" he says. He says at the same time the country is facing a long-standing challenge to the social care system. ""Typically around one in seven must pay over Â£100,000 for care, with bills falling indiscriminately on some of the sickest and most vulnerable in society,"" he says. The government's plan would mean an investment of Â£36bn in the health and care system over the next three years, he says. ""The social care system will finally be reformed ending unpredictable and catastrophic care costs faced by thousands and making the system fairer for all,"" he says. Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson is summing up now. She says while it's been a good debate, what's been most striking is how ""inadequate a basis it has been for a change of this magnitude to the tax system of our country"". There have been a number of ""sharp and insightful"" contributions from Labour MPs, including the point that the measures would not improve the lot of care workers, who were now facing a tax rise, she says. Phillipson cites the views of other MPs that the proposals do not represent a proper plan for the NHS or for social care. ""It is instead a broken promise, two-and-a-half million working households hit by the Tory double whammy of cuts to Universal Credit and an increase in National Insurance,"" she adds. Phillipson reiterates the point that it is ""ludicrous"" that landlords will not have to ""pay a penny"" more under the new tax, but that tenants, many who might be working in the NHS, ""are about to be clobbered by a tax rise"" - adding that about 95% of the revenue will come from taxing workers' wages. She criticises the lack of notice given to MPs to approve the government's plans, saying it lacks the scrutiny needed for plans that have such ""universal"" impact. Phillipson says as well as a ""strong and skilled social care workforce"", Labour would deliver a ""new deal"" for care workers to create a ""well motivated and properly rewarded workforce"" that would give support to unpaid carers. Tory MP Jack Brereton says he has been contacted by hundreds of constituents about the need for more investment in social care and the challenges they face of accessing healthcare and medical treatment. ""No decision to invest more to the scale required is going to be easy - and money must come from somewhere. ""I think what we've arrived at is probably the least worst option. ""The approach taken will ensure this burden is spread as broadly as possible, so all those with earned income streams must contribute and protections are in place to protect those on lowest incomes."" Veteran Conservative MP Peter Bone says the government was ""creating a new tax...without having the detail."" He says: ""Whilst I support the idea of more money for the NHS - and I have no objection to it being done through National Insurance - I absolutely object to saying that this has got anything to do with the care bill because that hasn't been introduced. ""Social care should be paid for separately. There should have been a social care bill, we should have had the bill, we should have been able to debate the principle of that and then immediately afterwards voted on the ways and means but we've got this mixed up."" Conservative MP Huw Merriman reiterates the need to ""act now"" to reform health and social care in England and welcomes the ""decisive action"" being taken by the government. However he says he has concerns around the new tax - with the first being the political difficulty of getting the money initially being funnelled into the NHS into social care. He tells the Commons: ""We know how difficult it is to convince people that a temporary lift to Universal Credit was just temporary, how on earth are we going to challenge the equivalence of Marcus Rashford when it comes to the NHS in persuading people that this wasn't a cut but just a plan for a period of time and then we move the money to social care?"" He also cites the ""inter-generational unfairness"" of expecting young people without a home of their own to fund social care through a hike in National Insurance, rather than the older people with nest eggs or their own homes who would be using the service sooner. Thirdly, he says the Tories will have to look to ""rein in"" public spending and allocate money for the NHS with ""strict criteria"" on how it is going to be spent. Merriman indicates he will support the government in the vote but wants them to look at some of the alternative measures he's suggested. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The emergency of the pandemic, which demanded spending and borrowing that busted all norms, has faded. But the prime minister's fondness for splurging billions when he sees fit has not. The last 24 hours have sealed Boris Johnson's existing reputation: a Conservative who says he'd love low taxes, but when there's spending that he perceives is popular, that affection swiftly disappears. Read Laura's blog in full Tory MP Ben Everitt says he's going to try to be optimistic and pull out the good things in the hard choices the government faces. He says there are never any good options for raising taxes but ""raising taxes on having a job is possibly the thing that should be at the bottom of the list when we look at new areas of income"". He says: ""The Â£86,000 cap needs to be met and tweaked with a regional house price element to recognise that houses are worth more in one area of the country than others."" ""I will vote for this. Our job in this place is to make good laws and we need to do that at every stage and this is a tricky problem."" MPs have been debating a new 1.25% tax - initially through National Insurance - to pay for health and social care for about three and a half hours. Here are some of the main points that have been made:  MPs are expected to vote around 19:00 BST and we will bring you the result as soon as we have it. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says the government's plan for social care fails Labour's two tests - that it will fix the problems in the sector and is being funded in a fair way. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, she says Labour would ask those with the ""broadest shoulders"" to contribute more ""and not just go to those who go out to work and earn a wage"". Asked what taxes Labour would raise in their plan to fix social care, she said the party would set out those details in ""due course"" but that the party would seek to tax ""all forms of income"", not just those who work. Challenged on why ex-Labour PMGordon Brown used National Insurance to increase NHS funding back in 2002, she insists there were ""very different economic circumstances"" back then. She adds that while Brown had ""come forward with a plan"" to cut waiting times and get health spending up to the European average - today's Tory government lacked any ""clear plan"" in its proposals. ""The government can't even say when the backlog of operations will be clear, they can't even say when the money will go into our social care system, and they can't even meet the test that no one will have to sell their home to pay for social care,"" she says. Jim Shannon of the Democratic Unionist Party asks for guarantees that the money Northern Ireland will receive from the tax will be used only to help reform health and social care and not for anything else. Reading from a document, he says Northern Ireland is due to get around Â£420m a year from the new tax, but ""there is no indication that the Northern Ireland executive will be required to spend it on the purpose for which it was raised, since the government, it appears, cannot ring-fence the money"". He asks if Northern Ireland's share can be ring-fenced for health and social care and whether this will apply to all future monies sent there. ""What guarantees do we have that every single employed person, every single pensioner, every single business owner, that their sacrifice will bring about necessary change, and not be lost in the ether of politics at Stormont?"" Conservative Dr Andrew Murrison says this could be a historic moment in which we sort out the problems in health and social care and he will be voting ""enthusiastically"" with the government later. And using National Insurance to raise the extra funds is progressive, he adds. But the challenge for ministers is to turn the money going to providers in to better outcomes for patients, he adds. Improving productivity in the NHS has to be a priority and sickness levels need to be driven down, he argues.  Anna George's 91-year-old mother has been in a British Legion Care Home since October 2019, where she lives in a dementia unit. She says her mother's home was sold to pay the Â£4778.43 cost of her care over a 31-day month. But the family are worried as there is only enough money left to fund 10 more months of care. Anna, 68, who lives in Northamptonshire, says: âWhen we get down to the final Â£23,000 we inform social services and we then pay a percentage to contribute to the continued care. I donât know how much. âItâs pretty scary for us because itâs not that far away now for us now."" She welcomes the new tax, but argues it has come ""too late"" for her family. âMy parents worked hard to own their home and to have something to give their children but their hopes are dashed now. âI know people think this tax is unfair on younger, working people but weâre losing our inheritance. Hopefully, with this new system that wonât happen for the younger generation when they reach the stage in life of needing social care."" Reality Check At prime ministerâs questions, Boris Johnson was asked by
the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, whether his previous guarantee that âno one who needs care has to sell their home to
pay for itâ still stood. Mr Johnson did not confirm whether it did. The pledge was
in the Conservativesâ 2019 manifesto. When the Health Secretary, Sajid Javid, was asked about on
the BBCâs Today programme he said: ""We will also make sure that everyone
is able to access what's called the deferred payment agreement... which means
no one will ever have to sell their housein their life time."" Weâve looked at the pledge, how the language has changed
and whether it can be met under the new plans. You can read what we foundhere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.7273895
"Boris Johnson has defended his plan to raise National Insurance to fund health and social care, saying it deals with ""catastrophic costs"" faced by millions. In a testy exchange in Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pressed him on whether he stood by his promise that no one who needed care would have to sell their home. The PM did not answer directly, saying his party was taking tough decisions. MPs are debating the plan in the Commons and will vote at 19:00 BST. In the manifesto-breaking move, the prime minister hopes to raise Â£12bn a year to tackle the health backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and boost social care. What would a National Insurance rise mean for me? Social care changes at-a-glance PM bets on imperfect care solution over inaction Mr Johnson saidhis plan,external- which includes capping care costs in England at Â£86,000 - was broad-based and progressive according to the economic think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies. ""The plan deals - after decades - with catastrophic costs faced by millions of people, the risks that they face, the threat they could face the loss of their homes, their possessions, their ability to pass on anything to their children,"" he said. He added it was the first time the state had stepped in to deal with the threat of such costs and meant insurance companies would now be able to help protect people against the costs of care. But Sir Keir said the tax was unfair on working people, adding: ""Under his plan, a landlord renting out dozens of properties won't pay a penny more, while their tenants in work will face tax rises of hundreds of pounds a year. ""A care worker earning the minimum wage doesn't get a pay rise under this plan but does get a tax rise. In what world is that fair?"" Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, confirmed during the debate that the party would be voting against the tax. A handful of Conservative MPs are also expected to vote against, including former minister Steve Baker, who called on his party to ""rediscover what it stands for"" rather than ""every time there is a squeeze on the public finances, coming back for higher taxes."" But with an 80-seat majority, Mr Johnson's plan is still expected to pass. This video can not be played Starmer: People with broadest shoulders should pay fair share The SNP also oppose the move, with its Westminster leader Ian Blackford calling it a ""regressive tax"" on millions of Scottish workers without consultation. And Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey - who is also carer for his disabled son - said the plan ""forgot family carers"" who just want ""a fair deal"". It is widely agreed that major changes are needed to England's social care system, which helps older and working-age people with high care needs to carry out day-to-day tasks, such as washing, dressing, eating and medication. The key proposals of the new plan are: People will no longer pay more than Â£86,000 in care costs - not including food and accommodation - over their lifetime, from October 2023 Once people have reached this cap, ongoing costs for personal care will be paid for by local authorities Those with between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 in assets will get means-tested help towards costs from their local council Those with less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay towards care costs from their assets at all, but might have to contribute from their income The tax will be raised through a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance - which working people and their employers pay to ensure benefits like the state pension - from next April This will cost Â£255 a year for someone earning Â£30,000, and Â£505 a year for someone on Â£50,000, the government says Mr Johnson has said the majority of the Â£36bn fund raised by the tax rise will go towards catching up on the backlog in the NHS created by Covid - increasing hospital capacity and creating space for nine million more appointments, scans and operations. A smaller portion of the money - Â£5.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that. But there has been anger from the social care sector over the amount they had been promised. The UK Home Care Association, which represents home care providers, said it was ""nowhere near enough"", while Unison, a union for care workers, said the money ""doesn't even come close"" and those in need of care would be feeling ""extremely let down"". Chairman of the Independent Care Group Mike Padgham also said the plan did not address the staffing crisis which was ""sending the sector into meltdown on a daily basis as care providers struggle to cover shifts"". Asked about staff shortages and low pay, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the levy would mean local authorities could pay more for care and a new staff training and development programme would be introduced. From those who work in, commission services or have their lives shaped by the care they get, the reactions to the prime minister's plans to reform this crumbling system have been mixed. The fact there is a plan is welcome because it means there is something to work with, but charities, councils and the people who run home care and care homes, are worried by the lack of a vision of what a future care system should be trying to achieve. And there is even more concern about the money. One senior local Conservative politician described the mood in local government to me in one word - ""despair"". Councils are facing a significant increase in people asking for help already, but there is no extra money now. There's scepticism about whether the funding given to the NHS in the short term will actually be released to social care in three years' time. The politician said the authority feared that as the new levy comes in, their costs will go up as they expect more people will be eligible for council support (with more generous means-testing) and wage bills will rise for them and care providers. They worry that people believe the social care system is fixed now, but the situation may have just got worse. The new tax will begin as a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance from next April, paid by both employers and workers, and will then become a separate tax on earned income from 2023 - calculated in the same way as National Insurance and appearing on an employee's payslip. This will be paid by all working adults, including older workers. The government says it will be ""legally ring-fenced"" to go only towards health and social care costs. Income from share dividends - earned by those who own shares in companies - will also see a 1.25% tax rate increase, to stop people getting round the tax by taking more earnings in the form of dividends rather than salary. This video can not be played Ben Zaranko from the IFS: 'If the NHS needs more money, that leaves less for social care' The Institute for Fiscal Studies also said the Â£12bn a year extra for health and social care risked being swallowed up by the NHS. It suggested that the experiences of the past 40 years showed NHS spending plans were almost always topped up, meaning that health would continue to require the bulk of the revenue raised by the new tax, which ""could leave little if any of the tax rises announced available for social care"". The UK-wide tax will be focused on funding health and social care in England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional Â£2.2bn to spend on their services. Mr Johnson said no Conservative government wanted to raise taxes but defended the move as ""the right, reasonable and fair approach"" in light of the pandemic, which saw the government spend upwards of Â£407bn on support. While he said he did not want to raise taxes further, he did not rule out more increases before the next election. Why the cap on care costs is not all it seems What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? Sir Edward Leigh said as a ""low tax Conservative"" MP, it would be ""easy to attack"" the new levy, warning it could end up ""subsidising"" wealthy pensioners in the south east of England at the expense of those elsewhere. But during Wednesday's debate, he said it was ""much more difficult to provide an alternative"" when the funding was needed for care and the NHS now. The Tory backbencher did warn the leadership, however, not to think they can ""solve these problems by becoming a tax and spend party"" to cheers from his colleagues, adding: ""It is simply not going to wash"".

"Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a plan to cap the cost of social care in England. It comes almost two years after the Conservative Party's manifesto promise on social care: ""Nobody needing care should be forced to sell their home to pay for it."" So will the creation of an Â£86,000 care cap fulfil this commitment? The social care system mainly helps older people and people with high care needs with tasks such as washing, dressing, eating and taking medication. To have residential care paid for by their local council, people in England must have savings and assets - which may include their home - worth less than Â£23,250. Below that level, the amount they pay reduces until you have less than Â£14,250, at which point the council pays for your care if you qualify. However, you may still need tocontribute some of your income,external, such as your pension. The government says this current system means one in seven people in England ends up paying Â£100,000 or more. And those with long-term needs - such as dementia - may have to sell their home to pay for residential care costs. The introduction of a cap would give people the confidence to properly plan their assets, ""because they know the maximum cost they will face in their lifetime will be Â£86,000"", Health Secretary Sajid Javid said. As well as your home, assets can also include things like cars, investments and savings. But when asked whether some people would still have to sell their homes - given the cap does not include costs such as accommodation and food - Mr Javid told BBC News: ""We will make sure that everyone is able to access what is called the deferred-payment agreement... which means no-one will have to sell their house in their lifetime."" Social care tax rise: MPs to hold Commons vote later What will the new tax cost me? Will people already paying for care get extra help? And other questions Deferred-payment agreements (DPAs) were introduced by the then government in 2015. A DPA is a legal arrangement with a local council. It covers care costs up front and secures these against a person's home at a fixed-interest rate. When the person dies, their home is sold to repay the loan - but they will not have to sell it before then to pay for residential care. As well as interest, administration costs may also apply. And councils can refuse to approve these loans, if, for example, they do not think they will get all of their money back. In the year ending March 2020: 3,415 new DPAs were agreed, at a total value of Â£53.2m,external a further 690 requests were turned down by councils in England To put this into context, we asked the government how many people had been forced to sell their homes to pay for social care but it has not provided the figures. Since the care cap was announced, the government has said it is keen to extend the use of DPAs, to provide more flexibility for people to defer their care payments. But it has yet to say how it will do this. As well as DPAs, the government expects more financial products, such as insurance, will be available for future care needs, because the cap provides more certainty about the costs faced. ""No-one will have to sell their house in their lifetime,"" Mr Javid says Boris Johnson's health and social care plan breaks two pledges from the 2019 Conservative manifesto - not to raise the rate of National Insurance and to keep the ""triple lock formula"" for annual state pension increases. Triple lock pension pledge suspended for one year What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? Referring to the manifesto promise ""nobody needing care should be forced to sell their home to pay for it"", Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asked Mr Johnson, at Prime Minister's Questions, if he ""still stands by his guarantee"". The prime minister did not confirm this. Sir Keir then asked how someone with assets of Â£186,000 (including the value of their home), for example, could pay care costs of Â£86,000 without selling their home. Mr Johnson did not answer directly but said his plan would deal with ""the catastrophic costs faced by millions of people"". Resolution Foundation think tank chief executive Torsten Bell says: ""Somebody who has significant residential-care costs and does not have lots of financial assets will still - in most cases - have to put a charge on the home. ""They will not have to sell it while they are alive - but when they pass away, the council will have had a charge on that home"". Since the announcement of the Â£86,000 cap, which starts in October 2023, some of the language has shifted compared with what was written in the manifesto. Mr Javid has promised, for example, to extend DPAs so ""no-one will have to sell their house in their lifetime"".

"Sophie Moss's brother said she had been ""taken advantage of and exploited"" The sentence given to a man who choked a woman to death during sex is being reviewed by the Attorney General to decide if it was unduly lenient. Sam Pybus, 32, wasjailed for four yearsand eight months after admitting the manslaughter of Sophie Moss, 33, at her home in Darlington on 7 February. Campaigners said the ""outrageous"" sentence sent a ""dreadful message"". Referring the sentence for review, MP Harriet Harman said it ""fails to reflect the gravity of the crime"". A spokesperson for the Attorney General's Office said the review under the Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme would take place within 28 days and, if successful, the case would be referred to the Court of Appeal. Ms Harman said Pybus' ""disgraceful mitigation"" that Ms Moss, a mother of two young boys, encouraged strangulation during sex made it sound as if it was ""her fault"". ""[Pybus] sought to shift the responsibility for Sophie's death from himself to her claiming that she both encouraged and enjoyed his placing pressure on her neck,"" Ms Harman said. Pybus had drunk 24 bottles of lager before he visited Sophie Moss, Teesside Crown Court heard The MP said: ""The sentence fails to reflect the gravity of the crime, the impact of her death on her family, his sole culpability for her death, his cynical shifting of the responsibility from himself to her and sends out the message that killing your girlfriend during sex is a minor matter."" We Can't Consent To This, a campaign group set up in response to so-called ""consensual"" violence claims against women, also criticised the sentence. Spokeswoman Fiona Mackenzie said: ""It seems that strangling a woman to death is still viewed in law as an unfortunate accident, rather than terrible serious violence. ""This sends a dreadful message to women - four years and eight months is an outrageous sentence. The Unduly Lenient Sentence scheme allows anyone to lobby the Attorney General to send a case to the Court of Appeal for review. Very experienced senior judges then consider the term given to an offender and how it compares to any relevant guidelines on sentencing and previous similar crimes. Judge Paul Watson reduced Pybus' initial sentence of seven years because the law required him to give the killer a discount for his early admission that he was guilty of manslaughter - the crime of unintentionally causing Ms Moss' death. Pybus said he never intended to kill, leading to the Crown Prosecution Service ruling out a murder charge. But he could not avoid a manslaughter conviction by claiming it was ""rough sex gone wrong"". Some 28 years ago, the UK's then most senior judges declared that nobody can consent to serious harm as part of sado-masochistic sex -a ruling that was recently reasserted in the 2021 Domestic Abuse Act,external. Pybus, who was married, had been seeing Ms Moss for sex about six times a year for three years without his wife's knowledge,  Teesside Crown Court previously heard. On 6 February he had drunk 24 bottles of Amstel lager over 10 hours, and drove to Ms Moss's flat after his wife went to bed. At 04:43 GMT the following morning he drove to Darlington police station and told staff he believed he had strangled Ms Moss. He said that during sex he would apply pressure to her neck, ""an act he said she encouraged"", but added he would never hurt her. The claim she encouraged strangulation during sex was confirmed by her long-term partner, the court heard. Instead of giving Ms Moss first aid, Pybus went to his car and thought about what to do for 15 minutes before driving to the police station, the court was told. On Tuesday Judge Paul Watson QC said he accepted Pybus, of Water View, Middleton St George, Darlington, did not intend to kill and believed he had genuine remorse. In a victim statement Ms Moss's brother said she had been ""taken advantage of and exploited"". Follow BBC North East & Cumbria onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external.

"Betty has already sold her house to pay for her care For thousands of people who need social care, raising the money to pay for it has meant taking life-changing decisions. Many have sold their homes, while others have given up work to look after their loved-ones themselves. Now the government is raising taxes and proposing a cap on the amount people will pay. So what do those already using the care system make of the proposals? Betty, 88, has dementia and has lived in a care home since December 2016. She has sold her house to cover the tens of thousands of pounds needed to pay for her care. But as she is already in a home, she will not benefit from the government's plans to cap costs at Â£86,000. It will come into force in England from October 2023, but it will not be backdated. Betty's son, Gordon Brooks, from Gosport, Hampshire, describes his mother's Â£4,300-a-month fees as ""horrendous"". To pay for them, her house was sold and the proceeds were invested in shares. But Gordon fears that rather than being helped by the government's new plans, the money set aside to pay for her care will be hit by further taxation. As part of the proposals, shareholders will also have to pay the additional 1.25% in tax on the profits they make. ""We invested it to gain more and make it last longer but if the investment is taxed further it diminishes it so it's a double whammy,"" he said. Social care changes at-a-glance Will people already paying for care get extra help? PM defends social care tax rise ahead of vote ""She's well looked after and in relatively good health but the assets she has will only last a certain amount of time."" He says his mother will be contributing to the new scheme through the additional tax from her shares, but won't gain anything herself. ""Politicians have been saying for a long time that people shouldn't have to sell houses to pay for their social care. She has already had to sell her house. ""This new scheme is meant to help people in this position but it's doing the opposite for her. I'm not interested in inheriting the family silver, I'm interested in making sure she is kept in the home and looked after."" Julie, from Manchester, says her mother, who has Alzheimer's disease, will have paid a quarter of a million pounds in care home fees by the time the government's plans come into force in October 2023. She rents out her mother's house to pay for her care but she says that only covers a quarter of the fees. ""In order to meet these costs, I will have to sell her property,"" she says. ""Her savings are all but depleted."" Julie, an only child, says her mother is well looked after but she doesn't think it's fair that some people pay for care fees and others don't. ""Â£250,000 is a lot of money for just over four years of care,"" she adds. Under the plans announced by the prime minister the NHS will get the bulk of the Â£36bn raised in the first three years, with Â£5.4bn going to social care in England. But that balance is expected to tip towards social care in subsequent years as the Â£86,000 cap on costs introduced from October 2023 starts to require funding. However, Julie says she is sceptical about how much of the money raised will end up going to social care. ""Whilst I welcome that finally, care home fees will be capped, waiting another two years in the hope that there will be funding available once monies have been ploughed into the NHS gives me very little comfort, or indeed hope, that this will actually come to fruition. ""I totally understand and appreciate that the NHS needs support, but so does social care. Why, yet again, is social care the poor relation?"" Sharon and her family are struggling to pay for her elderly mother's care after the money put together from selling the family home ran out. She says the money spent on her mother's care has gone well beyond the proposed cap. You can watch her talking about her situation, below. This video can not be played Sharon says her mother has given everything she's got for her care Some carers who look after their family members feel they have been ignored by the government's proposals. Norman Couch lives in East Sussex where he cares for his mother after she had a series of strokes which left her with limited mental capacity and movement in just one arm. He gets help from a carer three times a day for half an hour. ""This policy will not help me or fund the little help I get from carers - either me or my mother will still pay for it."" He gave up his job to look after his mother and he says family carers are saving the NHS Â£20,000 in looking after loved ones but ""we don't get the help"". ""It's a missed opportunity by the government - all they have done is kick the can down the road."" What is happening to the cap on care costs?

"Pussycat Dolls star Nicole Scherzinger has rejected claims that she went back on a deal to perform in a reunion tour, branding them ""ludicrous and false"". The singer is being sued by the band's choreographer and founder Robin Antin for allegedly reneging on a previously-announced tour, it emerged this week. But Scherzinger's lawyer has now said any such obligations ""simply do not exist"". Howard King called the legal case ""a desperate attempt to divert blame"". ""Robin will fail in her efforts to trade on Nicole's hard-earned success to pull herself out of a deep financial hole she has created by her own poor business and professional decisions,"" Mr King said in a statement given to the BBC. ""Nicole loves and respects the PCD fans and hopes to one day be back on stage performing the group's amazing hits for them... Sadly, this will not happen under these circumstances."" According to legal papers filed by Antin, Scherzinger asked to renegotiate the reunion agreement to give her creative control and a larger share in the group's new business venture. In November 2019, a decade after the Pussycat Dolls split, the groupannounced they would reform for a live tour. Five of the six Dolls would reunite - with Scherzinger joined by Ashley Roberts, Carmit Bachar, Kimberly Wyatt and Jessica Sutta to perform hits like Buttonz, Don't Cha and Jai Ho at a series of live UK shows. The Pussycat Dolls were pictured together in Leicester Square in 2019 as they announced their reunion tour Court papers show that Scherzinger agreed to be an ""active partner"" in the tour, which included making up to 45 live appearances with the group. The lawsuit,filed on Friday at Los Angeles Superior Court,,externalincludes a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), a short-form agreement drawn up and signed in advance of the tour's announcement. The MoU shows that Roberts, Wyatt and Sutta would each receive 12.5% of net profits from the tour. Antin, who is described as the ""chief executive officer, director and sole owner of PCD"" would also receive 12.5%. Bachar, who left the group in 2008 before their second album was released but was set to return for the reunion, would receive 5% of the takings. As the lead singer and face of the recording group, Scherzinger stood to make the most, with a 32.5% share. However, the Covid-19 pandemic struck before the tour could take place, and the band announced they would reschedule the live dates in the future, when it was safe to do so. The Pussycat Dolls had UK number one hits with Stickwitu and Don't Cha In addition to her earnings from the tour, Scherzinger would be given a 49% stake in a new Pussycat Dolls business venture called PCD Worldwide, while Antin had a 51% share. Scherzinger was awarded her share of the company in exchange for her participation in the reunion tour. The court papers indicate that PCD Worldwide would manage the Pussycat Dolls brand in the future, including any new projects, such as putting together a ""new generation"" of Pussycat Dolls. The court papers say Scherzinger initially agreed to the 49% share in PCD Worldwide in 2019, but allegedly later said she wanted to increase that to 75%. According to the papers, Scherzinger emailed to Antin in April 2021 saying she would refuse to take part in the reunion tour unless the contracts were renegotiated to increase her share in the company. Scherzinger cited the ""growth of her personal brand"" and the ""opportunities she would have to forego to continue to engage in the partnership"" with Antin and the band as her reason for demanding a bigger share. The lead singer is the biggest breakout star of the group. Scherzinger enjoyed a successful solo career in the early 2010s, starred in West End shows, and became a judge on TV competitions including The X Factor and The Masked Singer USA. Scherzinger is the biggest breakout star of the group Antin refused to meet this demand, which the lawsuit describes as ""extortion"", saying Scherzinger was already contractually obliged to take part in the reunion tour under the MoU she had signed two years earlier. The stand-off has prevented the Pussycat Dolls reunion tour dates from being rescheduled, which will cost the band financially unless a solution is found. The documents show Live Nation invested $600,000 (Â£434,000) to partner with the group in advance of the reunion, which the tour company will demand is returned if the concerts do not go ahead. In his statement in response to the legal action, Scherzinger's lawyer said: ""Prior to Nicole's involvement, trading on Nicole's name without her consent, Robin borrowed (and spent) $600,000 from Live Nation that she won't or can't repay. ""Nicole has invested her own funds in excess of $150,000 in support of a potential PCD reunion that has now been made impossible by Robin's actions (including the public release of the group members' confidential financial information).""

"This video can not be played Energy firm apologises for price hike Firmus energy has announced gas tariffs in the Ten Towns Network area will increase by 35% from 1 October. It says this reflects the increase in gas commodity prices which, it says, have risen by 170% since April 2021. The Consumer Council says the news will affect approximately 55,000 domestic customers. It means the yearly gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter will rise by about Â£182 per year, the council said. The Ten Towns Network area includes Antrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Craigavon , Limavady, Londonderry and Newry, More than 25 other towns in surrounding areas are also included. Customers in the Greater Belfast area will not be affected by Wednesday's news, although an announcement regarding tariffs in this area is expected in the coming weeks. ""We are very sorry to have to make this announcement as the last thing we want is to have to increase our prices,"" said the firm's managing director Michael Scott. ""However, given the massive increases in the cost of purchasing natural gas on the global markets, it is simply unavoidable, as these costs are totally beyond our control. ""We want to assure our customers that we will continue to monitor and review our tariffs to ensure customers are getting the best prices possible. As soon as we can lower our prices again, we will do so without delay"". Megan Potts, a single mother living in Bangor, says she has already been living hand-to-mouth. ""People talk about this decision between heat and eat and it's real. I am now getting to experience that on a whole new level. ""My electricity is actually about to go up. I dare say my gas rates will probably go up as well. Everything is going up."" Director of Infrastructure with the Consumer Council Peter McClenaghan said: ""The size of the Firmus energy price increase will shock consumers, make household budgeting more challenging, and is particularly difficult as consumers have no option to switch supplier. SSE Airtricity natural gas prices to rise by 21.8% ""This Firmus energy increase follows rises in electricity, grocery, and fuel costs and is particularly bad news for consumers in vulnerable situations as it will coincide with the end of the furlough scheme, the removal of the Universal Credit uplift, and the start of winter,"" he added Firmus energyis regulated by the Utility Regulator and comes after SSE Airtricity put prices up last week.

"Support for pupils who have special needs is ""beyond crisis"" in England and ""sucking money from budgets"" for all children, a report says. Nearly all schools (97%) responding to a survey by a head teachers' union said they received insufficient funding to support pupils who had special needs. The National Association of Head Teachers says funding has to rise so all pupils can be supported to learn. The government said its review of the system aimed to improve things. Funding for higher-level needs was rising 9.6% in 2022-23 and the Department for Education was providing Â£42m to projects for pupils who had special educational needs and disabilities (Send). But the NAHT report, based on a survey of 1,500 head teachers, suggests nearly a third of schools have cut services in the past year. Unlawful practice and buck-passing over special needs - MPs Special needs shortfalls 'causing misery' Special needs pupils without care plans 'vulnerable' And the starkest findings relate to funding for education for pupils who have Send. ""Special needs is beyond crisis in schools - it is sucking the money from budgets,"" Lesley Roberts, head teacher of a Berkshire primary, said. Simon Kidwell, head teacher of Hartford Manor Primary School, in Cheshire, said: ""The moment we get a child moving to us with recognised special needs, we are already in deficit."" This is because schools are required by local authorities to show they are spending the equivalent of 15 hours teaching assistant time -Â£6,000 in the case of Hartford Manor Primary on an pupil with an EHCR before they can get any extra money. And one pupil now attended a residential care setting, which may well have been avoidable if they had not been refused the early help the school requested at age seven. Separately, parents and carers of children who have special needs have written to the prime minister, demanding better in-school provision. They are concerned the government review has had little input from affected families and may actually weaken the law, which the Department for Education denies. Let Us Learn Too campaign co-founder Hayley Harding said: ""Before my son was diagnosed with autism, I would never have believed the fight that families have to go to just to enable their children to learn, in England. ""The right laws are there but unfortunately many local authorities blatantly ignore them, leaving many children unable to go to school. ""This review is the perfect opportunity to rectify this and introduce accountability."" Jason says daughter, Aime, just wants to go to school Jason Bailey's daughter, Aime, is autistic - and the anxiety her condition causes leads to reflex anoxic seizures, during which her heart briefly stops. Her local authority said she had no medical need for an education health and care plan (EHCP) - but no school would admit her without additional support, so the 12-year-old attends a unit offering short-term provision for children too ill for mainstream education. Jason feels fortunate Aime has a place there - but the curriculum is very narrow and she is in a class of three, so it is hard to make friends. ""She wants to go to school and be able to get a full education, the same as any of her peers, in an environment that is nurturing enough to allow her to attend,"" he says. ""It has been incredibly stressful, the amount of times we have been in tears and Aime's been in tears thinking she is putting pressure on the family. ""There is no understanding from the local authority. ""The review taking place has no direct input from anyone who has involvement with Send children. ""And if you do not have people affected by it, how can you make an effective decision?"" Hunter's local authority initially refused to assess him Nicola Shortt's son Hunter has a complex brain injury and attends a mainstream school, with full-time one-on-one assistance. Their local authority initially refused to assess him - and every year she has to battle to ensure his care plan is fit for purpose, she says, once resorting to paying a solicitor Â£900 to write to the council. ""It is exhausting - and it doesn't end,"" she says. ""Services for disabled children in general are just massively underfunded and we have seen cuts with successive governments to the point where service delivery is not viable. ""Parents have to keep going round and round this process or have the financial means to use solicitors."" NAHT general secretary Paul Whiteman said despite the rhetoric on extra investment, school budgets were under enormous pressure. ""A far more ambitious programme of investment is required from the government if schools are going to be able to deliver the education that the current generation of pupils need and deserve,"" he added. Labour shadow education secretary Kate Green said schools were having to make cuts because of the government's record of underfunding education. Local council bosses called for reforms to ensure special-needs funding was sustainable.

"Rents outside London are soaring at their fastest rate in more than a decade, according to a property website. Zoopla said private rental prices across the UK increased by 5% in the 12 months to the end of July - adding Â£456 a year to the average tenant's bill. The 5% jump is the biggest recorded since Zoopla's index started in 2008. The firm said it was down to increased demand for city living amid limited supply. As lockdown restrictions have eased and businesses have reopened in city centres, there has been a marked return to more built-up areas, it said. In August, the stock of property available to rent outside the capital was about a third below typical levels, while supply was already under pressure. As a result, average rents for the UK, excluding London, stand at Â£790 per month, up from Â£752 a year ago. Zoopla's head of research, Grainne Gilmore, said: ""The strong levels of rental demand seen across the UK during August will moderate in line with seasonal trends, but overall demand for rental property is likely to remain higher than usual in the coming months, amid this swing back to city life."" She cautioned that the market would be likely to depend on the path of the Covid-19 virus and any potential lockdown restrictions being re-introduced. ""But given no deviation from the current landscape, the demand for rental property, coupled with lower levels of supply, will continue to put upward pressure on rents,"" she added. House prices at new high but pace of growth slows Why rent control isnât working in Sweden Where can I afford to live? Inner cities across the UK, such as Edinburgh, have seen the highest growth in demand, although Zoopla's data showed London saw a decline of -3.8% in July on an annual basis. But competition remains fierce for properties, the platform said, with rents now typically agreed within just 15 days of a property being listed. Halifax, the UK's biggest mortgage lender, recently saidthat while house prices hit a record high in August, the annual pace of growth in property values slowed. It said, however, that the broader economic picture was positive, with high job vacancies and consumer confidence returning, which benefited the overall housing market.

"Boris Johnson has taken questions from MPs in the first PMQs since the Parliament's summer break He defended the new health and social care tax announced on Tuesday, saying it will help deal with the NHS backlog and 'catastrophic' care costs But Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said the PM's plan imposed an unfair tax on working people The SNP's Ian Blackford also branded the tax 'regressive' MPs will vote at 19:00 BST on whether to introduce the tax, which will start as a 1.25% rise to National Insurance Care providers have said the changes fail to deliver real reforms needed in the social care system The Institute for Fiscal Studies says tax increases under this government will be the highest in 40 years Jennifer Scott, Sinead Wilson and Johanna Howitt We'll pause our coverage from the Commons for now.

asked if Labour would oppose the new health and social care levy. On the assumption Sir Keir would refuse to back it, the PM
came equipped with a slogan: ""vote Labour, wait longer."" Following a degree of agreement during the Covid crisis,

With PMQs now over, political attentions turn to the debate this afternoon on the government's tax changes, where MPs will get to air their views more fully on the plans. We expect the debate to start around 13:45 BST, and it should continue up until 19:00 when voting is due to start. You can follow the debate on our live page covering all the updates on the new health and social care tax here. Minister for social care, Helen Whately, is on BBC 2's Politics Live. She is asked if the Â£86,000 cap on social care costs will be applied retrospectively, to benefit those people who are already in the system and funding their own care. She says the cap will not come in until October 2023. ""This is a big reform. I would love to turn it on tomorrow"" she says but it ""can't happen overnight"". The government is not ducking the challenges she argues but there are ""complexities that take time to implement"". Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor There were loud cheers for the prime minister when he got to his feet for PMQs.  The chamber once again packed, now that the social distancing measures have been lifted. And Boris Johnson certainly didnât get much stick about the new tax rise from
his own side - probably because most MPs have plenty of constituents waiting
for NHS treatment. And of course workers wonât see the difference on payslips
for several months. In the final question of the session, Tory MP Peter Bone brings attention to bill he is presenting to the Commons on Friday. The Asylum Seekers Return To Safe Country Bill aims to send people back to the last safe country they travelled through before seeking asylum in the UK. Bone says the bill would ""end the problem of people coming across the Channel"", and asks Johnson to urge his colleagues to back it. The PM doesn't go that far, but says the government's new Sovereign Borders Bill will ensure there is ""a price to pay"" for people coming to the country illegally. Labour's Gareth Thomas goes back to the issue of social care and says working people who are graduates -  such as newly qualified nurses -  will face a marginal tax rate of almost 50% under the government's plans. Aren't the less well-off paying more so ""his privileged friends pay less"", he asks. The PM says this is wrong. The highest-earning households will pay 40 times more than the poorest. This measure funds pay for nurses, he argues, which is ""why it is so astonishing"" that Labour would vote against it, he says. Labour's Peter Kyle gets into the popularity of Johnson's cabinet colleague during his question. He says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has a net approval rating amongst Tory supporters of minus 53, so asks: ""Can the prime minister get to his feet, put his hand on his heart and promise the country, this House and his own supporters that is he right person for job and up to the job?"" Johnson says the education secretary had done a ""heroic job"" during the pandemic, dealing with ""very difficult circumstances"". And he attacks Labour for not ""having the guts to say schools are safe"" to return to sooner. Tory Lee Anderson is next up, telling the House there are ""thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants landing on our shores every month"", referring to the issue ofsmall boats coming to the Kent coastline. He asks the PM: ""When are we going to take some direct action and send the boats straight back?"" Johnson says he shares the ""indignation"" of his colleague, and attacks the ""cruel behaviour of gangsters and criminal masterminds"" who are taking money from ""desperate, frightened people"" seeking safety. But he adds that Home Secretary Priti Patel is ""dealing with it in the best possible way"" by working with her French counterparts to ensure those boats never leave French shores. Labour's Emma Lewell-Buck raises the issue of non-British nationals stranded in Afghanistan. She says one of her constituents waited hours on a government  helpline to talk to someone for advice only to hear the call handler laugh and say they were having to lie to people and give them false hope because ""the whole thing is an entire scam"". Who in government is responsible for it she asks? The PM says the whole country should be proud of what the UK has done to help people in Afghanistan and more than 15,000 people have already been welcomed to this country. He says he is sorry to hear about the particular case she raises and vows to take it up. Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake brings up the ""widespread concerns"" over the HGV drivers ""crisis"", which is leading to shortages on our shelves. He says he has been contacted by drivers who believe the government's temporary measure of increasing the number of hours they can work will ""fail to solve the problem"", and instead working conditions needed to be improved. Johnson says the government is working with the industry to get more people into the sector, including increasing test centre capacities and apprenticeships. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey, who is also carer for his disabled son, says yesterday's social care plan forgot family carers who just want a fair deal. Will the PM raise carers' allowance he says and change employment law so families can balance their responsibilities with work? Why does the PM keep ignoring carers and taking them for granted, he adds. The PM says everyone acknowledges the ""massive debt"" owed to carers and he wants to thank them for everything they do. But the plan will bring changes across the board he argues and bring dignity and progression for care workers. Conservative MP David Jones moves on to a familiar topic - Brexit. He says the extension of grace periods to help stop trade issues across the Irish Sea is welcome. But, he adds, ""it does not amount to a permanent fix of Northern Ireland Protocol"". The PM agrees, and accuses the EU of not applying the protocol - agreed as part of the Brexit trade negotiations - in a way that protects the Good Friday Agreement ""in all its aspects"". ""We should sort it out,"" he adds. As we expected PMQs, has so far been dominiated by the government's promise to overhaul of the way social care is funded in England. So what's going to happen and how will it be paid for?  Read our recap of the main points here. SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, is up now. He says the PM's health and social care plans impose a regressive tax on millions of Scottish workers without consultation. This is balancing the books on the backs of the poor and the young he argues. The PM says people have told him they want more funding for the NHS. Johnson says all the SNP can talk about is another referendum, and not the priorities of people in the country. This is a return to austerity, says Blackford, with ""no chance"" of an economic recovery. Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor Thrust of Starmerâs attack is that the wrong people are
being asked to pay for this rise in spending and it wonât achieve its aim
anyway. But Johnson canât disguise his delight that Labour are opposing his
plans for the NHS. In his final question, Starmer says the PM is out of touch with the reality of workers. He tells the story of Rosie, a single mother working on the minimum wage in a nursing home. ""She will lose Â£87 a month becaue of the cut in universal credit,"" says Starmer, ""and will now be hit with a National Insurance tax rise"". He accuses the Conservatives of underfunding the NHS over the past decade and cutting social care, while ""always putting rich mates and donors before working people"". But Johnson calls it the ""same old nonsense from Labour"". He says he has ""every sympathy for Rosie"", but the best way to help her and other families was through building a ""strong and dynamic  economy"", which he insists his government is doing. Starmer says the PM can't even say his plan will clear the NHS backlog. They are breaking their manifesto promises for this, he says. 2.5 million working families face a double whammy of a National Insurance rise and a universal credit cut Starmer says. The PM says he is proud of what the government has done through the pandemic to help working families. Ministers believe in higher wages and better skills, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Yevgeny Zinichev was filmed inspecting the Arctic drill on Tuesday Russia's Emergencies Minister Yevgeny Zinichev has died in an accident during a big Arctic civil defence exercise. The ministry said Zinichev, 55, had died in the Norilsk area while trying to save someone's life. A cameraman had fallen off a cliff during an interview, according to Margarita Simonyan, the head of Russian broadcaster RT. ""He and the cameraman were on the edge of a cliff. The cameraman slipped and fell into the water,"" she said. ""Zinichev rushed after the fallen man and died after hitting a protruding rock."" The cameraman, later named as film director Alexander Melnik, 63, also died. Russian media said the accident happened at the Kitabo Oron waterfall in the Putorana nature reserve in northern Siberia, some 165km (100 miles) west of Norilsk. Zinichev had been emergencies minister since 2018 and for years was reportedly a key member of President Vladimir Putin's security detail. For most of his career he worked in state security, beginning with the Soviet KGB and eventually rising to number two in Russia's federal security service in 2016. A Kremlin statement said Mr Putin had shared many years working with Zinichev and spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was a great loss. Melnik was a director and screenwriter and was known for his 2015 Arctic adventure film Territory. The film was shot on the Putorana plateau where he died. He was planning a documentary on the development of the Arctic and Russia's Northern Sea Route. Some 6,000 people were taking part in the large-scale Arctic drill Russian media say they had been filming a training video in the Krasnoyarsk region for the ministry at the time of the accident. Deputy emergencies minister Andrei Gurovich told Rossiya 24 TV that his boss had acted spontaneously ""not like a minister, but like a rescuer. This is how he lived all his life"". Zinichev's body was being flown back to Moscow hours after the accident, which is said to have happened early on Wednesday morning. The unprecedented two-day exercise was organised by Zinichev's department and stretched across seven regions in the Russian Arctic. He said on Tuesday that the ""format, geography and involved units are unique"". They were reportedly ordered by President Putin to prevent crisis situations in the Arctic and involved 6,000 specialists covering a dozen emergency situations. Earlier, the minister had visited a search and rescue team and the site of a new fire station in Norilsk. Minister was filmed before fatal Arctic accident.

"MPs vote by 319 to 248 to raise taxes to fund the NHS and social care There will be a new 1.25% tax on workers and employers to fund health and social care This breaks a Tory manifesto commitment not to increase taxes National Insurance will increase from April 2022, with a separate tax introduced in 2023 It has been criticised by some Conservative backbenchers and opposition parties The amount individuals have to spend on their care will be capped at Â£86,000 - not including accommodation costs Labour says the change ""hammers"" working people, leave people still facing losing their homes to pay for care, and it may not clear NHS backlogs Edited by Rob Corp We've reached the end of the debating, and the subsequent passing of the health and social care levy in the House of Commons, so our live coverage will stop here. Thanks for joining us on what's been a busy day withnews of the tax riseand anoverhaul of the coronavirus foreign travel traffic light system. Your updates were written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans, Mary O'Connor, Justin Parkinson, Kate Whannel and Sinead Wilson. The page was edited by Martha Buckley and Rob Corp. Have a good evening and we will be back with more live updates tomorrow. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on need to address NHS wait times In an interview with the BBC, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted the government must make ""the investment now"" with the health and social care levy if NHS treatment backlogs are to be cleared. He tells the BBC's Health Editor Hugh Pym, that around 9 million NHS treatments could be funded by proposed government investment, but did not give details of targets. The new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and a social care reform is through. The Tories say it will bring an investment of Â£36bn in the health and care system over the next three years. This, according to chief secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay, will pay for the social care system to be reformed ""ending unpredictable and catastrophic care costs faced by thousands and making the system fairer for all"". The new tax means people will no longer pay more than Â£86,000 in care costs - not including food and accommodation - over their lifetime, from October 2023. Labour were against the plan with leader Sir Keir Starmer saying it wasunfair on working people. He says: ""Under his plan, a landlord renting out dozens of properties won't pay a penny more, while their tenants in work will face tax rises of hundreds of pounds a year."" The SNP also opposed the move, with its Westminster leader Ian Blackford calling it a ""regressive tax"" on millions of Scottish workers without consultation. And Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey - who is also a carer for his disabled son - said the plan ""forgot family carers"" who just want ""a fair deal"". We've got the key changeshereand you can work out how it will affect youhere. MPs have voted for an extra tax to fund social care in England - and help the NHS recover after the pandemic. There had been criticism - including from within the Conservative Party - that it will be unfair on younger people and the lower paid. Under the proposals, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April 2022. From April 2023, National Insurance will return to its current rate, and the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. This levy - unlike National Insurance - will also be paid by state pensioners who are still working. National Insurance is a UK-wide tax - and while Boris Johnson's announcement focuses on funding health and social care in England - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional Â£2.2bn to spend on their services. You can read morehere. MPs back the government's plan to raise taxes to fund spending on the NHS and social care. It gets through by 319 votes to 248 - that's a margin of 71. MPs have voted against a Labour amendment calling for an assessment of the plan to bring in a new 1.25% tax for the NHS and social care. They will now go to a vote on the substantive measure. If it goes through National Insurance will increase from April 2022, with a separate tax introduced in 2023 We will bring you the result as soon as we have it. While we wait why not read up on what it could mean:Whatâs the new Health and Social Care tax and how will it affect me? The debate is over after nearly five hours and MPs have gone to vote on a Labour amendment to the government's plan to bring in a new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and social care. Labour want the government to carry out an assessment on what the impact of the tax will be on jobs. We will bring you the result as soon as we have it. Steve Barclay, chief secretary to the Treasury, has been summing up the government's case for introducing a new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and to reform social care. ""The pandemic has put unprecedented pressure on the NHS with the number of people waiting for surgery or treatment in England is now at a record high of 5.5 million and if left unchecked this could rise to 13 million,"" he says. He says at the same time the country is facing a long-standing challenge to the social care system. ""Typically around one in seven must pay over Â£100,000 for care, with bills falling indiscriminately on some of the sickest and most vulnerable in society,"" he says. The government's plan would mean an investment of Â£36bn in the health and care system over the next three years, he says. ""The social care system will finally be reformed ending unpredictable and catastrophic care costs faced by thousands and making the system fairer for all,"" he says. Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson is summing up now. She says while it's been a good debate, what's been most striking is how ""inadequate a basis it has been for a change of this magnitude to the tax system of our country"". There have been a number of ""sharp and insightful"" contributions from Labour MPs, including the point that the measures would not improve the lot of care workers, who were now facing a tax rise, she says. Phillipson cites the views of other MPs that the proposals do not represent a proper plan for the NHS or for social care. ""It is instead a broken promise, two-and-a-half million working households hit by the Tory double whammy of cuts to Universal Credit and an increase in National Insurance,"" she adds. Phillipson reiterates the point that it is ""ludicrous"" that landlords will not have to ""pay a penny"" more under the new tax, but that tenants, many who might be working in the NHS, ""are about to be clobbered by a tax rise"" - adding that about 95% of the revenue will come from taxing workers' wages. She criticises the lack of notice given to MPs to approve the government's plans, saying it lacks the scrutiny needed for plans that have such ""universal"" impact. Phillipson says as well as a ""strong and skilled social care workforce"", Labour would deliver a ""new deal"" for care workers to create a ""well motivated and properly rewarded workforce"" that would give support to unpaid carers. Tory MP Jack Brereton says he has been contacted by hundreds of constituents about the need for more investment in social care and the challenges they face of accessing healthcare and medical treatment. ""No decision to invest more to the scale required is going to be easy - and money must come from somewhere. ""I think what we've arrived at is probably the least worst option. ""The approach taken will ensure this burden is spread as broadly as possible, so all those with earned income streams must contribute and protections are in place to protect those on lowest incomes."" Veteran Conservative MP Peter Bone says the government was ""creating a new tax...without having the detail."" He says: ""Whilst I support the idea of more money for the NHS - and I have no objection to it being done through National Insurance - I absolutely object to saying that this has got anything to do with the care bill because that hasn't been introduced. ""Social care should be paid for separately. There should have been a social care bill, we should have had the bill, we should have been able to debate the principle of that and then immediately afterwards voted on the ways and means but we've got this mixed up."" Conservative MP Huw Merriman reiterates the need to ""act now"" to reform health and social care in England and welcomes the ""decisive action"" being taken by the government. However he says he has concerns around the new tax - with the first being the political difficulty of getting the money initially being funnelled into the NHS into social care. He tells the Commons: ""We know how difficult it is to convince people that a temporary lift to Universal Credit was just temporary, how on earth are we going to challenge the equivalence of Marcus Rashford when it comes to the NHS in persuading people that this wasn't a cut but just a plan for a period of time and then we move the money to social care?"" He also cites the ""inter-generational unfairness"" of expecting young people without a home of their own to fund social care through a hike in National Insurance, rather than the older people with nest eggs or their own homes who would be using the service sooner. Thirdly, he says the Tories will have to look to ""rein in"" public spending and allocate money for the NHS with ""strict criteria"" on how it is going to be spent. Merriman indicates he will support the government in the vote but wants them to look at some of the alternative measures he's suggested. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The emergency of the pandemic, which demanded spending and borrowing that busted all norms, has faded. But the prime minister's fondness for splurging billions when he sees fit has not. The last 24 hours have sealed Boris Johnson's existing reputation: a Conservative who says he'd love low taxes, but when there's spending that he perceives is popular, that affection swiftly disappears. Read Laura's blog in full Tory MP Ben Everitt says he's going to try to be optimistic and pull out the good things in the hard choices the government faces. He says there are never any good options for raising taxes but ""raising taxes on having a job is possibly the thing that should be at the bottom of the list when we look at new areas of income"". He says: ""The Â£86,000 cap needs to be met and tweaked with a regional house price element to recognise that houses are worth more in one area of the country than others."" ""I will vote for this. Our job in this place is to make good laws and we need to do that at every stage and this is a tricky problem."" MPs have been debating a new 1.25% tax - initially through National Insurance - to pay for health and social care for about three and a half hours. Here are some of the main points that have been made:  MPs are expected to vote around 19:00 BST and we will bring you the result as soon as we have it. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says the government's plan for social care fails Labour's two tests - that it will fix the problems in the sector and is being funded in a fair way. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, she says Labour would ask those with the ""broadest shoulders"" to contribute more ""and not just go to those who go out to work and earn a wage"". Asked what taxes Labour would raise in their plan to fix social care, she said the party would set out those details in ""due course"" but that the party would seek to tax ""all forms of income"", not just those who work. Challenged on why ex-Labour PMGordon Brown used National Insurance to increase NHS funding back in 2002, she insists there were ""very different economic circumstances"" back then. She adds that while Brown had ""come forward with a plan"" to cut waiting times and get health spending up to the European average - today's Tory government lacked any ""clear plan"" in its proposals. ""The government can't even say when the backlog of operations will be clear, they can't even say when the money will go into our social care system, and they can't even meet the test that no one will have to sell their home to pay for social care,"" she says. Jim Shannon of the Democratic Unionist Party asks for guarantees that the money Northern Ireland will receive from the tax will be used only to help reform health and social care and not for anything else. Reading from a document, he says Northern Ireland is due to get around Â£420m a year from the new tax, but ""there is no indication that the Northern Ireland executive will be required to spend it on the purpose for which it was raised, since the government, it appears, cannot ring-fence the money"". He asks if Northern Ireland's share can be ring-fenced for health and social care and whether this will apply to all future monies sent there. ""What guarantees do we have that every single employed person, every single pensioner, every single business owner, that their sacrifice will bring about necessary change, and not be lost in the ether of politics at Stormont?"" Conservative Dr Andrew Murrison says this could be a historic moment in which we sort out the problems in health and social care and he will be voting ""enthusiastically"" with the government later. And using National Insurance to raise the extra funds is progressive, he adds. But the challenge for ministers is to turn the money going to providers in to better outcomes for patients, he adds. Improving productivity in the NHS has to be a priority and sickness levels need to be driven down, he argues.  Anna George's 91-year-old mother has been in a British Legion Care Home since October 2019, where she lives in a dementia unit. She says her mother's home was sold to pay the Â£4778.43 cost of her care over a 31-day month. But the family are worried as there is only enough money left to fund 10 more months of care. Anna, 68, who lives in Northamptonshire, says: âWhen we get down to the final Â£23,000 we inform social services and we then pay a percentage to contribute to the continued care. I donât know how much. âItâs pretty scary for us because itâs not that far away now for us now."" She welcomes the new tax, but argues it has come ""too late"" for her family. âMy parents worked hard to own their home and to have something to give their children but their hopes are dashed now. âI know people think this tax is unfair on younger, working people but weâre losing our inheritance. Hopefully, with this new system that wonât happen for the younger generation when they reach the stage in life of needing social care."" Reality Check At prime ministerâs questions, Boris Johnson was asked by
the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, whether his previous guarantee that âno one who needs care has to sell their home to
pay for itâ still stood. Mr Johnson did not confirm whether it did. The pledge was
in the Conservativesâ 2019 manifesto. When the Health Secretary, Sajid Javid, was asked about on
the BBCâs Today programme he said: ""We will also make sure that everyone
is able to access what's called the deferred payment agreement... which means
no one will ever have to sell their housein their life time."" Weâve looked at the pledge, how the language has changed
and whether it can be met under the new plans. You can read what we foundhere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.0980465e-07
"Boris Johnson has taken questions from MPs in the first PMQs since the Parliament's summer break He defended the new health and social care tax announced on Tuesday, saying it will help deal with the NHS backlog and 'catastrophic' care costs But Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said the PM's plan imposed an unfair tax on working people The SNP's Ian Blackford also branded the tax 'regressive' MPs will vote at 19:00 BST on whether to introduce the tax, which will start as a 1.25% rise to National Insurance Care providers have said the changes fail to deliver real reforms needed in the social care system The Institute for Fiscal Studies says tax increases under this government will be the highest in 40 years Jennifer Scott, Sinead Wilson and Johanna Howitt We'll pause our coverage from the Commons for now.

Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Sir Keir Starmer asked two specific questions of the prime
minister, but he didnât receive specific answers. He queried whether the Conservative election promise â that
no-one should  have to sell their home To pay for care â still stood. And he inquired if the extra cash promised for the NHS in
England would clear the backlog. The prime minister sidestepped the questions and instead
asked if Labour would oppose the new health and social care levy. On the assumption Sir Keir would refuse to back it, the PM
came equipped with a slogan: ""vote Labour, wait longer."" Following a degree of agreement during the Covid crisis,
traditional dividing lines were clearly being drawn at PMQs. The prime minister declared that Labour believed in welfare
rather than work. While the Labour leader accused Boris Johnson of
putting his ""rich mates"" ahead of ""working people"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

With PMQs now over, political attentions turn to the debate this afternoon on the government's tax changes, where MPs will get to air their views more fully on the plans. We expect the debate to start around 13:45 BST, and it should continue up until 19:00 when voting is due to start. You can follow the debate on our live page covering all the updates on the new health and social care tax here. Minister for social care, Helen Whately, is on BBC 2's Politics Live. She is asked if the Â£86,000 cap on social care costs will be applied retrospectively, to benefit those people who are already in the system and funding their own care. She says the cap will not come in until October 2023. ""This is a big reform. I would love to turn it on tomorrow"" she says but it ""can't happen overnight"". The government is not ducking the challenges she argues but there are ""complexities that take time to implement"". Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor There were loud cheers for the prime minister when he got to his feet for PMQs.  The chamber once again packed, now that the social distancing measures have been lifted. And Boris Johnson certainly didnât get much stick about the new tax rise from
his own side - probably because most MPs have plenty of constituents waiting
for NHS treatment. And of course workers wonât see the difference on payslips
for several months. In the final question of the session, Tory MP Peter Bone brings attention to bill he is presenting to the Commons on Friday. The Asylum Seekers Return To Safe Country Bill aims to send people back to the last safe country they travelled through before seeking asylum in the UK. Bone says the bill would ""end the problem of people coming across the Channel"", and asks Johnson to urge his colleagues to back it. The PM doesn't go that far, but says the government's new Sovereign Borders Bill will ensure there is ""a price to pay"" for people coming to the country illegally. Labour's Gareth Thomas goes back to the issue of social care and says working people who are graduates -  such as newly qualified nurses -  will face a marginal tax rate of almost 50% under the government's plans. Aren't the less well-off paying more so ""his privileged friends pay less"", he asks. The PM says this is wrong. The highest-earning households will pay 40 times more than the poorest. This measure funds pay for nurses, he argues, which is ""why it is so astonishing"" that Labour would vote against it, he says. Labour's Peter Kyle gets into the popularity of Johnson's cabinet colleague during his question. He says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has a net approval rating amongst Tory supporters of minus 53, so asks: ""Can the prime minister get to his feet, put his hand on his heart and promise the country, this House and his own supporters that is he right person for job and up to the job?"" Johnson says the education secretary had done a ""heroic job"" during the pandemic, dealing with ""very difficult circumstances"". And he attacks Labour for not ""having the guts to say schools are safe"" to return to sooner. Tory Lee Anderson is next up, telling the House there are ""thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants landing on our shores every month"", referring to the issue ofsmall boats coming to the Kent coastline. He asks the PM: ""When are we going to take some direct action and send the boats straight back?"" Johnson says he shares the ""indignation"" of his colleague, and attacks the ""cruel behaviour of gangsters and criminal masterminds"" who are taking money from ""desperate, frightened people"" seeking safety. But he adds that Home Secretary Priti Patel is ""dealing with it in the best possible way"" by working with her French counterparts to ensure those boats never leave French shores. Labour's Emma Lewell-Buck raises the issue of non-British nationals stranded in Afghanistan. She says one of her constituents waited hours on a government  helpline to talk to someone for advice only to hear the call handler laugh and say they were having to lie to people and give them false hope because ""the whole thing is an entire scam"". Who in government is responsible for it she asks? The PM says the whole country should be proud of what the UK has done to help people in Afghanistan and more than 15,000 people have already been welcomed to this country. He says he is sorry to hear about the particular case she raises and vows to take it up. Plaid Cymru MP Ben Lake brings up the ""widespread concerns"" over the HGV drivers ""crisis"", which is leading to shortages on our shelves. He says he has been contacted by drivers who believe the government's temporary measure of increasing the number of hours they can work will ""fail to solve the problem"", and instead working conditions needed to be improved. Johnson says the government is working with the industry to get more people into the sector, including increasing test centre capacities and apprenticeships. Lib Dem leader Ed Davey, who is also carer for his disabled son, says yesterday's social care plan forgot family carers who just want a fair deal. Will the PM raise carers' allowance he says and change employment law so families can balance their responsibilities with work? Why does the PM keep ignoring carers and taking them for granted, he adds. The PM says everyone acknowledges the ""massive debt"" owed to carers and he wants to thank them for everything they do. But the plan will bring changes across the board he argues and bring dignity and progression for care workers. Conservative MP David Jones moves on to a familiar topic - Brexit. He says the extension of grace periods to help stop trade issues across the Irish Sea is welcome. But, he adds, ""it does not amount to a permanent fix of Northern Ireland Protocol"". The PM agrees, and accuses the EU of not applying the protocol - agreed as part of the Brexit trade negotiations - in a way that protects the Good Friday Agreement ""in all its aspects"". ""We should sort it out,"" he adds. As we expected PMQs, has so far been dominiated by the government's promise to overhaul of the way social care is funded in England. So what's going to happen and how will it be paid for?  Read our recap of the main points here. SNP Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, is up now. He says the PM's health and social care plans impose a regressive tax on millions of Scottish workers without consultation. This is balancing the books on the backs of the poor and the young he argues. The PM says people have told him they want more funding for the NHS. Johnson says all the SNP can talk about is another referendum, and not the priorities of people in the country. This is a return to austerity, says Blackford, with ""no chance"" of an economic recovery. Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor Thrust of Starmerâs attack is that the wrong people are
being asked to pay for this rise in spending and it wonât achieve its aim
anyway. But Johnson canât disguise his delight that Labour are opposing his
plans for the NHS. In his final question, Starmer says the PM is out of touch with the reality of workers. He tells the story of Rosie, a single mother working on the minimum wage in a nursing home. ""She will lose Â£87 a month becaue of the cut in universal credit,"" says Starmer, ""and will now be hit with a National Insurance tax rise"". He accuses the Conservatives of underfunding the NHS over the past decade and cutting social care, while ""always putting rich mates and donors before working people"". But Johnson calls it the ""same old nonsense from Labour"". He says he has ""every sympathy for Rosie"", but the best way to help her and other families was through building a ""strong and dynamic  economy"", which he insists his government is doing. Starmer says the PM can't even say his plan will clear the NHS backlog. They are breaking their manifesto promises for this, he says. 2.5 million working families face a double whammy of a National Insurance rise and a universal credit cut Starmer says. The PM says he is proud of what the government has done through the pandemic to help working families. Ministers believe in higher wages and better skills, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Maura McGoldrick was vaccinated in England and in Scotland A woman who was vaccinated in England and Scotland says she cannot get an accurate vaccination certificate because of issues with data-sharing across health services. Maura McGoldrick, 21, received her first dose in London and her second in Glasgow, where she lives. However, her vaccination record only shows her having received one dose. The fourth-year student at the University of Edinburgh is concerned others may be similarly affected. The Scottish government said it had been working to ""align"" vaccination data from across the UK. The certificates are necessary for travelling abroad and could be used as part of a passport scheme toallow people into nightclubs and large events. Scotland's system has already seen problems including arecent security glitchand people beingdenied use of the pass in certain countries. It has only recently been made available in the form of a QR code - despite a digital passport being widely used across Europe for months. While travelling to London over the summer, Ms McGoldrick said she heard news of the push for young people to visit drop-in vaccine clinics - and attended a local clinic the following day. She said the medics at the centre were unable to find her NHS records, but took her name and address and gave her a card which stated the batch of the vaccine she had just received. NHS England issue patients with cards detailing the vaccine batch number To be safe, Ms McGoldrick said she quickly phoned NHS Inform to let them know she had received her first jab outside of Scotland and was told her records would be updated. However, when she received her second dose in Glasgow in August, she was told the first dose was missing from her medical records. How do I get a vaccine certificate in Scotland? What do we know about the vaccine passport? Double-jabbed students denied quarantine exemption She requested her vaccine certificate by post and, again, the document showed one dose issued in Glasgow. ""Because there have been other things going on, it's just compounded general stress and been emotionally draining,"" said Ms McGoldrick. ""I know rationally it's not the end of the world and I'm very privileged even to just have the vaccine. ""But I'm now at the stage where there is no-one else for me to call, no more leads for me to pursue - it's a bit of a hopeless situation."" Ms McGoldrick has spent more than two weeks calling NHS Inform and her GP in order to resolve the matter. She said her GP managed to acquire information on her vaccination in London. However, she said NHS Inform staff told her there was no data-sharing mechanism between them and NHS England and they would need to request the information from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. The Scottish government denied the claim about data sharing, saying it has worked to ""align"" vaccination records from different UK nations. A spokesperson said: ""We are aware some people have encountered problems but it's untrue to say there is no data-sharing and we are working closely with other nations to resolve the issue. ""We have a process in place for sharing data between England and Scotland and continue to work with international stakeholders to improve the transfer of data across borders. ""Updated NHS Inform guidance contains guidance on what to do if you have been vaccinated abroad or have been vaccinated in different parts of the UK."" What does the NHS say about vaccine status and the Common Travel Area?,external NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde gave the BBC contradictory information, saying that NHS Scotland certificates ""can only contain information on vaccines administered in Scotland"". It has not responded to a further query. Ms McGoldrick is currently trying to get the health board to share her GP's information with NHS Inform - but said other people in her position may not be able to chase it up. She said: ""Selfishly speaking, I'm trying to sort this out for myself but I'm in the fortunate position where I have time to chase this up. ""But I know there are other people in the same position - NHS Inform said they had other people call about this but assumed they sorted it out. People have probably just given up as it will take more time and effort that they have to give right now."" Vaccine certificates with QR codes are widely used across European countries As a result of her vaccine status issue, Ms McGoldrick has postponed her October plans to travel to Copenhagen - partly for leisure, but also to do work experience related to her university course in international relations. She said she thought she was doing the right thing by getting her vaccine as quickly as possible, but the bureaucracy and cancelled plans that resulted had been a ""bit of a blow"". ""It's the fact that we've been cooped up for so long,"" she said. ""I felt when I got two doses I had done everything I was supposed to do."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"A group of people are brought ashore at Dover by Border Force officers The home secretary is expected to hold talks with her French counterpart about the number of migrants crossing the English Channel to the UK. Priti Patel and Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin are both due to attend a meeting of G7 ministers in London. She has warned that Britain could withhold Â£54.2m it hadpromised to pay Franceto help deal with the problem, unless more boats are intercepted. The Home Office said 785 people crossed the channel in small boats on Monday. More than 12,600 people have made the dangerous journey so far this year. The rise in the number of migrants making the crossing in recent days comes after several weeks of unsettled weather. Back in July the UK agreed to pay France to step up patrols along the French coast in order to deter crossings. On Tuesday, the prime minister's official spokesman said UK and French officials were ""working on the implementation"" of the deal and that ""significant"" funding provided in November had already led to increased patrols and ""enhanced intelligence"". He said that following a period of poor weather there had been an increase in crossings but warned that the journey remained ""extremely dangerous"". ""We remain determined to fix the broken asylum system and break the business model of people smugglers who put lives at risk, and welcome people through safe and legal routes,"" he added. Migrants continue to arrive ahead of France talks Patel defends latest Channel crossings deal What happens to migrants who reach the UK? And speaking during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons, Mr Johnson said efforts to stop the illegal crossings of the English Channel depended ""to a large extent"" on the ability of the French authorities. He was responding to a question from the Conservative MP, Lee Anderson, who urged ministers to ""take some direct action and send the boats straight back"" because ""thousands and thousands of illegal immigrants"" are landing on Kent's shores every month. The PM said it was a ""perennial problem"" and the home secretary was ""dealing with it in the best possible way, which is to make sure that they don't leave those French shores"". He added: ""Clearly, as time goes on and this problem continues, we are going to have to make sure that we use every possible tactic at our disposal to stop what I think is a vile trade and a manipulation of people's hopes."" But speaking earlier on Radio 4's Today programme, Calais MP Pierre-Henri Dumont, said ""nothing"" can stop migrants crossing the Channel and it is ""impossible"" for French police to patrol the whole shoreline. ""The fact is, we've got 300 to 400 kilometres of shore to monitor every day and every night and it's quite impossible to have police officers every 100 metres because of the length of the shore"" he said. There are ""numerous causes"" why people attempt the journey in the first place, including the warmer weather, migrants being more likely to speak English and the perception that it is easier to find work in the UK, he said. He added: ""We have more and more patrols. ""The money that was promised to be given by the UK government to France is set to maintain this number of patrols that we already doubled a few weeks ago."" Ahead of the meeting, Amnesty International UK's refugee and migrant rights director, Steve Valdez-Symonds, said without a change of policy by the government, the talks were a ""lost cause"". ""The home secretary can keep on spending public money, but nothing is going to change unless she is prepared to change her failed and unworkable policies"" he said. ""People have every right to seek asylum in the UK,"" he said, adding ""they only make dangerous journeys and rely on smugglers because there are no safe alternatives made available to them"". Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called for the government to focus on finding a ""workable solution with the French authorities, tackling vile people-smuggling gangs and properly managing safe routes to prevent people risking their lives"". If migrants are found in UK national waters, it is likely they will be brought to a British port If they are in international waters, the UK will work with French authorities to decide where to take them Each country has search-and-rescue zones An EU law called Dublin III allows asylum seekers to be transferred back to the first member state they were proven to have entered but the UK is no longer part of this arrangement and has not agreed a new scheme to replace it The Â£54.2m deal doubles the number of police patrolling France's beaches, funds improved intelligence sharing and introduces better technology to target the gangs who organise the crossings It follows a Â£28.2m deal last November that failed to limit crossings THE GREATEST PHARAOH:Who was Ramesses The Great and why was he beloved?

"The 737 Max was cleared to fly again late last year, after being grounded since March 2019 Boeing's board of directors must face a lawsuit from shareholders over two fatal crashes involving its 737 Max plane, a US judge has ruled. Morgan Zurn said the first crash was a ""red flag"" about a key safety system on the aircraft ""that the board should have heeded but instead ignored"". She said the real victims were the dead and their families but investors had also lost billions of dollars. Boeing said it would ""consider next steps"". In her rulingthe Delaware judge said,external: ""While it may seem callous in the face of [the families'] losses, corporate law recognizes another set of victims: Boeing as an enterprise, and its stockholders. ""Stockholders have come to this court claiming Boeing's directors and officers failed them in overseeing mission-critical airplane safety to protect enterprise and stockholder value."" Boeing to pay $2.5bn over 737 Max conspiracy Boeing 737 Max: What went wrong? The crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia in 2018 and 2019 killed all 346 people on board, leading to the 737 Max being grounded around the world. Investigations later found a flaw in an automated flight control system, known as MCAS, was at fault. In January, Boeing paid $2.5bn to settle criminal charges it concealed information about changes to MCAS from safety officials, contributing to the crashes. But it still faces civil lawsuits from families along with the latest action from shareholders. On Tuesday, Vice Chancellor Zurn dismissed some of the investors' claims, including one regarding a decision to award former chief executive Dennis Muilenburg a $60m retirement package after he was fired. However, the judge said another claim about board member oversight could go ahead. Shares in the plane maker slumped following the accidents and are yet to fully recover. A Boeing spokesperson said: ""We are disappointed in the court's decision to allow the plaintiffs' case to proceed past this preliminary stage of litigation. ""We will review the opinion closely over the coming days as we consider next steps."" The Max was cleared to fly in the US in November 2020, and in Europe and Canada in January this year. It remains grounded in China. The crashes have already cost Boeing about $20bn in fines, cancelled orders and other costs.

"Chow Hang Tung, a human rights lawyer, was arrested earlier this year and charged with promoting unauthorised assembly Several members of a pro-democracy Hong Kong organisation have been arrested after their group was accused of working as a ""foreign agent"". The Hong Kong Alliance is known for organising the city's famed annual vigil for victims of the deadly 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. Pro-democracy activist and barrister Chow Hang Tung was among the arrested. The arrests were made under the national security law, which has a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Tiananmen HK activist arrested on anniversary Hong Kong police's national security unit had earlier requested that the Hong Kong Alliance hand over information, reportedly including personal details of all members since the group's founding and financial records. On Tuesday, the deadline for the request, the alliance members handed over a letter explaining their refusal to cooperate. The next morning, police officers arrested four members of the alliance's standing committee at their homes or offices. ""We are going to respond, to say that we feel you have no legal grounds for your demands, so we are just going to ignore you,"" Ms Chow, the vice chairperson of the alliance, had told AFP on her way to the police station. Police have said that those who fail to comply with their request could face up to six months in jail and a fine of HK$100,000 ($12,800, Â£9,300). Ms Chow, a human rights lawyer, was arrested earlier this year and charged with promoting unauthorised assembly. She was later released on bail. She was due on Wednesday to represent an opposition politician charged under the national security law at a bail hearing, but was arrested at her office before she could appear in court. China recently imposed a broadly-worded national security law in Hong Kong that criminalises secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. Critics say it is aimed at crushing dissent but China says it is meant to maintain stability. In June, Chow Hang Tung spoke to BBC Chinese explaining why she was encouraging those in Hong Kong to remember the Tiananmen crackdown.

"The countries most vulnerable to climate change are calling for an ""emergency pact"" to tackle rising temperatures. The group wants all countries to agree radical steps to avoid ""climate catastrophe"" at the upcoming COP26 meeting in Glasgow. Green campaignersare urging a postponement of the gathering, citing problems with vaccines for delegates. TheClimate Vulnerable Forum,external(CVF) says the event is critical and cannot wait. Weather-related disasters increase five-fold Climate change summit 'make or break' for planet UK fires up coal power plant as gas prices soar Representing some 1.2 billion people, the CVF consists of countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Pacific. The group has been key in pushing the rest of the world to accept the idea of keeping the rise in global temperatures to under 1.5C this century. This was incorporated into the Paris agreement in 2015. Recent research from theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Changesuggests that the threshold will be passed in little over a decade at current rates of carbon emissions. In less than two months, global leaders will gather in Glasgow forCOP26, the most critical meeting on climate change since Paris. Ahead of the Glasgow meeting, the CVF has issued a manifesto for what the conference must deliver to keep the planet safe and protect the most vulnerable. Environmental groups have suggested postponing the meeting, on the grounds that vaccine distribution is inequitable and that delegates from poorer countries face huge bills for quarantine hotels when they arrive in the UK. In Bangladesh, erosion continues as river levels keep rising However, the CVF member states insist the meeting must go ahead in person, and are calling for support and ""facilitated access"" to ensure inclusive participation. The UK government has responded to these calls by agreeing to pay the quarantine hotel expenses of any delegate, observer or media from a developing country. The vulnerable group says that progress on climate change has stalled and COP26 should move forward with what it terms a ""climate emergency pact"". This would see every country put forward a new climate plan every year between now and 2025. At present, signatories of the Paris agreement are only obliged to put forward new plans every five years. The vulnerable nations say that richer countries must fulfil their obligations to deliver $100bn in climate finance per year over the 2020-24 period. A man watches as the sea rushes in on the Marshall Islands The CVF nations want this money to be split 50-50 between cutting carbon and helping countries adapt to the threat posed by rising temperatures. The countries also want the UK to ""take full responsibility"" for this aspect of the negotiations, saying it is vital to restore confidence in the Paris pact. Among the other areas that the most vulnerable nations want to see progress on is the question of debt-for-climate swaps. Many of the world's poorest countries have large debt burdens, and these have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic which has stretched finances even further. In a debt-for-climate swap, a country can reduce what it owes to international creditors by directing the debt service payments to fund renewable energy or greater protection for nature. Many campaigners have argued that the COP26 meeting should be postponed One such restructuring was recentlyannounced by Belize,externalwhere the debt money will now go to support marine conservation projects instead. ""Vulnerable countries have unique needs - and public-private collaboration will be key to addressing them,"" said Nigel Topping, who's the UK's high-level climate action champion for COP26. ""Whether it is in debt for nature swaps such as the recent Belize announcement or in increasing public sector capability to structure investment projects to attract private finance, the aim is to accelerate progress in this area so that 2022 becomes the year of climate action solidarity.""

"MPs vote by 319 to 248 to raise taxes to fund the NHS and social care There will be a new 1.25% tax on workers and employers to fund health and social care This breaks a Tory manifesto commitment not to increase taxes National Insurance will increase from April 2022, with a separate tax introduced in 2023 It has been criticised by some Conservative backbenchers and opposition parties The amount individuals have to spend on their care will be capped at Â£86,000 - not including accommodation costs Labour says the change ""hammers"" working people, leave people still facing losing their homes to pay for care, and it may not clear NHS backlogs Edited by Rob Corp We've reached the end of the debating, and the subsequent passing of the health and social care levy in the House of Commons, so our live coverage will stop here. Thanks for joining us on what's been a busy day withnews of the tax riseand anoverhaul of the coronavirus foreign travel traffic light system. Your updates were written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans, Mary O'Connor, Justin Parkinson, Kate Whannel and Sinead Wilson. The page was edited by Martha Buckley and Rob Corp. Have a good evening and we will be back with more live updates tomorrow. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on need to address NHS wait times In an interview with the BBC, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted the government must make ""the investment now"" with the health and social care levy if NHS treatment backlogs are to be cleared. He tells the BBC's Health Editor Hugh Pym, that around 9 million NHS treatments could be funded by proposed government investment, but did not give details of targets. The new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and a social care reform is through. The Tories say it will bring an investment of Â£36bn in the health and care system over the next three years. This, according to chief secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay, will pay for the social care system to be reformed ""ending unpredictable and catastrophic care costs faced by thousands and making the system fairer for all"". The new tax means people will no longer pay more than Â£86,000 in care costs - not including food and accommodation - over their lifetime, from October 2023. Labour were against the plan with leader Sir Keir Starmer saying it wasunfair on working people. He says: ""Under his plan, a landlord renting out dozens of properties won't pay a penny more, while their tenants in work will face tax rises of hundreds of pounds a year."" The SNP also opposed the move, with its Westminster leader Ian Blackford calling it a ""regressive tax"" on millions of Scottish workers without consultation. And Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey - who is also a carer for his disabled son - said the plan ""forgot family carers"" who just want ""a fair deal"". We've got the key changeshereand you can work out how it will affect youhere. MPs have voted for an extra tax to fund social care in England - and help the NHS recover after the pandemic. There had been criticism - including from within the Conservative Party - that it will be unfair on younger people and the lower paid. Under the proposals, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April 2022. From April 2023, National Insurance will return to its current rate, and the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. This levy - unlike National Insurance - will also be paid by state pensioners who are still working. National Insurance is a UK-wide tax - and while Boris Johnson's announcement focuses on funding health and social care in England - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional Â£2.2bn to spend on their services. You can read morehere. MPs back the government's plan to raise taxes to fund spending on the NHS and social care. It gets through by 319 votes to 248 - that's a margin of 71. MPs have voted against a Labour amendment calling for an assessment of the plan to bring in a new 1.25% tax for the NHS and social care. They will now go to a vote on the substantive measure. If it goes through National Insurance will increase from April 2022, with a separate tax introduced in 2023 We will bring you the result as soon as we have it. While we wait why not read up on what it could mean:Whatâs the new Health and Social Care tax and how will it affect me? The debate is over after nearly five hours and MPs have gone to vote on a Labour amendment to the government's plan to bring in a new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and social care. Labour want the government to carry out an assessment on what the impact of the tax will be on jobs. We will bring you the result as soon as we have it. Steve Barclay, chief secretary to the Treasury, has been summing up the government's case for introducing a new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and to reform social care. ""The pandemic has put unprecedented pressure on the NHS with the number of people waiting for surgery or treatment in England is now at a record high of 5.5 million and if left unchecked this could rise to 13 million,"" he says. He says at the same time the country is facing a long-standing challenge to the social care system. ""Typically around one in seven must pay over Â£100,000 for care, with bills falling indiscriminately on some of the sickest and most vulnerable in society,"" he says. The government's plan would mean an investment of Â£36bn in the health and care system over the next three years, he says. ""The social care system will finally be reformed ending unpredictable and catastrophic care costs faced by thousands and making the system fairer for all,"" he says. Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson is summing up now. She says while it's been a good debate, what's been most striking is how ""inadequate a basis it has been for a change of this magnitude to the tax system of our country"". There have been a number of ""sharp and insightful"" contributions from Labour MPs, including the point that the measures would not improve the lot of care workers, who were now facing a tax rise, she says. Phillipson cites the views of other MPs that the proposals do not represent a proper plan for the NHS or for social care. ""It is instead a broken promise, two-and-a-half million working households hit by the Tory double whammy of cuts to Universal Credit and an increase in National Insurance,"" she adds. Phillipson reiterates the point that it is ""ludicrous"" that landlords will not have to ""pay a penny"" more under the new tax, but that tenants, many who might be working in the NHS, ""are about to be clobbered by a tax rise"" - adding that about 95% of the revenue will come from taxing workers' wages. She criticises the lack of notice given to MPs to approve the government's plans, saying it lacks the scrutiny needed for plans that have such ""universal"" impact. Phillipson says as well as a ""strong and skilled social care workforce"", Labour would deliver a ""new deal"" for care workers to create a ""well motivated and properly rewarded workforce"" that would give support to unpaid carers. Tory MP Jack Brereton says he has been contacted by hundreds of constituents about the need for more investment in social care and the challenges they face of accessing healthcare and medical treatment. ""No decision to invest more to the scale required is going to be easy - and money must come from somewhere. ""I think what we've arrived at is probably the least worst option. ""The approach taken will ensure this burden is spread as broadly as possible, so all those with earned income streams must contribute and protections are in place to protect those on lowest incomes."" Veteran Conservative MP Peter Bone says the government was ""creating a new tax...without having the detail."" He says: ""Whilst I support the idea of more money for the NHS - and I have no objection to it being done through National Insurance - I absolutely object to saying that this has got anything to do with the care bill because that hasn't been introduced. ""Social care should be paid for separately. There should have been a social care bill, we should have had the bill, we should have been able to debate the principle of that and then immediately afterwards voted on the ways and means but we've got this mixed up."" Conservative MP Huw Merriman reiterates the need to ""act now"" to reform health and social care in England and welcomes the ""decisive action"" being taken by the government. However he says he has concerns around the new tax - with the first being the political difficulty of getting the money initially being funnelled into the NHS into social care. He tells the Commons: ""We know how difficult it is to convince people that a temporary lift to Universal Credit was just temporary, how on earth are we going to challenge the equivalence of Marcus Rashford when it comes to the NHS in persuading people that this wasn't a cut but just a plan for a period of time and then we move the money to social care?"" He also cites the ""inter-generational unfairness"" of expecting young people without a home of their own to fund social care through a hike in National Insurance, rather than the older people with nest eggs or their own homes who would be using the service sooner. Thirdly, he says the Tories will have to look to ""rein in"" public spending and allocate money for the NHS with ""strict criteria"" on how it is going to be spent. Merriman indicates he will support the government in the vote but wants them to look at some of the alternative measures he's suggested. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The emergency of the pandemic, which demanded spending and borrowing that busted all norms, has faded. But the prime minister's fondness for splurging billions when he sees fit has not. The last 24 hours have sealed Boris Johnson's existing reputation: a Conservative who says he'd love low taxes, but when there's spending that he perceives is popular, that affection swiftly disappears. Read Laura's blog in full Tory MP Ben Everitt says he's going to try to be optimistic and pull out the good things in the hard choices the government faces. He says there are never any good options for raising taxes but ""raising taxes on having a job is possibly the thing that should be at the bottom of the list when we look at new areas of income"". He says: ""The Â£86,000 cap needs to be met and tweaked with a regional house price element to recognise that houses are worth more in one area of the country than others."" ""I will vote for this. Our job in this place is to make good laws and we need to do that at every stage and this is a tricky problem."" MPs have been debating a new 1.25% tax - initially through National Insurance - to pay for health and social care for about three and a half hours. Here are some of the main points that have been made:  MPs are expected to vote around 19:00 BST and we will bring you the result as soon as we have it. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says the government's plan for social care fails Labour's two tests - that it will fix the problems in the sector and is being funded in a fair way. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, she says Labour would ask those with the ""broadest shoulders"" to contribute more ""and not just go to those who go out to work and earn a wage"". Asked what taxes Labour would raise in their plan to fix social care, she said the party would set out those details in ""due course"" but that the party would seek to tax ""all forms of income"", not just those who work. Challenged on why ex-Labour PMGordon Brown used National Insurance to increase NHS funding back in 2002, she insists there were ""very different economic circumstances"" back then. She adds that while Brown had ""come forward with a plan"" to cut waiting times and get health spending up to the European average - today's Tory government lacked any ""clear plan"" in its proposals. ""The government can't even say when the backlog of operations will be clear, they can't even say when the money will go into our social care system, and they can't even meet the test that no one will have to sell their home to pay for social care,"" she says. Jim Shannon of the Democratic Unionist Party asks for guarantees that the money Northern Ireland will receive from the tax will be used only to help reform health and social care and not for anything else. Reading from a document, he says Northern Ireland is due to get around Â£420m a year from the new tax, but ""there is no indication that the Northern Ireland executive will be required to spend it on the purpose for which it was raised, since the government, it appears, cannot ring-fence the money"". He asks if Northern Ireland's share can be ring-fenced for health and social care and whether this will apply to all future monies sent there. ""What guarantees do we have that every single employed person, every single pensioner, every single business owner, that their sacrifice will bring about necessary change, and not be lost in the ether of politics at Stormont?"" Conservative Dr Andrew Murrison says this could be a historic moment in which we sort out the problems in health and social care and he will be voting ""enthusiastically"" with the government later. And using National Insurance to raise the extra funds is progressive, he adds. But the challenge for ministers is to turn the money going to providers in to better outcomes for patients, he adds. Improving productivity in the NHS has to be a priority and sickness levels need to be driven down, he argues.  Anna George's 91-year-old mother has been in a British Legion Care Home since October 2019, where she lives in a dementia unit. She says her mother's home was sold to pay the Â£4778.43 cost of her care over a 31-day month. But the family are worried as there is only enough money left to fund 10 more months of care. Anna, 68, who lives in Northamptonshire, says: âWhen we get down to the final Â£23,000 we inform social services and we then pay a percentage to contribute to the continued care. I donât know how much. âItâs pretty scary for us because itâs not that far away now for us now."" She welcomes the new tax, but argues it has come ""too late"" for her family. âMy parents worked hard to own their home and to have something to give their children but their hopes are dashed now. âI know people think this tax is unfair on younger, working people but weâre losing our inheritance. Hopefully, with this new system that wonât happen for the younger generation when they reach the stage in life of needing social care."" Reality Check At prime ministerâs questions, Boris Johnson was asked by
the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, whether his previous guarantee that âno one who needs care has to sell their home to
pay for itâ still stood. Mr Johnson did not confirm whether it did. The pledge was
in the Conservativesâ 2019 manifesto. When the Health Secretary, Sajid Javid, was asked about on
the BBCâs Today programme he said: ""We will also make sure that everyone
is able to access what's called the deferred payment agreement... which means

"The countries most vulnerable to climate change are calling for an ""emergency pact"" to tackle rising temperatures. The group wants all countries to agree radical steps to avoid ""climate catastrophe"" at the upcoming COP26 meeting in Glasgow. Green campaignersare urging a postponement of the gathering, citing problems with vaccines for delegates. TheClimate Vulnerable Forum,external(CVF) says the event is critical and cannot wait. Weather-related disasters increase five-fold Climate change summit 'make or break' for planet UK fires up coal power plant as gas prices soar Representing some 1.2 billion people, the CVF consists of countries in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America and the Pacific. The group has been key in pushing the rest of the world to accept the idea of keeping the rise in global temperatures to under 1.5C this century. This was incorporated into the Paris agreement in 2015. Recent research from theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Changesuggests that the threshold will be passed in little over a decade at current rates of carbon emissions. In less than two months, global leaders will gather in Glasgow forCOP26, the most critical meeting on climate change since Paris. Ahead of the Glasgow meeting, the CVF has issued a manifesto for what the conference must deliver to keep the planet safe and protect the most vulnerable. Environmental groups have suggested postponing the meeting, on the grounds that vaccine distribution is inequitable and that delegates from poorer countries face huge bills for quarantine hotels when they arrive in the UK. In Bangladesh, erosion continues as river levels keep rising However, the CVF member states insist the meeting must go ahead in person, and are calling for support and ""facilitated access"" to ensure inclusive participation. The UK government has responded to these calls by agreeing to pay the quarantine hotel expenses of any delegate, observer or media from a developing country. The vulnerable group says that progress on climate change has stalled and COP26 should move forward with what it terms a ""climate emergency pact"". This would see every country put forward a new climate plan every year between now and 2025. At present, signatories of the Paris agreement are only obliged to put forward new plans every five years. The vulnerable nations say that richer countries must fulfil their obligations to deliver $100bn in climate finance per year over the 2020-24 period. A man watches as the sea rushes in on the Marshall Islands The CVF nations want this money to be split 50-50 between cutting carbon and helping countries adapt to the threat posed by rising temperatures. The countries also want the UK to ""take full responsibility"" for this aspect of the negotiations, saying it is vital to restore confidence in the Paris pact. Among the other areas that the most vulnerable nations want to see progress on is the question of debt-for-climate swaps. Many of the world's poorest countries have large debt burdens, and these have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic which has stretched finances even further. In a debt-for-climate swap, a country can reduce what it owes to international creditors by directing the debt service payments to fund renewable energy or greater protection for nature. Many campaigners have argued that the COP26 meeting should be postponed One such restructuring was recentlyannounced by Belize,externalwhere the debt money will now go to support marine conservation projects instead. ""Vulnerable countries have unique needs - and public-private collaboration will be key to addressing them,"" said Nigel Topping, who's the UK's high-level climate action champion for COP26. ""Whether it is in debt for nature swaps such as the recent Belize announcement or in increasing public sector capability to structure investment projects to attract private finance, the aim is to accelerate progress in this area so that 2022 becomes the year of climate action solidarity.""

"MPs vote by 319 to 248 to raise taxes to fund the NHS and social care There will be a new 1.25% tax on workers and employers to fund health and social care This breaks a Tory manifesto commitment not to increase taxes National Insurance will increase from April 2022, with a separate tax introduced in 2023 It has been criticised by some Conservative backbenchers and opposition parties The amount individuals have to spend on their care will be capped at Â£86,000 - not including accommodation costs Labour says the change ""hammers"" working people, leave people still facing losing their homes to pay for care, and it may not clear NHS backlogs Edited by Rob Corp We've reached the end of the debating, and the subsequent passing of the health and social care levy in the House of Commons, so our live coverage will stop here. Thanks for joining us on what's been a busy day withnews of the tax riseand anoverhaul of the coronavirus foreign travel traffic light system. Your updates were written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans, Mary O'Connor, Justin Parkinson, Kate Whannel and Sinead Wilson. The page was edited by Martha Buckley and Rob Corp. Have a good evening and we will be back with more live updates tomorrow. This video can not be played Boris Johnson on need to address NHS wait times In an interview with the BBC, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has insisted the government must make ""the investment now"" with the health and social care levy if NHS treatment backlogs are to be cleared. He tells the BBC's Health Editor Hugh Pym, that around 9 million NHS treatments could be funded by proposed government investment, but did not give details of targets. The new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and a social care reform is through. The Tories say it will bring an investment of Â£36bn in the health and care system over the next three years. This, according to chief secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay, will pay for the social care system to be reformed ""ending unpredictable and catastrophic care costs faced by thousands and making the system fairer for all"". The new tax means people will no longer pay more than Â£86,000 in care costs - not including food and accommodation - over their lifetime, from October 2023. Labour were against the plan with leader Sir Keir Starmer saying it wasunfair on working people. He says: ""Under his plan, a landlord renting out dozens of properties won't pay a penny more, while their tenants in work will face tax rises of hundreds of pounds a year."" The SNP also opposed the move, with its Westminster leader Ian Blackford calling it a ""regressive tax"" on millions of Scottish workers without consultation. And Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey - who is also a carer for his disabled son - said the plan ""forgot family carers"" who just want ""a fair deal"". We've got the key changeshereand you can work out how it will affect youhere. MPs have voted for an extra tax to fund social care in England - and help the NHS recover after the pandemic. There had been criticism - including from within the Conservative Party - that it will be unfair on younger people and the lower paid. Under the proposals, employees, employers and the self-employed will all pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance from April 2022. From April 2023, National Insurance will return to its current rate, and the extra tax will be collected as a new Health and Social Care Levy. This levy - unlike National Insurance - will also be paid by state pensioners who are still working. National Insurance is a UK-wide tax - and while Boris Johnson's announcement focuses on funding health and social care in England - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional Â£2.2bn to spend on their services. You can read morehere. MPs back the government's plan to raise taxes to fund spending on the NHS and social care. It gets through by 319 votes to 248 - that's a margin of 71. MPs have voted against a Labour amendment calling for an assessment of the plan to bring in a new 1.25% tax for the NHS and social care. They will now go to a vote on the substantive measure. If it goes through National Insurance will increase from April 2022, with a separate tax introduced in 2023 We will bring you the result as soon as we have it. While we wait why not read up on what it could mean:Whatâs the new Health and Social Care tax and how will it affect me? The debate is over after nearly five hours and MPs have gone to vote on a Labour amendment to the government's plan to bring in a new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and social care. Labour want the government to carry out an assessment on what the impact of the tax will be on jobs. We will bring you the result as soon as we have it. Steve Barclay, chief secretary to the Treasury, has been summing up the government's case for introducing a new 1.25% tax to pay for the NHS and to reform social care. ""The pandemic has put unprecedented pressure on the NHS with the number of people waiting for surgery or treatment in England is now at a record high of 5.5 million and if left unchecked this could rise to 13 million,"" he says. He says at the same time the country is facing a long-standing challenge to the social care system. ""Typically around one in seven must pay over Â£100,000 for care, with bills falling indiscriminately on some of the sickest and most vulnerable in society,"" he says. The government's plan would mean an investment of Â£36bn in the health and care system over the next three years, he says. ""The social care system will finally be reformed ending unpredictable and catastrophic care costs faced by thousands and making the system fairer for all,"" he says. Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson is summing up now. She says while it's been a good debate, what's been most striking is how ""inadequate a basis it has been for a change of this magnitude to the tax system of our country"". There have been a number of ""sharp and insightful"" contributions from Labour MPs, including the point that the measures would not improve the lot of care workers, who were now facing a tax rise, she says. Phillipson cites the views of other MPs that the proposals do not represent a proper plan for the NHS or for social care. ""It is instead a broken promise, two-and-a-half million working households hit by the Tory double whammy of cuts to Universal Credit and an increase in National Insurance,"" she adds. Phillipson reiterates the point that it is ""ludicrous"" that landlords will not have to ""pay a penny"" more under the new tax, but that tenants, many who might be working in the NHS, ""are about to be clobbered by a tax rise"" - adding that about 95% of the revenue will come from taxing workers' wages. She criticises the lack of notice given to MPs to approve the government's plans, saying it lacks the scrutiny needed for plans that have such ""universal"" impact. Phillipson says as well as a ""strong and skilled social care workforce"", Labour would deliver a ""new deal"" for care workers to create a ""well motivated and properly rewarded workforce"" that would give support to unpaid carers. Tory MP Jack Brereton says he has been contacted by hundreds of constituents about the need for more investment in social care and the challenges they face of accessing healthcare and medical treatment. ""No decision to invest more to the scale required is going to be easy - and money must come from somewhere. ""I think what we've arrived at is probably the least worst option. ""The approach taken will ensure this burden is spread as broadly as possible, so all those with earned income streams must contribute and protections are in place to protect those on lowest incomes."" Veteran Conservative MP Peter Bone says the government was ""creating a new tax...without having the detail."" He says: ""Whilst I support the idea of more money for the NHS - and I have no objection to it being done through National Insurance - I absolutely object to saying that this has got anything to do with the care bill because that hasn't been introduced. ""Social care should be paid for separately. There should have been a social care bill, we should have had the bill, we should have been able to debate the principle of that and then immediately afterwards voted on the ways and means but we've got this mixed up."" Conservative MP Huw Merriman reiterates the need to ""act now"" to reform health and social care in England and welcomes the ""decisive action"" being taken by the government. However he says he has concerns around the new tax - with the first being the political difficulty of getting the money initially being funnelled into the NHS into social care. He tells the Commons: ""We know how difficult it is to convince people that a temporary lift to Universal Credit was just temporary, how on earth are we going to challenge the equivalence of Marcus Rashford when it comes to the NHS in persuading people that this wasn't a cut but just a plan for a period of time and then we move the money to social care?"" He also cites the ""inter-generational unfairness"" of expecting young people without a home of their own to fund social care through a hike in National Insurance, rather than the older people with nest eggs or their own homes who would be using the service sooner. Thirdly, he says the Tories will have to look to ""rein in"" public spending and allocate money for the NHS with ""strict criteria"" on how it is going to be spent. Merriman indicates he will support the government in the vote but wants them to look at some of the alternative measures he's suggested. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The emergency of the pandemic, which demanded spending and borrowing that busted all norms, has faded. But the prime minister's fondness for splurging billions when he sees fit has not. The last 24 hours have sealed Boris Johnson's existing reputation: a Conservative who says he'd love low taxes, but when there's spending that he perceives is popular, that affection swiftly disappears. Read Laura's blog in full Tory MP Ben Everitt says he's going to try to be optimistic and pull out the good things in the hard choices the government faces. He says there are never any good options for raising taxes but ""raising taxes on having a job is possibly the thing that should be at the bottom of the list when we look at new areas of income"". He says: ""The Â£86,000 cap needs to be met and tweaked with a regional house price element to recognise that houses are worth more in one area of the country than others."" ""I will vote for this. Our job in this place is to make good laws and we need to do that at every stage and this is a tricky problem."" MPs have been debating a new 1.25% tax - initially through National Insurance - to pay for health and social care for about three and a half hours. Here are some of the main points that have been made:  MPs are expected to vote around 19:00 BST and we will bring you the result as soon as we have it. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves says the government's plan for social care fails Labour's two tests - that it will fix the problems in the sector and is being funded in a fair way. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, she says Labour would ask those with the ""broadest shoulders"" to contribute more ""and not just go to those who go out to work and earn a wage"". Asked what taxes Labour would raise in their plan to fix social care, she said the party would set out those details in ""due course"" but that the party would seek to tax ""all forms of income"", not just those who work. Challenged on why ex-Labour PMGordon Brown used National Insurance to increase NHS funding back in 2002, she insists there were ""very different economic circumstances"" back then. She adds that while Brown had ""come forward with a plan"" to cut waiting times and get health spending up to the European average - today's Tory government lacked any ""clear plan"" in its proposals. ""The government can't even say when the backlog of operations will be clear, they can't even say when the money will go into our social care system, and they can't even meet the test that no one will have to sell their home to pay for social care,"" she says. Jim Shannon of the Democratic Unionist Party asks for guarantees that the money Northern Ireland will receive from the tax will be used only to help reform health and social care and not for anything else. Reading from a document, he says Northern Ireland is due to get around Â£420m a year from the new tax, but ""there is no indication that the Northern Ireland executive will be required to spend it on the purpose for which it was raised, since the government, it appears, cannot ring-fence the money"". He asks if Northern Ireland's share can be ring-fenced for health and social care and whether this will apply to all future monies sent there. ""What guarantees do we have that every single employed person, every single pensioner, every single business owner, that their sacrifice will bring about necessary change, and not be lost in the ether of politics at Stormont?"" Conservative Dr Andrew Murrison says this could be a historic moment in which we sort out the problems in health and social care and he will be voting ""enthusiastically"" with the government later. And using National Insurance to raise the extra funds is progressive, he adds. But the challenge for ministers is to turn the money going to providers in to better outcomes for patients, he adds. Improving productivity in the NHS has to be a priority and sickness levels need to be driven down, he argues.  Anna George's 91-year-old mother has been in a British Legion Care Home since October 2019, where she lives in a dementia unit. She says her mother's home was sold to pay the Â£4778.43 cost of her care over a 31-day month. But the family are worried as there is only enough money left to fund 10 more months of care. Anna, 68, who lives in Northamptonshire, says: âWhen we get down to the final Â£23,000 we inform social services and we then pay a percentage to contribute to the continued care. I donât know how much. âItâs pretty scary for us because itâs not that far away now for us now."" She welcomes the new tax, but argues it has come ""too late"" for her family. âMy parents worked hard to own their home and to have something to give their children but their hopes are dashed now. âI know people think this tax is unfair on younger, working people but weâre losing our inheritance. Hopefully, with this new system that wonât happen for the younger generation when they reach the stage in life of needing social care."" Reality Check At prime ministerâs questions, Boris Johnson was asked by
the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, whether his previous guarantee that âno one who needs care has to sell their home to
pay for itâ still stood. Mr Johnson did not confirm whether it did. The pledge was
in the Conservativesâ 2019 manifesto. When the Health Secretary, Sajid Javid, was asked about on
the BBCâs Today programme he said: ""We will also make sure that everyone
is able to access what's called the deferred payment agreement... which means
no one will ever have to sell their housein their life time."" Weâve looked at the pledge, how the language has changed
and whether it can be met under the new plans. You can read what we foundhere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.5815972e-11
"Deborah Polverino and her partner Guy Griffiths are facing spiralling costs People who have lost thousands of pounds in the post-Grenfell fire safety crisis have asked for urgent help amid spiralling insurance and service costs. Deborah Polverino, from Cardiff, saw her annual service charge rise from Â£3,000 to nearly Â£7,800 after her building failed fire safety tests. Campaigners warned people could go bankrupt and lose their homes. The Welsh government said it was ""working hard to develop funding options"". A spokesman said the ""complex nature"" of the issue was ""affecting the pace"" of that work. Legal action threat over cladding support delay 'No Grenfell Tower type cladding here' 'Constant dread' of failed fire safety flat owners As well as paying increased charges, many leaseholders are worried about the huge costs of repair work for things such as flammable cladding and inadequate internal firebreaks. In July, the Welsh government announced it would be funding surveys to assess what work was required, a move described by campaigners as ""too little, too late"". A repair fund is planned for next year in Wales. In England people can already apply for money to remove cladding on buildings over 18m (59ft) tall. The Welsh government is yet to spend any money on removing cladding or other fire safety remediation work on private residential buildings over 18m tall. In response to a freedom of information request by BBC Wales, it said nearly Â£11m had so far been spent on remedial work on 15 social housing blocks. Work has been completed on three buildings in Newport and is under way on one other in the city, eight in Cardiff and three in Swansea. Ms Polverino has lived at Victoria Wharf in Cardiff Bay with her partner Guy Griffiths for 10 years. When they tried to move a couple of years ago they realised their seventh-floor, three-bedroom flat was ""valueless"". ""When you've invested a huge amount of money into your home and you're then told it's unsellable, or if you're lucky you might sell it at auction at a massively decreased value, it's a hard pill to take,"" said Ms Polverino. ""I can't mortgage it, I can't sell it."" Deborah Polverino said her latest bill had her in tears Increased costs, including insurance and internal safety measures, have seen big hikes in the service charges leaseholders must pay. ""I sat down and cried, as I'm sure many people in these blocks did,"" she said. The total cost of repair work, including the replacement of cladding, has been estimated at Â£60,000 per flat, she said. As well as the financial hit already taken and the worry about the bigger one potentially on the way, she is also anxious at the thought of a fire. ""I know so many people have sleepless nights over this. I've had my own sleepless nights. ""I even looked at getting one of these ladders but sadly they only go four floors, so that didn't help me."" She said the developer, Taylor Wimpey, should ""step up and do what's morally right"". ""We didn't build these properties, we didn't create the issue. Why are we paying for it?"" She suggested the Welsh government could set up a low-interest loan scheme, similar to help it gave tenants during the pandemic. Ms Polverino said First Minister Mark Drakeford and Housing Minister Julie James ""need to do more now"". ""We keep getting these promises of something in the future,"" she said. ""It's a moral obligation for the Welsh government to make sure leaseholders don't lose their homes."" A spokesman for Taylor Wimpey said the company was ""taking steps where appropriate"" to help customers with fire safety measures and it had set funding aside to bring the external walls of its apartment buildings constructed over the past 20 years up to current standards. ""We are closely engaged with FirstPort, the management company at Victoria Wharf, regarding funding and further updates will be provided to residents as soon as possible."" FirstPort said it was ""pleased"" Taylor Wimpey has ""announced additional funding"" and it was ""urgently reviewing"" what permanent work was required. Bex Ashwin, from newly-formed campaign group Welsh Cladiators, said increased charges people were facing meant some would lose their homes or go bankrupt. ""The Welsh government really need to step up and understand the urgency of this situation and how much it is putting on residents every day from a mental health perspective."" Welsh Conservative housing spokeswoman Janet Finch Saunders said homeowners in Wales had been left in the dark waiting for further news while costs spiralled. ""We urgently need action, with homeowners so far only seeing a paltry survey,"" she added. ""Welsh homeowners should not be left paying the price for the shortcomings of developers and it is the job of ministers to step in to rectify this injustice."" Plaid Cymru claimed it was ""not acceptable"" the Welsh government had given no details about funding options and and urged it to address the matter, adding: ""How many more times will the pleas from these people, figuratively trapped in their high-rise buildings, fall on deaf ears?"" The Welsh government said: ""These building defects are having a significant impact on leaseholders and residents. ""We are committed to supporting them and are working hard to develop funding options. ""Building safety issues are often more than just cladding-related - we are working hard to deliver a funding offer which will go further than cladding only.""

"Maura McGoldrick was vaccinated in England and in Scotland A woman who was vaccinated in England and Scotland says she cannot get an accurate vaccination certificate because of issues with data-sharing across health services. Maura McGoldrick, 21, received her first dose in London and her second in Glasgow, where she lives. However, her vaccination record only shows her having received one dose. The fourth-year student at the University of Edinburgh is concerned others may be similarly affected. The Scottish government said it had been working to ""align"" vaccination data from across the UK. The certificates are necessary for travelling abroad and could be used as part of a passport scheme toallow people into nightclubs and large events. Scotland's system has already seen problems including arecent security glitchand people beingdenied use of the pass in certain countries. It has only recently been made available in the form of a QR code - despite a digital passport being widely used across Europe for months. While travelling to London over the summer, Ms McGoldrick said she heard news of the push for young people to visit drop-in vaccine clinics - and attended a local clinic the following day. She said the medics at the centre were unable to find her NHS records, but took her name and address and gave her a card which stated the batch of the vaccine she had just received. NHS England issue patients with cards detailing the vaccine batch number To be safe, Ms McGoldrick said she quickly phoned NHS Inform to let them know she had received her first jab outside of Scotland and was told her records would be updated. However, when she received her second dose in Glasgow in August, she was told the first dose was missing from her medical records. How do I get a vaccine certificate in Scotland? What do we know about the vaccine passport? Double-jabbed students denied quarantine exemption She requested her vaccine certificate by post and, again, the document showed one dose issued in Glasgow. ""Because there have been other things going on, it's just compounded general stress and been emotionally draining,"" said Ms McGoldrick. ""I know rationally it's not the end of the world and I'm very privileged even to just have the vaccine. ""But I'm now at the stage where there is no-one else for me to call, no more leads for me to pursue - it's a bit of a hopeless situation."" Ms McGoldrick has spent more than two weeks calling NHS Inform and her GP in order to resolve the matter. She said her GP managed to acquire information on her vaccination in London. However, she said NHS Inform staff told her there was no data-sharing mechanism between them and NHS England and they would need to request the information from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde. The Scottish government denied the claim about data sharing, saying it has worked to ""align"" vaccination records from different UK nations. A spokesperson said: ""We are aware some people have encountered problems but it's untrue to say there is no data-sharing and we are working closely with other nations to resolve the issue. ""We have a process in place for sharing data between England and Scotland and continue to work with international stakeholders to improve the transfer of data across borders. ""Updated NHS Inform guidance contains guidance on what to do if you have been vaccinated abroad or have been vaccinated in different parts of the UK."" What does the NHS say about vaccine status and the Common Travel Area?,external NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde gave the BBC contradictory information, saying that NHS Scotland certificates ""can only contain information on vaccines administered in Scotland"". It has not responded to a further query. Ms McGoldrick is currently trying to get the health board to share her GP's information with NHS Inform - but said other people in her position may not be able to chase it up. She said: ""Selfishly speaking, I'm trying to sort this out for myself but I'm in the fortunate position where I have time to chase this up. ""But I know there are other people in the same position - NHS Inform said they had other people call about this but assumed they sorted it out. People have probably just given up as it will take more time and effort that they have to give right now."" Vaccine certificates with QR codes are widely used across European countries As a result of her vaccine status issue, Ms McGoldrick has postponed her October plans to travel to Copenhagen - partly for leisure, but also to do work experience related to her university course in international relations. She said she thought she was doing the right thing by getting her vaccine as quickly as possible, but the bureaucracy and cancelled plans that resulted had been a ""bit of a blow"". ""It's the fact that we've been cooped up for so long,"" she said. ""I felt when I got two doses I had done everything I was supposed to do."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

"Some principals have voiced concern about high absence levels due to the test and trace policy The Northern Ireland Assembly is to be recalled to discuss the situation regarding Covid-19 in schools. The speaker has decided that the recall, which follows a petition put forward by Sinn FÃ©in, will take place on Thursday at 12:00 BST. Some principals have expressed concern that guidance on testing and tracing has caused a high number of pupils to miss classes. First Minister Paul Givan has suggested a quicker test could be used. Education Minister Michelle McIlveen said proposals for dealing with Covid school absences were being finalised, and would be discussed with the education sector this week. She said discussions had been ongoing between her department and the Department of Health. Assembly members were officially due to resume assembly business on Monday. The recall, proposed by Pat Sheehan MLA, needed 30 signatures to pass. Education Minister Michelle McIlveen needed to give ""clear guidance"" and put in place enough resources to support staff in keeping schools open, he said. On Tuesday, Mr Givan, a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) colleague of the minister, said the executive may need to consider other options for Covid-19 testing and contact tracing in schools. It comes aftermore than half of the pupils at Larne High School were absenton Monday because they were in close contact with a positive case. The current guidanceissued by the Public Health Agency (PHA) last monthadvised that close contacts of a positive case can avoid self-isolation if they had recently tested positive themselves and present no symptoms. Otherwise, if a pupil is a close contact and has no symptoms but has not had a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in the previous 90 days, they are advised to self-isolate until they have taken a test. Mr Givan said this policy was supported by all the parties in the executive and should be followed, rather than children having to self-isolate for the previous requirement of 10 days. The word that you hear a lot is ""unsustainable"". Principals are saying they can't go on like this. Michael Carville, who is head of Regent House, a secondary school in Newtownards with 1,400 pupils, said to me on Monday that he hasn't done any education since he got back to school at the start of term. It it has been all contact tracing. And a number of other heads [principals] are in the same position. We are only just a week into term, and there is a recognition right across the board that it cannot go on like this. The problem is, what do we do about it? Any major change in self-isolation rules would have to be approved by the executive. It is hard to know if that would be palatable to the executive, or what other changes could be made without executive approval. Mr Givan conceded it was ""becoming difficult"" to find available slots for PCR tests and questioned if the education system should ""go back to a system of lateral flow testing"", which are not as accurate but provide quick results. He told BBC News NI that such tests were considered sufficient for access to venues such as sporting events and could be ""carried out at home by parents"". Paul Givan said politicians, parents and teachers want to see children in school ""Every option needs to now be considered because if the system within the Public Health Agency cannot support principals to implement a policy which was to prevent children being put out for 10 days and to have a turnaround of 24 hours, then we need to be considering other options,"" he said. But St John the Baptist Primary School principal Chris Donnelly said lateral flow testing did not give the same security. Two classes at the Finaghy school were sent home because of positive cases last week, he said. Over the weekend he asked parents to provide documentary proof of negative PCR tests. The same documentary proof would not be available with a lateral flow test, he said. He said he also had to stop two children from coming into school because they had not been tested. What are Northern Ireland's Covid-19 rules now? What are lateral flow tests? ""There's a trade-off in society at the moment. We know that opening the schools can only do one thing. It's only going to lead in an increase in the number of cases,"" he told BBC's Evening Extra programme. ""But we understand that society needs to function. If we're going to have that system in place then we need to trust that the system is robust. ""I do not think relying on lateral flow tests is robust, I don't think that it would provide the reassurance that parents, that staff members and school leaders need."" Brain Guthrie, head teacher of Ebrington Primary School in Londonderry, said the first positive cases since the school year started were identified at the end of last week. He told BBC Radio Foyle some of the messages coming from the PHA have been mixed. ""If a child tests positive here at Ebrington, having reported cases before I am feeling confident enough myself to get information out to parents. We have our letter ready to go, we adjust the date appropriately,"" he said. ""I then make the phone call through to PHA and make them aware of that. The only thing is, is the pressure of time, the amount of added administration that is putting on principals."" Lori Campbell, who is a mum of four and also works as a childminder in Londonderry, was instructed to take one her children home when she arrived at the school gates on Monday. ""Her class was involved in a close-contact situation and they needed us to return home and organise a PCR test,"" Mrs Campbell told BBC Radio Foyle. ""It left me in a situation where I was meant to be working, I had another child on board who was then at risk and my husband was at work."" She said her daughter's Covid-19 test results came back negative. ""If her test had came up positive, I would have to close my business and that would be me closed until her PCR test came back clear,"" she said. ""That's not a great position to be in and not a great position to then land other parents in who have to come and pick up their child."" Mrs Campbell has called for the current testing and tracing protocols in schools to be changed. BBC News NI asked the Department of Education and Education Authority (EA) for figures for the number of pupils absent from class, but they directed us to the PHA. The PHA directed us to a Covid-19 bulletin, which has not been updated since August 29. Stormont education committee chair Chris Lyttle said he had requested that both the PHA and chief medical officer attend Wednesday's education committee meeting. ""We need greater clarity on what the evidence is behind the system we have in place, and whether the system is operating as it is supposed to,"" said the Alliance assembly member. SDLP education spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said the lack of planning by the Department of Education had ""plunged schools into crisis"". ""I have been inundated by school principals complaining about the current guidance, it's not fit for purpose and resulted in them and their staff spending countless hours focused on contact tracing and other Covid-related issues instead of education,"" he said. Following the absence levels at Larne High School, the PHA set up a mobile testing facility at Larne Leisure Centre. The real business on Thursday may not happen within the assembly chamber but at the executive meeting which is also due to take place. The education and health ministers have been tasked by the executive to go off and listen to what's been said by teachers on the ground, to speak to public health officials and the chief medical officer. They will come back to the executive on Thursday with some proposals as to how they may be able to tackle this current crisis. It was anticipated there was going to be difficulties but ministers have now found themselves in the position where they are going to have to look again at this problem. Perhaps the scale of the problem that was coming down the track was underestimated. Behind the scenes, there is probably a lot of scrambling going on. On Sunday, the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) saidsome schools had decided not to follow the PHA guidancebecause they feared it could lead to greater infection rates. The union said some principals would like pupils to have longer self-isolation periods to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to their classmates. The first minister said he wanted the Department of Health to provide an update on the situation at Thursday's executive meeting. Up to 12,000 pupils are out of school in the Republic of Ireland, RTÃ has reported. About 1,300 schools are reporting cases but the ""vast majority"" are traced to community transmission and not picked up in school, according to the Health Service Executive. Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said ""we are seeing a large number of students having to self-isolate because they have been deemed to be close contacts and they of course will get tested"".

"Demand for university places continues to rise despite all the disruption of the pandemic Record numbers of 18-year-olds in the UK have accepted university places this year, according to updated figures from the Ucas admissions service. There will be 272,500 of this age cohort starting at UK universities - up by 7% on last year. But a sharp fall in EU students coming to the UK means overall university numbers are slightly down this year. Ucas head Clare Marchant said students had worked hard for places despite ""incredibly trying circumstances"". These latest figures show rising numbers of UK students of all ages getting university places, up to 448,000, along with more overseas students coming to the UK from countries such as China and Nigeria. The ""resilience"" of rising demand for university places has confounded earlier warnings about the impact of Covid, says the admission service's head of data, Richard O'Kelly. Despite the switch to online learning, lack of access to social activities, Covid outbreaks andcomplaints about value for money, more UK students have accepted places than before the pandemic. But the overall figure of almost 508,000 new students is slightly down on this point last year, after a 56% fall in students from EU countries such as France, Germany and Italy. Will I need a jab to start university? Record top grades in exam results Students say university not value for money this year Universities could keep lectures online in autumn It means there will be more students from Peru than Denmark, more from Kuwait than the Netherlands - and more from China than all the EU countries combined. Applications are still open for this year's courses, but the trends show record numbers of UK school-leavers heading to university. Almost 38% of 18-year-olds have so far decided to go to university, the highest ever proportion. Although entry numbers for those aged 19 and over are slightly down on last year. Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said the continuing rise in UK student numbers showed ""young people are voting with their feet and behaving entirely rationally"". ""They are not snowflakes who melt under heat. They are rational, ambitious and full of aspiration."" Mr Hillman said university was still an ambition for families and that ""when the labour market is in flux and the world is in crisis, getting more education is a very sensible response"". On the fall in EU student numbers, he said it reflected the higher fees they would be charged after the UK left the EU. The update on university admissions, a month after exam results, shows a relatively high number of applicants still to decide on whether to take a place - with the suggestion they might have narrowly missed out on a preference and are considering whether to reapply next year. Figures for England show the regional divide is getting wider, with increasing numbers of students coming from London, the South and the Midlands, while numbers have fallen in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber. Compared with 2012, the number of students from London has risen by 26%, while in the North East, numbers have slightly fallen. Clare Marchant said she expected numbers of acceptances to continue increasing over the next few weeks. ""We know that some students, particularly mature applicants looking to study at their local university or college, often make a late decision through clearing, so we expect numbers to rise before the end of the cycle,"" she said. A spokesman for the Russell Group said its universities ""made more offers this year to UK 18-year-olds, including those from the most deprived areas, reflecting their determination to be fair and flexible so students were not disadvantaged by this year's changes to the assessment system"". A Universities UK spokeswoman said: ""It's brilliant to see record numbers of students recognising the benefits of a university degree. ""Embarking on a degree is a uniquely exciting time, with the skills and experience students set to gain lasting a lifetime, giving them an edge in the employment market and generating significant benefits for the UK as we rebuild from the pandemic.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Social care must be paid for by taxes, not borrowing A new health and social care tax will be introduced across the UK to pay for reforms to the care sector and NHS funding in England. Boris Johnson said it would raise Â£12bn a year, designed to tackle the health backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and to bolster social care. He accepted the tax broke a manifesto pledge, but said the ""global pandemic was in no-one's manifesto"". However, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the plan was a ""sticking plaster"". Leaders in social care also warned the money was ""nowhere near enough"" and would not address current problems. The tax will begin as a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance from April 2022, paid by both employers and workers, and will then become a separate tax on earned income from 2023 - calculated in the same way as National Insurance and appearing on an employee's payslip. This will be paid by all working adults, including older workers, and the government says it will be ""legally ring-fenced"" to go only towards health and social care costs. What would a National Insurance rise mean for me? Social care changes at-a-glance Income from share dividends - earned by those who own shares in companies - will also see a 1.25% tax rate increase. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the latest tax increases amounted to Â£14bn. Together with those announced in the March Budget, it said, 2022 had seen the highest tax rises in 40 years. The UK-wide tax will be focused on funding health and social care in England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional Â£2.2bn to spend on their services. The SNP said the tax would ""unfairly penalise Scottish families - and leave the poorest in society subsidising the wealthy"". MPs will vote on the new proposals in the Commons on Wednesday. Mr Johnson said the proceeds from the tax would lead to Â£12bn a year being raised, with the majority going into catching up on the backlog in the NHS created by Covid - increasing hospital capacity and creating space for nine million more appointments, scans and operations. A portion of the money - Â£5.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that. A cap will be introduced on care costs in England from October 2023 of Â£86,000 over a person's lifetime. All people with assets worth less than Â£20,000 will then have their care fully covered by the state, and those who have between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 in assets will see their care costs subsidised. This video can not be played Sharon told the BBC that she feared her mum 'would be auctioned off to the lowest bidder' June Clay, 92, from Hornchurch, had to go into a nursing home four years ago. As a property owner, June had to ""self-fund"", so sold her house to afford fees which over four years have risen to nearly Â£1,200 a week. Her capital is almost all gone. The local authority will help, but only up to Â£640 a week - while the cheapest homes locally charge Â£900. Now her children, in their 60s, are considering re-mortgaging their own homes and using their pension savings to pay for her care. ""I made a promise to my mum, that she would stay in that home... I'm worried sick about it,"" says daughter Sharon. But she fears the reforms will be ""smoke and mirrors"" that will not meet the full costs of care. Mr Johnson insisted that with the new tax, ""everyone will contribute according to their means"", adding: ""You can't fix the Covid backlogs without giving the NHS the money it needs. ""You can't fix the NHS without fixing social care. You can't fix social care without removing the fear of losing everything to pay for social care, and you can't fix health and social care without long-term reform."" But Labour's Sir Keir said the new tax broke the Conservatives' pledge at the last election not to raise National Insurance, income tax or VAT. He also said the rise would target young people, supermarket workers and nurses, rather than those with the ""broadest shoulders"" who should pay more. The Labour leader added: ""Read my lips - the Tories can never again claim to be the party of low tax."" This video can not be played Keir Starmer says the Conservatives can ânever again claim to be the party of low tax"" The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey - who is a carer himself - also said the tax was ""unfair"", and that the government's plan missed out solutions for staffing shortages, care for working age adults and unpaid family carers. Mr Johnson said no Conservative government wanted to raise taxes - but he defended the move as ""the right, reasonable and fair approach"" in light of the pandemic, which saw the government spend upwards of Â£407bn on support. Later, during a press conference, the prime minister said he didn't want to raise taxes further but did not promise there would be no further rises before the next election - despite being asked repeatedly to rule it out. Meanwhile, the government has also announced it willsuspend the so-called ""triple lock"" on pensions for one yearfollowing concerns that a big post-pandemic rise in average earnings would have led to pensions increasing by 8%. The government is raising about Â£12bn a year for three years with these tax rises. Just over Â£2bn of that goes to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland under rules on how UK government spending is split. That leaves Â£10bn a year for health and social care in England. Most, but not all, of that has been earmarked against particular parts of health and social care. About Â£6bn a year has been earmarked for the NHS. Another nearly Â£2bn a year will go to social care. A bit less than half of that will go towards the new funding model (helping people to pay for care) and a bit more than half going on delivering care - training for staff, support for councils and work on making the care and health services work better together. Some of the remainder will be spent on tax. The Department of Health and Social Care, and the NHS, are big employers and so a tax rise for employers will mean they have to pay more. But there's still at least a Â£1bn increase in the DHSC budget that goes into ""other"", with the government saying they'll announce further details in the coming weeks. Ahead of the announcement, there was a backlash from number of Tory MPs, who said they were against a rise in National Insurance. But questioning the PM after his statement in the Commons, many backbenchers instead sought reassurance that the money raised from the new tax would definitely go towards social care. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 4's World At One that he thought the government had listened to concerns about only making changes to National Insurance, especially as it would ""disproportionately target younger people"" and not pensioners. He said: ""This new tax is more broadly based and the 10% of pensioners who work will pay it as well."" However, there was anger from the social care sector over the amount they had been promised as a result of the tax. Chief executive of the UK Home Care Association, Dr Jane Townson, said: ""This is nowhere near enough. It will not address current issues and some measures may create new risks."" Chairman of the Independent Care Group, Mike Padgham, said it was a ""huge opportunity missed for radical, once-in-a-generation reform of the social care system"", adding it would not address the staffing crisis which was ""sending the sector into meltdown on a daily basis as care providers struggle to cover shifts"". And the general secretary of the Unison union, Christina McAnea, said: ""A detailed plan is needed first to mend and future-proof a sector broken by years of neglect. ""Only then will the cost of making good the damage become clear."" The sums are eye-watering, but they've still left health and care bosses disappointed. The Covid pandemic has had a huge toll on the NHS, requiring an overhaul of how services are run and creating a growing backlog in care. Even with this money, it will take the health service years to catch up. Part of the reason for that is that despite the headline figure of Â£36bn over three years, by the time the money is shared out across the four UK nations and social care takes a chunk, the frontline of the NHS in England is left with little more than half the Â£10bn a year health bosses were asking for. Councils are perhaps even more disappointed. The case for social care predates the pandemic. Governments have been dodging it since the late 1990s so the fact that changes are on the way is being welcomed. But the cap only solves one part of the problem - protecting people's assets when they face catastrophic costs. You will still need to be eligible for care to benefit from the cap. Access is rationed so only the most frail qualify - currently half of requests for help are turned down. Councils say the money will do little to help them tackle this.

"Boris Johnson has defended his plan to raise National Insurance to fund health and social care, saying it deals with ""catastrophic costs"" faced by millions. In a testy exchange in Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer pressed him on whether he stood by his promise that no one who needed care would have to sell their home. The PM did not answer directly, saying his party was taking tough decisions. MPs are debating the plan in the Commons and will vote at 19:00 BST. In the manifesto-breaking move, the prime minister hopes to raise Â£12bn a year to tackle the health backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and boost social care. What would a National Insurance rise mean for me? Social care changes at-a-glance PM bets on imperfect care solution over inaction Mr Johnson saidhis plan,external- which includes capping care costs in England at Â£86,000 - was broad-based and progressive according to the economic think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies. ""The plan deals - after decades - with catastrophic costs faced by millions of people, the risks that they face, the threat they could face the loss of their homes, their possessions, their ability to pass on anything to their children,"" he said. He added it was the first time the state had stepped in to deal with the threat of such costs and meant insurance companies would now be able to help protect people against the costs of care. But Sir Keir said the tax was unfair on working people, adding: ""Under his plan, a landlord renting out dozens of properties won't pay a penny more, while their tenants in work will face tax rises of hundreds of pounds a year. ""A care worker earning the minimum wage doesn't get a pay rise under this plan but does get a tax rise. In what world is that fair?"" Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, confirmed during the debate that the party would be voting against the tax. A handful of Conservative MPs are also expected to vote against, including former minister Steve Baker, who called on his party to ""rediscover what it stands for"" rather than ""every time there is a squeeze on the public finances, coming back for higher taxes."" But with an 80-seat majority, Mr Johnson's plan is still expected to pass. This video can not be played Starmer: People with broadest shoulders should pay fair share The SNP also oppose the move, with its Westminster leader Ian Blackford calling it a ""regressive tax"" on millions of Scottish workers without consultation. And Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey - who is also carer for his disabled son - said the plan ""forgot family carers"" who just want ""a fair deal"". It is widely agreed that major changes are needed to England's social care system, which helps older and working-age people with high care needs to carry out day-to-day tasks, such as washing, dressing, eating and medication. The key proposals of the new plan are: People will no longer pay more than Â£86,000 in care costs - not including food and accommodation - over their lifetime, from October 2023 Once people have reached this cap, ongoing costs for personal care will be paid for by local authorities Those with between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 in assets will get means-tested help towards costs from their local council Those with less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay towards care costs from their assets at all, but might have to contribute from their income The tax will be raised through a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance - which working people and their employers pay to ensure benefits like the state pension - from next April This will cost Â£255 a year for someone earning Â£30,000, and Â£505 a year for someone on Â£50,000, the government says Mr Johnson has said the majority of the Â£36bn fund raised by the tax rise will go towards catching up on the backlog in the NHS created by Covid - increasing hospital capacity and creating space for nine million more appointments, scans and operations. A smaller portion of the money - Â£5.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that. But there has been anger from the social care sector over the amount they had been promised. The UK Home Care Association, which represents home care providers, said it was ""nowhere near enough"", while Unison, a union for care workers, said the money ""doesn't even come close"" and those in need of care would be feeling ""extremely let down"". Chairman of the Independent Care Group Mike Padgham also said the plan did not address the staffing crisis which was ""sending the sector into meltdown on a daily basis as care providers struggle to cover shifts"". Asked about staff shortages and low pay, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the levy would mean local authorities could pay more for care and a new staff training and development programme would be introduced. From those who work in, commission services or have their lives shaped by the care they get, the reactions to the prime minister's plans to reform this crumbling system have been mixed. The fact there is a plan is welcome because it means there is something to work with, but charities, councils and the people who run home care and care homes, are worried by the lack of a vision of what a future care system should be trying to achieve. And there is even more concern about the money. One senior local Conservative politician described the mood in local government to me in one word - ""despair"". Councils are facing a significant increase in people asking for help already, but there is no extra money now. There's scepticism about whether the funding given to the NHS in the short term will actually be released to social care in three years' time. The politician said the authority feared that as the new levy comes in, their costs will go up as they expect more people will be eligible for council support (with more generous means-testing) and wage bills will rise for them and care providers. They worry that people believe the social care system is fixed now, but the situation may have just got worse. The new tax will begin as a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance from next April, paid by both employers and workers, and will then become a separate tax on earned income from 2023 - calculated in the same way as National Insurance and appearing on an employee's payslip. This will be paid by all working adults, including older workers. The government says it will be ""legally ring-fenced"" to go only towards health and social care costs. Income from share dividends - earned by those who own shares in companies - will also see a 1.25% tax rate increase, to stop people getting round the tax by taking more earnings in the form of dividends rather than salary. This video can not be played Ben Zaranko from the IFS: 'If the NHS needs more money, that leaves less for social care' The Institute for Fiscal Studies also said the Â£12bn a year extra for health and social care risked being swallowed up by the NHS. It suggested that the experiences of the past 40 years showed NHS spending plans were almost always topped up, meaning that health would continue to require the bulk of the revenue raised by the new tax, which ""could leave little if any of the tax rises announced available for social care"". The UK-wide tax will be focused on funding health and social care in England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive an additional Â£2.2bn to spend on their services. Mr Johnson said no Conservative government wanted to raise taxes but defended the move as ""the right, reasonable and fair approach"" in light of the pandemic, which saw the government spend upwards of Â£407bn on support. While he said he did not want to raise taxes further, he did not rule out more increases before the next election. Why the cap on care costs is not all it seems What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? Sir Edward Leigh said as a ""low tax Conservative"" MP, it would be ""easy to attack"" the new levy, warning it could end up ""subsidising"" wealthy pensioners in the south east of England at the expense of those elsewhere. But during Wednesday's debate, he said it was ""much more difficult to provide an alternative"" when the funding was needed for care and the NHS now. The Tory backbencher did warn the leadership, however, not to think they can ""solve these problems by becoming a tax and spend party"" to cheers from his colleagues, adding: ""It is simply not going to wash"".

"This is a very significant tax rise, with little precedent outside of a Budget. It doesn't just break a manifesto promise, it drives a JCB through it, with Â£11.4bn a year in extra taxes that were the subject of a guarantee that they would not go up. The March Budget of this year was already the most significant tax-raising Budget since 1993. But a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic recession and associated long-lasting damage to the NHS do give some rationale for thinking about how appropriate promises are made in very different circumstances. Boris Johnson outlines new 1.25% health and social care tax to pay for reforms Business bosses warn new tax could hit jobs Triple lock pension pledge suspended for one year Among workers, the money will be raised in a ""progressive fashion"" - unlike say a VAT rise - with the highest earners paying the most. However, some very low earners, including some on the cusp of losing Â£1,000 in annual universal credit payments, will face higher tax bills of Â£100. And it is pretty clear that one of the rationales here is to be able to present a National Insurance increase of 1.25% as lower than the 2% rise in income tax that would have been required to raise such funds. The argument is almost entirely presentational and relies on a general public lack of familiarity with how National Insurance works. The tax rise on working is effectively 2.5%, with the direct burden shared between workers and their bosses. As the Treasury acknowledges, however, firms may reduce wages, or raise prices to pay the extra bill. So this is the big choice the government has made. The prize is that pensioners can have certainty about the cost of social care, and the least well off will have it paid for. Tax could have been raised on, for example, the inflating value of homes, especially at the point of their being inherited. The social care cost could have been spread more evenly on all forms of income, from savings to pensions, through income taxes. Instead, with some tweaks to apply it to those over the age of 66 from 2023, it will go on workers and work. It used to be called a ""jobs tax"". The hope is by earmarking it for health and care and separating out this levy on all tax bills, that the public won't mind.

"The government has confirmed a one-year suspension of the ""triple lock"" formula for annual state pension increases. The move follows government concern that a big post-pandemic rise in average earnings would have meant pensions increasing by 8%. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said the average earnings component would be disregarded in the 2022-23 financial year. Instead, the rise will be the consumer inflation rate or 2.5%. What is the triple lock and why has it been 'suspended'? Public finances at risk after Covid, says watchdog State pension age hits 66 and set to rise further ""Tomorrow, I will introduce a Social Security Uprating and Benefits Bill for 2022-23 only,"" she told the Commons. ""It will ensure the basic and new state pensions increase by 2.5% or in line with inflation, which is expected to be the higher figure this year, and as happened last year, it will again set aside the earnings element for 2022-23 before being restored for the remainder of this Parliament."" Ms Coffey said the figures had been ""skewed and distorted"" by the average earnings rise, which she described as a ""statistical anomaly"". She said the change meant that pensions would still rise, but less quickly. The triple lock would return the following year, she added. Under the triple lock, pensions increase by inflation, the increase in earnings between May and July or 2.5%, whichever is the greater. The Work and Pensions secretary said she was ""anticipating an unusual change in earnings"" due to the pandemic. She added that earnings between May and July were expected to rise by more than 8%, so a one-year adjustment was needed. Last month, the Bank of England said it was expecting inflation to peak at 4%. The Conservatives promised in their 2019 election manifesto to maintain the triple lock formula. Ms Coffey's announcement came just hours afterPrime Minister Boris Johnson breached another manifesto commitmentby increasing National Insurance to fund health and social care. Age UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said: ""If suspending the triple lock for a single year helps get a government deal on social care over the line, then I believe it's a price worth paying, but only if it really is just a one-off measure and not a sneaky way for ministers to ditch the triple lock altogether."" Ms Abrahams said that with more than two million pensioners currently living in poverty, there was ""a strong case"" for keeping the triple lock untouched. She added that it was ""imperative that the triple lock reverts to normal next year, to help all those pensioners on low and modest incomes who desperately need it"". The one-year break in the usual calculations for increases in the state pension was widely expected. There is, after all, near-universal agreement that the average annual earnings rise (one leg of the so-called triple lock) will be an anomaly caused by the economic effect of Covid. Charities representing the elderly will hold the government to its commitment that this is just a temporary arrangement. Their fear is that the government might be tempted to do the same again - potentially reducing rises in a state pension which is already low when compared with elsewhere in the Western world. Others will consider this as a missed opportunity to reform the universal triple lock system, even though its existence is a Conservative manifesto promise for the rest of this Parliament.

"Alice Thompson wanted to work shorter hours to pick her daughter up from nursery, but ended up resigning. The former estate agent spent tens of thousands of pounds pursuing the case against her former employer. She was awarded Â£185,000 by an employment tribunal and this week told the BBC it was ""a long, exhausting journey"". The tribunal ruled she had suffered indirect sex discrimination when the firm refused to consider her request. Ms Thompson was a successful sales manager at a small independent estate agents in central London before she became pregnant in 2018. ""I'd put my heart and soul into an estate agency career for more than a decade,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour. ""That's no mean feat, it's quite a male dominated environment to work in. And I'd worked really hard to build relationships with clients."" When she wanted to return to work after maternity leave, she asked her employer if she could work shorter hours, a four day week, and leave at 5pm, rather than the normal end-of-day at 6pm, to pick her daughter up from nursery. Breastfeeding mother's appeal over jury service New mother wins unfair dismissal case Her manager said they couldn't afford for her to work part time. ""I made a request for flexible working that wasn't seriously considered,"" Ms Thompson says. ""I proposed what would have worked for me. If that didn't work for the company, I would have been more than happy to hear a counter offer, what might work for them. ""If they needed me for the full hours, maybe eight 'til five instead of nine 'til six, that's something I could have worked around. ""But it was shut down, every avenue, not listened to, not considered. And I was left with no other option but to resign. ""How are mums meant to have careers and families? It's 2021 not 1971."" Are firms doing enough to support new mothers? She said she was motivated to pursue the legal challenge in order to prompt change. ""I've got a daughter and I didn't want her to experience the same treatment in 20, 30 years' time, when she's in the workplace."" She said her effort was worth it to ""stand up for what is right"". The tribunal found that the firm's failure to consider more flexible working put Ms Thompson at a disadvantage, and upheld her claim. The judge awarded her almost Â£185,000 for loss of earnings, loss of pension contributions, injury to feelings and interest. ""Losing a job unexpectedly is always a cause of unhappiness, shock, and sometimes anger, as shown by the way many employees react to redundancy, even when there has been proper consultation, and even when it is never suggested their performance was not good enough,""the tribunal found,external. ""Here the claimant resented that flexible working appeared not to be considered properly - as in our finding it was not - and felt that this was an injustice because of her sex, which it was."" A flexible working request could involve shorter hours, different start and finish times, a job share or doing your hours over fewer days (compressed hours) All employees who have been with a firm for at least 26 weeks have the right to make a flexible working request If you make a request, your employer must consider if fairly and make a decision within a maximum of three months Read more here from,external However several other claims Ms Thompson made regarding her treatment, including discrimination because of pregnancy and maternity, and harassment, were denied by the tribunal. The tribunal found that the director of the Manors estate agency, Paul Sellar, had moved a staff trip to New York from November to August so Ms Thompson could fly in when pregnant, and there were checks to see when the latest was that she could fly. When there, she did not join the other six for a boat trip. ""She did go shopping and then back to the hotel. In our finding she was upset that the others had had a good time drinking and were late back. She may have felt excluded, but it was not because of any action on the part of the respondent,""the judges said,external. On the return journey from New York, Mr Sellar commented that Ms Thompson did not seem to have enjoyed the trip, and she replied that she had felt isolated and became tearful. A few days later he suggested she should not have gone to New York. ""We can understand that Mr Sellar may have found her response ungrateful when the group trip had cost him Â£25,000,"" the judges said. While she was determined to pursue the legal action she told Woman's Hour it was challenging. ""It's a very emotional process once you've had a child. You have a new identity as a mum, you're trying to figure things out on that field, and then you're going back to work as well,"" said Ms Thompson. But she said workplaces that didn't support returning mothers risked ""missing out on some fantastic women, who have been really successful, because they are short-sighted and don't want to be flexible"". She said many women had reached out to her in the wake of the ruling, many of whom had similar experiences but didn't have the mental or financial capacity to pursue a claim. ""It did come at a huge financial cost... and obviously there's the risk you might not get that money back if you lose, but there's a greater picture to trying to make some small change in the world for the better.""
