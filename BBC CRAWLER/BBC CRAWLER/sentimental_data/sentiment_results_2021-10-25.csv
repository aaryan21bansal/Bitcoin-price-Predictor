"This video can not be played An exiled officer says the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman is a ""psychopath"". Saudi Arabia's crown prince suggested using a ""poison ring"" to kill the late King Abdullah, a former top Saudi intelligence official has alleged. In an interview with CBS, Saad al-Jabri said Mohammed bin Salman told his cousin in 2014 that he wanted to do so to clear the throne for his father. There were tensions within the ruling family at the time over the succession. The Saudi government has called Mr Jabri a discredited former official with a long history of fabrication. US softens towards Saudis after murder snub Saudi prince 'approved Khashoggi killing' - US Saudi prince denies sending hit squad to Canada In his interview with CBS's 60 Minutes programme,externalMr Jabri warned that Crown Prince Mohammed - Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler and the son of King Salman - was a ""psychopath, killer, in the Middle East with infinite resources, who poses threat to his people, to the Americans and to the planet"". He alleged that at a 2014 meeting the prince suggested to his cousin Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the then interior minister, that he could arrange the killing of King Abdullah. Mohammed bin Salman (L) replaced Mohammed bin Nayef (R) as crown prince in 2017 ""He told him: 'I want to assassinate King Abdullah. I get a poison ring from Russia. It's enough for me just to shake hand with him and he will be done,'"" Mr Jabri said. ""Whether he's just bragging... he said that and we took it seriously."" He said the matter was settled privately within the royal court. But he added that the meeting was secretly filmed and that he knew where two copies of the video recording were. Abdullah died at the age of 90 in 2015 and was succeeded by his half-brother Salman, Mohammed bin Salman's father, who named Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince. In 2017, Mohammed bin Nayef was replaced as heir to the throne by Mohammed bin Salman. He also lost his role as interior minister and was reportedly placed under house arrestbefore being detained last year on unspecified charges,external. Mr Jabri fled to Canada after Mohammed bin Nayef was ousted. He said in the interview that he was warned by a friend in a Middle Eastern intelligence service that Mohammed bin Salman was sending a hit team to kill him in October 2018, just days after Saudi agents murdered the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. He alleged that a six-person team landed at an airport in Ottawa but were deported after customs found they were carrying ""suspicious equipment for DNA analysis"". Last year,Mr Jabri accused the crown prince of attempted murderin a civil suit filed in a US federal court. The prince rejected the allegations. He has also denied any involvement in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, althoughUS intelligence agencies assessed that he approved the operation. King Abdullah (front left) was succeeded by his half-brother Salman (R) after he died in 2015 at the age of 90 The BBC has contacted the Saudi government for comment on the allegations. In a statement sent to CBS, the Saudi embassy in Washington labelled Mr Jabri as ""a discredited former government official with a long history of fabricating and creating distractions to hide the financial crimes he committed, which amount to billions of dollars, to furnish a lavish life-style for himself and his family"". Mr Jabri is being sued for corruption by various Saudi entities and a Canadian judge has frozen his assets saying there is ""overwhelming evidence of fraud"". He denies stealing any government money, saying his former employers rewarded him generously. In March 2020, Saudi authorities detained Mr Jabri's son Omar and daughter Sarahin what human rights groups said was an apparent effort to coerce him to return to Saudi Arabia,external. Last November, two months after their father sued the crown prince, the siblings were sentenced to nine and six-and-a-half years in prison respectively by a Saudi court after being convicted of money laundering and ""attempting to escape"" the country. They denied the charges. An appeals court upheld their sentences in a secret hearing at which they were not present.

"A new temporary injunction has been granted against environmental group Insulate Britain after protesters brought parts of London to a standstill. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the injunction covered the ""entire strategic road network"". ""Tonight this has been granted on a temp basis by the High Court,"" he tweeted on Monday evening. Earlier police arrested more than 50 people, some glued to the road. In a post on Twitter, Mr Shapps accused Insulate Britain, who blocked roads on 14 days over the five weeks to 14 October, of ""risking lives and ruining journeys"". There are already three specific injunctions in place against the group. Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? Insulate Britain blocks roads across east London Angry drivers confront protesters at M25 junction The transport secretary tweeted,external: ""The long term solution lies in changes to the Police, Crime, Sentencing & Courts Bill, giving additional powers against disruptive protests which target critical national infrastructure."" Insulate Britain, an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion, wants the government to insulate all UK homes by 2030 to cut carbon emissions. Members of the group targeted London's financial district in Canary Wharf and the City of London during Monday's rush hour, obstructing Limehouse Causeway as well as nearby Liverpool Street, Bishopsgate and Upper Thames Street. Demonstrators who glued their hands to the ground on Monday were removed from the road by officers before being arrested and led to police vehicles. Protesters blocked roads in London's financial district on Monday The previousinjunctions obtained by the government,externalban the group from demonstrations on the M25, around the Port of Dover and on major roads around London. These orders were granted to National Highways. In addition, Transport for London was granted a civil banning order earlier this month to prevent activists obstructing traffic on the city's roads -an order which was extended last week. Breaches of the injunctions could lead to jail terms. However, so far, the injunctions have failed to put a stop to the protests. Insulate Britain have also targeted motorways, including the M25 Earlier this month, the group, whose actions have led to angry exchanges with members of the public caught up in traffic disruption, suspended its campaigning for 11 days, from 14 October. But protesters vowed to restart its action if Prime Minister Boris Johnson did not deliver ""a meaningful or trustworthy statement"" on improving the insulation in some British homes. In a statement following the most recent arrests on Monday, Insulate Britain said: ""We won't stand by while the government kills our kids.""

"Campaigners are concerned about the impact of sewage discharges on many rivers Tory MPs have been defending themselves from accusations they have given the go-ahead to water companies to dump raw sewage in rivers. A proposal from the Lords to theEnvironment Bill,externalthat would have placed legal duties on the companies to reduce discharges was defeated by 265 MPs' votes to 202 last week. The MPs say safeguards already exist and new measures would cost billions. Critics say the UK is ""lecturing"" the world while its rivers are polluted. What's in the government's new environment bill? 'Only big changes' will tackle climate change MPs reject tougher air quality target What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all With just over a week to go until the UK hosts theCOP26 climate summit, there is intense focus on ministers' green credentials. Last Wednesday, 265 MPs voted with the government to reject an attempt by the House of Lords to toughen up the approach to the discharge of sewage, while 22 Conservative MPs rebelled and voted against the government. The move has sparked an uproar on social media. Peers had tabled an amendment to the Environment Bill that would have forced water companies and the government to demonstrate progressive reductions in discharges of untreated sewage and required them to ""take all reasonable steps"" to avoid using combined sewer overflows. But ministers said the changes were unnecessary because safeguards are already contained in the bill. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, former singer Fergal Sharkey, who now campaigns to clean up the nation's waterways, said it was a ""disgrace"". ""We're lecturing the rest of the planet on climate change yet the reality is there is not a single river in England that makes good overall environmental health,"" he said. He said ""every single river"" in England is polluted and ""a major cause is the water industry dumping sewage"". He added: ""The truth is what we are looking at is the result of a massive under-investment in infrastructure for the last 30 years and a complete failure of oversight and regulation of the industry by Ofwat, the environment agency and the government itself."" He said ministers were ""unwilling and incapable"" of dealing with the situation. Conservative Huw Merriman, who voted against the government and for the amendment, said ""what was being proposed by the government wasn't enough"" and he hoped ministers would ""be persuaded"" it was the right way to go. He said: ""To have sewage being discharged down streets, when there is too much rain, into the sea"" is ""just absolutely shocking"". ""It does mean more investment. That may ultimately mean more expensive bills, but we're talking about decades of investment and it's got to happen,"" he said. But fellow Conservative, Julie Marson, who voted against the amendment, said ""there is a lot of misinformation floating about"" on the issue and while the proposal itself was ""sound"", its ""fundamental flaw"" was that it ""had no plan as to how this can be delivered and no impact assessment whatsoever"". She wrote: ""The preliminary cost of the required infrastructure change was estimated to be between Â£150bn and Â£650bn. ""Unless we asked taxpayers to contribute, most of the water companies who would be carrying out this work would go bankrupt, meaning the work could not be completed anyway. ""The cost works out at between about Â£5,000 and Â£20,000 per household. ""I felt it would be unfair to sting local people with a bill of this size."" She said the existing legislation already placed a new duty on water companies to continuously monitor the water quality upstream and downstream of a storm overflow and of sewage disposal works. Another Conservative, Fay Jones, tweeted that the criticisms of MPs were ""deeply misleading"". She wrote: ""It ignores the massive flaw in the amendment (i.e forcing taxpayers to pay up to Â£600bn to dig up Victorian sewerage system) and the work the government is already doing to reduce discharge from storm overflows."" And Conservative, John Howell, said in a statement he voted against the amendment because ""it is necessary to be realistic"" given the age of the sewerage systems and the potential disruption to homes and businesses. The accusation that he voted to allow water companies to pump raw sewage into rivers ""is far from the truth"", he said. ""It would be just as fair to say that Liberal Democrat and Labour MPs voted to pump raw sewage into your home given that resolving the problem by their half-baked proposal of sewage discharges would require rebuilding the sewage system and could cost up to Â£600bn and take many years,"" he added. Water companies discharged raw sewage into rivers in Englandmore than 400,000 times last year, according to figures published by the Environment Agency. Untreated effluent, including human waste, wet wipes and condoms, was released into waterways for more than three million hours in 2020. The Environment Agency allows water utilities to release sewage into rivers and streams after extreme weather events such as prolonged heavy rain. This protects properties from flooding and prevents sewage from backing up into streets and homes. The agency says that overflows are ""not a sign that the system is faulty"", and that they are ""a necessary part of the existing sewerage system"". A government spokesperson said the amount of sewage discharge by water companies into rivers was ""not acceptable"". The spokesman added: ""We have made it crystal clear to water companies that they must significantly reduce sewage discharges from storm overflows as a priority. ""If we do not start to see significant improvements, we will not hesitate to take action through the new measures directly on water companies in the Environment Bill. ""We have provided over Â£3bn of investment to tackle pollution in rivers and we expect to see results."" The Environment Bill will return to the Lords on Tuesday, where peers are expected to re-insert the measures before it goes back to the House of Commons later this week.

"Millions of public sector workers are set to see their wages rise next year, after the government confirmed a pay freeze is being lifted. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will use his Budget on Wednesday to say nurses, teachers and members of the armed forces are among those set to benefit. A ""temporary pause"" in salary progression wasintroduced last Novemberas a response to the pandemic. Labour says tax and price rises mean families face a cost of living crisis. The public sector pay freeze was part of the government's response to what it described as the ""economic emergency"" caused by Covid, with only the lowest-paid excluded. Budget 2021: What has already been announced? Is there a gap between public and private sector pay? A simple guide to Budget 2021 In his spending review in November 2020, Mr Sunak said he could not justify an across-the-board increase when many in the private sector had seen their pay and hours cut in the crisis. The Treasury said exactly how much of a pay rise public sector workers receive depends on the recommendations from the independent pay review bodies, who set the pay for most frontline workforces - including nurses, police officers, prison officers and teachers. But asked if public sector pay would rise above inflation, a Downing Street spokesperson said the independent pay review body would consider what the rise should be and that No 10 couldn't ""pre-judge that process"". Separately, campaigners for a freeze in fuel duty have been told to expect the tax to be frozen for a twelfth year in a row at Wednesday's Budget. The BBC has also been toldVAT on household energy would not be cutwith the Treasury arguing it would be poorly targeted and that lower income households could be better helped through other schemes. 2010-12:Two-year pay freeze, excluding workers below Â£21,000 2013-17:Pay awards limited to an average of 1% per year 2018-20:No explicit pay policy 2021:One-year pay freeze, excluding NHS staff and workers earning below Â£24,000 In an announcement on Monday, the Treasury said the chancellor would use his forthcoming Budget to say ""the solid economic recovery and encouraging signs in the labour market"" mean the ""pay pause"" can be lifted. In a statement, Mr Sunak said: ""The economic impact and uncertainty of the virus meant we had to take the difficult decision to pause public sector pay. ""And now, with the economy firmly back on track, it's right that nurses, teachers and all the other public sector workers who played their part during the pandemic see their wages rise."" Union backlash over public sector pay freeze Economic emergency has only just begun, says Sunak Pay rebound for workers hit by the pandemic Business Minister Paul Scully said it was ""important public sector workers are recognised for what they do and are rewarded fairly"". He said it was part of a number of measures to help people on low incomes, which also included therise in the national living wage announced on Monday. He told BBC Breakfast: ""We know there are pressures. We know this is a difficult time for the economy, for people in the country in terms of the cost of living."" The Treasury said the ""temporary pause"" had helped ensure the gap between public and private sector pay did not widen further during the height of the pandemic. It said public sector average weekly earnings rose by 4.5% in 2020/21 whilst private sector wage increases were a third lower than they were pre-crisis, at 1.8%. On Tuesday figures from the Office for National Statistics showed thatworkers and occupations hardest hit by the pandemic saw the biggest rebound in pay in 2021, with employees aged under 21 and those in low-paid work seeing the sharpest dip and recovery. It comes at a time of fierce debate about the pressure families are under amid soaring energy bills and price rises for goods in shops. Opposition MPs have accused the Conservatives of presiding over a cost of living crisis withcuts to universal creditandtax rises to fund the NHS and social care. There is disquiet among some Conservative backbenchers too about whether ministers should be doing more to help struggling households. There may be an element of relief for some public sector workers that their pay will at at least not be frozen for another year. But it may not be enough to lift the bitterness many feel that in the year when many of them were key workers, often risking their health on the frontlines of the pandemic, they're coping with a real terms pay cut. Even nurses, who've received more than most, have seen their spending power shrink as inflation gets above 3%. And that renewed squeeze on living standards is getting worse with record petrol prices and energy bills driving up the cost of living. What shouldn't be taken at face value is the notion that the government ""can't afford"" to pay more. What a government that issues its own currency decides it can or cannot ""afford"" has no objective economic basis, but is a matter of political choice. For example, as the IFS points out, the cost of servicing debt is lower than it was pre-pandemic. In fact, it's the second lowest it's been since the 1950s. Even if official interest rates rise to 1.25%, they will still be historically low - and that is manageable as long as tax receipts are rising faster than the debt servicing cost. With teachers' pay in real terms 8% lower than a decade ago, hospital consultants 9% lower, NHS dentists 32% down, a reality is coming home: you can't get the work done if you can't attract the staff to do it. The cost of not allowing pay rises - in the harm it could to the government's other goals such as better public health and education - could have been higher than any pay rise. The UK's largest union, Unison, said the pay freeze would continue ""in all but name"" unless government departments get extra money. Its general secretary Christina McAnea said while there was ""never a good time to freeze public sector pay"", to do so ""at the peak of a pandemic was the height of folly"" while ""staff were doing their all to keep under-pressure services running"". She added: ""There can be no decent public services without the people to run them. ""Pay freezes don't help employers hold on to experienced staff, nor attract new recruits. ""But if the chancellor doesn't allocate extra money to government departments to fund the much-needed wage rises, the pay freeze will continue in all but name."" Torsten Bell of the Resolution Foundation described the announcement as ""blindingly obvious"" adding that it was ""totally inevitable"" the pay freeze would be lifted. ""What we don't know, is what is going to happen to public sector pay - lifting the freeze is one thing, but a rise could be anything between 0 to a million per cent pay rise."" Labour says many of those working on the frontline dealing with Covid are among those being hit by the government's choices. Shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Bridget Phillipson said: ""This Conservative government's choice last year to freeze pay for so many frontline workers, who have been among the real heroes of the pandemic, was damaging and unsustainable. ""The government must work to ensure a fair settlement and reflect the vital work of all key workers including many who have been burnt out over the course of the pandemic."" Meanwhile, the Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has told MPs it was""not acceptable"" to brief the mediaahead of MPs about the Budget. Sir Lindsay said that ministers used to ""walk"" if they briefed about a Budget.

"Bibaa Henry (left) and Nicole Smallman pictured at Ms Henry's birthday gathering at about 8pm - at which time their killer was on his way to the park ""Mina. Mina, we found a knife. Mina, I'm going to need you to sit down. I found them. I found them but they've gone."" With those words, Adam Stone extinguished Mina Smallman's last spark of hope that this story could have a happy ending. Over the previous two days she had become increasingly concerned about the oldest and youngest of her three daughters, unable to reach either Bibaa Henry or Nicole Smallman - the partner of Mr Stone. The police had seemed uninterested; Mrs Smallman felt there was a frustrating lack of urgency in searching for the sisters, who had been celebrating Ms Henry's 46th birthday at a country park. ""I said to the police: 'We don't know if there's been foul play here - we have no idea. We are now 36 hours on and they haven't turned up.' ""I knew instantly why they didn't care. They didn't care because they looked at my daughter's address and they thought they knew who she was. ""A black woman who lives on a council estate."" Mina Smallman, a former archdeacon, believes the police handled the disappearance of her daughters with a lack of urgency The news of the murders of Bibaa Henry and Nicole Smallman hit the headlines on Monday 8 June 2020. The two sisters had been repeatedly stabbed. Their bodies had been lying behind a line of trees at Fryent Country Park in Wembley, north-west London, since the very early hours of Saturday. Man guilty of murdering sisters in park stabbing Mr Stone and friends who had been with the women at the birthday gathering had already tried to raise the alarm. He knew something was wrong when neither woman could be contacted on Saturday. He knew it when Ms Smallman's flatmate said she had not come home, and when he couldn't trace his girlfriend with a phone-finding app, and when he saw that her bank account had not been accessed. He knew it when there was no answer to his frantic knocks at Ms Henry's front door. He had telephoned anyone he thought could shed light on the disappearance, including the police. Nothing. The two women had seemingly just vanished. Ms Henry and Ms Smallman were close despite an age gap of nearly 20 years Nina Esmat, a nurse who had been friends with Ms Henry since they were 16, was equally as convinced that something terrible had happened. And so, on Sunday 7 June Ms Esmat and Mr Stone made their separate ways to Fryent Country Park, where Ms Esmat found a pair of Ms Henry's sunglasses. ""I saw them glinting in the sun and my heart sank. I just knew she would not have left them behind."" She called the police who told her to take them to a local police station. Mr Stone and his parents continued to search. He found another pair of sunglasses, these belonging to Ms Smallman. He left them where they lay, in case the park became acknowledged as the crime scene it was. Mr Stone's father found a knife. Mr Stone saw shoes in the undergrowth. He had found his girlfriend. The woman he had been with for six years, who had lived with him at his parents' house. The co-owner of their pet bearded dragon. The last text message he received from her said: ""I'm dancing in a field."" The blue cushion in this photograph was later found bloodstained at a refuse centre Now, lifeless, she had been left intertwined with her equally motionless older sister. Their eyes were open, blank and dull. Stab wounds were visible on their bodies. Mr Stone dropped to his knees and screamed. ""It was like the whole world stopped at that point,"" his mother said. Mr Stone had to break the news to the others. He telephoned Mrs Smallman. He texted Ms Esmat. He used the same phrase: ""I found them. They're gone."" The bodies of Ms Henry and Ms Smallman had been concealed by a treeline at Fryent Country Park The events leading up to the attack were pieced together. Detectives soon determined the perpetrator was a stranger. There was no logic to the killing of Ms Henry and Ms Smallman. They were chosen because they were there. The evening had started so well. The picnic area had been decked out with blankets and cushions. Ms Esmat was the first to arrive and joined the sisters at the top of the hill. ""It was a beautiful evening, amazing view, amazing sunset. We were all taking pictures remarking on the sky at night."" They were only there because they had been following the rules. Social distancing meant Ms Henry could not celebrate her birthday indoors. She arranged a small gathering in the open air. There was food and drink, music and laughter, fairy lights and friends; and selfies that should have preserved memories of people doing their best to enjoy life during a strange summer of lockdown. Ms Henry ""had the heart of a lion"", her family said The sisters, thanks to the senseless actions of an insignificant teenager who thought he could do a deal with a demon, are at risk of being remembered as murder victims, forever associated with something that was done to them rather than by them, something out of their control. But Bibaa Henry was a strong woman. She was a mother, a daughter, a sister, a friend and a colleague. She fought for what was right; she was a fierce exponent for the more vulnerable members of society. She was ""a force of nature"" who lived in Brent in north-west London, an ""exceptional"" senior social worker at Buckinghamshire Council, ""just fantastic to be around"", had ""the biggest personality in the room"" and was a fervent advocate in safeguarding at-risk children and families. A ""lovely woman who was both serious and fun"", her luminous love for life drew people to her ""like a beacon in the darkness"". Before qualifying in social work Ms Henry had a job driving disabled children to their activities. Baby daughter beside her, she would get her young passengers singing and enjoying the journey. She was proud of her father, Herman Henry, the ABA featherweight champion of 1982 who set up his own building contracting company. She was proud of her mother Mina, who gave up office work to train as a teacher and later joined the priesthood, becoming the Church of England's first black female archdeacon. She was barely 5ft tall yet ""had the heart of a lion"" and ""a smile that would put the Blackpool Illuminations to shame"". Nicole Smallman was passionate about her work in documentary-making and theatre Nicole Smallman, 19 years younger than her elder sister, shared many of the same interests, especially in the arts. Laid-back and approachable, Ms Smallman was a photographer, a University of Westminster graduate and ""a joy to be around"". In comparison to Ms Henry's blinding incandescence Ms Smallman's personality was more diffuse; mellow and all-encompassing. Long-time family friend Ieuan Ledger said: ""You hear about people 'lighting up a room' when they walk in. But that description is almost too harsh for Nikki. ""When she walked into a room she was like a nightlight. It was subtle, protective, warm."" A talented artist, she was passionate about her work in documentary-making and theatre. She was also a singer and an actor with a speaking voice so ""silky smooth"" her teacher said she should do radio or TV presenting. She ""saw beauty in everything"", was friendly, enthusiastic and much-loved. Calm and positive, she was a strong supporter of humanitarian and environmental causes. Her parents, Mina and Christopher, would laughingly agree the baby of the family ""was a child of the '60s"", and beautiful both inside and out. Ms Smallman was ""like a nightlight - subtle, protective and warm"" Nicole Smallman with her ""godbrother"" Ieuan Ledger Mr Ledger's godmother is Mina Smallman. His mother, who went to university with Mrs Smallman, is Nicole's godmother. Mr Ledger and Ms Smallman called themselves ""godsiblings"". ""We were very close as children - as we became adults it was harder and harder to be as involved but she was still very much in my heart. I had a stuffed tiger she gave me, it was on my shelf well into my 20s. ""It really didn't sink in until a couple of months later when something snapped inside me and I realised that I was never going to see Bibaa or Nikki again. That was the hardest part. ""I have moments of blinding realisation. It felt like every bit of news got progressively more traumatic. Police taking selfies."" (Two officers have been charged with misconduct in public office). He added: ""Every single moment there was something new that made it even worse than it was."" When Mr Ledger heard of the killer's efforts to secure a big lottery win, ""there was a moment of sheer disbelief. To find out it was to do with just trying to win the lottery... it was beyond tragic. ""It's insulting. If it wasn't bad enough already, such a banal reason - it was insulting and offensive."" Bibaa Henry celebrated her 46th birthday with a small group of friends. It was her last Ms Smallman arranged the picnic with her big sister Mrs Smallman, who said the greatest fear of any parent is that they will outlive their children, described herself as ""broken beyond words"". ""The grief we feel is palpable, our beautiful and talented daughters gone."" She later said: ""I think the notion of 'all people matter' is absolutely right, but it's not true. Other people have more kudos in this world than people of colour. ""That's what gives me purpose - if their lives make a change in the way women are viewed, and black women in particular. ""In the pecking order of things we are the lowest on the ladder."" This is one of the last photographs taken of the sisters, only moments before they were attacked The final images Mrs Smallman's daughters captured on their phones are both haunting and poignant. Whirling lights and grinning, spinning sisters laughing at each other; stars wheeling overhead as they dance, and the soft apricot glow of London's night sky throwing the trees into gentle silhouette. But a teenager lurking just out of shot had also planned his evening - one of spilled blood, horrific violence and pointless sacrifice. The very last photograph was taken by the sisters at 01:13. It shows the two women looking distracted and glancing to their left. Then their world ended. PC Deniz Jaffer, 47, and PC Jamie Lewis, 32, have been charged with misconduct in public office by taking ""non-official and inappropriate photographs"" of the murder scene. Both officers have been suspended from duty. They are due at the Old Bailey on 13 July to enter a plea formally. They have said they are ""sorry beyond measure for the pain that they have caused"". The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is carrying out a separate inquiry into how the Met handled calls from worried relatives and friends of Ms Smallman and Ms Henry before their bodies were discovered.

"On Budget day the chancellor usually holds up a traditional red box full of financial documents On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Budget. He'll say how much of our money the government will take in taxes, and what they will spend it on. Each year, the chancellor of the exchequer - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement to MPs in the House of Commons. It outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. It also includes big decisions on what the government will spend money on - including health, schools, police and other public services. The Budget speech will be delivered onWednesday 27 October. It usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will give his response straight afterwards. This year's Autumn Budget is unusual for two reasons: It's the second of the year - there was a Budget in March too It comes on the same day asthe results of a spending review,external, which details how government will fund public services for the next three years After the speech, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors government spending - will publish a report on how the economy is doing. The Budget is likely to include help to support businesses and individuals recover from the economic effects of Covid. A number of measures have been announced in advance of the Budget, including a rise inthe minimum wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50and anend to the public sector pay freeze. The chancellor will likely set out some more details of the government's long term ambitions: Reducing the UK's net greenhouse emissions to zero by 2050 to combat climate change Levelling up - bringing jobs and investment to the poorer regions of the UK. Budget 2021: What has already been announced? Though many businesses are open again, the impact of the pandemic on government finances will last for years Measures such as thefurlough scheme- which finished at the end of September - were expensive, and government income is down because it collected less money in tax during the pandemic. To close the gap between higher spending and less money, the government has had to borrow more. In the year ending April 2021, the government borrowed Â£320bn - the highest figure seen outside wartime. Economists expect it to borrow around Â£180bn more this year, another enormous sum. During his Budget speech, the Chancellor will set out the latest borrowing forecasts for the years ahead. Where does the government borrow billions from? The government needs to cut the gap between what it spends and what it raises. One major tax rise was announced in September - the Â£12bnHealth and Social Care Levy. This broke a promise the Conservatives made at the last election, not to raise the three biggest taxes - income tax, national insurance and VAT. There has been speculation that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier. At the same time,the cost of living is rising. So the chancellor may want to cut some taxes, such as the amount of VAT pay on energy bills. He is also expected to announce major changes to the complicated alcohol tax system, which could see sparkling wine become cheaper. Six things that could affect you in the Budget Why is the cost of living going up? Overall government spending will rise next year, with big increases already announced for health and schools in England. The government has already said thatthe NHS in England will receive an extra Â£5.9bnto help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans. But other government departments, such as courts, prisons, local government and transport,are braced for cuts to their day-to-day budgetsnext year. They have already faced a decade of tight spending, and making further cuts will be painful. Could alcohol duty be reformed in the Budget? Some parts of the Budget, such as defence spending, affect the whole of the UK. Others, such as education, only affect England. This is because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions. Scotland has income tax-raising powers, which means its rates differ from the rest of the UK. The Scottish government will publish its Budget on 9 December. If the government announces extra spending on areas that only affect England, the other nations get an equivalent extra sum of money to spend as they choose, according to a rulecalled the Barnett formula.

"This video can not be played Lindsay Hoyle says it is ânot acceptable"" for ministers to give briefings to the media before Parliament. The Treasury has released a deluge of funding announcements, days before the chancellor delivers his Budget on 27 October. Statements from the government setting out spending for transport, health and education have been put out in the past few days. Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is furious, telling MPs on Monday it was ""not acceptable"" to brief the media ahead of MPs and on Tuesday that the government was behaving in a ""discourteous manner"". He thundered that ministers used to ""walk"" if they briefed about a Budget. Indeed, in 1947, then-Chancellor Hugh Dalton resigned after he leaked details of his budget to a journalist. Defending pre-Budget announcements, Treasury Minister Simon Clarke said the government had not commented on the ""substantive tax measures"" that would appear in the Budget. So what do we know? Firstly, this isn't the complete story. Rishi Sunak's Budget won't all be about displays of generosity. The Treasury has asked departments to identify ""at least 5% of savings and efficiencies from their day-to-day budgets"" and we may hear more about those plans on Wednesday. The government has already committed to spending for health, schools, defence and overseas aid so other areas such as local government, justice and further education may face a squeeze on their budgets. And there may be more to some of the seemingly lavish spending pledges than meets the eye. A simple guide to Budget 2021 Analysis by political correspondent Damian Grammaticas Beware what you are reading! They sound good, all these announcements in the run up to Budget and Spending Review. But they need to be taken with caution. This is the PR blitz seeking good headlines. We don't yet know the detail of exactly what the government is planning. The raft of investments will make a difference. But there are questions. Are the transport links, treatment centres and other projects entirely new or have some parts been announced (with equal fanfare) before now? Crucially what is happening more broadly to the budgets of the departments getting cash? A shiny investment in something is great, but is that department's day-to-day spending being squeezed? And what of those areas that aren't getting the handouts? Best to wait until Wednesday to truly judge the chancellor's largesse. The government has announced that England's city regions will receive Â£6.9bn to spend on train, tram, bus and cycle projects. This includes Â£1.07bn for Greater Manchester, Â£1.05bn for the West Midlands and Â£830m for West Yorkshire. However, the figure of Â£6.9bn only includes Â£1.5bn of additional spending because the government is including the Â£4.2bn promisedin 2019alongside funding for buses announced by the prime minister last year. The chancellor has refused to be drawn on the future of the eastern leg of High Speed Two, which could be delayed or cancelled to save an estimated Â£40bn.  If built, the extension would cut journey times between London and the North East by 31 minutes. It would also shave 52 minutes off trips between London and Leeds. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding through the Barnett formula - a mechanism the UK government uses to allocate additional money to the devolved nations when it spends more in England. City regions to get Â£6.9bn for public transport Government urged to make a decision on HS2 route NHS England will get Â£5.9bn to tackle the backlog of people waiting for tests and scans. That covers Â£2.3bn for diagnostic tests including clinics in shopping centres for scans; Â£1.5bn on beds equipment and new ""surgical hubs""; and Â£2.1bn to improve IT. Health bodies welcomed the money but warned it would not solve the problem of staff shortages. According to data published by NHS digital, in June there were 93,806 full-time vacancies across the NHS in England. NHS in England to get Â£5.9bn to cut waiting lists Mr Sunak is set to announce a rise in the National Living Wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50, to come into effect from 1 April next year. This is a 6.6% increase in the minimum wage for all those aged 23 and over - more than twice the current 3.1% rise in the cost of living. Assuming a 40 hour week, the new minimum wage amounts to a salary of Â£1,646 per month or Â£19,760 a year. The increases to the wage rates follow recommendations made by the Low Pay Commission, an independent advisory board. The Treasury has also announced it will be lifting a pay freeze imposed on millions of public sector workers last year as a result of the pandemic. Independent pay review bodies will recommend how much extra money workers will get early next year. National Living Wage set to rise to Â£9.50 an hour Public sector workers set for pay rise - Sunak The government's major tax change has already been announced, as earlier this year the prime minister told MPs he would introduce a tax in England designed to tackle the NHS backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and later to pay for social care. However, we know a few other changes (or rather lack of changes) that will be announced on Wednesday. Campaigners for a freeze in fuel duty have been told to expect the levy to be frozen for a twelfth year in a row. And separately, the BBC has been told VAT on household energy would not be cut. No VAT cut to household energy bills in Budget The health department will get Â£5bn over the next three years for research and development. This includes Â£95m which will go towards researching methods for treating cancer, obesity and mental health. The money will also be spent on developing genome technology which could detect more than 200 conditions in newborn babies. Â£2.6bn will be spent on creating 30,000 new school places for children with special educational needs and disabilities. The money will also go towards improving school buildings' accessibility and funding new, special provision in free schools England. The Budget will also include Â£1.6bn over three years to roll out new T-levels for 16 to 19-year-olds plus Â£550m for adult skills in England. Currently there are over 6,000 on T-level courses, but the government hopes to ramp up those numbers. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, warned that the extra money was a ""gamble"" as it was unclear how many would want to take the qualification. The government will also spend a further Â£830m modernising colleges in England. Chancellor to pledge funds for skills training What will teenagers study for the new T-levels? The Treasury is allocating Â£1.8bn for building around 160,000 new homes on derelict or unused land - also known as brownfield sites - in England. An extra Â£9m will also go towards allowing councils to turn neglected urban spaces into ""pocket parks"" roughly the size of a tennis court. The chancellor is also expected to confirm Â£65m for digitising England's planning system. Budget: Â£2bn for new homes on derelict land Grants worth Â£1.4bn will be given to ""internationally mobile"" companies to invest in UK infrastructure. This includes Â£345m aimed at increasing resilience for future pandemics and Â£800m for the production of electric vehicles in north-east England and the Midlands. As part of the package, a talent network team will aim to attract high-skilled workers to the UK, through ""innovation hotspots"" initially based in San Francisco and Boston in the US and Bengaluru in India. The government has announced Â£500m to support parents and children in England. This includes Â£200m to support families with complex issues; Â£82m to fund centres in 75 different areas to provide advice for parents; Â£100m for mental health support for expectant parents; and Â£50m for breastfeeding support. Labour has argued that the government previously closed over 1,000 children's centres - known as Sure Start centres - and that this new announcement ""rings hollow"". Mr Sunak defended past cuts, arguing that the new funding would ""create a network of family hubs which are broader than the Sure Start centres"". Ministers pledge Â£500m to support young families Â£850m to restore museums and art galleries including the V&A in London and Tate Liverpool; Â£125m for a scientific research centre in Oxfordshire and Â£75m for regional museums Â£700m to protect UK borders including Â£74m for a new fleet of patrol boats Â£700m for football pitches, tennis courts and youth facilities Â£435m to prevent crime, protect communities and help victims in England and Wales Â£150m for the British Business Bank to encourage development of Dragons' Den-style regional investors outside of London and south east Â£5m for research grants to develop new surgery and treatment options for amputees and blast victims A tax change to encourage shipping companies to the UK Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

"This video can not be played The BBC goes behind the scenes with Sir David Attenborough on the set of his new documentary, The Green Planet ""If we don't act now, it'll be too late."" That's the warning from Sir David Attenborough ahead of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. The broadcaster says the richest nations have ""a moral responsibility"" to help the world's poorest. And it would be ""really catastrophic"" if we ignored their problems, he told me in a BBC News interview. ""Every day that goes by in which we don't do something about it is a day wasted,"" he said. Sir David and I were speaking at Kew Gardens in London during filming for a new landmark series, The Green Planet, to be aired on BBC1 next year. Attenborough warns leaders over extinction crisis Greta Thunberg to march at Glasgow climate protest Attenborough: World 'changing habits' on plastic Our conversation ranged from the latest climate science to the importance of COP26 to the pace of his working life. The UN climate science panel recently concluded that it is ""unequivocal"" that human activity is driving up global temperatures. And Sir David said that proved that he and others had not been making ""a fuss about nothing"", and that the risks of a hotter world are real. Extreme weather such as drought will increase as the world gets warmer ""What climate scientists have been saying for 20 years, and that we have been reporting upon, you and I both, is the case - we were not causing false alarms. ""And every day that goes by in which we don't do something about it is a day wasted. And things are being made worse"". But he said the report had not convinced everyone and that they are acting as a brake on efforts to tackle climate change. ""There are still people in North America, there are still people in Australia who say 'no, no, no, no, of course it's very unfortunate that there was that forest fire that absolutely demolished, incinerated that village, but it's a one-off'. ""Particularly if it's going to cost money in the short term, the temptation is to deny the problem and pretend it's not there. ""But every month that passes, it becomes more and more incontrovertible, the changes to the planet that we are responsible for that are having these devastating effects."" His call for an urgent response reflects the latest scientific assessment that to avoid the worst impacts of rising temperatures, global carbon emissions need to be halved no later than 2030. That's why the coming years are described as ""the decisive decade"" and why the COP26 talks are so crucial for getting the world on a safer path now. As things stand, emissions are projected to continue rising rather than starting to fall, and Sir David was sounding more exasperated than I've heard before. ""If we don't act now, it will be too late,"" he said. ""We have to do it now."" We turned to the question of responsibility, a highly contentious issue which will loom large at the conference. Developing countries have for years accused the richest nations, which were the first to start polluting the atmosphere, of failing to shoulder their share of the burden. The argument is that they should be making the deepest cuts in carbon emissions and providing help to those who need it most.  A long-standing promise of $100bn a year for low carbon development and to build stronger defences against more violent weather has yet to be fulfilled - reaching that total will be a key test of whether COP26 succeeds or fails. Bangladesh, on the UN's list of Least Developed Countries, is battling river erosion due to climate change For Sir David, this is one of the most worrying challenges, and he says it would be ""really catastrophic"" if threats to the poorest nations were ignored. ""Whole parts of Africa are likely to be unliveable - people will simply have to move away because of the advancing deserts and increasing heat, and where will they go? Well, a lot of them will try to get into Europe. ""Do we say, 'Oh, it's nothing to do with us' and cross our arms? ""We caused it - our kind of industrialisation is one of the major factors in producing this change in climate. So we have a moral responsibility. ""Even if we didn't cause it, we would have a moral responsibility to do something about thousands of men, women and children who've lost everything, everything. Can we just say goodbye and say this is no business of ours?"" Finally I asked about his own hectic workload at the age of 95 - from filming documentaries to addressing the G7 summit, the UN Security Council and the Duke of Cambridge's Earthshot Prize. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Six ways the UK could tackle climate change Why the COP26 climate summit is important What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? How extreme weather is linked to climate change ""I don't plan very far ahead - as you say, I'm 95. How long can you go on? It isn't within our gift to say those things or to know those things. ""All I know is that if I get up tomorrow and I feel that I'm able to do a decent day's work, then I shall jolly well do it and be grateful. ""And the day is going to come when I'm going to get out of bed and say, I don't think I can do that. When that's going to be, who knows? I don't."" Having watched him filming for five hours straight, and remaining not only focused but also good-humoured, I suggested that he still loved what he was doing. ""At the moment, I feel it would be a waste of an opportunity just to back out and not do the things I think are very important to do in which I am well placed to do."" And the next major engagement in the Attenborough diary? Nothing less than speaking, virtually or in-person, to what's set to be the largest ever gathering of global leaders on British soil: COP26, in a few days' time.

"This video can not be played Watch: Frances Haugen tells MPs that Facebook ""unquestionably"" makes hate worse Whistleblower Frances Haugen has told MPs Facebook is ""unquestionably making hate worse"", as they consider what new rules to impose on big social networks. Ms Haugen was talking to the Online Safety Bill committee in London. She said Facebook safety teams were under-resourced, and ""Facebook has been unwilling to accept even little slivers of profit being sacrificed for safety"". And she warned that Instagram was ""more dangerous than other forms of social media"". While other social networks were about performance, play, or an exchange of ideas, ""Instagram is about social comparison and about bodies... about people's lifestyles, and that's what ends up being worse for kids"", she told a joint committee of MPs and Lords. She said Facebook's own research described one problem as ""an addict's narrative"" - where children are unhappy, can't control their use of the app, but feel like they cannot stop using it. ""I am deeply worried that it may not be possible to make Instagram safe for a 14-year-old, and I sincerely doubt that it is possible to make it safe for a 10-year-old,"" she said. The committee is fine-tuning a proposed law that will place new duties on large social networks and subject them to checks by the media regulator Ofcom. Asked if the law was ""keeping Mark Zuckerberg awake at night"", Ms Haugen said she was ""incredibly proud of the UK for taking such a world-leading stance"". ""The UK has a tradition of leading policy in ways that are followed around the world. ""I can't imagine Mark isn't paying attention to what you're doing."" Ms Haugen also warned that Facebook was unable to police content in multiple languages around the world - something which should worry UK officials, she said. ""UK English is sufficiently different that I would be unsurprised if the safety systems that they developed primarily for American English were actually under-enforcing in the UK,"" she said. And she said that dangerous misinformation in other languages affects people in Britain. Facebook earns $9bn despite whistleblower scandal Online safety plans need more clarity, says Twitter Facebook fined Â£50m by UK competition watchdog ""Those people are also living in the UK, and being fed misinformation that is dangerous, that radicalises people,"" she warned. Ms Haugen also urged the committee to include paid-for advertising in its new rules, saying the current system was ""literally subsidising hate on these platforms"" because of their algorithmic ranking. ""It is substantially cheaper to run an angry hateful divisive ad than it is to run a compassionate, empathetic ad,"" she said. And she also urged MPs to require a breakdown of who is harmed by content, rather than an average figure - suggesting Facebook is ""very good at dancing with data"", but pushes people towards ""extreme content"". Ms Haugen appeared at a joint committee of MPs and Lords ""The median experience on Facebook is a pretty good experience,"" she said. ""The real danger is that 20% of the population has a horrible experience or an experience that is dangerous,"" she said. She warned that employees were unable to report internal concerns at Facebook - something she called a ""huge weak spot"". ""When I worked on counter-espionage, I saw things where I was concerned about national security, and I had no idea how to escalate those because I didn't have faith in my chain of command at that point,"" she told the committee. And she warned: ""We were told to accept under-resourcing."" Similar problems plague Facebook's Oversight Board, which can overturn the company's decisions on content, she said. She repeated her claim that Facebook has repeatedly lied to its own watchdog, and said this is a ""defining moment"" for the Oversight Board to ""step up"". ""I don't know what the purpose of the Oversight Board is,"" she said. This video can not be played Facebook's Monika Bickert: ""It's in our financial interest to make sure that people have a good experience on our site"" It comes as several news outlets published fresh stories based on the thousands of leaked documents Ms Haugen took with her when she left Facebook. Facebook has characterised previous reporting as misleading, and at one point referred to the leaked documents as ""stolen"". ""Contrary to what was discussed at the hearing, we've always had the commercial incentive to remove harmful content from our sites,"" a spokesperson said, after Ms Haugen finished giving evidence. ""People don't want to see it when they use our apps, and advertisers don't want their ads next to it. That's why we've invested $13bn (Â£9.4bn) and hired 40,000 people to do one job: keep people safe on our apps. "" The company said that over the last three quarters it has halved the amount of hate speech seen on Facebook, which it claims now accounts for only 0.05% of all content viewed. ""While we have rules against harmful content and publish regular transparency reports, we agree we need regulation for the whole industry so that businesses like ours aren't making these decisions on our own,"" the spokesperson said. ""The UK is one of the countries leading the way and we're pleased the Online Safety Bill is moving forward."" An avalanche of information emerged on Monday from leaked Facebook documents - and it was hard to keep up. Allegations include that the social media giant is aware of its role in inciting violence all around the world, or causing harm to its users from US and UKto India,externalandEthiopia,external. A common theme runs through each of the stories. They all suggest a tension between employees raising the alarm about their concerns and a corporate machine that does not appear to be using this to inform its policies. Reporters and journalists have been highlighting many of these same concerns, especially for the past 18 months. I've investigatedthe human cost of online disinformationandabuse again and againand exposed the damage being done to real people offline using these sites.

"Twenty-two people died in the bombing on 22 May 2017 The decision not to question the Manchester Arena bomber after he returned to the UK from Libya four days before the attack was a mistake, a senior MI5 officer has conceded. The officer, referred to as Witness J, told the Manchester Arena Inquiry Salman Abedi was assessed in the months before the 22 May 2017 bombing. He said ""no intelligence"" indicating a threat to national security was found. But he conceded it was an error not to ask police to question Abedi on 18 May. The inquiry has begun looking at what was known about the 22-year-old before the attack, which saw 22 people die and hundreds more suffer injuries in a bombing at the venue on 22 May 2017. The hearing was told that from December 2013 to January 2017, Abedi was identified as being in direct contact with three ""subjects of interest"", one who was suspected of planning travel to Syria, one who had links to al-Qaeda and a third who had links to extremists in Libya. Between April 2016 and April 2017, he was identified as a second-level contact with three more ""subjects of interest"", all with suspected links to the Islamic State terror group. Witness J, appearing in court inside a bespoke wooden box and shielded from victims' families to maintain his anonymity, was asked by Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, if increased contact with ""a person of an extremist mindset"" would increase ""the concern [someone] might share their mindset?"" Witness J said it did not ""necessarily follow"" that having contact was ""a cumulative risk"". ""We have to make very fine judgments about whether someone meets the threshold of investigation,"" he said. ""A second-level contact is a contact of a contact. ""I'm not sure that... indicates a cumulative risk developing."" Manchester attack: Who were the victims? Bomber's brother is a coward, families say Terrorist told to assist to help families The inquiry was told Abedi had himself been made a ""subject of interest"" for five months, but his file was closed in July 2014, due to a ""lack of engagement"" with extremists. Witness J was asked about two prison visits by Abedi, the second of which was in January 2017. Mr Greaney asked him if the visits, along with the other intelligence, should have led to Abedi being designated a ""subject of interest"" once again. Witness J said there was ""no intelligence to indicate that the contact was related to Abedi posing a threat to national security"". ""The decision to not open [an investigation] was a reasonable one,"" he added. The hearing was also told that twice in the months prior to the attack, intelligence was received by MI5 about Abedi which was highly relevant to the planned attack but was assessed at the time to relate to non-terrorist criminality. Abedi's name also hit a ""priority indicator"" during a separate ""data-washing exercise"" as falling within a small number of former subjects of interest who merited further consideration. The hearing was also told an assessment on 1 May 2017 had concluded Abedi should be considered for further investigation and a meeting to consider that conclusion was scheduled for 31 May. Witness J conceded it was a mistake not to ask police to stop and question Abedi on his return to the UK on 18 May. The bomber immediately took a taxi to a store of explosives and set about making his final attack preparations. Asked by Mr Greaney if it had been a missed opportunity, Witness J said stopping him ""would have been the better course of action"". Inquiry chairman Sir John Saunders said MI5 had known Abedi was in contact with terrorist suspects and his father had been involved in such activities in Libya, adding that he looked like an ""obvious candidate"" to be involved in terrorism himself. Witness J had earlier told the inquiry Abedi's extremist views were ""likely to have been influenced by his father Ramadan Abedi"". The court has previously heard Ramadan Abedi has refused to help the inquiry and remains a suspect in the police investigation into the atrocity. Sir John asked Witness J about why Salman Abedi had not been referred to the Prevent counter-extremism scheme when he was closed as a subject of interest in July 2014. The witness said consideration of a Prevent referral was not ""policy"" at the time and that it was a ""reasonable"" decision not to refer Abedi. Sir John said it was a government de-radicalisation scheme and ""MI5 didn't take advantage of it"". The inquiry continues.

"A joint group of unions is calling for targeted industrial action as part of a long-running dispute Unions representing rail and council workers have confirmed plans for strike action during the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow. Cleaners, refuse and recycling workers are among staff who could take industrial action from 8 November. ScotRail could also be hit by strikes from 1 November after the RMT's AGM in Leeds rejected the latest pay offer. The Scottish government has set a deadline of Wednesday for the rail union to accept its pay offer. Ministers also said ScotRail will now go ahead and implement the pay rise for members of three other trade unions which accepted its offer, as well as non-unionised ScotRail workers. Sturgeon: Credible action needed on climate crisis How are COP26 road closures affecting Glasgow? Sturgeon: Credible action needed on climate crisis COP26 strikes and closures during Glasgow summit Transport Minister Graeme Dey said the government was ""utterly perplexed"" at the RMT position while the union hit back at the ""arbitrary"" Wednesday deadline. About 120 world leaders are expected to attend the crucial United Nations summit from 31 October to 12 November. A joint trade union group, including Unison, Unite and the GMB, is seeking a Â£2,000 flat rate pay increase or 6%, whichever is greater, from Scotland's local authority umbrella body Cosla. It has now notified councils that it will call on some school cleaners, caterers and janitors along with waste, recycling and maintenance staff to take ""targeted"" strike action during the second week of the summit. Wendy Dunsmore, of Unite,  said: ""The incredible professionalism and sacrifice by local government workers has not been recognised during the Covid-19 pandemic."" Johanna Baxter, of Unison, said more than half of local government workers earned under Â£25,000 a year and many were at ""breaking point"". Drew Duffy, of the GMB union, added:  ""It's been over 18 months since any of these key workers had a pay rise and that is a disgrace given the work they have done over the last 18 months."" Cosla has offered an Â£850 flat rate rise for the lowest paid staff and 2% for those paid less than Â£40,000 a year. A spokesman said: ""We appreciate everything that local government workers have been doing, and continue to do, to support people and communities during the pandemic and as we begin to recover. We continue with ongoing constructive negotiations."" Earlier, the AGM of the RMT union confirmed plans for strike action by ScotRail staff from 1 to 12 November, almost the entire duration of the summit. The union described the offer of a 2.5% increase this year, 2,2% in 2022 and a one-off Â£300 bonus for staff working during the summit as ""pitiful"". Three other rail unions, Unite, Aslef and the TSSA have already accepted the offer. Transport Minister Graeme Dey said: ""We remain utterly perplexed at the position the RMT leadership is taking here. While we think their action is misguided and does their members no favours, we, of course,  respect the right of trade unions to do what they think is appropriate for their membership. ""But we are clear that this is a fair and good offer that will put cash in the pockets of rail workers who have worked hard during the pandemic. This is evidenced by the fact that the three other rail unions (Aslef, Unite and TSSA) have accepted it. ""ScotRail, with the full support of the Scottish government, has tried a number of times to reach a deal with the RMT leadership - as of yesterday, the offer being made to its members consisted of a 4.7% pay increase over this and next year, a Â£300 payment for COP26, an additional payment equivalent to three hours salary for booking on for a Rest Day shift for the rest of the year. ""That last enhancement was offered just yesterday, and we understood that we were close to agreement with negotiators apparently happy with the offer, RMT leaders have then moved the goalposts."" The RMT said it had been given an ""arbitrary"" deadline to accept the pay offer by Wednesday, but said strikes on both ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper services could still be avoided. General secretary Mike Lynch said: ""Our message to Nicola Sturgeon, Transport Scotland, Abellio and Serco is that there is still time to resolve the pay disputes but it requires some serious movement, the lifting of bogus deadlines and genuine talks."" Meanwhile, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg has invited Glasgow workers who plan on striking during COP26 to join her in a protest march through the city. She said she would be taking part in the Climate Strike march from Kelvingrove Park to George Square. She wrote on Twitter: ""On Friday Nov 5 I'll join the climate strike in Glasgow - during #COP26 Climate justice also means social justice and that we leave no one behind. ""So we invite everyone, especially the workers striking in Glasgow, to join us. See you there!"" The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"Proof of vaccine status can be given using a smartphone app The first weekend of enforcement of Scotland's vaccine passport scheme was an ""unmitigated disaster"", according to a body representing night-time venues. Venue staff refused entry to revellers without vaccine passports more than 550 times, and some staff were abused, the Scottish Hospitality Group said. It said some venues decided to close early and footfall was down by up to 40%. The Scottish government said the scheme was a ""proportionate"" health measure. Ministers say it will encourage more people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and ensure late-night venues can remain open during a ""potentially very difficult"" winter. Vaccine passport scheme enforceable by law Scotland's vaccine passport scheme goes live The vaccine certification scheme was introduced on 1 October but there was no enforcement during a 17-day ""grace period"" as venues adjusted to the new requirements. The Scottish Hospitality Group, which opposes the scheme, said the first real test this weekend had been ""one of unmitigated disaster"". ""The Scottish Hospitality Group has been warning the government for weeks that their vaccine passports scheme is not ready - but the government's attitude has been to tell us to 'get on with it' whilst offering no safety net of support for businesses or our hard working staff,"" spokesperson Stephen Montgomery said. ""The experience of this weekend shows that the result has been intolerable levels of abuse of our staff, and the creation of an atmosphere that will totally undermine anyone's enjoyment of our night-time venues."" People attending nightclubs and other large venues have to be able to show proof of two Covid jabs The group said there was a ""concerning number"" of reports of staff being abused over rejections and queues which led to a ""charged atmosphere"". Some venues had decided to close at midnight, taking them outside the scope of the scheme, because of problems with staff recruitment and welfare, it said. Mr Montgomery rejected a suggestion that the numbers being turned away was a sign the scheme was working properly in keeping unvaccinated people away from higher risk settings. ""Turning people away at the door - yes, I get the point to a degree - but all it's doing is sending them somewhere else, a dancefloor that has tables and chairs on it that does away with dancing,"" he told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programme. The Scottish Conservatives said the scheme was ""unworkable and unreasonable"" with no financial support for businesses or their staff. The party's Covid recovery spokesperson Murdo Fraser said: ""What is most concerning is the levels of abuse hospitality workers have been subjected to, caused by a lack of public engagement, and a frustrating and unreliable app."" The Scottish government insisted it was continuing to engage with the sector to discuss implementation of the scheme. A spokesperson said: ""Covid-19 certification is a proportionate way of encouraging people to get vaccinated, and also of helping large events and night-time hospitality to keep operating during what will potentially be a very difficult winter. ""This means many businesses will not have to close and can continue to trade whilst making necessary adjustments to ensure their premises are as safe as possible for staff and customers."" People who have had two vaccines in Scotland candownload or get a paper copy of a certificate with a QR code,external. Everyone over the age of 18 must now show - if asked - that they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to certain venues and events. These include: Nightclubs and ""analogous venues"" Adult entertainment venues Unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, even if some are seated Unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people Any event with more than 10,000 people in attendance The scheme requires venues to put in place a ""reasonable system"" to check the status of customers, with certain exemptions on medical grounds. For large events such as football matches spot checks can be used, but for smaller gatherings more rigorous checking is required. WHERE?Where in Scotland are the latest cases?

"Workers on the minimum wage are set to get a pay boost from April, with the rate for those aged over 23 rising to Â£9.50 an hour from Â£8.91. The rise means a full-time worker will get Â£1,074 extra a year before tax. The move will be announced at this week's Budget and follows the recommendation of independent advisers, the Low Pay Commission. The government has faced pressure to help low-paid, younger workers, who are among the worst hit by the pandemic. The 6.6% increase in the minimum pay rate for those aged over 23 - known as the National Living Wage - is more than twice the current 3.1% rise in the cost of living. Minimum pay rates for younger workers are also set to go up. The National Minimum Wage for people aged 21-22 will rise from Â£8.36 to Â£9.18 an hour and the Apprentice Rate will increase from Â£4.30 to Â£4.81 an hour. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the rise ""ensures we're making work pay and keeps us on track to meet our target to end low pay by the end of this Parliament"". But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, described it as an ""underwhelming offer"" that would be mostly swallowed up by tax rises, universal credit cuts and higher energy bills. National Living Wage for over-23s: From Â£8.91 to Â£9.50 an hour National Minimum Wage for those aged 21-22: From Â£8.36 to Â£9.18 National Minimum Wage for 18 to 20-year-olds: From Â£6.56 to Â£6.83 National Minimum Wage for under-18s: From Â£4.62 to Â£4.81 The Apprentice Rate: From Â£4.30 to Â£4.81 How much is the minimum wage? Finn Oldfield, 23, earns the National Living Wage for his communications job at the People's Powerhouse social enterprise. He lives at home with his parents in Widnes, but said the increase would help him move to Liverpool city centre, which was unaffordable before the rise. ""It's hard if you're from a regional town. I have a politics and philosophy degree from Edinburgh University and thought I'd be able to find opportunities,"" Mr Oldfield told the BBC. After graduating last year in the middle of the pandemic, Mr Oldfield found his role through the government's Kickstart scheme, which encourages six-month jobs with businesses for people aged 16-24 who are currently claiming universal credit. ""With no rent control and higher energy prices, I think this will offset perhaps the harshest of the blows that have come,"" he said. ""But I think there's more that could be done by the government to help with rising everyday costs."" Campaign group the Living Wage Foundation welcomed the increases, but said there was still ""a substantial gap"" between the government-mandated minimum wage and its own calculations of a real living wage based on living costs. The foundation's director, Graham Griffiths, called on employers to ""commit to go beyond this new government minimum, do the right thing, and commit to pay a real living wage"". Salima Vellani, founder of restaurant chain Absurd Bird, says although higher wages will be ""tougher"" on the hospitality sector, increasing the minimum wage ""is the right move"". ""It is hard work, it's unsociable hours, so if people are leaving the industry in droves, then we have to attract them back,"" she said. ""That's not just about pay, it's about training."" Ms Vellani said agreeing with the minimum wage rise ""might be going against the grain, with all the labour issues we are facing"", but added her company had been pushing up wages generally to retain staff. ""You're going to have to pass some of this on to consumers, if your costs are going up,"" said the restaurant owner. ""It's going to be a challenge for a lot of operators who are facing extreme costs. ""If we what produce is good enough, people will keep buying from us."" Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the National Living Wage increase was ""very welcome"", but would ""not remotely compensate"" forthe cut to universal credit. He said the universal credit change affected 4.4 million families, whereas only 2.2 million workers were on the living wage. The minimum wage that workers should get depends on their age and whether they are apprentices. Employers often worry that a higher minimum wage will lead to more unemployment, and that they will be forced to lay off workers in order to afford the increases. But independent experts maintain there has been little or no evidence of job losses as a result of rising minimum wage levels. Giving millions of workers a 6.6% pay rise sounds generous and will be a welcome boost to many pay packets. It also follows the government's - and particularly the prime minister's - narrative of pushing towards a higher-wage economy. Yet this would be no bumper pay day for low-income families. They spend a higher proportion of income than others on heating and lighting their homes. Hefty gas and electricity bill rises, on top of recent increases this month, are inevitable in the spring. Prices in the shops are going up and many economists believe the increases could last longer than previously expected. Finally, a National Living Wage rise is not compensation for welfare cuts, such as a removal of theÂ£20-a-week universal credit uplift, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies has consistently pointed out. Not all of those receiving benefits are in work, and for low-income employees who are, a rise in wages can mean a reduction in their benefits. Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said wage increases needed to be matched by support for smaller firms. Meanwhile, the Confederation of British Industry called on the chancellor to use the Budget to help get more firms ""investing to lift UK productivity"". ""We all want to see a higher-wage economy, but the real challenge is how to do so sustainably,"" it said. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said that although a wage increase would be welcomed by staff, it was a ""further cost increase for pubs who are still struggling to recover and face an uncertain future"". ""It makes beer duty, business rates and VAT cuts in the Budget on Wednesday all the more important for the viability of our sector,"" she added. Tom Ironside, director of business and regulations at the British Retail Consortium, said retailers supported the objective of higher wages and had been working hard to secure productivity improvements, so that those pay increases would be sustainable. ""This is made more challenging when retailers are currently grappling with an assortment of other government-imposed costs - higher National Insurance contributions, rising business rates, higher corporation tax - at a time when sales are slowing and supply chains are experiencing significant disruption,"" he added. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said her industry was ""committed to good and fair pay for its highly-valued staff"" and called for further government support, including ""immediate root-and-branch reform of business rates"".

"Rishi Sunak has had a year-and-a-half as a high spending chancellor during a once-in-a-century crisis. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil the government's tax and spending plans on Wednesday. Here are five things to look out for. The forecasts will reflect an economy that has rebounded faster than the 4% predicted for this year at the last Budget in March. That means significantly lower borrowing. The forecast peak for unemployment will again be further lowered, reflecting the success of the furlough scheme. However, much of this is already old news, and some of those who predicted a ""boom"" are now scaling back their estimates. What matters now is the immediate implications for the economy of supply chain problems, worker shortages, rising prices and interest rates. The chancellor's speech, along with accompanying forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, should have some pointers. An immediate test of the Downing Street rhetoric on wage rises will take place with the announcements on public sector pay, largely frozen last year, and the National Living Wage (NLW). The NLW is earmarked for a 5% rise to Â£9.42 an hour from April, as part of a pathway to Â£10 an hour by 2024, which could be brought forward by a year. But could that, in fact, widen what has been significant wage rises in shortage sectors, such as haulage, to a more general and therefore inflationary economy-wide phenomenon? A simple guide to Budget 2021 Why is the cost of living going up? Rishi Sunak has had a year-and-a-half as a high spending emergency chancellor, racking up debts for a once-in-a-century crisis, expanding the state, and taking taxes to post war highs. This will be his chance to re-establish his fiscally conservative free market credentials. His method for doing so will be a set of new fiscal rules to bring both annual borrowing under control and the debt down. These rules have been routinely broken by previous chancellors. But how strictly he decides to set these restraints on his power to borrow, will determine room for manoeuvre for extra spending and possible tax cuts. Just how ambitious the government is on net zero will be seen in black and white in the numbers. The chancellor will tout this as the first full multi-year post austerity spending review. Spending will rise more than one of the Gordon Brown Spending Reviews. But two-thirds of the funding decisions - for health, schools, defence and aid, are already baked in the cake. What remains, are important areas of spending, such as courts, prisons, and, crucially, local Government, which are on course for another two-year spending squeeze, before spending goes up. Even more importantly, little cash has been so far allocated for permanent post pandemic legacy spending in health, care, and schools. If that happens, the immediate squeeze elsewhere will be even tighter. This will have consequences for services, and potentially council tax bills. Local council spending cuts will be difficult to reconcile with promises made to regions outside the big cities. But this spending review really is show time for Downing Street to reveal the substance behind their promise to ""level up"" Britain. The phrase originated in promises to equalise per-pupil spending across England. Transport spending is hugely skewed in the UK - with regions such as the North East of England missing out. Will this Spending Review fundamentally change that pattern, even if it would never seek to equalise such spending with, say, London? The answer to that question will start to be seen in the capital funding allocations in the review. Likewise, net zero: Tens of billions of investment will be required to rewire the economy away from burning carbon. Most of that will come from the private sector, but a huge amount will need to come from the public sector too. Again just how ambitious and serious the government is here will be seen in black and white in the numbers allocated in the review. A simple guide to Budget 2021 Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Ruby Torry wants the minimum wage to rise or national insurance to go down Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver his Budget and Spending Review to the House of Commons next week, setting out the government's spending and financial strategy. Changes to the national minimum wage could be announced, as those earners have been badly hit by the economic downturn. New climate measures and changes to company taxes are also expected. We asked six people across the UK what they want to see from this Budget. Ruby Torry, a 23-year-old waitress at Zizzi's restaurant in the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield, lives in Rotherham with her mother and earns the minimum wage. ""I'm careful with my bills and don't go silly with shopping, but I want to see the minimum wage go up or national insurance tax come down,"" she told the BBC. Five things that could affect you in the Budget Why is the cost of living going up? Zizzi's had put Ms Torry on furlough, but she said she couldn't cover her bills, so she worked for Asos in the firm's Barnsley warehouse during the pandemic. She says she would also like to see more incentives for apprenticeships. ""I wanted to do an engineering apprenticeship, but wouldn't have been able to live on Â£800 a month wages - I couldn't even pay for my car on that,"" she explains. ""Minimum wage needs to go up, I don't know how the government thinks we can do anything on that little."" Michelle and her daughter Charlize Michelle Wilson is a single mother from Glenrothes in Scotland and has already felt challenges after the Â£20 weekly uplift in Universal Credit was ended on 6 October. ""It's a real worry because the uplift was almost Â£100 a month, which is my main shop gone now, so it's another big stress,"" she told the BBC. She added that she would like to see increases in Universal Credit and the minimum wage to reflect the rise in household costs from inflation. ""My kids have been eating healthier with that uplift and it's been a big drop when I'm worried about my gas and fuel bills,"" she says. Ms Wilson used to work as a support officer for Fife council, but one of the reasons she left the job was because she struggled with the cost of childcare as a lone parent. She said it would be ""helpful"" for the Budget to encourage more flexible hours for working and finding childcare, as she is limited to 09:00 to 15:00. Ms Wilson would support government measures to help with the sharp rise in energy bills, which she said she is ""struggling to keep up"" with, as rising costs are making life ""harder and harder"" for her. Nick Grey founded Gtech, which makes floor cleaning and garden products and has a turnover of Â£70m. The firm employs 200 people across the UK and sells more than 22 million products in 19 countries. Mr Grey says the Budget should not make it more difficult for firms to employ overseas workers, which he thinks would be a ""backwards step"" amid the labour shortages. Another of his requests is that a rise in corporation tax should be avoided, as he says it ""risks businesses setting up headquarters elsewhere and less bureaucracy would be better for attracting investment in the UK"". Raising tax on high earners also ""risks lowering the overall tax income for the country"", he adds. Jon Tolley runs independent record shop Banquet Records in Kingston, Surrey. He believes the fairest way to pay for the pandemic is through increased tax for people and businesses that earn the most, rather than a rise in everyone's National Insurance tax. ""I want customers and my employees to have disposable income and cash in their pockets, so they can spend it on the High Streets,"" he adds. Mr Tolley explains the business has had an ""OK"" year and received acash grant of Â£25,000,externaltwice from the government for having had to close the shop - action that he says was ""welcome and effective"". But he adds that he would like to ""see something changed about business rates"". ""We're in competition with online stores who don't have to pay the same rates and High Street rents, so that playing field needs to be levelled."" The business pays the standard 20% VAT on products and Mr Tolley doesn't want to see this increase. ""We haven't had 'just-in-time' stock control at all, because of delivery delays, but we're fortunate to have storage capacity and have ordered well ahead for Christmas."" Hollie Whittles, digital strategy specialist and HR director at Purple Frog Systems, says she wants to see a review of the business rates system. She says small businesses often ""lack the time to understand"" tax and rates. Ms Whittles says it is ""crucial"" to make sure taxes designed for large organisations are not avoided or passed ""further down the chain to their small business customers"". On climate measures, she commends grant schemes such as the Low Carbon Opportunities Programme (LOCOP) and the Business Energy Efficiency Programme (BEEP), which encourage businesses to adopt greener technologies. ""It is vital that the government supports small businesses' journey to net zero, especially with small businesses making up more than 99% of all private sector enterprises,"" she adds. Hollie Whittles On changes to apprenticeship schemes and student loans, Ms Whittles, who works with 14 staff, says she would welcome more support for small businesses wanting to train and upskill staff in new technologies that help benefit long-term careers and the local economy. Ms Whittles says there have been ""considerable challenges"" in accessing the government's Kickstart scheme, which creates new jobs for 16 to 24-year-olds on Universal Credit. The government should also support schemes and skills investment for older people wanting to change careers, in her view. Lynne Turner Lynne Turner is 71 years old and would like to see her basic government pension of Â£137.60 per week increased. ""It's absolutely not enough. I'm frugal, but couldn't survive with a decent lifestyle if I only had my pension,"" Ms Turner explains. Ms Turner says she could not afford to pay into a private pension in the past because of childcare costs. Without an inherited cottage in Wales, the rent from which supplements her pension, she ""wouldn't be able to manage"", she says. She adds that she would support a beer levy, which ""wouldn't bother her at all"", but says that because so many small businesses have struggled during the pandemic, she would be against making them pay more taxes.

"Proof of vaccine status can be given using a smartphone app The first weekend of enforcement of Scotland's vaccine passport scheme was an ""unmitigated disaster"", according to a body representing night-time venues. Venue staff refused entry to revellers without vaccine passports more than 550 times, and some staff were abused, the Scottish Hospitality Group said. It said some venues decided to close early and footfall was down by up to 40%. The Scottish government said the scheme was a ""proportionate"" health measure. Ministers say it will encourage more people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and ensure late-night venues can remain open during a ""potentially very difficult"" winter. Vaccine passport scheme enforceable by law Scotland's vaccine passport scheme goes live The vaccine certification scheme was introduced on 1 October but there was no enforcement during a 17-day ""grace period"" as venues adjusted to the new requirements. The Scottish Hospitality Group, which opposes the scheme, said the first real test this weekend had been ""one of unmitigated disaster"". ""The Scottish Hospitality Group has been warning the government for weeks that their vaccine passports scheme is not ready - but the government's attitude has been to tell us to 'get on with it' whilst offering no safety net of support for businesses or our hard working staff,"" spokesperson Stephen Montgomery said. ""The experience of this weekend shows that the result has been intolerable levels of abuse of our staff, and the creation of an atmosphere that will totally undermine anyone's enjoyment of our night-time venues."" People attending nightclubs and other large venues have to be able to show proof of two Covid jabs The group said there was a ""concerning number"" of reports of staff being abused over rejections and queues which led to a ""charged atmosphere"". Some venues had decided to close at midnight, taking them outside the scope of the scheme, because of problems with staff recruitment and welfare, it said. Mr Montgomery rejected a suggestion that the numbers being turned away was a sign the scheme was working properly in keeping unvaccinated people away from higher risk settings. ""Turning people away at the door - yes, I get the point to a degree - but all it's doing is sending them somewhere else, a dancefloor that has tables and chairs on it that does away with dancing,"" he told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programme. The Scottish Conservatives said the scheme was ""unworkable and unreasonable"" with no financial support for businesses or their staff. The party's Covid recovery spokesperson Murdo Fraser said: ""What is most concerning is the levels of abuse hospitality workers have been subjected to, caused by a lack of public engagement, and a frustrating and unreliable app."" The Scottish government insisted it was continuing to engage with the sector to discuss implementation of the scheme. A spokesperson said: ""Covid-19 certification is a proportionate way of encouraging people to get vaccinated, and also of helping large events and night-time hospitality to keep operating during what will potentially be a very difficult winter. ""This means many businesses will not have to close and can continue to trade whilst making necessary adjustments to ensure their premises are as safe as possible for staff and customers."" People who have had two vaccines in Scotland candownload or get a paper copy of a certificate with a QR code,external. Everyone over the age of 18 must now show - if asked - that they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to certain venues and events. These include: Nightclubs and ""analogous venues"" Adult entertainment venues Unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, even if some are seated Unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people Any event with more than 10,000 people in attendance The scheme requires venues to put in place a ""reasonable system"" to check the status of customers, with certain exemptions on medical grounds. For large events such as football matches spot checks can be used, but for smaller gatherings more rigorous checking is required. WHERE?Where in Scotland are the latest cases?

"This video can not be played Watch: Frances Haugen tells MPs that Facebook ""unquestionably"" makes hate worse Whistleblower Frances Haugen has told MPs Facebook is ""unquestionably making hate worse"", as they consider what new rules to impose on big social networks. Ms Haugen was talking to the Online Safety Bill committee in London. She said Facebook safety teams were under-resourced, and ""Facebook has been unwilling to accept even little slivers of profit being sacrificed for safety"". And she warned that Instagram was ""more dangerous than other forms of social media"". While other social networks were about performance, play, or an exchange of ideas, ""Instagram is about social comparison and about bodies... about people's lifestyles, and that's what ends up being worse for kids"", she told a joint committee of MPs and Lords. She said Facebook's own research described one problem as ""an addict's narrative"" - where children are unhappy, can't control their use of the app, but feel like they cannot stop using it. ""I am deeply worried that it may not be possible to make Instagram safe for a 14-year-old, and I sincerely doubt that it is possible to make it safe for a 10-year-old,"" she said. The committee is fine-tuning a proposed law that will place new duties on large social networks and subject them to checks by the media regulator Ofcom. Asked if the law was ""keeping Mark Zuckerberg awake at night"", Ms Haugen said she was ""incredibly proud of the UK for taking such a world-leading stance"". ""The UK has a tradition of leading policy in ways that are followed around the world. ""I can't imagine Mark isn't paying attention to what you're doing."" Ms Haugen also warned that Facebook was unable to police content in multiple languages around the world - something which should worry UK officials, she said. ""UK English is sufficiently different that I would be unsurprised if the safety systems that they developed primarily for American English were actually under-enforcing in the UK,"" she said. And she said that dangerous misinformation in other languages affects people in Britain. Facebook earns $9bn despite whistleblower scandal Online safety plans need more clarity, says Twitter Facebook fined Â£50m by UK competition watchdog ""Those people are also living in the UK, and being fed misinformation that is dangerous, that radicalises people,"" she warned. Ms Haugen also urged the committee to include paid-for advertising in its new rules, saying the current system was ""literally subsidising hate on these platforms"" because of their algorithmic ranking. ""It is substantially cheaper to run an angry hateful divisive ad than it is to run a compassionate, empathetic ad,"" she said. And she also urged MPs to require a breakdown of who is harmed by content, rather than an average figure - suggesting Facebook is ""very good at dancing with data"", but pushes people towards ""extreme content"". Ms Haugen appeared at a joint committee of MPs and Lords ""The median experience on Facebook is a pretty good experience,"" she said. ""The real danger is that 20% of the population has a horrible experience or an experience that is dangerous,"" she said. She warned that employees were unable to report internal concerns at Facebook - something she called a ""huge weak spot"". ""When I worked on counter-espionage, I saw things where I was concerned about national security, and I had no idea how to escalate those because I didn't have faith in my chain of command at that point,"" she told the committee. And she warned: ""We were told to accept under-resourcing."" Similar problems plague Facebook's Oversight Board, which can overturn the company's decisions on content, she said. She repeated her claim that Facebook has repeatedly lied to its own watchdog, and said this is a ""defining moment"" for the Oversight Board to ""step up"". ""I don't know what the purpose of the Oversight Board is,"" she said. This video can not be played Facebook's Monika Bickert: ""It's in our financial interest to make sure that people have a good experience on our site"" It comes as several news outlets published fresh stories based on the thousands of leaked documents Ms Haugen took with her when she left Facebook. Facebook has characterised previous reporting as misleading, and at one point referred to the leaked documents as ""stolen"". ""Contrary to what was discussed at the hearing, we've always had the commercial incentive to remove harmful content from our sites,"" a spokesperson said, after Ms Haugen finished giving evidence. ""People don't want to see it when they use our apps, and advertisers don't want their ads next to it. That's why we've invested $13bn (Â£9.4bn) and hired 40,000 people to do one job: keep people safe on our apps. "" The company said that over the last three quarters it has halved the amount of hate speech seen on Facebook, which it claims now accounts for only 0.05% of all content viewed. ""While we have rules against harmful content and publish regular transparency reports, we agree we need regulation for the whole industry so that businesses like ours aren't making these decisions on our own,"" the spokesperson said. ""The UK is one of the countries leading the way and we're pleased the Online Safety Bill is moving forward."" An avalanche of information emerged on Monday from leaked Facebook documents - and it was hard to keep up. Allegations include that the social media giant is aware of its role in inciting violence all around the world, or causing harm to its users from US and UKto India,externalandEthiopia,external. A common theme runs through each of the stories. They all suggest a tension between employees raising the alarm about their concerns and a corporate machine that does not appear to be using this to inform its policies. Reporters and journalists have been highlighting many of these same concerns, especially for the past 18 months. I've investigatedthe human cost of online disinformationandabuse again and againand exposed the damage being done to real people offline using these sites. But until these documents were released by Ms Haugen, it was very difficult to know how aware Facebook was of that damage. These latest leaks reinforce the idea that it is conscious of it - although it refutes a number of the claims. And it means pressure is mounting on policymakers around the world to do something about it. Father of Molly Russell meets Facebook whistleblower.

"Tyler frequently made guest appearances at fan events Friends stars including Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox and Matt LeBlanc have paid tribute to James Michael Tyler, who starred as Gunther in the sitcom, after he died at the age of 59. Tyler was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer in 2018. Aniston said the show ""would not have been the same"" without Tyler's performance as the Central Perk waiter. ""Thank you for the laughter you brought to the show and to all of our lives. You will be so missed,"" she said. 11 of Gunther's best moments on Friends Tyler's much-loved character worked in the show's coffee house and had a crush on Aniston's character Rachel, who also worked there as a waitress in the show's early seasons. She shared an Instagram post which included a photo of Tyler from the set and a clip of the pair in the final episode as Gunther declared his love for the departing Rachel, who turned him down gently.

David Schwimmer, aka Ross,thanked Tyler,external""for playing such a wonderful, unforgettable role"" and ""for being such a big hearted gentleman and all around mensch off screen"". ""You will be missed, buddy,"" he went on. Tyler appeared in almost 150 episodes of the comedy, which ran from 1994 to 2004. Gunther was and remains a hugely popular character among fans. Tyler's manager said the actor ""passed away peacefully at his home in Los Angeles on Sunday morning"". A statement added: ""The world knew him as Gunther (the seventh Friend)... but Michael's loved ones knew him as an actor, musician, cancer-awareness advocate, and loving husband. If you met him once you made a friend for life. ""Wanting to help as many people as possible, he bravely shared his story and became a campaigner for those with a prostate to get a... blood test as early as 40-years-old."" David Crane, who co-created Friends, told the BBC that Tyler started as an extra on the show and was given the role because he could work the coffee machine. ""As time went on, I think we realised he's funny - a really good actor,"" Crane said. ""We just kept giving him more and more, and when we realised there was a storyline about his secret love for Rachel, it was just the gift that kept on giving."" On Tyler's comedic timing, Crane added: ""His delivery was impeccable, he was so good that we found ourselves going to him for the punchline for a whole scene or for a whole episode. ""With just the littlest opportunity he created this indelible character."" Tyler revisited the Central Perk in 2015 as part of a Warner Bros studio tour In May, Tyler made a brief appearance on the Friends reunion special via Zoom. ""It was the most memorable 10 years of my life, honestly,"" the actor said at the time. ""I could not have imagined just a better experience. All these guys were fantastic and just a joy to work with. It felt very, very special."" Warner Bros Television, one of the co-producers of the sitcom, said Tyler was ""a beloved actor and integral part of our Friends family"". He continued to perform in recent years while undergoing treatment for cancer. He also starred in two short films - The Gesture and the Word, and Processing - winning best actor awards at film festivals. In 2021, his spoken word performance of Stephen Kalinich's poem If You Knew was adapted into a short video to raise awareness for the Prostate Cancer Foundation.

"Health Secretary Javid says there is no need for further Covid restrictions ""at this point"" and he believes the UK will have ""a normal Christmas"" But Sage scientist Prof John Edmunds tells the BBC it is hard to be ""precise"" about what the situation will be at Christmas Javid also says the Covid vaccine could become mandatory for NHS staff - but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has warned against this A further 36,567 Covid cases have been reported in the UK NHS medical director Stephen Powis urges people to book their jabs as the NHS sends out two million more booster invites this week The NHS in England is to receive an extra Â£5.9bn in this week's Budget, the government has announced Edited by Hamish Mackay We're pausing our live coronavirus coverage for the day. Thanks for joining us, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's main headlines:  Today's live page was brought to you by Hugo Bachega, Victoria Lindrea and Mary O'Connor. The editor was Hamish Mackay. Smitha MundasadBBC health reporter Rare neurological conditions may occur after Covid vaccination, but the risk is far higher in people who catch Covid, new research suggests. Doctors say the landmark UK study provides further reassurance that being vaccinated offers the best protection for overall health. The investigators examined the NHS records of 32 million adults in England to assess any rare adverse events linked to Covid vaccines. The studyappears in Nature Medicine.,external The scientists, from the Universities of Oxford and Edinburgh, compared the levels of neurological conditions seen within a month of having a first Covid jab, to those seen within a month of a positive coronavirus test. One thing they looked for was a rare condition called Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) known to be associated with certain infectious diseases and linked to some other vaccines. You can read the results of the studyhere. Last year's street party was cancelled due to Covid Edinburgh's Hogmanay street party will return this year after Covid forced the cancellation of the 2020 event. The event, which also will feature the return of the Edinburgh Castle fireworks display, has a reduced capacity of 30,000. The last time the event was held in-person, in 2019, the street party was attended by 75,000 people. Last year's programme of events was heldonline due to the pandemic. Tickets for the event will go on sale on Tuesday. There have been a further 36,567 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today. It means the number of new cases has declined for a fourth consecutive day, after they reached 52,009 on 21 October. However, case numbers for Wales are yet to be added to today's tally. Another 38 deaths of people who tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days have also been recorded. The Russian capital has tightened Covid-19
restrictions amid a surge in cases, requiring the elderly to stay at home,
while at least a third of the workforce is to return to home working. From today, Moscow residents aged 60 and older, as well as those with chronic
conditions, are ordered to stay home in line withmeasures taken by Mayor Sergei Sobyanin,external. Those who can show proof of being vaccinated or of having had Covid-19 in the
past six months are exempt. In addition, employers have been told to move at least 30% of their staff back to
working remotely. These measures will stay in place for at least four months. Even tighter restrictions will come into force in Moscow on 28 October and last
until 7 November, when all non-essential organisations and businesses including
schools will beordered to close,external. Cafes, bars and restaurants
will only be able to serve takeaway food. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online US pharmaceutical company Modern
says it has had good results from trials giving children aged six to 11 its
Covid vaccine. The interim findings, described in a press release and based on
4,753 children, suggest two doses create a strong immune response. Moderna says
the mRNA vaccine was well tolerated and the most common side effects â a sore arm, tiredness, fever or headache â were mild. The vaccine was given
as a smaller dose than the adult equivalent. Other manufacturers have also been
testing paediatric doses. A panel of advisors in the US will vote on Tuesday
whether to authorise the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA Covid vaccine for use in children
aged five to 11. At least 6.1 million booster doses of the vaccine have been delivered in the UK, new NHS figures show. As of 24 October, estimated figures can be broken down by nations as follows:  In Wales, 322,591 booster doses had been delivered as of 21 October - the latest figures available. It means at least one in eight people in the UK who have received a first and second dose of vaccine are likely to have also received a booster jab. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has committed to wearing a mask in the Commons for this Wednesday's Budget ""given it will be packed"", but will not repeat his call for Tory colleagues to do the same. Last week, fellow cabinet member Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested members of Parliament did not need to wear masks, citing the ""convivial, fraternal spirit"" among Tory colleagues. But today, Javid tells the BBC: ""The guidelines are clear, it's for people to make a personal decision on how they see the risk of them and those around them - and this is obviously a workplace setting, so it's going to be a decision for them - but I can speak for myself."" Current government guidance says masks should be worn in ""crowded, enclosed spaces where [people] come into contact with people they do not normally meet"". Asked whether Boris Johnson will wear a mask on Budget day, the prime minister's official spokesman says it is ""a matter for personal judgment"". Sage scientist Prof John Edmunds has just told the BBC that the UK's vaccine booster programme needs to be rapidly accelerated to reduce the ""dangerous"" levels of infection across the country. But who exactly is eligible for a booster? At present, boosters are being offered to:  The dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination. For more information on boosters, read this explainer. We've got more from Prof
Edmunds, who warns that the UK's Covid booster campaign needs to be rapidly accelerated to reduce national infection levels. He
tells the BBC the UK needs to hit âvery highâ coverage of booster doses and calls
for the programme to be widened to everyone once the over-50s and other priority
groups have had third jabs. More
than five million people have received booster jabs since last month, according
to NHS England, but Prof Edmunds says the current pace is âslowerâ than the vaccine
rollout earlier this year and insists it needs to be âimprovedâ. ""I donât see any reason for it to go slow at the moment,"" he says. ""There
is in fact a great deal of reason for that to happen very quickly given the
very high levels of infection we have at the moment. ""Itâs quite a dangerous
situation that weâre in. âItâs
very important that [people] do get a booster because thereâs a lot of
infection around at the moment and I think the faster we can get boosters into
peoplesâ arms, the better."" As Covid cases rise, many medical experts and opposition politicians are calling on the government to reimpose some Covid restrictions in England, including working from home and compulsory face masks. In September that the government said it could bring inextra measures,externalin England - if necessary - to protect the NHS from ""unsustainable pressure"". Those measures - outlined below - are referred to as Plan B.  In effect, the introduction of Plan B would bring England in line with restrictions still in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. So what are the current restrictions across the four UK nations, how do they differ, and what are the various winter plans in the event of a health crisis? Read on to find out more. Earlier, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he expected the UK to havea ânormal Christmasâ this year provided the public âplay their partâand
insisted a move to tighter Plan B restrictions was not necessary ""at this point"". But a scientist advising the government tells the BBC it's âhard to be preciseâ about what the
Covid picture will look like at Christmas as there are âa lot of things in playâ, including
high case numbers among young people. Prof
John Edmunds, an infectious diseases expert who sits on the Scientific Advisory
Group for Emergencies and is part of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on
Modelling, warns thatwhile several scientific models,externalpredicted
cases âmight declineâ by Christmas, infections âcould still be pretty highâ by
then, which could pose a risk to older and vulnerable people during the festive
period, when there is more intergenerational mixing. Prof Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says he expects âa lot of changeâ between now and Christmas as the booster programme continues and teenagers are gradually vaccinated â but that
it is âhard to say with any great certaintyâ that infections in children will have dropped before the festive period. He
also points out that while scientific models say cases are likely to fall
at some point, âtheyâre likely to go back up again next yearâ which is due to âdeclining
immunity and a change in adultsâ contact patternsâ. Scotland's health secretary, Humza Yousaf, has insisted the booster programme is ""on track"" despite calls from opposition parties to speed up the rollout. From today, invitation letters are being sent to the 60-69 age group for a third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Yousaf says the government intends to allow over-50s, unpaid carers and household contacts of immunosuppressed individuals to book booster appointments online from mid-November - but stressed appointments can only take place six months after the second dose, in accordance with medical advice. Booster jabs are already being administered to Scots aged 70 and over, those at the highest risk from infection, care home residents and frontline health and social care workers. ""In addition to delivering the Covid-19 vaccine boosters, this year we are offering a record number of free flu vaccines to help protect the people of Scotland,"" the health secretary says. Despite the demonstration, the game between the Nets and Hornets went ahead as scheduled Anti-vaccine demonstrators gathered outside the Barclays Center on Sunday to show their support for basketball player Kyrie Irving, as his team, the Brooklyn Nets, played their first game of the NBA season. Irving has refused to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and is not allowed to play or train with his team until he does so, because of local vaccine rules. Some protesters broke through barriers outside the arena in New York before being confronted by security. No arrests or injuries were reported. The beginning of the new NBA seasonhas been dominated by debate over the Covid-19 vaccine,with some players saying they will not get jabbed and others refusing to confirm their vaccination status. Irving has recentlyshared microchip claims about the Moderna vaccine on social media,externaland admits to being a ""big conspiracy theorist"". There was no legal requirement for fans at this Manic Street Preachers gig in Cardiff to social distance Wales' top doctor has expressed concernthat some people are behaving as if the pandemic is over by ignoring Welsh laws on face coverings and not social distancing. Wales' case rate is at a record high of 716.9 cases per 100,000 people - the highest of all the UK nations. It has led ministers to look at extending the use ofNHS Covid passesfor a wider range of venues, such as cafes, bars and restaurants. Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton tells BBC Wales: ""A very significant proportion of the Welsh population is still behaving with extreme caution and realises that we are not out of the woods with this yet, but there is a sense other places that it is all over."" He says he worries when he sees people not wearing face coverings or crowding into indoor spaces without observing social distancing. Dr Atherton warns that unless people follow Covid rules, some of the ""more draconian"" measures and laws may have to return. Just joining us? Here are the latest Covid headlines in the UK. Yesterday, a further 39,962 new Covid cases were reported across the UK. That takes the seven-day average for cases - which is a more reliable indicator of infection levels, as there can be delays in daily reporting - to 46,920 cases per day. There were also a further 72 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test result. The seven-day average for deaths is now 124.

The South Korean government's plan will see restrictions being gradually removed by February If you're just joining us, here is how Covid is impacting countries outside of the UK: Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online About 95% of NHS staff in England accepted the offer of a Covid vaccine, says Mr Javid Health Secretary Sajid Javid says he is minded to make Covid
vaccines compulsory for the estimated 1.2 million front line health staff in England, rather than just those working in social care. Vaccination helps protects the individual from serious infection and death, but also reduces their chance of spreading the virus. From 11 November, it will be mandatory for anyone who works
in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home in England to prove they are
fully vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption. But it appears uptake is already high.Latest figures from NHS England,externalreveal more than nine in 10 staff in care homes for older adults have been vaccinated
with at least one dose, and more than eight in 10 have had two
doses. Javid says about 95% of NHS staff in England accepted the
offer of a Covid vaccine when they became available earlier in the year. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.19860838
"This video can not be played Watch: Frances Haugen tells MPs that Facebook ""unquestionably"" makes hate worse Whistleblower Frances Haugen has told MPs Facebook is ""unquestionably making hate worse"", as they consider what new rules to impose on big social networks. Ms Haugen was talking to the Online Safety Bill committee in London. She said Facebook safety teams were under-resourced, and ""Facebook has been unwilling to accept even little slivers of profit being sacrificed for safety"". And she warned that Instagram was ""more dangerous than other forms of social media"". While other social networks were about performance, play, or an exchange of ideas, ""Instagram is about social comparison and about bodies... about people's lifestyles, and that's what ends up being worse for kids"", she told a joint committee of MPs and Lords. She said Facebook's own research described one problem as ""an addict's narrative"" - where children are unhappy, can't control their use of the app, but feel like they cannot stop using it. ""I am deeply worried that it may not be possible to make Instagram safe for a 14-year-old, and I sincerely doubt that it is possible to make it safe for a 10-year-old,"" she said. The committee is fine-tuning a proposed law that will place new duties on large social networks and subject them to checks by the media regulator Ofcom. Asked if the law was ""keeping Mark Zuckerberg awake at night"", Ms Haugen said she was ""incredibly proud of the UK for taking such a world-leading stance"". ""The UK has a tradition of leading policy in ways that are followed around the world. ""I can't imagine Mark isn't paying attention to what you're doing."" Ms Haugen also warned that Facebook was unable to police content in multiple languages around the world - something which should worry UK officials, she said. ""UK English is sufficiently different that I would be unsurprised if the safety systems that they developed primarily for American English were actually under-enforcing in the UK,"" she said. And she said that dangerous misinformation in other languages affects people in Britain. Facebook earns $9bn despite whistleblower scandal Online safety plans need more clarity, says Twitter Facebook fined Â£50m by UK competition watchdog ""Those people are also living in the UK, and being fed misinformation that is dangerous, that radicalises people,"" she warned. Ms Haugen also urged the committee to include paid-for advertising in its new rules, saying the current system was ""literally subsidising hate on these platforms"" because of their algorithmic ranking. ""It is substantially cheaper to run an angry hateful divisive ad than it is to run a compassionate, empathetic ad,"" she said. And she also urged MPs to require a breakdown of who is harmed by content, rather than an average figure - suggesting Facebook is ""very good at dancing with data"", but pushes people towards ""extreme content"". Ms Haugen appeared at a joint committee of MPs and Lords ""The median experience on Facebook is a pretty good experience,"" she said. ""The real danger is that 20% of the population has a horrible experience or an experience that is dangerous,"" she said. She warned that employees were unable to report internal concerns at Facebook - something she called a ""huge weak spot"". ""When I worked on counter-espionage, I saw things where I was concerned about national security, and I had no idea how to escalate those because I didn't have faith in my chain of command at that point,"" she told the committee. And she warned: ""We were told to accept under-resourcing."" Similar problems plague Facebook's Oversight Board, which can overturn the company's decisions on content, she said. She repeated her claim that Facebook has repeatedly lied to its own watchdog, and said this is a ""defining moment"" for the Oversight Board to ""step up"". ""I don't know what the purpose of the Oversight Board is,"" she said. This video can not be played Facebook's Monika Bickert: ""It's in our financial interest to make sure that people have a good experience on our site"" It comes as several news outlets published fresh stories based on the thousands of leaked documents Ms Haugen took with her when she left Facebook. Facebook has characterised previous reporting as misleading, and at one point referred to the leaked documents as ""stolen"". ""Contrary to what was discussed at the hearing, we've always had the commercial incentive to remove harmful content from our sites,"" a spokesperson said, after Ms Haugen finished giving evidence. ""People don't want to see it when they use our apps, and advertisers don't want their ads next to it. That's why we've invested $13bn (Â£9.4bn) and hired 40,000 people to do one job: keep people safe on our apps. "" The company said that over the last three quarters it has halved the amount of hate speech seen on Facebook, which it claims now accounts for only 0.05% of all content viewed. ""While we have rules against harmful content and publish regular transparency reports, we agree we need regulation for the whole industry so that businesses like ours aren't making these decisions on our own,"" the spokesperson said. ""The UK is one of the countries leading the way and we're pleased the Online Safety Bill is moving forward."" An avalanche of information emerged on Monday from leaked Facebook documents - and it was hard to keep up. Allegations include that the social media giant is aware of its role in inciting violence all around the world, or causing harm to its users from US and UKto India,externalandEthiopia,external. A common theme runs through each of the stories. They all suggest a tension between employees raising the alarm about their concerns and a corporate machine that does not appear to be using this to inform its policies. Reporters and journalists have been highlighting many of these same concerns, especially for the past 18 months. I've investigatedthe human cost of online disinformationandabuse again and againand exposed the damage being done to real people offline using these sites. But until these documents were released by Ms Haugen, it was very difficult to know how aware Facebook was of that damage. These latest leaks reinforce the idea that it is conscious of it - although it refutes a number of the claims. And it means pressure is mounting on policymakers around the world to do something about it. Father of Molly Russell meets Facebook whistleblower.

"A joint group of unions is calling for targeted industrial action as part of a long-running dispute Unions representing rail and council workers have confirmed plans for strike action during the COP26 climate change summit in Glasgow. Cleaners, refuse and recycling workers are among staff who could take industrial action from 8 November. ScotRail could also be hit by strikes from 1 November after the RMT's AGM in Leeds rejected the latest pay offer. The Scottish government has set a deadline of Wednesday for the rail union to accept its pay offer. Ministers also said ScotRail will now go ahead and implement the pay rise for members of three other trade unions which accepted its offer, as well as non-unionised ScotRail workers. Sturgeon: Credible action needed on climate crisis How are COP26 road closures affecting Glasgow? Sturgeon: Credible action needed on climate crisis COP26 strikes and closures during Glasgow summit Transport Minister Graeme Dey said the government was ""utterly perplexed"" at the RMT position while the union hit back at the ""arbitrary"" Wednesday deadline. About 120 world leaders are expected to attend the crucial United Nations summit from 31 October to 12 November. A joint trade union group, including Unison, Unite and the GMB, is seeking a Â£2,000 flat rate pay increase or 6%, whichever is greater, from Scotland's local authority umbrella body Cosla. It has now notified councils that it will call on some school cleaners, caterers and janitors along with waste, recycling and maintenance staff to take ""targeted"" strike action during the second week of the summit. Wendy Dunsmore, of Unite,  said: ""The incredible professionalism and sacrifice by local government workers has not been recognised during the Covid-19 pandemic."" Johanna Baxter, of Unison, said more than half of local government workers earned under Â£25,000 a year and many were at ""breaking point"". Drew Duffy, of the GMB union, added:  ""It's been over 18 months since any of these key workers had a pay rise and that is a disgrace given the work they have done over the last 18 months."" Cosla has offered an Â£850 flat rate rise for the lowest paid staff and 2% for those paid less than Â£40,000 a year. A spokesman said: ""We appreciate everything that local government workers have been doing, and continue to do, to support people and communities during the pandemic and as we begin to recover. We continue with ongoing constructive negotiations."" Earlier, the AGM of the RMT union confirmed plans for strike action by ScotRail staff from 1 to 12 November, almost the entire duration of the summit. The union described the offer of a 2.5% increase this year, 2,2% in 2022 and a one-off Â£300 bonus for staff working during the summit as ""pitiful"". Three other rail unions, Unite, Aslef and the TSSA have already accepted the offer. Transport Minister Graeme Dey said: ""We remain utterly perplexed at the position the RMT leadership is taking here. While we think their action is misguided and does their members no favours, we, of course,  respect the right of trade unions to do what they think is appropriate for their membership. ""But we are clear that this is a fair and good offer that will put cash in the pockets of rail workers who have worked hard during the pandemic. This is evidenced by the fact that the three other rail unions (Aslef, Unite and TSSA) have accepted it. ""ScotRail, with the full support of the Scottish government, has tried a number of times to reach a deal with the RMT leadership - as of yesterday, the offer being made to its members consisted of a 4.7% pay increase over this and next year, a Â£300 payment for COP26, an additional payment equivalent to three hours salary for booking on for a Rest Day shift for the rest of the year. ""That last enhancement was offered just yesterday, and we understood that we were close to agreement with negotiators apparently happy with the offer, RMT leaders have then moved the goalposts."" The RMT said it had been given an ""arbitrary"" deadline to accept the pay offer by Wednesday, but said strikes on both ScotRail and Caledonian Sleeper services could still be avoided. General secretary Mike Lynch said: ""Our message to Nicola Sturgeon, Transport Scotland, Abellio and Serco is that there is still time to resolve the pay disputes but it requires some serious movement, the lifting of bogus deadlines and genuine talks."" Meanwhile, Swedish activist Greta Thunberg has invited Glasgow workers who plan on striking during COP26 to join her in a protest march through the city. She said she would be taking part in the Climate Strike march from Kelvingrove Park to George Square. She wrote on Twitter: ""On Friday Nov 5 I'll join the climate strike in Glasgow - during #COP26 Climate justice also means social justice and that we leave no one behind. ""So we invite everyone, especially the workers striking in Glasgow, to join us. See you there!"" The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland's industrial past is a source of pride, but it should also be a ""real cause for reflection"" Nicola Sturgeon has called for ""credible action, not face-saving slogans"" to come from next week's COP26 summit in Glasgow. The talks have been billed as the ""last best chance"" to limit the rise in the earth's temperature to 1.5C. In a speech ahead of the conference, the first minister said concrete action is needed to ""keep 1.5 alive"". The UK government said the first minister would play an ""important role"" at COP26. It has insisted the summit must ""stick with the goal"" of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C. How is Scotland tackling climate change? Ms Sturgeon said the conference can lead the world into a ""green revolution"" and that Scotland can act as a bridge between large and small nations. And she said her government would set out details later this week about how it would ""catch up"" with its own emissions reduction targets, having""fallen short"" of its last three annual milestones. She said: ""Governments at all levels have a responsibility and Scotland is determined to play our full part. ""Our ability to do that depends on our own climate credibility - Scotland cannot urge other countries to set and meet ambitious targets if we fail to do that ourselves."" As final preparations take place at the SEC, the first minister hopes Glasgow will act as a bridge across the climate divide More than 120 world leaders will attend the summit, which takes place at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow from 31 October to 12 November. In her speech to an audience of young people and students in Glasgow, the first minister called for a ""significant uplift in ambition"" from world leaders - particularly those of the ""biggest emitting countries"" - to act to limit global temperature increases and deliver a fair financial package for developing countries. She said: ""We take seriously the responsibility of all governments - at all levels - to show ambition, and to galvanise action. If we do that, we can all contribute towards a successful summit. ""I have said that small countries can lead the way in this, and they can, but in the coming days, it is the countries which emit the most, who most need to step up. They need to make ambitious pledges to achieve net zero. And those pledges must be backed by credible actions."" ""The idea of 'keeping 1.5 alive', cannot simply be a face-saving slogan. It must be real. And there must be progress in Glasgow which makes that outcome more likely."" Ms Sturgeon also encouraged national governments to match the ambition of cities, regions and state governments, and she said her government would ""help those around the negotiating table to hear from activists in the developed world and from the global South"". Thousands of delegates and hundreds of world leaders will descend on Glasgow for the climate summit The Scottish government has set what it describes as world leading targets to cut carbon emissions. It has committed to achieving net zero by 2045 with an interim goal of reducing emissions by 75% by 2030. These targets have been put into law in Scotland, with ministers describing it as the ""toughest, most ambitious legislative framework on climate change in the world"". The snag is the annual progress required to hit these targets has not yet been achieved. The latest emissions figures for 2019 suggested Scotland had reduced the amount of carbon it was releasing into the atmosphere by 51.5% compared to 1990 levels. The target for 2019 was 55%. The Scottish government has more to do to live up to its ambitions on tackling climate change, and is promising a ""catch up"" plan later this week. Last week, COP26 President Alok Sharmatold the BBC's No Hot Air podcastthe aim was to get countries to ""stick with the goals"" of holding the rise in the earth's temperature to 1.5C, as agreed at a COP summit in Paris in 2015. He said: ""World leaders came together and said that they would act to limit global temperature rises to well below 2C, aiming for 1.5C and that's what we want to try and achieve. ""I think Glasgow has to be the moment that the world acts. We've got some commitments but we need to go further."" Mr Sharma added: ""We need to make sure that we can say with credibility that we've kept 1.5C in reach. ""Now is the time for all of us to act, but particularly for the biggest emitters - the G20 nations and the developed countries who promised finance to support developing countries - they also need to step up."" A spokesman for the UK government said: ""The prime minister has been clear [that] the first ministers will play an important role at COP26. ""We are working with the Scottish government, Welsh government and Northern Ireland executive to ensure an inclusive and ambitious summit for the whole of the UK."" The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

"Proof of vaccine status can be given using a smartphone app The first weekend of enforcement of Scotland's vaccine passport scheme was an ""unmitigated disaster"", according to a body representing night-time venues. Venue staff refused entry to revellers without vaccine passports more than 550 times, and some staff were abused, the Scottish Hospitality Group said. It said some venues decided to close early and footfall was down by up to 40%. The Scottish government said the scheme was a ""proportionate"" health measure. Ministers say it will encourage more people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and ensure late-night venues can remain open during a ""potentially very difficult"" winter. Vaccine passport scheme enforceable by law Scotland's vaccine passport scheme goes live The vaccine certification scheme was introduced on 1 October but there was no enforcement during a 17-day ""grace period"" as venues adjusted to the new requirements. The Scottish Hospitality Group, which opposes the scheme, said the first real test this weekend had been ""one of unmitigated disaster"". ""The Scottish Hospitality Group has been warning the government for weeks that their vaccine passports scheme is not ready - but the government's attitude has been to tell us to 'get on with it' whilst offering no safety net of support for businesses or our hard working staff,"" spokesperson Stephen Montgomery said. ""The experience of this weekend shows that the result has been intolerable levels of abuse of our staff, and the creation of an atmosphere that will totally undermine anyone's enjoyment of our night-time venues."" People attending nightclubs and other large venues have to be able to show proof of two Covid jabs The group said there was a ""concerning number"" of reports of staff being abused over rejections and queues which led to a ""charged atmosphere"". Some venues had decided to close at midnight, taking them outside the scope of the scheme, because of problems with staff recruitment and welfare, it said. Mr Montgomery rejected a suggestion that the numbers being turned away was a sign the scheme was working properly in keeping unvaccinated people away from higher risk settings. ""Turning people away at the door - yes, I get the point to a degree - but all it's doing is sending them somewhere else, a dancefloor that has tables and chairs on it that does away with dancing,"" he told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programme. The Scottish Conservatives said the scheme was ""unworkable and unreasonable"" with no financial support for businesses or their staff. The party's Covid recovery spokesperson Murdo Fraser said: ""What is most concerning is the levels of abuse hospitality workers have been subjected to, caused by a lack of public engagement, and a frustrating and unreliable app."" The Scottish government insisted it was continuing to engage with the sector to discuss implementation of the scheme. A spokesperson said: ""Covid-19 certification is a proportionate way of encouraging people to get vaccinated, and also of helping large events and night-time hospitality to keep operating during what will potentially be a very difficult winter. ""This means many businesses will not have to close and can continue to trade whilst making necessary adjustments to ensure their premises are as safe as possible for staff and customers."" People who have had two vaccines in Scotland candownload or get a paper copy of a certificate with a QR code,external. Everyone over the age of 18 must now show - if asked - that they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to certain venues and events. These include: Nightclubs and ""analogous venues"" Adult entertainment venues Unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, even if some are seated Unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people Any event with more than 10,000 people in attendance The scheme requires venues to put in place a ""reasonable system"" to check the status of customers, with certain exemptions on medical grounds. For large events such as football matches spot checks can be used, but for smaller gatherings more rigorous checking is required. WHERE?Where in Scotland are the latest cases?

"This video can not be played Javid says Â£5.9bn for the NHS is ""new money"" to tackle waiting lists The NHS in England is to receive an extra Â£5.9bn in this week's Budget, the government has announced. The money will be used to help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans, which has been worsened by the pandemic, and also to buy equipment and improve IT. Chancellor Rishi Sunak called the announcement ""game-changing"". Health bodies welcomed the latest pledge but said it would not solve the problem of staff shortages. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said the funding was ""new money"" and that Mr Sunak would set out exactly where it was coming from during Wednesday's Budget and Spending Review. A simple guide to Budget 2021 Six things that could affect you in the Budget Budget 2021: Five things to look out for More than five million people are waiting for NHS hospital treatment in England, with hundreds of thousands waiting more than a year. The Â£5.9bn is on top of the Â£12bn a yearthat was announced in September.,external. That money will be raised through tax increases - the rise in National Insurance and, from 2022, the Health and Social Care Levy - and will be spent on resources such as staffing. The Â£5.9bn will be used to pay for physical infrastructure and equipment - not day-to-day spending. Some of the Â£5.9bn - Â£2.3bn - will be used to fund more diagnostic tests, like CT, MRI and ultrasound scans, the government said. More clinics in shopping centres for scans and tests -which the government had already announced- will be opened. These will help clear the backlog of tests by the end of this Parliament, the government said. Also included in the Â£5.9bn total is: Â£1.5bn on beds, equipment and new ""surgical hubs"" Â£2.1bn on improving IT and digital technology within the NHS A proportionate amount will also go to the health services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Access to tests and scans is a real bottleneck in the system at the moment, slowing down the ability of the NHS to work its way through the backlog in routine care and, sometimes, delaying the diagnosis of cancer. It has been known for years the NHS does not have enough equipment to carry out tests and scans. And the machines it has are ageing. The problems mean as demand has increased, performance has deteriorated. The aim is to get these tests done within six weeks of referral, unless it is an urgent cancer case. But currently around a quarter of patients wait longer than that. Before the pandemic fewer than 5% did. The funding will help, in time, improve the situation. But the big issue that it does not tackle is staffing - there is a shortage of specialists to carry out these tests. Around one in 10 posts are currently vacant. There are various reasons for this, including more part-time working, the numbers retiring and problems recruiting internationally because of the pandemic. Buying new machines is much easier than training, recruiting and retaining staff. Until that is resolved, many are sceptical about what this announcement will actually achieve. Waiting lists have grown as routine operations were cancelled throughout the pandemic and people who put off seeking help for symptoms come forward. Some of those in the healthcare sector warned it was not enough to keep up with costs and demand. Christopher Rigby, an NHS radiographer from Yorkshire, said: ""We haven't got the workforce to staff the hospitals we have now let alone all these new centres."" NHS Providers - which speaks for hospital and other NHS trusts - warned the health service needed more staff to deliver services. A body representing healthcare leaders, the NHS Confederation, said the funding ""falls short of what is needed to get services completely back on track"". The NHS is sending out a further two million invites for Covid booster jabs this week. The health secretary said ""we should actively be looking at"" making jabs mandatory for NHS staff, as they are for care workers. Mr Javid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would wear a face covering during Wednesday's Budget announcement in the Commons. But he said now was not time to activate England's ""Plan B"", that would make face masks mandatory in many places. Are you an NHS professional or patient affected by the NHS backlog?

"This video can not be played An exiled officer says the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman is a ""psychopath"". Saudi Arabia's crown prince suggested using a ""poison ring"" to kill the late King Abdullah, a former top Saudi intelligence official has alleged. In an interview with CBS, Saad al-Jabri said Mohammed bin Salman told his cousin in 2014 that he wanted to do so to clear the throne for his father. There were tensions within the ruling family at the time over the succession. The Saudi government has called Mr Jabri a discredited former official with a long history of fabrication. US softens towards Saudis after murder snub Saudi prince 'approved Khashoggi killing' - US Saudi prince denies sending hit squad to Canada In his interview with CBS's 60 Minutes programme,externalMr Jabri warned that Crown Prince Mohammed - Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler and the son of King Salman - was a ""psychopath, killer, in the Middle East with infinite resources, who poses threat to his people, to the Americans and to the planet"". He alleged that at a 2014 meeting the prince suggested to his cousin Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the then interior minister, that he could arrange the killing of King Abdullah. Mohammed bin Salman (L) replaced Mohammed bin Nayef (R) as crown prince in 2017 ""He told him: 'I want to assassinate King Abdullah. I get a poison ring from Russia. It's enough for me just to shake hand with him and he will be done,'"" Mr Jabri said. ""Whether he's just bragging... he said that and we took it seriously."" He said the matter was settled privately within the royal court. But he added that the meeting was secretly filmed and that he knew where two copies of the video recording were. Abdullah died at the age of 90 in 2015 and was succeeded by his half-brother Salman, Mohammed bin Salman's father, who named Mohammed bin Nayef as crown prince. In 2017, Mohammed bin Nayef was replaced as heir to the throne by Mohammed bin Salman. He also lost his role as interior minister and was reportedly placed under house arrestbefore being detained last year on unspecified charges,external. Mr Jabri fled to Canada after Mohammed bin Nayef was ousted. He said in the interview that he was warned by a friend in a Middle Eastern intelligence service that Mohammed bin Salman was sending a hit team to kill him in October 2018, just days after Saudi agents murdered the dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. He alleged that a six-person team landed at an airport in Ottawa but were deported after customs found they were carrying ""suspicious equipment for DNA analysis"". Last year,Mr Jabri accused the crown prince of attempted murderin a civil suit filed in a US federal court. The prince rejected the allegations. He has also denied any involvement in the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, althoughUS intelligence agencies assessed that he approved the operation. King Abdullah (front left) was succeeded by his half-brother Salman (R) after he died in 2015 at the age of 90 The BBC has contacted the Saudi government for comment on the allegations. In a statement sent to CBS, the Saudi embassy in Washington labelled Mr Jabri as ""a discredited former government official with a long history of fabricating and creating distractions to hide the financial crimes he committed, which amount to billions of dollars, to furnish a lavish life-style for himself and his family"". Mr Jabri is being sued for corruption by various Saudi entities and a Canadian judge has frozen his assets saying there is ""overwhelming evidence of fraud"". He denies stealing any government money, saying his former employers rewarded him generously. In March 2020, Saudi authorities detained Mr Jabri's son Omar and daughter Sarahin what human rights groups said was an apparent effort to coerce him to return to Saudi Arabia,external. Last November, two months after their father sued the crown prince, the siblings were sentenced to nine and six-and-a-half years in prison respectively by a Saudi court after being convicted of money laundering and ""attempting to escape"" the country. They denied the charges. An appeals court upheld their sentences in a secret hearing at which they were not present.

"Workers on the minimum wage are set to get a pay boost from April, with the rate for those aged over 23 rising to Â£9.50 an hour from Â£8.91. The rise means a full-time worker will get Â£1,074 extra a year before tax. The move will be announced at this week's Budget and follows the recommendation of independent advisers, the Low Pay Commission. The government has faced pressure to help low-paid, younger workers, who are among the worst hit by the pandemic. The 6.6% increase in the minimum pay rate for those aged over 23 - known as the National Living Wage - is more than twice the current 3.1% rise in the cost of living. Minimum pay rates for younger workers are also set to go up. The National Minimum Wage for people aged 21-22 will rise from Â£8.36 to Â£9.18 an hour and the Apprentice Rate will increase from Â£4.30 to Â£4.81 an hour. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the rise ""ensures we're making work pay and keeps us on track to meet our target to end low pay by the end of this Parliament"". But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, described it as an ""underwhelming offer"" that would be mostly swallowed up by tax rises, universal credit cuts and higher energy bills. National Living Wage for over-23s: From Â£8.91 to Â£9.50 an hour National Minimum Wage for those aged 21-22: From Â£8.36 to Â£9.18 National Minimum Wage for 18 to 20-year-olds: From Â£6.56 to Â£6.83 National Minimum Wage for under-18s: From Â£4.62 to Â£4.81 The Apprentice Rate: From Â£4.30 to Â£4.81 How much is the minimum wage? Finn Oldfield, 23, earns the National Living Wage for his communications job at the People's Powerhouse social enterprise. He lives at home with his parents in Widnes, but said the increase would help him move to Liverpool city centre, which was unaffordable before the rise. ""It's hard if you're from a regional town. I have a politics and philosophy degree from Edinburgh University and thought I'd be able to find opportunities,"" Mr Oldfield told the BBC. After graduating last year in the middle of the pandemic, Mr Oldfield found his role through the government's Kickstart scheme, which encourages six-month jobs with businesses for people aged 16-24 who are currently claiming universal credit. ""With no rent control and higher energy prices, I think this will offset perhaps the harshest of the blows that have come,"" he said. ""But I think there's more that could be done by the government to help with rising everyday costs."" Campaign group the Living Wage Foundation welcomed the increases, but said there was still ""a substantial gap"" between the government-mandated minimum wage and its own calculations of a real living wage based on living costs. The foundation's director, Graham Griffiths, called on employers to ""commit to go beyond this new government minimum, do the right thing, and commit to pay a real living wage"". Salima Vellani, founder of restaurant chain Absurd Bird, says although higher wages will be ""tougher"" on the hospitality sector, increasing the minimum wage ""is the right move"". ""It is hard work, it's unsociable hours, so if people are leaving the industry in droves, then we have to attract them back,"" she said. ""That's not just about pay, it's about training."" Ms Vellani said agreeing with the minimum wage rise ""might be going against the grain, with all the labour issues we are facing"", but added her company had been pushing up wages generally to retain staff. ""You're going to have to pass some of this on to consumers, if your costs are going up,"" said the restaurant owner. ""It's going to be a challenge for a lot of operators who are facing extreme costs. ""If we what produce is good enough, people will keep buying from us."" Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the National Living Wage increase was ""very welcome"", but would ""not remotely compensate"" forthe cut to universal credit. He said the universal credit change affected 4.4 million families, whereas only 2.2 million workers were on the living wage. The minimum wage that workers should get depends on their age and whether they are apprentices. Employers often worry that a higher minimum wage will lead to more unemployment, and that they will be forced to lay off workers in order to afford the increases. But independent experts maintain there has been little or no evidence of job losses as a result of rising minimum wage levels. Giving millions of workers a 6.6% pay rise sounds generous and will be a welcome boost to many pay packets. It also follows the government's - and particularly the prime minister's - narrative of pushing towards a higher-wage economy. Yet this would be no bumper pay day for low-income families. They spend a higher proportion of income than others on heating and lighting their homes. Hefty gas and electricity bill rises, on top of recent increases this month, are inevitable in the spring. Prices in the shops are going up and many economists believe the increases could last longer than previously expected. Finally, a National Living Wage rise is not compensation for welfare cuts, such as a removal of theÂ£20-a-week universal credit uplift, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies has consistently pointed out. Not all of those receiving benefits are in work, and for low-income employees who are, a rise in wages can mean a reduction in their benefits. Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said wage increases needed to be matched by support for smaller firms. Meanwhile, the Confederation of British Industry called on the chancellor to use the Budget to help get more firms ""investing to lift UK productivity"". ""We all want to see a higher-wage economy, but the real challenge is how to do so sustainably,"" it said. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said that although a wage increase would be welcomed by staff, it was a ""further cost increase for pubs who are still struggling to recover and face an uncertain future"". ""It makes beer duty, business rates and VAT cuts in the Budget on Wednesday all the more important for the viability of our sector,"" she added. Tom Ironside, director of business and regulations at the British Retail Consortium, said retailers supported the objective of higher wages and had been working hard to secure productivity improvements, so that those pay increases would be sustainable. ""This is made more challenging when retailers are currently grappling with an assortment of other government-imposed costs - higher National Insurance contributions, rising business rates, higher corporation tax - at a time when sales are slowing and supply chains are experiencing significant disruption,"" he added. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said her industry was ""committed to good and fair pay for its highly-valued staff"" and called for further government support, including ""immediate root-and-branch reform of business rates"".

Thanks for joining us, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's main headlines:  Today's live page was brought to you by Hugo Bachega, Victoria Lindrea and Mary O'Connor. The editor was Hamish Mackay. Smitha MundasadBBC health reporter Rare neurological conditions may occur after Covid vaccination, but the risk is far higher in people who catch Covid, new research suggests. Doctors say the landmark UK study provides further reassurance that being vaccinated offers the best protection for overall health. The investigators examined the NHS records of 32 million adults in England to assess any rare adverse events linked to Covid vaccines. The studyappears in Nature Medicine.,external The scientists, from the Universities of Oxford and Edinburgh, compared the levels of neurological conditions seen within a month of having a first Covid jab, to those seen within a month of a positive coronavirus test. One thing they looked for was a rare condition called Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) known to be associated with certain infectious diseases and linked to some other vaccines. You can read the results of the studyhere. Last year's street party was cancelled due to Covid Edinburgh's Hogmanay street party will return this year after Covid forced the cancellation of the 2020 event. The event, which also will feature the return of the Edinburgh Castle fireworks display, has a reduced capacity of 30,000. The last time the event was held in-person, in 2019, the street party was attended by 75,000 people. Last year's programme of events was heldonline due to the pandemic. Tickets for the event will go on sale on Tuesday. There have been a further 36,567 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today. It means the number of new cases has declined for a fourth consecutive day, after they reached 52,009 on 21 October. However, case numbers for Wales are yet to be added to today's tally. Another 38 deaths of people who tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days have also been recorded. The Russian capital has tightened Covid-19
restrictions amid a surge in cases, requiring the elderly to stay at home,
while at least a third of the workforce is to return to home working. From today, Moscow residents aged 60 and older, as well as those with chronic
conditions, are ordered to stay home in line withmeasures taken by Mayor Sergei Sobyanin,external. Those who can show proof of being vaccinated or of having had Covid-19 in the
past six months are exempt. In addition, employers have been told to move at least 30% of their staff back to
working remotely. These measures will stay in place for at least four months. Even tighter restrictions will come into force in Moscow on 28 October and last
until 7 November, when all non-essential organisations and businesses including
schools will beordered to close,external. Cafes, bars and restaurants
will only be able to serve takeaway food. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online US pharmaceutical company Modern
says it has had good results from trials giving children aged six to 11 its
Covid vaccine. The interim findings, described in a press release and based on
4,753 children, suggest two doses create a strong immune response. Moderna says
the mRNA vaccine was well tolerated and the most common side effects â a sore arm, tiredness, fever or headache â were mild. The vaccine was given
as a smaller dose than the adult equivalent. Other manufacturers have also been
testing paediatric doses. A panel of advisors in the US will vote on Tuesday
whether to authorise the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA Covid vaccine for use in children
aged five to 11. At least 6.1 million booster doses of the vaccine have been delivered in the UK, new NHS figures show. As of 24 October, estimated figures can be broken down by nations as follows:  In Wales, 322,591 booster doses had been delivered as of 21 October - the latest figures available. It means at least one in eight people in the UK who have received a first and second dose of vaccine are likely to have also received a booster jab. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has committed to wearing a mask in the Commons for this Wednesday's Budget ""given it will be packed"", but will not repeat his call for Tory colleagues to do the same. Last week, fellow cabinet member Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested members of Parliament did not need to wear masks, citing the ""convivial, fraternal spirit"" among Tory colleagues. But today, Javid tells the BBC: ""The guidelines are clear, it's for people to make a personal decision on how they see the risk of them and those around them - and this is obviously a workplace setting, so it's going to be a decision for them - but I can speak for myself."" Current government guidance says masks should be worn in ""crowded, enclosed spaces where [people] come into contact with people they do not normally meet"". Asked whether Boris Johnson will wear a mask on Budget day, the prime minister's official spokesman says it is ""a matter for personal judgment"". Sage scientist Prof John Edmunds has just told the BBC that the UK's vaccine booster programme needs to be rapidly accelerated to reduce the ""dangerous"" levels of infection across the country. But who exactly is eligible for a booster? At present, boosters are being offered to:  The dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination. For more information on boosters, read this explainer. We've got more from Prof
Edmunds, who warns that the UK's Covid booster campaign needs to be rapidly accelerated to reduce national infection levels. He
tells the BBC the UK needs to hit âvery highâ coverage of booster doses and calls
for the programme to be widened to everyone once the over-50s and other priority
groups have had third jabs. More
than five million people have received booster jabs since last month, according
to NHS England, but Prof Edmunds says the current pace is âslowerâ than the vaccine
rollout earlier this year and insists it needs to be âimprovedâ. ""I donât see any reason for it to go slow at the moment,"" he says. ""There
is in fact a great deal of reason for that to happen very quickly given the
very high levels of infection we have at the moment. ""Itâs quite a dangerous
situation that weâre in. âItâs
very important that [people] do get a booster because thereâs a lot of
infection around at the moment and I think the faster we can get boosters into
peoplesâ arms, the better."" As Covid cases rise, many medical experts and opposition politicians are calling on the government to reimpose some Covid restrictions in England, including working from home and compulsory face masks. In September that the government said it could bring inextra measures,externalin England - if necessary - to protect the NHS from ""unsustainable pressure"". Those measures - outlined below - are referred to as Plan B.  In effect, the introduction of Plan B would bring England in line with restrictions still in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. So what are the current restrictions across the four UK nations, how do they differ, and what are the various winter plans in the event of a health crisis? Read on to find out more. Earlier, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he expected the UK to havea ânormal Christmasâ this year provided the public âplay their partâand
insisted a move to tighter Plan B restrictions was not necessary ""at this point"". But a scientist advising the government tells the BBC it's âhard to be preciseâ about what the
Covid picture will look like at Christmas as there are âa lot of things in playâ, including
high case numbers among young people. Prof
John Edmunds, an infectious diseases expert who sits on the Scientific Advisory
Group for Emergencies and is part of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on
Modelling, warns thatwhile several scientific models,externalpredicted
cases âmight declineâ by Christmas, infections âcould still be pretty highâ by
then, which could pose a risk to older and vulnerable people during the festive
period, when there is more intergenerational mixing. Prof Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says he expects âa lot of changeâ between now and Christmas as the booster programme continues and teenagers are gradually vaccinated â but that
it is âhard to say with any great certaintyâ that infections in children will have dropped before the festive period. He
also points out that while scientific models say cases are likely to fall
at some point, âtheyâre likely to go back up again next yearâ which is due to âdeclining
immunity and a change in adultsâ contact patternsâ. Scotland's health secretary, Humza Yousaf, has insisted the booster programme is ""on track"" despite calls from opposition parties to speed up the rollout. From today, invitation letters are being sent to the 60-69 age group for a third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Yousaf says the government intends to allow over-50s, unpaid carers and household contacts of immunosuppressed individuals to book booster appointments online from mid-November - but stressed appointments can only take place six months after the second dose, in accordance with medical advice. Booster jabs are already being administered to Scots aged 70 and over, those at the highest risk from infection, care home residents and frontline health and social care workers. ""In addition to delivering the Covid-19 vaccine boosters, this year we are offering a record number of free flu vaccines to help protect the people of Scotland,"" the health secretary says. Despite the demonstration, the game between the Nets and Hornets went ahead as scheduled Anti-vaccine demonstrators gathered outside the Barclays Center on Sunday to show their support for basketball player Kyrie Irving, as his team, the Brooklyn Nets, played their first game of the NBA season. Irving has refused to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and is not allowed to play or train with his team until he does so, because of local vaccine rules. Some protesters broke through barriers outside the arena in New York before being confronted by security. No arrests or injuries were reported. The beginning of the new NBA seasonhas been dominated by debate over the Covid-19 vaccine,with some players saying they will not get jabbed and others refusing to confirm their vaccination status. Irving has recentlyshared microchip claims about the Moderna vaccine on social media,externaland admits to being a ""big conspiracy theorist"". There was no legal requirement for fans at this Manic Street Preachers gig in Cardiff to social distance Wales' top doctor has expressed concernthat some people are behaving as if the pandemic is over by ignoring Welsh laws on face coverings and not social distancing. Wales' case rate is at a record high of 716.9 cases per 100,000 people - the highest of all the UK nations. It has led ministers to look at extending the use ofNHS Covid passesfor a wider range of venues, such as cafes, bars and restaurants. Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton tells BBC Wales: ""A very significant proportion of the Welsh population is still behaving with extreme caution and realises that we are not out of the woods with this yet, but there is a sense other places that it is all over."" He says he worries when he sees people not wearing face coverings or crowding into indoor spaces without observing social distancing. Dr Atherton warns that unless people follow Covid rules, some of the ""more draconian"" measures and laws may have to return. Just joining us? Here are the latest Covid headlines in the UK. Yesterday, a further 39,962 new Covid cases were reported across the UK. That takes the seven-day average for cases - which is a more reliable indicator of infection levels, as there can be delays in daily reporting - to 46,920 cases per day. There were also a further 72 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test result. The seven-day average for deaths is now 124.

vaccines compulsory for the estimated 1.2 million front line health staff in England, rather than just those working in social care. Vaccination helps protects the individual from serious infection and death, but also reduces their chance of spreading the virus. From 11 November, it will be mandatory for anyone who works
in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home in England to prove they are
fully vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption. But it appears uptake is already high.Latest figures from NHS England,externalreveal more than nine in 10 staff in care homes for older adults have been vaccinated
with at least one dose, and more than eight in 10 have had two
doses. Javid says about 95% of NHS staff in England accepted the
offer of a Covid vaccine when they became available earlier in the year. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Twenty-two people died in the bombing on 22 May 2017 The decision not to question the Manchester Arena bomber after he returned to the UK from Libya four days before the attack was a mistake, a senior MI5 officer has conceded. The officer, referred to as Witness J, told the Manchester Arena Inquiry Salman Abedi was assessed in the months before the 22 May 2017 bombing. He said ""no intelligence"" indicating a threat to national security was found. But he conceded it was an error not to ask police to question Abedi on 18 May. The inquiry has begun looking at what was known about the 22-year-old before the attack, which saw 22 people die and hundreds more suffer injuries in a bombing at the venue on 22 May 2017. The hearing was told that from December 2013 to January 2017, Abedi was identified as being in direct contact with three ""subjects of interest"", one who was suspected of planning travel to Syria, one who had links to al-Qaeda and a third who had links to extremists in Libya. Between April 2016 and April 2017, he was identified as a second-level contact with three more ""subjects of interest"", all with suspected links to the Islamic State terror group. Witness J, appearing in court inside a bespoke wooden box and shielded from victims' families to maintain his anonymity, was asked by Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, if increased contact with ""a person of an extremist mindset"" would increase ""the concern [someone] might share their mindset?"" Witness J said it did not ""necessarily follow"" that having contact was ""a cumulative risk"". ""We have to make very fine judgments about whether someone meets the threshold of investigation,"" he said. ""A second-level contact is a contact of a contact. ""I'm not sure that... indicates a cumulative risk developing."" Manchester attack: Who were the victims? Bomber's brother is a coward, families say Terrorist told to assist to help families The inquiry was told Abedi had himself been made a ""subject of interest"" for five months, but his file was closed in July 2014, due to a ""lack of engagement"" with extremists. Witness J was asked about two prison visits by Abedi, the second of which was in January 2017. Mr Greaney asked him if the visits, along with the other intelligence, should have led to Abedi being designated a ""subject of interest"" once again. Witness J said there was ""no intelligence to indicate that the contact was related to Abedi posing a threat to national security"". ""The decision to not open [an investigation] was a reasonable one,"" he added. The hearing was also told that twice in the months prior to the attack, intelligence was received by MI5 about Abedi which was highly relevant to the planned attack but was assessed at the time to relate to non-terrorist criminality. Abedi's name also hit a ""priority indicator"" during a separate ""data-washing exercise"" as falling within a small number of former subjects of interest who merited further consideration. The hearing was also told an assessment on 1 May 2017 had concluded Abedi should be considered for further investigation and a meeting to consider that conclusion was scheduled for 31 May. Witness J conceded it was a mistake not to ask police to stop and question Abedi on his return to the UK on 18 May. The bomber immediately took a taxi to a store of explosives and set about making his final attack preparations. Asked by Mr Greaney if it had been a missed opportunity, Witness J said stopping him ""would have been the better course of action"". Inquiry chairman Sir John Saunders said MI5 had known Abedi was in contact with terrorist suspects and his father had been involved in such activities in Libya, adding that he looked like an ""obvious candidate"" to be involved in terrorism himself. Witness J had earlier told the inquiry Abedi's extremist views were ""likely to have been influenced by his father Ramadan Abedi"". The court has previously heard Ramadan Abedi has refused to help the inquiry and remains a suspect in the police investigation into the atrocity. Sir John asked Witness J about why Salman Abedi had not been referred to the Prevent counter-extremism scheme when he was closed as a subject of interest in July 2014. The witness said consideration of a Prevent referral was not ""policy"" at the time and that it was a ""reasonable"" decision not to refer Abedi. Sir John said it was a government de-radicalisation scheme and ""MI5 didn't take advantage of it"". The inquiry continues.

"Petrol prices have hit 142.94p a litre, their highest level to date, according to the RAC motoring organisation. Fuel prices were last around this level in April 2012. It is now Â£15 more expensive to fill up an average family car than a year earlier, said the RAC, which called the new high a ""dark day for drivers"". The RAC said the increase was partly due to a doubling of the oil price since last year. Some analysts believe the oil price could rise further. The price of unleaded petrol has jumped by 28p a litre since last October, the RAC said, meaning it now costs Â£78.61 to fill a family car. ""This will hurt many household budgets and no doubt have knock-on implications for the wider economy,"" a spokesman for the RAC said. The organisation said that other costs, aside from oil, had also pushed up fuel prices. Retailers had increased their profit margins by 2p a litre from around 5.5p in April last year to 7.5p a litre. The RAC said retailers, particularly the smaller, independent ones, were trying to rebuild their profits after the steep fall in sales prompted by the first UK lockdown in spring last year. In addition to this, the ethanol component of unleaded petrol was doubled to 10% last month in the more eco-friendly E10 fuel, but as ethanol is more expensive than petrol, that added about 1p a litre. What is E10 and can my car run on it? Duty paid on fuel is currently 57.95p a litre, more than the cost of the combined bio and petrol components, which amount to around 50p. VAT, currently around 24p a litre, is applied on top of all other elements of the petrol price, including duty and the retailer's profit margin. Petrol and diesel cars are slowly being phased out as part of pledges to tackle climate change. The government says it will ban the sale of these from 2030. The introduction of the E10 fuel as standard this summer is also part of that drive. The Department for Transport says bringing in this new fuel could cut carbon emissions by 750,000 tonnes a year, the equivalent of taking 350,000 cars off the road. Petrol and diesel prices nearing a record high Petrol station stocks back to normal What is E10 petrol and can my car run on it? Why are energy bills going up?

"The bank on St Mary's will close in April 2022 The only bank on the Isles of Scilly is set to close next year. Lloyds Bank will close its branch on St Mary's on 25 April, 2022. Phil Moon, who runs a restaurant and takeaway on the island, said the closure had come as a ""shock"" and would make running his business ""more complicated"". Lloyds Bank said the decision was due to changes in customer behaviour meaning the branch was used less often. Mr Moon said: ""We obviously lost Barclays a couple of years ago and Lloyds became the only bank on the island so we never saw this coming."" He said his business regularly used the bank for change stock and for taking cash off the premises for security. ""It was a shock, and quite an unpleasant one at that, I'm pretty disappointed to be honest; it's going to affect all of us and businesses especially."" Steve Sims, the Isles of Scilly councillor for economy, tourism and transport, said: ""It's really sad... and it's another blow against the high street"". He added: ""We've got three properties right on the high street really which are now vacant."" Lloyds Bank said staff would be on hand to advise and support customers. A spokesperson added: ""A new community banker will be made available to help customers with their everyday banking and customers can also continue to bank locally by visiting the nearby Post Office, which is a short walk away from the branch."" Mr Moon said using the Post Office would see people ""who just want to do bank transactions"" having to join the queue with those wanting stamps or postal services. ""It's just going to slow things down and make things more complicated,"" he said. Postmaster Lindsay Rodger says she is working to find solutions to help customers affected by the closure Lindsay Rodger, Postmaster of the St Mary's Post Office said they were working on finding solutions to help those affected, and making sure there was a ""smooth transition"" for customers. She said: ""With the bank closing it will mean the loss of the only ATM on the Isles of Scilly and that is a great area of concern for me. ""Without that we will struggle to allow cash to foreign visitors, to people with cash point cards, people with independent banks who do not have the banking facilities through the Post Office. ""And for the vulnerable and the elderly that do not access online."" Ms Rodgers said she was in the process of looking into the possibility of installing an ATM at the Post Office.

"Workers on the minimum wage are set to get a pay boost from April, with the rate for those aged over 23 rising to Â£9.50 an hour from Â£8.91. The rise means a full-time worker will get Â£1,074 extra a year before tax. The move will be announced at this week's Budget and follows the recommendation of independent advisers, the Low Pay Commission. The government has faced pressure to help low-paid, younger workers, who are among the worst hit by the pandemic. The 6.6% increase in the minimum pay rate for those aged over 23 - known as the National Living Wage - is more than twice the current 3.1% rise in the cost of living. Minimum pay rates for younger workers are also set to go up. The National Minimum Wage for people aged 21-22 will rise from Â£8.36 to Â£9.18 an hour and the Apprentice Rate will increase from Â£4.30 to Â£4.81 an hour. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the rise ""ensures we're making work pay and keeps us on track to meet our target to end low pay by the end of this Parliament"". But Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, described it as an ""underwhelming offer"" that would be mostly swallowed up by tax rises, universal credit cuts and higher energy bills. National Living Wage for over-23s: From Â£8.91 to Â£9.50 an hour National Minimum Wage for those aged 21-22: From Â£8.36 to Â£9.18 National Minimum Wage for 18 to 20-year-olds: From Â£6.56 to Â£6.83 National Minimum Wage for under-18s: From Â£4.62 to Â£4.81 The Apprentice Rate: From Â£4.30 to Â£4.81 How much is the minimum wage? Finn Oldfield, 23, earns the National Living Wage for his communications job at the People's Powerhouse social enterprise. He lives at home with his parents in Widnes, but said the increase would help him move to Liverpool city centre, which was unaffordable before the rise. ""It's hard if you're from a regional town. I have a politics and philosophy degree from Edinburgh University and thought I'd be able to find opportunities,"" Mr Oldfield told the BBC. After graduating last year in the middle of the pandemic, Mr Oldfield found his role through the government's Kickstart scheme, which encourages six-month jobs with businesses for people aged 16-24 who are currently claiming universal credit. ""With no rent control and higher energy prices, I think this will offset perhaps the harshest of the blows that have come,"" he said. ""But I think there's more that could be done by the government to help with rising everyday costs."" Campaign group the Living Wage Foundation welcomed the increases, but said there was still ""a substantial gap"" between the government-mandated minimum wage and its own calculations of a real living wage based on living costs. The foundation's director, Graham Griffiths, called on employers to ""commit to go beyond this new government minimum, do the right thing, and commit to pay a real living wage"". Salima Vellani, founder of restaurant chain Absurd Bird, says although higher wages will be ""tougher"" on the hospitality sector, increasing the minimum wage ""is the right move"". ""It is hard work, it's unsociable hours, so if people are leaving the industry in droves, then we have to attract them back,"" she said. ""That's not just about pay, it's about training."" Ms Vellani said agreeing with the minimum wage rise ""might be going against the grain, with all the labour issues we are facing"", but added her company had been pushing up wages generally to retain staff. ""You're going to have to pass some of this on to consumers, if your costs are going up,"" said the restaurant owner. ""It's going to be a challenge for a lot of operators who are facing extreme costs. ""If we what produce is good enough, people will keep buying from us."" Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation, said the National Living Wage increase was ""very welcome"", but would ""not remotely compensate"" forthe cut to universal credit. He said the universal credit change affected 4.4 million families, whereas only 2.2 million workers were on the living wage. The minimum wage that workers should get depends on their age and whether they are apprentices. Employers often worry that a higher minimum wage will lead to more unemployment, and that they will be forced to lay off workers in order to afford the increases. But independent experts maintain there has been little or no evidence of job losses as a result of rising minimum wage levels. Giving millions of workers a 6.6% pay rise sounds generous and will be a welcome boost to many pay packets. It also follows the government's - and particularly the prime minister's - narrative of pushing towards a higher-wage economy. Yet this would be no bumper pay day for low-income families. They spend a higher proportion of income than others on heating and lighting their homes. Hefty gas and electricity bill rises, on top of recent increases this month, are inevitable in the spring. Prices in the shops are going up and many economists believe the increases could last longer than previously expected. Finally, a National Living Wage rise is not compensation for welfare cuts, such as a removal of theÂ£20-a-week universal credit uplift, as the Institute for Fiscal Studies has consistently pointed out. Not all of those receiving benefits are in work, and for low-income employees who are, a rise in wages can mean a reduction in their benefits. Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said wage increases needed to be matched by support for smaller firms. Meanwhile, the Confederation of British Industry called on the chancellor to use the Budget to help get more firms ""investing to lift UK productivity"". ""We all want to see a higher-wage economy, but the real challenge is how to do so sustainably,"" it said. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said that although a wage increase would be welcomed by staff, it was a ""further cost increase for pubs who are still struggling to recover and face an uncertain future"". ""It makes beer duty, business rates and VAT cuts in the Budget on Wednesday all the more important for the viability of our sector,"" she added. Tom Ironside, director of business and regulations at the British Retail Consortium, said retailers supported the objective of higher wages and had been working hard to secure productivity improvements, so that those pay increases would be sustainable. ""This is made more challenging when retailers are currently grappling with an assortment of other government-imposed costs - higher National Insurance contributions, rising business rates, higher corporation tax - at a time when sales are slowing and supply chains are experiencing significant disruption,"" he added. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said her industry was ""committed to good and fair pay for its highly-valued staff"" and called for further government support, including ""immediate root-and-branch reform of business rates"".

"This video can not be played Tata says guidance is needed to safeguard thousands of jobs Tata Steel says it needs a route map from the UK government before it decides how it will make steel in the future. There are fears the steel industry, as the biggest single emitter of CO2 in the UK, might not fit into a new greener economy and thousands of jobs could be lost. That would damage communities in Port Talbot, Newport, Llanelli and Shotton. The UK government said it was supporting the steel industry. Tata Steel employs 6,600 people in Wales Tata Steel has already reduced its emissions and said it wants to go much further but has not yet worked out how. It said the industry alone could not solve the emissions problem and there had to be a partnership with government. Welsh industry's 23 million tonne carbon problem How are we doing with cutting emissions? What is Wales' role at the COP26 climate summit? A range of options are available to steelmakers, including using hydrogen, electric furnaces or carbon capture. Tata Steel employs 6,600 people in Wales on wages that are, on average, 36% higher than the UK average. There has been concern about jobs and questions about the firm's future because of its impact on the environment. Tata Steel's sustainability spokesman Martin Brunnock said: ""There's no point us saying we won't make steel in the UK because that doesn't solve your carbon problem. ""All we do then is import carbon through our borders in finished goods or coils of steel to be used in the UK."" Tata Steel, in Port Talbot, is one of the UK's biggest emitters of climate-warming gases At the Port Talbot steelworks, carbon dioxide emissions have already been reduced by recycling scrap steel back into the liquid steel. Tata said 20% of its scrap steel now goes back into the system and every 1% extra of scrap recycled reduces the plant's carbon emissions by 150,000 tonnes a year. But it needs to do more than that to reach its target. ""We can't do this alone. How do you get an energy infrastructure, hydrogen infrastructure, how do you create that carbon capture technology, how does that all work?"" Mr Brunnock said. He added ""revolutionary"" policies were needed and ""a route map would be really helpful"". There are concerns that changes to the way steel is made - to make it greener - could result in thousands of job losses . The demise of steel would lead to deprivation in Welsh communities, says Jaqueline Thomas Tata Steel employee Jaqueline Thomas said there had been a ""lack of empathy"" over the impact of changes to the economy on areas such as hers. ""I myself travel down from Tredegar in Blaenau Gwent and we lost Ebbw Vale steelworks in 2002 and we've seen how the economy has changed, how it's hit the area I live in,"" she said. ""Not just me but Redcar is the same and how the community has become deprived, lack of jobs - and what can we do? ""There's obviously a lack of empathy as well with the younger generation because they get very much disorientated about where their future lies and we've got to make sure that the steel industry survives for the young apprentices that also travel down here on a daily basis. ""I'd hate to see the steel industry shrink to a point where the community involvement is no longer there. There has always been a massive camaraderie amongst the communities... steel has always been at the heart of this community."" Tata Steel says it wants to make more changes, but is not sure how It is not about a future lack of demand. Tata Steel believes that the amount of steel used in the UK will increase by 10% by 2030 and many renewable energy projects and low carbon transport systems will rely on it. Already more than two-thirds of the steel it makes stays in the UK. Steel made at the Port Talbot plant goes into car production, food packaging, construction and even used to make walls that can generate electricity. Many of its customers want steel that is made in such a way that it has less impact on the environment. It is expected that will increase as companies will have to publish the impact of their supply chain on emission levels. The industry is already struggling with energy prices rising steeply and competition from overseas. The UK government's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said: ""We are already working closely with Britain's steel sector to support its transition to a low carbon future. ""We have previously announced a Â£250m clean steel fund to support the industry to reduce carbon emissions, and our industrial decarbonisation strategy sets out how it can be done in a way that prevents industrial activity from being outsourced overseas and supports competitiveness, jobs and clean growth.""

"Steelworkers collectively transferred Â£2.8 billion from their pensions The public spending watchdog will investigate the Financial Conduct Authority over the British Steel pension scandal. About 8,000 steelworkers, many from Wales,collectively transferred about Â£2.8bnfrom the firm's scheme when it was restructured in 2017. A Commons select committee said they were prey to ""vulture"" financial advisors in a ""misselling scandal"". The FCA said it was looking forward to working with the National Audit Office. The NAO will examine the FCA's plans for supporting steelworkers who may be entitled to redress, and the extent to which compensation is being delivered. British Steel Pension Scandal: Grant details to be released Steel pensions scheme victim to 'major misselling scandal' Fraud warning issued to former clients of steel pensions adviser The NAO said many steelworkers had been given bad advice and may have made poor choices, which could have seen them lose ""significant sums"". Richard Pugh said the Financial Conduct Authority ""have let steelworkers down"" Port Talbot steel worker Richard Pugh said the value of his pension had plummeted Â£20,000 in the past two weeks. The 47-year-old said he and other workers ""did not have a clue"" what they were doing when they had to decide on the next steps for their pension arrangements. They were given assorted options, including transferring their funds from the British Steel pension scheme altogether. ""Realistically, a lot of us are financially illiterate when it comes to pensions,"" he said, meaning many steelworkers had been left in an ""extremely vulnerable"" position. ""We were in the Tata Steel final pension which was gold,"" he said, with some pension pots worth up to Â£500,000. He called the FCA an ""absolute disgrace"". Blaenau Gwent MP Nick Smith said more than Â£20m had been paid out to steelworkers by the financial services compensation scheme The NAO encouraged people to examine advice they had received and complain if they had any concerns. ""This investigation will set out the activities the FCA has undertaken to regulate financial advice in the British Steel pension scheme case, its plans for supporting steelworkers who may be entitled to redress, and the extent to which compensation is being delivered,"" it said. Port Talbot financial advisor Alastair Rush, who has been helping some of those who have suffered, called the investigation ""incredible"" and a ""deal changer"". He added: ""The regulator should have been here four-and-a-half years ago, when it was pointed out to them the problems that were unfolding."" While there was ""light at the end of the tunnel"" for some, it was not the case for all. ""Many will have died not knowing whether there loved ones would have compensation or whether they would be looked after in their retirement."" Blaenau Gwent MP, Nick Smith, who had asked the NAO to look into how the regulator handled the scandal, said: ""Justice is needed after one of the biggest financial rip-offs of working people in south Wales and other steel-making areas across the UK. ""We are now four years into this sad story and still IFA (independent financial advisors) sharks and their introducer cronies are evading criminal penalties."" He said just 1,200 out of the 8,000 steelworkers likely to be affected had complained so far. ""Furthermore, 85% to 90% of their complaints have been upheld, so a big pool of steelworkers with likely good cause are being left behind."" The results of the NAO inquiry will be published in the spring. An FCA spokeswoman said: ""We've introduced new rules to raise the standard of pension transfer advice and we're taking action, both with individual firms and across the sector, to ensure that where consumers lost out because of unsuitable advice they receive compensation.""

"Twenty-two people died in the bombing on 22 May 2017 The decision not to question the Manchester Arena bomber after he returned to the UK from Libya four days before the attack was a mistake, a senior MI5 officer has conceded. The officer, referred to as Witness J, told the Manchester Arena Inquiry Salman Abedi was assessed in the months before the 22 May 2017 bombing. He said ""no intelligence"" indicating a threat to national security was found. But he conceded it was an error not to ask police to question Abedi on 18 May. The inquiry has begun looking at what was known about the 22-year-old before the attack, which saw 22 people die and hundreds more suffer injuries in a bombing at the venue on 22 May 2017. The hearing was told that from December 2013 to January 2017, Abedi was identified as being in direct contact with three ""subjects of interest"", one who was suspected of planning travel to Syria, one who had links to al-Qaeda and a third who had links to extremists in Libya. Between April 2016 and April 2017, he was identified as a second-level contact with three more ""subjects of interest"", all with suspected links to the Islamic State terror group. Witness J, appearing in court inside a bespoke wooden box and shielded from victims' families to maintain his anonymity, was asked by Paul Greaney QC, counsel to the inquiry, if increased contact with ""a person of an extremist mindset"" would increase ""the concern [someone] might share their mindset?"" Witness J said it did not ""necessarily follow"" that having contact was ""a cumulative risk"". ""We have to make very fine judgments about whether someone meets the threshold of investigation,"" he said. ""A second-level contact is a contact of a contact. ""I'm not sure that... indicates a cumulative risk developing."" Manchester attack: Who were the victims? Bomber's brother is a coward, families say Terrorist told to assist to help families The inquiry was told Abedi had himself been made a ""subject of interest"" for five months, but his file was closed in July 2014, due to a ""lack of engagement"" with extremists. Witness J was asked about two prison visits by Abedi, the second of which was in January 2017. Mr Greaney asked him if the visits, along with the other intelligence, should have led to Abedi being designated a ""subject of interest"" once again. Witness J said there was ""no intelligence to indicate that the contact was related to Abedi posing a threat to national security"". ""The decision to not open [an investigation] was a reasonable one,"" he added. The hearing was also told that twice in the months prior to the attack, intelligence was received by MI5 about Abedi which was highly relevant to the planned attack but was assessed at the time to relate to non-terrorist criminality. Abedi's name also hit a ""priority indicator"" during a separate ""data-washing exercise"" as falling within a small number of former subjects of interest who merited further consideration. The hearing was also told an assessment on 1 May 2017 had concluded Abedi should be considered for further investigation and a meeting to consider that conclusion was scheduled for 31 May. Witness J conceded it was a mistake not to ask police to stop and question Abedi on his return to the UK on 18 May. The bomber immediately took a taxi to a store of explosives and set about making his final attack preparations. Asked by Mr Greaney if it had been a missed opportunity, Witness J said stopping him ""would have been the better course of action"". Inquiry chairman Sir John Saunders said MI5 had known Abedi was in contact with terrorist suspects and his father had been involved in such activities in Libya, adding that he looked like an ""obvious candidate"" to be involved in terrorism himself. Witness J had earlier told the inquiry Abedi's extremist views were ""likely to have been influenced by his father Ramadan Abedi"". The court has previously heard Ramadan Abedi has refused to help the inquiry and remains a suspect in the police investigation into the atrocity. Sir John asked Witness J about why Salman Abedi had not been referred to the Prevent counter-extremism scheme when he was closed as a subject of interest in July 2014. The witness said consideration of a Prevent referral was not ""policy"" at the time and that it was a ""reasonable"" decision not to refer Abedi. Sir John said it was a government de-radicalisation scheme and ""MI5 didn't take advantage of it"". The inquiry continues.

Thanks for joining us, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's main headlines:  Today's live page was brought to you by Hugo Bachega, Victoria Lindrea and Mary O'Connor. The editor was Hamish Mackay. Smitha MundasadBBC health reporter Rare neurological conditions may occur after Covid vaccination, but the risk is far higher in people who catch Covid, new research suggests. Doctors say the landmark UK study provides further reassurance that being vaccinated offers the best protection for overall health. The investigators examined the NHS records of 32 million adults in England to assess any rare adverse events linked to Covid vaccines. The studyappears in Nature Medicine.,external The scientists, from the Universities of Oxford and Edinburgh, compared the levels of neurological conditions seen within a month of having a first Covid jab, to those seen within a month of a positive coronavirus test. One thing they looked for was a rare condition called Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) known to be associated with certain infectious diseases and linked to some other vaccines. You can read the results of the studyhere. Last year's street party was cancelled due to Covid Edinburgh's Hogmanay street party will return this year after Covid forced the cancellation of the 2020 event. The event, which also will feature the return of the Edinburgh Castle fireworks display, has a reduced capacity of 30,000. The last time the event was held in-person, in 2019, the street party was attended by 75,000 people. Last year's programme of events was heldonline due to the pandemic. Tickets for the event will go on sale on Tuesday. There have been a further 36,567 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today. It means the number of new cases has declined for a fourth consecutive day, after they reached 52,009 on 21 October. However, case numbers for Wales are yet to be added to today's tally. Another 38 deaths of people who tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days have also been recorded. The Russian capital has tightened Covid-19
restrictions amid a surge in cases, requiring the elderly to stay at home,
while at least a third of the workforce is to return to home working. From today, Moscow residents aged 60 and older, as well as those with chronic
conditions, are ordered to stay home in line withmeasures taken by Mayor Sergei Sobyanin,external. Those who can show proof of being vaccinated or of having had Covid-19 in the
past six months are exempt. In addition, employers have been told to move at least 30% of their staff back to
working remotely. These measures will stay in place for at least four months. Even tighter restrictions will come into force in Moscow on 28 October and last
until 7 November, when all non-essential organisations and businesses including
schools will beordered to close,external. Cafes, bars and restaurants
will only be able to serve takeaway food. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online US pharmaceutical company Modern
says it has had good results from trials giving children aged six to 11 its
Covid vaccine. The interim findings, described in a press release and based on
4,753 children, suggest two doses create a strong immune response. Moderna says
the mRNA vaccine was well tolerated and the most common side effects â a sore arm, tiredness, fever or headache â were mild. The vaccine was given
as a smaller dose than the adult equivalent. Other manufacturers have also been
testing paediatric doses. A panel of advisors in the US will vote on Tuesday
whether to authorise the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA Covid vaccine for use in children
aged five to 11. At least 6.1 million booster doses of the vaccine have been delivered in the UK, new NHS figures show. As of 24 October, estimated figures can be broken down by nations as follows:  In Wales, 322,591 booster doses had been delivered as of 21 October - the latest figures available. It means at least one in eight people in the UK who have received a first and second dose of vaccine are likely to have also received a booster jab. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has committed to wearing a mask in the Commons for this Wednesday's Budget ""given it will be packed"", but will not repeat his call for Tory colleagues to do the same. Last week, fellow cabinet member Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested members of Parliament did not need to wear masks, citing the ""convivial, fraternal spirit"" among Tory colleagues. But today, Javid tells the BBC: ""The guidelines are clear, it's for people to make a personal decision on how they see the risk of them and those around them - and this is obviously a workplace setting, so it's going to be a decision for them - but I can speak for myself."" Current government guidance says masks should be worn in ""crowded, enclosed spaces where [people] come into contact with people they do not normally meet"". Asked whether Boris Johnson will wear a mask on Budget day, the prime minister's official spokesman says it is ""a matter for personal judgment"". Sage scientist Prof John Edmunds has just told the BBC that the UK's vaccine booster programme needs to be rapidly accelerated to reduce the ""dangerous"" levels of infection across the country. But who exactly is eligible for a booster? At present, boosters are being offered to:  The dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination. For more information on boosters, read this explainer. We've got more from Prof
Edmunds, who warns that the UK's Covid booster campaign needs to be rapidly accelerated to reduce national infection levels. He
tells the BBC the UK needs to hit âvery highâ coverage of booster doses and calls
for the programme to be widened to everyone once the over-50s and other priority
groups have had third jabs. More
than five million people have received booster jabs since last month, according
to NHS England, but Prof Edmunds says the current pace is âslowerâ than the vaccine
rollout earlier this year and insists it needs to be âimprovedâ. ""I donât see any reason for it to go slow at the moment,"" he says. ""There
is in fact a great deal of reason for that to happen very quickly given the
very high levels of infection we have at the moment. ""Itâs quite a dangerous
situation that weâre in. âItâs
very important that [people] do get a booster because thereâs a lot of
infection around at the moment and I think the faster we can get boosters into
peoplesâ arms, the better."" As Covid cases rise, many medical experts and opposition politicians are calling on the government to reimpose some Covid restrictions in England, including working from home and compulsory face masks. In September that the government said it could bring inextra measures,externalin England - if necessary - to protect the NHS from ""unsustainable pressure"". Those measures - outlined below - are referred to as Plan B.  In effect, the introduction of Plan B would bring England in line with restrictions still in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. So what are the current restrictions across the four UK nations, how do they differ, and what are the various winter plans in the event of a health crisis? Read on to find out more. Earlier, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he expected the UK to havea ânormal Christmasâ this year provided the public âplay their partâand
insisted a move to tighter Plan B restrictions was not necessary ""at this point"". But a scientist advising the government tells the BBC it's âhard to be preciseâ about what the
Covid picture will look like at Christmas as there are âa lot of things in playâ, including
high case numbers among young people. Prof
John Edmunds, an infectious diseases expert who sits on the Scientific Advisory
Group for Emergencies and is part of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on
Modelling, warns thatwhile several scientific models,externalpredicted
cases âmight declineâ by Christmas, infections âcould still be pretty highâ by
then, which could pose a risk to older and vulnerable people during the festive
period, when there is more intergenerational mixing. Prof Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says he expects âa lot of changeâ between now and Christmas as the booster programme continues and teenagers are gradually vaccinated â but that
it is âhard to say with any great certaintyâ that infections in children will have dropped before the festive period. He
also points out that while scientific models say cases are likely to fall
at some point, âtheyâre likely to go back up again next yearâ which is due to âdeclining
immunity and a change in adultsâ contact patternsâ. Scotland's health secretary, Humza Yousaf, has insisted the booster programme is ""on track"" despite calls from opposition parties to speed up the rollout. From today, invitation letters are being sent to the 60-69 age group for a third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Yousaf says the government intends to allow over-50s, unpaid carers and household contacts of immunosuppressed individuals to book booster appointments online from mid-November - but stressed appointments can only take place six months after the second dose, in accordance with medical advice. Booster jabs are already being administered to Scots aged 70 and over, those at the highest risk from infection, care home residents and frontline health and social care workers. ""In addition to delivering the Covid-19 vaccine boosters, this year we are offering a record number of free flu vaccines to help protect the people of Scotland,"" the health secretary says. Despite the demonstration, the game between the Nets and Hornets went ahead as scheduled Anti-vaccine demonstrators gathered outside the Barclays Center on Sunday to show their support for basketball player Kyrie Irving, as his team, the Brooklyn Nets, played their first game of the NBA season.

"This video can not be played The Â£1.7bn third proposal to built a tidal lagoon in Swansea bay A Bridgend company is leading plans to build a Â£1.7bn renewable energy project on Swansea's waterfront. The Blue Eden scheme includes a tidal lagoon and floating solar panels. This is the third proposal to develop a tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay, and would include a battery factory and a data centre run on renewable energy. No tax payers' money would be needed, according to the consortium, but consent will be required from the Welsh government for the energy projects. The international consortium is led by DST Innovations, which makes industrial batteries in the United States. Welsh industry's 23 million tonne carbon problem Action on green energy needed now, says trade body Green energy issues 'threaten' climate change goal Blue Eden would be developed in three phases over twelve years, starting in 2023 with 1,000 jobs making high tech batteries for energy storage. That would be followed by construction of a floating solar energy farm in the Queens Dock area and large data centre powered by an uninterruptable source of renewable energy, which would be a UK first. The heat generated by the computer servers in the centre would then heat 5,000 new eco-homes along the waterfront. Plans would include floating solar panels There would also be an oceanic and climate change research centre and 150 floating houses, as seen in the Netherlands. The project hopes to support 16,000 jobs across the Swansea Bay city region in the long term. Swansea council's leader Rob Stewart said: ""I'm delighted that an international consortium led by a Welsh company has developed our Dragon Energy Island vision into a ground-breaking project that delivers so many benefits and builds on the council's ambition to become a net zero city by 2050. ""Cooperation and support will be required, trying to make sure the permissions and the consents that are needed are in place."" Floating eco-homes like this one could be seen on Swansea's waterfront if the plans go ahead Mr Stewart explained that Blue Eden had signed a memorandum of understanding with Associated British Ports and were in discussions with them about acquiring land. The projected energy output of the tidal lagoon and floating solar panels are just under 320 megawatts each, which means Welsh government would be responsible for giving consent to these elements. Swansea council supports the project but Mr Stewart said no public money would be given to it: ""Blue Eden will put Swansea and Wales at the cutting-edge of global renewable energy innovation, helping create thousands of well-paid jobs, significantly cut our carbon footprint and further raise Swansea's profile across the world as a place to invest."" An image by DST of the proposed tidal lagoon including turbines DST's co-founder and chief executive Tony Miles said: ""Blue Eden is an opportunity to create a template for the world to follow - utilising renewable energy and maximising new technologies and thinking to develop not only a place to live and work, but also to thrive."" The company added it did not any need money from either the UK or Welsh government, or a guaranteed price for the electricity, since all the electricity produced will be used within the Blue Eden development. Mr Miles said he hoped to start building work in two years' time: ""We'd like to break ground in a couple of years, once we've finalised all the studies, and some fairly major investors have injected a lot of capital into this already. ""We're hoping without too many bad statistics for future sea rises and weather forecasts, it has 120 years of life before somebody comes up with a new version."" The latest project for Swansea Bay differs widely from previous attempts to generate renewable energy there. In contrast this is entirely privately funded, does not feed electricity into the National Grid and is different in the way it develops two industries - batteries for the renewable sector and a data centre, saving time and producing an income while the lengthy planning process for the lagoon takes place. However, it is still early days for the project. The battery production is still at the pilot stage and involves using, but not burning, anthracite coal - a sodium solution. DST said it would be less affected by extreme weather than batteries made from lithium. Blue Eden's plans also depend on customers for the data centre and the company says it has already been contacted by people who are interested. The biggest hurdles to the project are permissions from four public sector organisations. It needs a license from the Crown Estate to construct the lagoon wall on the sea bed, planning permission for the battery factory, data centre and housing from Swansea Council, permission to generate electricity from Welsh government and a license from Natural Resources Wales. The first proposals for a tidal lagoon in Swansea Bay faced detailed criticism from groups that were concerned about its impact on ecology and fish migration from the sea into rivers to spawn. The lagoon would produce 320 megawatts of electricity which would power more than 5,000 homes on site, a data centre, an oceanographic and climate change research centre and battery manufacturing plant. That size means that it is not big enough to need permission from the UK government.

Thanks for joining us, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's main headlines:  Today's live page was brought to you by Hugo Bachega, Victoria Lindrea and Mary O'Connor. The editor was Hamish Mackay. Smitha MundasadBBC health reporter Rare neurological conditions may occur after Covid vaccination, but the risk is far higher in people who catch Covid, new research suggests. Doctors say the landmark UK study provides further reassurance that being vaccinated offers the best protection for overall health. The investigators examined the NHS records of 32 million adults in England to assess any rare adverse events linked to Covid vaccines. The studyappears in Nature Medicine.,external The scientists, from the Universities of Oxford and Edinburgh, compared the levels of neurological conditions seen within a month of having a first Covid jab, to those seen within a month of a positive coronavirus test. One thing they looked for was a rare condition called Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) known to be associated with certain infectious diseases and linked to some other vaccines. You can read the results of the studyhere. Last year's street party was cancelled due to Covid Edinburgh's Hogmanay street party will return this year after Covid forced the cancellation of the 2020 event. The event, which also will feature the return of the Edinburgh Castle fireworks display, has a reduced capacity of 30,000. The last time the event was held in-person, in 2019, the street party was attended by 75,000 people. Last year's programme of events was heldonline due to the pandemic. Tickets for the event will go on sale on Tuesday. There have been a further 36,567 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today. It means the number of new cases has declined for a fourth consecutive day, after they reached 52,009 on 21 October. However, case numbers for Wales are yet to be added to today's tally. Another 38 deaths of people who tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days have also been recorded. The Russian capital has tightened Covid-19
restrictions amid a surge in cases, requiring the elderly to stay at home,
while at least a third of the workforce is to return to home working. From today, Moscow residents aged 60 and older, as well as those with chronic
conditions, are ordered to stay home in line withmeasures taken by Mayor Sergei Sobyanin,external. Those who can show proof of being vaccinated or of having had Covid-19 in the
past six months are exempt. In addition, employers have been told to move at least 30% of their staff back to
working remotely. These measures will stay in place for at least four months. Even tighter restrictions will come into force in Moscow on 28 October and last
until 7 November, when all non-essential organisations and businesses including
schools will beordered to close,external. Cafes, bars and restaurants
will only be able to serve takeaway food. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online US pharmaceutical company Modern
says it has had good results from trials giving children aged six to 11 its
Covid vaccine. The interim findings, described in a press release and based on
4,753 children, suggest two doses create a strong immune response. Moderna says
the mRNA vaccine was well tolerated and the most common side effects â a sore arm, tiredness, fever or headache â were mild. The vaccine was given
as a smaller dose than the adult equivalent. Other manufacturers have also been
testing paediatric doses. A panel of advisors in the US will vote on Tuesday
whether to authorise the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA Covid vaccine for use in children
aged five to 11. At least 6.1 million booster doses of the vaccine have been delivered in the UK, new NHS figures show. As of 24 October, estimated figures can be broken down by nations as follows:  In Wales, 322,591 booster doses had been delivered as of 21 October - the latest figures available. It means at least one in eight people in the UK who have received a first and second dose of vaccine are likely to have also received a booster jab. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has committed to wearing a mask in the Commons for this Wednesday's Budget ""given it will be packed"", but will not repeat his call for Tory colleagues to do the same. Last week, fellow cabinet member Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested members of Parliament did not need to wear masks, citing the ""convivial, fraternal spirit"" among Tory colleagues. But today, Javid tells the BBC: ""The guidelines are clear, it's for people to make a personal decision on how they see the risk of them and those around them - and this is obviously a workplace setting, so it's going to be a decision for them - but I can speak for myself."" Current government guidance says masks should be worn in ""crowded, enclosed spaces where [people] come into contact with people they do not normally meet"". Asked whether Boris Johnson will wear a mask on Budget day, the prime minister's official spokesman says it is ""a matter for personal judgment"". Sage scientist Prof John Edmunds has just told the BBC that the UK's vaccine booster programme needs to be rapidly accelerated to reduce the ""dangerous"" levels of infection across the country. But who exactly is eligible for a booster? At present, boosters are being offered to:  The dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination. For more information on boosters, read this explainer. We've got more from Prof
Edmunds, who warns that the UK's Covid booster campaign needs to be rapidly accelerated to reduce national infection levels. He
tells the BBC the UK needs to hit âvery highâ coverage of booster doses and calls
for the programme to be widened to everyone once the over-50s and other priority
groups have had third jabs. More
than five million people have received booster jabs since last month, according
to NHS England, but Prof Edmunds says the current pace is âslowerâ than the vaccine
rollout earlier this year and insists it needs to be âimprovedâ. ""I donât see any reason for it to go slow at the moment,"" he says. ""There
is in fact a great deal of reason for that to happen very quickly given the
very high levels of infection we have at the moment. ""Itâs quite a dangerous
situation that weâre in. âItâs
very important that [people] do get a booster because thereâs a lot of
infection around at the moment and I think the faster we can get boosters into
peoplesâ arms, the better.""

The money will be used to help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans, which has been worsened by the pandemic, and also to buy equipment and improve IT. Chancellor Rishi Sunak called the announcement ""game-changing"". Health bodies welcomed the latest pledge but said it would not solve the problem of staff shortages. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said the funding was ""new money"" and that Mr Sunak would set out exactly where it was coming from during Wednesday's Budget and Spending Review. A simple guide to Budget 2021 Six things that could affect you in the Budget Budget 2021: Five things to look out for More than five million people are waiting for NHS hospital treatment in England, with hundreds of thousands waiting more than a year. The Â£5.9bn is on top of the Â£12bn a yearthat was announced in September.,external. That money will be raised through tax increases - the rise in National Insurance and, from 2022, the Health and Social Care Levy - and will be spent on resources such as staffing. The Â£5.9bn will be used to pay for physical infrastructure and equipment - not day-to-day spending. Some of the Â£5.9bn - Â£2.3bn - will be used to fund more diagnostic tests, like CT, MRI and ultrasound scans, the government said. More clinics in shopping centres for scans and tests -which the government had already announced- will be opened. These will help clear the backlog of tests by the end of this Parliament, the government said. Also included in the Â£5.9bn total is: Â£1.5bn on beds, equipment and new ""surgical hubs"" Â£2.1bn on improving IT and digital technology within the NHS A proportionate amount will also go to the health services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Access to tests and scans is a real bottleneck in the system at the moment, slowing down the ability of the NHS to work its way through the backlog in routine care and, sometimes, delaying the diagnosis of cancer. It has been known for years the NHS does not have enough equipment to carry out tests and scans. And the machines it has are ageing. The problems mean as demand has increased, performance has deteriorated. The aim is to get these tests done within six weeks of referral, unless it is an urgent cancer case. But currently around a quarter of patients wait longer than that. Before the pandemic fewer than 5% did. The funding will help, in time, improve the situation. But the big issue that it does not tackle is staffing - there is a shortage of specialists to carry out these tests. Around one in 10 posts are currently vacant. There are various reasons for this, including more part-time working, the numbers retiring and problems recruiting internationally because of the pandemic. Buying new machines is much easier than training, recruiting and retaining staff. Until that is resolved, many are sceptical about what this announcement will actually achieve. Waiting lists have grown as routine operations were cancelled throughout the pandemic and people who put off seeking help for symptoms come forward. Some of those in the healthcare sector warned it was not enough to keep up with costs and demand. Christopher Rigby, an NHS radiographer from Yorkshire, said: ""We haven't got the workforce to staff the hospitals we have now let alone all these new centres."" NHS Providers - which speaks for hospital and other NHS trusts - warned the health service needed more staff to deliver services. A body representing healthcare leaders, the NHS Confederation, said the funding ""falls short of what is needed to get services completely back on track"". The NHS is sending out a further two million invites for Covid booster jabs this week. The health secretary said ""we should actively be looking at"" making jabs mandatory for NHS staff, as they are for care workers. Mr Javid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would wear a face covering during Wednesday's Budget announcement in the Commons. But he said now was not time to activate England's ""Plan B"", that would make face masks mandatory in many places. Are you an NHS professional or patient affected by the NHS backlog?

"Proof of vaccine status can be given using a smartphone app The first weekend of enforcement of Scotland's vaccine passport scheme was an ""unmitigated disaster"", according to a body representing night-time venues. Venue staff refused entry to revellers without vaccine passports more than 550 times, and some staff were abused, the Scottish Hospitality Group said. It said some venues decided to close early and footfall was down by up to 40%. The Scottish government said the scheme was a ""proportionate"" health measure. Ministers say it will encourage more people to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and ensure late-night venues can remain open during a ""potentially very difficult"" winter. Vaccine passport scheme enforceable by law Scotland's vaccine passport scheme goes live The vaccine certification scheme was introduced on 1 October but there was no enforcement during a 17-day ""grace period"" as venues adjusted to the new requirements. The Scottish Hospitality Group, which opposes the scheme, said the first real test this weekend had been ""one of unmitigated disaster"". ""The Scottish Hospitality Group has been warning the government for weeks that their vaccine passports scheme is not ready - but the government's attitude has been to tell us to 'get on with it' whilst offering no safety net of support for businesses or our hard working staff,"" spokesperson Stephen Montgomery said. ""The experience of this weekend shows that the result has been intolerable levels of abuse of our staff, and the creation of an atmosphere that will totally undermine anyone's enjoyment of our night-time venues."" People attending nightclubs and other large venues have to be able to show proof of two Covid jabs The group said there was a ""concerning number"" of reports of staff being abused over rejections and queues which led to a ""charged atmosphere"". Some venues had decided to close at midnight, taking them outside the scope of the scheme, because of problems with staff recruitment and welfare, it said. Mr Montgomery rejected a suggestion that the numbers being turned away was a sign the scheme was working properly in keeping unvaccinated people away from higher risk settings. ""Turning people away at the door - yes, I get the point to a degree - but all it's doing is sending them somewhere else, a dancefloor that has tables and chairs on it that does away with dancing,"" he told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotland programme. The Scottish Conservatives said the scheme was ""unworkable and unreasonable"" with no financial support for businesses or their staff. The party's Covid recovery spokesperson Murdo Fraser said: ""What is most concerning is the levels of abuse hospitality workers have been subjected to, caused by a lack of public engagement, and a frustrating and unreliable app."" The Scottish government insisted it was continuing to engage with the sector to discuss implementation of the scheme. A spokesperson said: ""Covid-19 certification is a proportionate way of encouraging people to get vaccinated, and also of helping large events and night-time hospitality to keep operating during what will potentially be a very difficult winter. ""This means many businesses will not have to close and can continue to trade whilst making necessary adjustments to ensure their premises are as safe as possible for staff and customers."" People who have had two vaccines in Scotland candownload or get a paper copy of a certificate with a QR code,external. Everyone over the age of 18 must now show - if asked - that they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to certain venues and events. These include: Nightclubs and ""analogous venues"" Adult entertainment venues Unseated indoor events with more than 500 people, even if some are seated Unseated outdoor events with more than 4,000 people Any event with more than 10,000 people in attendance The scheme requires venues to put in place a ""reasonable system"" to check the status of customers, with certain exemptions on medical grounds. For large events such as football matches spot checks can be used, but for smaller gatherings more rigorous checking is required. WHERE?Where in Scotland are the latest cases?

"Petrol prices have hit 142.94p a litre, their highest level to date, according to the RAC motoring organisation. Fuel prices were last around this level in April 2012. It is now Â£15 more expensive to fill up an average family car than a year earlier, said the RAC, which called the new high a ""dark day for drivers"". The RAC said the increase was partly due to a doubling of the oil price since last year. Some analysts believe the oil price could rise further. The price of unleaded petrol has jumped by 28p a litre since last October, the RAC said, meaning it now costs Â£78.61 to fill a family car. ""This will hurt many household budgets and no doubt have knock-on implications for the wider economy,"" a spokesman for the RAC said. The organisation said that other costs, aside from oil, had also pushed up fuel prices. Retailers had increased their profit margins by 2p a litre from around 5.5p in April last year to 7.5p a litre. The RAC said retailers, particularly the smaller, independent ones, were trying to rebuild their profits after the steep fall in sales prompted by the first UK lockdown in spring last year. In addition to this, the ethanol component of unleaded petrol was doubled to 10% last month in the more eco-friendly E10 fuel, but as ethanol is more expensive than petrol, that added about 1p a litre. What is E10 and can my car run on it? Duty paid on fuel is currently 57.95p a litre, more than the cost of the combined bio and petrol components, which amount to around 50p. VAT, currently around 24p a litre, is applied on top of all other elements of the petrol price, including duty and the retailer's profit margin. Petrol and diesel cars are slowly being phased out as part of pledges to tackle climate change. The government says it will ban the sale of these from 2030. The introduction of the E10 fuel as standard this summer is also part of that drive. The Department for Transport says bringing in this new fuel could cut carbon emissions by 750,000 tonnes a year, the equivalent of taking 350,000 cars off the road.

"The signed trainers were bought by Nick Fiorella, a well-known collector A pair of trainers worn by the US basketball star Michael Jordan have sold for a record $1.47m (Â£1.1m) at auction. Jordan used the pair of red and white Nike Air Ships during his first season with the Chicago Bulls in 1984. That was the year he and Nike began their collaboration to create his signature brand of clothes and shoes. The price is the highest ever paid for game-worn footwear from any sport. Jordan is seen by many as the best player in the history of basketball. The $6bn surge sparked by an icon from 1985 Rare Jordan trainers fetch $615,000 at auction The shooting guard, who spent most of his career with the Chicago Bulls, became a global icon and helped raise the NBA's profile around the world. Jordan, who retired in 2003, also became the first billionaire player in NBA history. Michael Jordan - seen here in 1998 - is considered the greatest basketball player of all time ""This record-breaking result for the Jordan Nike Air Ships affirms the place of Michael Jordan and the Air Jordan franchise at the pinnacle of the sneaker market,"" said Sotheby's Brahm Wachter after Sunday's auction in Las Vegas. The signed trainers were bought by Nick Fiorella, a well-known collector. Before the auction, they had been estimated to sell for between $1m and $1.5m. They are, however, not the most expensive trainers ever sold. That record belongs to the rapper Kanye West, whose Nike Air Yeezy 1 Prototypes fetched $1.8m via a private sale in April. The record price for trainers has been broken several times in recent years, and the market now attracts interest from general buyers as well as leading collectors.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland's industrial past is a source of pride, but it should also be a ""real cause for reflection"" Nicola Sturgeon has called for ""credible action, not face-saving slogans"" to come from next week's COP26 summit in Glasgow. The talks have been billed as the ""last best chance"" to limit the rise in the earth's temperature to 1.5C. In a speech ahead of the conference, the first minister said concrete action is needed to ""keep 1.5 alive"". The UK government said the first minister would play an ""important role"" at COP26. It has insisted the summit must ""stick with the goal"" of limiting temperature rises to 1.5C. How is Scotland tackling climate change? Ms Sturgeon said the conference can lead the world into a ""green revolution"" and that Scotland can act as a bridge between large and small nations. And she said her government would set out details later this week about how it would ""catch up"" with its own emissions reduction targets, having""fallen short"" of its last three annual milestones. She said: ""Governments at all levels have a responsibility and Scotland is determined to play our full part. ""Our ability to do that depends on our own climate credibility - Scotland cannot urge other countries to set and meet ambitious targets if we fail to do that ourselves."" As final preparations take place at the SEC, the first minister hopes Glasgow will act as a bridge across the climate divide More than 120 world leaders will attend the summit, which takes place at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow from 31 October to 12 November. In her speech to an audience of young people and students in Glasgow, the first minister called for a ""significant uplift in ambition"" from world leaders - particularly those of the ""biggest emitting countries"" - to act to limit global temperature increases and deliver a fair financial package for developing countries. She said: ""We take seriously the responsibility of all governments - at all levels - to show ambition, and to galvanise action. If we do that, we can all contribute towards a successful summit. ""I have said that small countries can lead the way in this, and they can, but in the coming days, it is the countries which emit the most, who most need to step up. They need to make ambitious pledges to achieve net zero. And those pledges must be backed by credible actions."" ""The idea of 'keeping 1.5 alive', cannot simply be a face-saving slogan. It must be real. And there must be progress in Glasgow which makes that outcome more likely."" Ms Sturgeon also encouraged national governments to match the ambition of cities, regions and state governments, and she said her government would ""help those around the negotiating table to hear from activists in the developed world and from the global South"". Thousands of delegates and hundreds of world leaders will descend on Glasgow for the climate summit The Scottish government has set what it describes as world leading targets to cut carbon emissions. It has committed to achieving net zero by 2045 with an interim goal of reducing emissions by 75% by 2030. These targets have been put into law in Scotland, with ministers describing it as the ""toughest, most ambitious legislative framework on climate change in the world"". The snag is the annual progress required to hit these targets has not yet been achieved. The latest emissions figures for 2019 suggested Scotland had reduced the amount of carbon it was releasing into the atmosphere by 51.5% compared to 1990 levels. The target for 2019 was 55%. The Scottish government has more to do to live up to its ambitions on tackling climate change, and is promising a ""catch up"" plan later this week. Last week, COP26 President Alok Sharmatold the BBC's No Hot Air podcastthe aim was to get countries to ""stick with the goals"" of holding the rise in the earth's temperature to 1.5C, as agreed at a COP summit in Paris in 2015. He said: ""World leaders came together and said that they would act to limit global temperature rises to well below 2C, aiming for 1.5C and that's what we want to try and achieve. ""I think Glasgow has to be the moment that the world acts. We've got some commitments but we need to go further."" Mr Sharma added: ""We need to make sure that we can say with credibility that we've kept 1.5C in reach. ""Now is the time for all of us to act, but particularly for the biggest emitters - the G20 nations and the developed countries who promised finance to support developing countries - they also need to step up."" A spokesman for the UK government said: ""The prime minister has been clear [that] the first ministers will play an important role at COP26. ""We are working with the Scottish government, Welsh government and Northern Ireland executive to ensure an inclusive and ambitious summit for the whole of the UK."" The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"The bank on St Mary's will close in April 2022 The only bank on the Isles of Scilly is set to close next year. Lloyds Bank will close its branch on St Mary's on 25 April, 2022. Phil Moon, who runs a restaurant and takeaway on the island, said the closure had come as a ""shock"" and would make running his business ""more complicated"". Lloyds Bank said the decision was due to changes in customer behaviour meaning the branch was used less often. Mr Moon said: ""We obviously lost Barclays a couple of years ago and Lloyds became the only bank on the island so we never saw this coming."" He said his business regularly used the bank for change stock and for taking cash off the premises for security. ""It was a shock, and quite an unpleasant one at that, I'm pretty disappointed to be honest; it's going to affect all of us and businesses especially."" Steve Sims, the Isles of Scilly councillor for economy, tourism and transport, said: ""It's really sad... and it's another blow against the high street"". He added: ""We've got three properties right on the high street really which are now vacant."" Lloyds Bank said staff would be on hand to advise and support customers. A spokesperson added: ""A new community banker will be made available to help customers with their everyday banking and customers can also continue to bank locally by visiting the nearby Post Office, which is a short walk away from the branch."" Mr Moon said using the Post Office would see people ""who just want to do bank transactions"" having to join the queue with those wanting stamps or postal services. ""It's just going to slow things down and make things more complicated,"" he said. Postmaster Lindsay Rodger says she is working to find solutions to help customers affected by the closure Lindsay Rodger, Postmaster of the St Mary's Post Office said they were working on finding solutions to help those affected, and making sure there was a ""smooth transition"" for customers. She said: ""With the bank closing it will mean the loss of the only ATM on the Isles of Scilly and that is a great area of concern for me. ""Without that we will struggle to allow cash to foreign visitors, to people with cash point cards, people with independent banks who do not have the banking facilities through the Post Office. ""And for the vulnerable and the elderly that do not access online."" Ms Rodgers said she was in the process of looking into the possibility of installing an ATM at the Post Office.

"Health Secretary Javid says there is no need for further Covid restrictions ""at this point"" and he believes the UK will have ""a normal Christmas"" But Sage scientist Prof John Edmunds tells the BBC it is hard to be ""precise"" about what the situation will be at Christmas Javid also says the Covid vaccine could become mandatory for NHS staff - but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has warned against this A further 36,567 Covid cases have been reported in the UK NHS medical director Stephen Powis urges people to book their jabs as the NHS sends out two million more booster invites this week The NHS in England is to receive an extra Â£5.9bn in this week's Budget, the government has announced Edited by Hamish Mackay We're pausing our live coronavirus coverage for the day. Thanks for joining us, we'll be back tomorrow morning. Here's a recap of the day's main headlines:  Today's live page was brought to you by Hugo Bachega, Victoria Lindrea and Mary O'Connor. The editor was Hamish Mackay. Smitha MundasadBBC health reporter Rare neurological conditions may occur after Covid vaccination, but the risk is far higher in people who catch Covid, new research suggests. Doctors say the landmark UK study provides further reassurance that being vaccinated offers the best protection for overall health. The investigators examined the NHS records of 32 million adults in England to assess any rare adverse events linked to Covid vaccines. The studyappears in Nature Medicine.,external The scientists, from the Universities of Oxford and Edinburgh, compared the levels of neurological conditions seen within a month of having a first Covid jab, to those seen within a month of a positive coronavirus test. One thing they looked for was a rare condition called Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) known to be associated with certain infectious diseases and linked to some other vaccines. You can read the results of the studyhere. Last year's street party was cancelled due to Covid Edinburgh's Hogmanay street party will return this year after Covid forced the cancellation of the 2020 event. The event, which also will feature the return of the Edinburgh Castle fireworks display, has a reduced capacity of 30,000. The last time the event was held in-person, in 2019, the street party was attended by 75,000 people. Last year's programme of events was heldonline due to the pandemic. Tickets for the event will go on sale on Tuesday. There have been a further 36,567 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today. It means the number of new cases has declined for a fourth consecutive day, after they reached 52,009 on 21 October. However, case numbers for Wales are yet to be added to today's tally. Another 38 deaths of people who tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days have also been recorded. The Russian capital has tightened Covid-19
restrictions amid a surge in cases, requiring the elderly to stay at home,
while at least a third of the workforce is to return to home working. From today, Moscow residents aged 60 and older, as well as those with chronic
conditions, are ordered to stay home in line withmeasures taken by Mayor Sergei Sobyanin,external. Those who can show proof of being vaccinated or of having had Covid-19 in the
past six months are exempt. In addition, employers have been told to move at least 30% of their staff back to
working remotely. These measures will stay in place for at least four months. Even tighter restrictions will come into force in Moscow on 28 October and last
until 7 November, when all non-essential organisations and businesses including
schools will beordered to close,external. Cafes, bars and restaurants
will only be able to serve takeaway food. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online US pharmaceutical company Modern
says it has had good results from trials giving children aged six to 11 its
Covid vaccine. The interim findings, described in a press release and based on
4,753 children, suggest two doses create a strong immune response. Moderna says
the mRNA vaccine was well tolerated and the most common side effects â a sore arm, tiredness, fever or headache â were mild. The vaccine was given
as a smaller dose than the adult equivalent. Other manufacturers have also been
testing paediatric doses. A panel of advisors in the US will vote on Tuesday
whether to authorise the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA Covid vaccine for use in children
aged five to 11. At least 6.1 million booster doses of the vaccine have been delivered in the UK, new NHS figures show. As of 24 October, estimated figures can be broken down by nations as follows:  In Wales, 322,591 booster doses had been delivered as of 21 October - the latest figures available. It means at least one in eight people in the UK who have received a first and second dose of vaccine are likely to have also received a booster jab. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has committed to wearing a mask in the Commons for this Wednesday's Budget ""given it will be packed"", but will not repeat his call for Tory colleagues to do the same. Last week, fellow cabinet member Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested members of Parliament did not need to wear masks, citing the ""convivial, fraternal spirit"" among Tory colleagues. But today, Javid tells the BBC: ""The guidelines are clear, it's for people to make a personal decision on how they see the risk of them and those around them - and this is obviously a workplace setting, so it's going to be a decision for them - but I can speak for myself."" Current government guidance says masks should be worn in ""crowded, enclosed spaces where [people] come into contact with people they do not normally meet"". Asked whether Boris Johnson will wear a mask on Budget day, the prime minister's official spokesman says it is ""a matter for personal judgment"". Sage scientist Prof John Edmunds has just told the BBC that the UK's vaccine booster programme needs to be rapidly accelerated to reduce the ""dangerous"" levels of infection across the country. But who exactly is eligible for a booster? At present, boosters are being offered to:  The dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination. For more information on boosters, read this explainer. We've got more from Prof
Edmunds, who warns that the UK's Covid booster campaign needs to be rapidly accelerated to reduce national infection levels. He
tells the BBC the UK needs to hit âvery highâ coverage of booster doses and calls
for the programme to be widened to everyone once the over-50s and other priority
groups have had third jabs. More
than five million people have received booster jabs since last month, according
to NHS England, but Prof Edmunds says the current pace is âslowerâ than the vaccine
rollout earlier this year and insists it needs to be âimprovedâ. ""I donât see any reason for it to go slow at the moment,"" he says. ""There
is in fact a great deal of reason for that to happen very quickly given the
very high levels of infection we have at the moment. ""Itâs quite a dangerous
situation that weâre in. âItâs
very important that [people] do get a booster because thereâs a lot of
infection around at the moment and I think the faster we can get boosters into
peoplesâ arms, the better."" As Covid cases rise, many medical experts and opposition politicians are calling on the government to reimpose some Covid restrictions in England, including working from home and compulsory face masks. In September that the government said it could bring inextra measures,externalin England - if necessary - to protect the NHS from ""unsustainable pressure"". Those measures - outlined below - are referred to as Plan B.  In effect, the introduction of Plan B would bring England in line with restrictions still in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. So what are the current restrictions across the four UK nations, how do they differ, and what are the various winter plans in the event of a health crisis? Read on to find out more. Earlier, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he expected the UK to havea ânormal Christmasâ this year provided the public âplay their partâand
insisted a move to tighter Plan B restrictions was not necessary ""at this point"". But a scientist advising the government tells the BBC it's âhard to be preciseâ about what the
Covid picture will look like at Christmas as there are âa lot of things in playâ, including
high case numbers among young people. Prof
John Edmunds, an infectious diseases expert who sits on the Scientific Advisory
Group for Emergencies and is part of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on
Modelling, warns thatwhile several scientific models,externalpredicted
cases âmight declineâ by Christmas, infections âcould still be pretty highâ by
then, which could pose a risk to older and vulnerable people during the festive
period, when there is more intergenerational mixing. Prof Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says he expects âa lot of changeâ between now and Christmas as the booster programme continues and teenagers are gradually vaccinated â but that
it is âhard to say with any great certaintyâ that infections in children will have dropped before the festive period. He
also points out that while scientific models say cases are likely to fall
at some point, âtheyâre likely to go back up again next yearâ which is due to âdeclining
immunity and a change in adultsâ contact patternsâ. Scotland's health secretary, Humza Yousaf, has insisted the booster programme is ""on track"" despite calls from opposition parties to speed up the rollout. From today, invitation letters are being sent to the 60-69 age group for a third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Yousaf says the government intends to allow over-50s, unpaid carers and household contacts of immunosuppressed individuals to book booster appointments online from mid-November - but stressed appointments can only take place six months after the second dose, in accordance with medical advice. Booster jabs are already being administered to Scots aged 70 and over, those at the highest risk from infection, care home residents and frontline health and social care workers. ""In addition to delivering the Covid-19 vaccine boosters, this year we are offering a record number of free flu vaccines to help protect the people of Scotland,"" the health secretary says. Despite the demonstration, the game between the Nets and Hornets went ahead as scheduled Anti-vaccine demonstrators gathered outside the Barclays Center on Sunday to show their support for basketball player Kyrie Irving, as his team, the Brooklyn Nets, played their first game of the NBA season. Irving has refused to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and is not allowed to play or train with his team until he does so, because of local vaccine rules. Some protesters broke through barriers outside the arena in New York before being confronted by security. No arrests or injuries were reported. The beginning of the new NBA seasonhas been dominated by debate over the Covid-19 vaccine,with some players saying they will not get jabbed and others refusing to confirm their vaccination status. Irving has recentlyshared microchip claims about the Moderna vaccine on social media,externaland admits to being a ""big conspiracy theorist"". There was no legal requirement for fans at this Manic Street Preachers gig in Cardiff to social distance Wales' top doctor has expressed concernthat some people are behaving as if the pandemic is over by ignoring Welsh laws on face coverings and not social distancing. Wales' case rate is at a record high of 716.9 cases per 100,000 people - the highest of all the UK nations. It has led ministers to look at extending the use ofNHS Covid passesfor a wider range of venues, such as cafes, bars and restaurants. Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton tells BBC Wales: ""A very significant proportion of the Welsh population is still behaving with extreme caution and realises that we are not out of the woods with this yet, but there is a sense other places that it is all over."" He says he worries when he sees people not wearing face coverings or crowding into indoor spaces without observing social distancing. Dr Atherton warns that unless people follow Covid rules, some of the ""more draconian"" measures and laws may have to return. Just joining us? Here are the latest Covid headlines in the UK. Yesterday, a further 39,962 new Covid cases were reported across the UK. That takes the seven-day average for cases - which is a more reliable indicator of infection levels, as there can be delays in daily reporting - to 46,920 cases per day. There were also a further 72 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test result. The seven-day average for deaths is now 124. This video can not be played Starmer: Schools need exclusion zones for anti-vax protestors Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says schools need exclusion zones to stop protesters spreading harmful misinformation on vaccines. Starmer accuses protesters of ""intimidating"" children and parents. He proposes ""fast-track exclusion orders"" to remove the anti-vaxxers and ""make sure we can get on with the [vaccine] programme"". You can read more about how we know vaccines are safe here. The South Korean government's plan will see restrictions being gradually removed by February If you're just joining us, here is how Covid is impacting countries outside of the UK: Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online About 95% of NHS staff in England accepted the offer of a Covid vaccine, says Mr Javid Health Secretary Sajid Javid says he is minded to make Covid
vaccines compulsory for the estimated 1.2 million front line health staff in England, rather than just those working in social care. Vaccination helps protects the individual from serious infection and death, but also reduces their chance of spreading the virus. From 11 November, it will be mandatory for anyone who works
in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home in England to prove they are
fully vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption. But it appears uptake is already high.Latest figures from NHS England,externalreveal more than nine in 10 staff in care homes for older adults have been vaccinated
with at least one dose, and more than eight in 10 have had two
doses. Javid says about 95% of NHS staff in England accepted the
offer of a Covid vaccine when they became available earlier in the year. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,6.1269156e-10

That takes the seven-day average for cases - which is a more reliable indicator of infection levels, as there can be delays in daily reporting - to 46,920 cases per day. There were also a further 72 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test result. The seven-day average for deaths is now 124.

vaccines compulsory for the estimated 1.2 million front line health staff in England, rather than just those working in social care. Vaccination helps protects the individual from serious infection and death, but also reduces their chance of spreading the virus. From 11 November, it will be mandatory for anyone who works
in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home in England to prove they are
fully vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption. But it appears uptake is already high.Latest figures from NHS England,externalreveal more than nine in 10 staff in care homes for older adults have been vaccinated
with at least one dose, and more than eight in 10 have had two

The editor was Hamish Mackay. Smitha MundasadBBC health reporter Rare neurological conditions may occur after Covid vaccination, but the risk is far higher in people who catch Covid, new research suggests. Doctors say the landmark UK study provides further reassurance that being vaccinated offers the best protection for overall health. The investigators examined the NHS records of 32 million adults in England to assess any rare adverse events linked to Covid vaccines. The studyappears in Nature Medicine.,external The scientists, from the Universities of Oxford and Edinburgh, compared the levels of neurological conditions seen within a month of having a first Covid jab, to those seen within a month of a positive coronavirus test. One thing they looked for was a rare condition called Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) known to be associated with certain infectious diseases and linked to some other vaccines. You can read the results of the studyhere. Last year's street party was cancelled due to Covid Edinburgh's Hogmanay street party will return this year after Covid forced the cancellation of the 2020 event. The event, which also will feature the return of the Edinburgh Castle fireworks display, has a reduced capacity of 30,000. The last time the event was held in-person, in 2019, the street party was attended by 75,000 people. Last year's programme of events was heldonline due to the pandemic. Tickets for the event will go on sale on Tuesday. There have been a further 36,567 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK today. It means the number of new cases has declined for a fourth consecutive day, after they reached 52,009 on 21 October. However, case numbers for Wales are yet to be added to today's tally. Another 38 deaths of people who tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days have also been recorded. The Russian capital has tightened Covid-19
restrictions amid a surge in cases, requiring the elderly to stay at home,
while at least a third of the workforce is to return to home working. From today, Moscow residents aged 60 and older, as well as those with chronic
conditions, are ordered to stay home in line withmeasures taken by Mayor Sergei Sobyanin,external. Those who can show proof of being vaccinated or of having had Covid-19 in the
past six months are exempt. In addition, employers have been told to move at least 30% of their staff back to
working remotely. These measures will stay in place for at least four months. Even tighter restrictions will come into force in Moscow on 28 October and last
until 7 November, when all non-essential organisations and businesses including
schools will beordered to close,external. Cafes, bars and restaurants
will only be able to serve takeaway food. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online US pharmaceutical company Modern
says it has had good results from trials giving children aged six to 11 its
Covid vaccine. The interim findings, described in a press release and based on
4,753 children, suggest two doses create a strong immune response. Moderna says
the mRNA vaccine was well tolerated and the most common side effects â a sore arm, tiredness, fever or headache â were mild. The vaccine was given
as a smaller dose than the adult equivalent. Other manufacturers have also been
testing paediatric doses. A panel of advisors in the US will vote on Tuesday
whether to authorise the Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA Covid vaccine for use in children
aged five to 11. At least 6.1 million booster doses of the vaccine have been delivered in the UK, new NHS figures show. As of 24 October, estimated figures can be broken down by nations as follows:  In Wales, 322,591 booster doses had been delivered as of 21 October - the latest figures available. It means at least one in eight people in the UK who have received a first and second dose of vaccine are likely to have also received a booster jab. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has committed to wearing a mask in the Commons for this Wednesday's Budget ""given it will be packed"", but will not repeat his call for Tory colleagues to do the same. Last week, fellow cabinet member Jacob Rees-Mogg suggested members of Parliament did not need to wear masks, citing the ""convivial, fraternal spirit"" among Tory colleagues. But today, Javid tells the BBC: ""The guidelines are clear, it's for people to make a personal decision on how they see the risk of them and those around them - and this is obviously a workplace setting, so it's going to be a decision for them - but I can speak for myself."" Current government guidance says masks should be worn in ""crowded, enclosed spaces where [people] come into contact with people they do not normally meet"". Asked whether Boris Johnson will wear a mask on Budget day, the prime minister's official spokesman says it is ""a matter for personal judgment"". Sage scientist Prof John Edmunds has just told the BBC that the UK's vaccine booster programme needs to be rapidly accelerated to reduce the ""dangerous"" levels of infection across the country. But who exactly is eligible for a booster? At present, boosters are being offered to:  The dose must be given at least six months after a second vaccination. For more information on boosters, read this explainer. We've got more from Prof
Edmunds, who warns that the UK's Covid booster campaign needs to be rapidly accelerated to reduce national infection levels. He
tells the BBC the UK needs to hit âvery highâ coverage of booster doses and calls
for the programme to be widened to everyone once the over-50s and other priority
groups have had third jabs. More
than five million people have received booster jabs since last month, according
to NHS England, but Prof Edmunds says the current pace is âslowerâ than the vaccine
rollout earlier this year and insists it needs to be âimprovedâ. ""I donât see any reason for it to go slow at the moment,"" he says. ""There
is in fact a great deal of reason for that to happen very quickly given the
very high levels of infection we have at the moment. ""Itâs quite a dangerous
situation that weâre in. âItâs
very important that [people] do get a booster because thereâs a lot of
infection around at the moment and I think the faster we can get boosters into
peoplesâ arms, the better."" As Covid cases rise, many medical experts and opposition politicians are calling on the government to reimpose some Covid restrictions in England, including working from home and compulsory face masks. In September that the government said it could bring inextra measures,externalin England - if necessary - to protect the NHS from ""unsustainable pressure"". Those measures - outlined below - are referred to as Plan B.  In effect, the introduction of Plan B would bring England in line with restrictions still in place in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. So what are the current restrictions across the four UK nations, how do they differ, and what are the various winter plans in the event of a health crisis? Read on to find out more. Earlier, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said he expected the UK to havea ânormal Christmasâ this year provided the public âplay their partâand
insisted a move to tighter Plan B restrictions was not necessary ""at this point"". But a scientist advising the government tells the BBC it's âhard to be preciseâ about what the
Covid picture will look like at Christmas as there are âa lot of things in playâ, including
high case numbers among young people. Prof
John Edmunds, an infectious diseases expert who sits on the Scientific Advisory
Group for Emergencies and is part of the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on
Modelling, warns thatwhile several scientific models,externalpredicted
cases âmight declineâ by Christmas, infections âcould still be pretty highâ by
then, which could pose a risk to older and vulnerable people during the festive
period, when there is more intergenerational mixing. Prof Edmunds, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says he expects âa lot of changeâ between now and Christmas as the booster programme continues and teenagers are gradually vaccinated â but that
it is âhard to say with any great certaintyâ that infections in children will have dropped before the festive period. He
also points out that while scientific models say cases are likely to fall
at some point, âtheyâre likely to go back up again next yearâ which is due to âdeclining
immunity and a change in adultsâ contact patternsâ. Scotland's health secretary, Humza Yousaf, has insisted the booster programme is ""on track"" despite calls from opposition parties to speed up the rollout. From today, invitation letters are being sent to the 60-69 age group for a third dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Yousaf says the government intends to allow over-50s, unpaid carers and household contacts of immunosuppressed individuals to book booster appointments online from mid-November - but stressed appointments can only take place six months after the second dose, in accordance with medical advice. Booster jabs are already being administered to Scots aged 70 and over, those at the highest risk from infection, care home residents and frontline health and social care workers. ""In addition to delivering the Covid-19 vaccine boosters, this year we are offering a record number of free flu vaccines to help protect the people of Scotland,"" the health secretary says. Despite the demonstration, the game between the Nets and Hornets went ahead as scheduled Anti-vaccine demonstrators gathered outside the Barclays Center on Sunday to show their support for basketball player Kyrie Irving, as his team, the Brooklyn Nets, played their first game of the NBA season. Irving has refused to get vaccinated against Covid-19 and is not allowed to play or train with his team until he does so, because of local vaccine rules. Some protesters broke through barriers outside the arena in New York before being confronted by security. No arrests or injuries were reported. The beginning of the new NBA seasonhas been dominated by debate over the Covid-19 vaccine,with some players saying they will not get jabbed and others refusing to confirm their vaccination status. Irving has recentlyshared microchip claims about the Moderna vaccine on social media,externaland admits to being a ""big conspiracy theorist"". There was no legal requirement for fans at this Manic Street Preachers gig in Cardiff to social distance Wales' top doctor has expressed concernthat some people are behaving as if the pandemic is over by ignoring Welsh laws on face coverings and not social distancing. Wales' case rate is at a record high of 716.9 cases per 100,000 people - the highest of all the UK nations. It has led ministers to look at extending the use ofNHS Covid passesfor a wider range of venues, such as cafes, bars and restaurants. Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton tells BBC Wales: ""A very significant proportion of the Welsh population is still behaving with extreme caution and realises that we are not out of the woods with this yet, but there is a sense other places that it is all over."" He says he worries when he sees people not wearing face coverings or crowding into indoor spaces without observing social distancing. Dr Atherton warns that unless people follow Covid rules, some of the ""more draconian"" measures and laws may have to return. Just joining us? Here are the latest Covid headlines in the UK.

""You will be missed, buddy,"" he went on. Tyler appeared in almost 150 episodes of the comedy, which ran from 1994 to 2004. Gunther was and remains a hugely popular character among fans. Tyler's manager said the actor ""passed away peacefully at his home in Los Angeles on Sunday morning"". A statement added: ""The world knew him as Gunther (the seventh Friend)... but Michael's loved ones knew him as an actor, musician, cancer-awareness advocate, and loving husband. If you met him once you made a friend for life. ""Wanting to help as many people as possible, he bravely shared his story and became a campaigner for those with a prostate to get a... blood test as early as 40-years-old."" David Crane, who co-created Friends, told the BBC that Tyler started as an extra on the show and was given the role because he could work the coffee machine. ""As time went on, I think we realised he's funny - a really good actor,"" Crane said. ""We just kept giving him more and more, and when we realised there was a storyline about his secret love for Rachel, it was just the gift that kept on giving."" On Tyler's comedic timing, Crane added: ""His delivery was impeccable, he was so good that we found ourselves going to him for the punchline for a whole scene or for a whole episode. ""With just the littlest opportunity he created this indelible character."" Tyler revisited the Central Perk in 2015 as part of a Warner Bros studio tour In May, Tyler made a brief appearance on the Friends reunion special via Zoom. ""It was the most memorable 10 years of my life, honestly,"" the actor said at the time. ""I could not have imagined just a better experience.

It has led ministers to look at extending the use ofNHS Covid passesfor a wider range of venues, such as cafes, bars and restaurants. Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton tells BBC Wales: ""A very significant proportion of the Welsh population is still behaving with extreme caution and realises that we are not out of the woods with this yet, but there is a sense other places that it is all over."" He says he worries when he sees people not wearing face coverings or crowding into indoor spaces without observing social distancing. Dr Atherton warns that unless people follow Covid rules, some of the ""more draconian"" measures and laws may have to return. Just joining us? Here are the latest Covid headlines in the UK. Yesterday, a further 39,962 new Covid cases were reported across the UK. That takes the seven-day average for cases - which is a more reliable indicator of infection levels, as there can be delays in daily reporting - to 46,920 cases per day. There were also a further 72 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test result. The seven-day average for deaths is now 124.

Starmer accuses protesters of ""intimidating"" children and parents. He proposes ""fast-track exclusion orders"" to remove the anti-vaxxers and ""make sure we can get on with the [vaccine] programme"". You can read more about how we know vaccines are safe here. The South Korean government's plan will see restrictions being gradually removed by February If you're just joining us, here is how Covid is impacting countries outside of the UK: Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online About 95% of NHS staff in England accepted the offer of a Covid vaccine, says Mr Javid Health Secretary Sajid Javid says he is minded to make Covid
vaccines compulsory for the estimated 1.2 million front line health staff in England, rather than just those working in social care. Vaccination helps protects the individual from serious infection and death, but also reduces their chance of spreading the virus. From 11 November, it will be mandatory for anyone who works
in a Care Quality Commission-registered care home in England to prove they are
fully vaccinated, unless they have a medical exemption. But it appears uptake is already high.Latest figures from NHS England,externalreveal more than nine in 10 staff in care homes for older adults have been vaccinated
with at least one dose, and more than eight in 10 have had two
doses. Javid says about 95% of NHS staff in England accepted the
offer of a Covid vaccine when they became available earlier in the year. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.12126381
"Many councils are not paying homecare companies a high enough hourly rate to cover basic costs like travel time between clients, says a report. It means, despite losing staff faster than they can be replaced, companies are unable to raise wages, says the Homecare Association. Low wages and feeling undervalued are key factors leading care staff to quit, says the report. Councils say they do not have enough money to pay companies more. The Homecare Association, which represents some 2,340 care providers, calculates the true minimum cost of providing an hour of homecare in the UK is Â£21.43. This covers the minimum wage, travel time, pensions, holidays, training, PPE, office staff and 60p for profit or reinvestment in services. Private clients who hire care direct from providers pay an average Â£24.94 for an hour of homecare, according to separate analysis by software company The Access Group. But private clients are a minority, with the bulk of homecare (about 70%) funded by the state, says the Homecare Association. Freedom of Information data collected for the Association shows the average paid by councils in Great Britain and health boards in Northern Ireland is Â£18.45. The report found that areas with some of the highest levels of deprivation also had the lowest average fee rates for homecare. Sorry, this content does not appear to be working The Homecare Association says with some local authorities still buying homecare by the minute, and little or no funding for better pay, it makes it very difficult to compete with other sectors for staff. Richard Walker, chief executive of Optimo Care Group in South Yorkshire, has tried to improve pay and conditions for staff, but says his efforts are limited by local authority funding levels. ""We're simply not competing... so I think people go elsewhere... ""It feels like we're in a harder position now than we've ever been before."" Richard estimates that, overall, Optimo's costs outstrip council funding by about 25%, although this varies according to local authority. ""We're miles away at the moment in terms of the rates that have been paid."" The staff shortage means the company is having to turn away referrals - and he finds not being able to give people the help they require when they need it ""really tough... quite demotivating"". Pay is not ""level with the job you do out there"", says Denise Wickson Among his staff is Denise Wickson, a home carer for 16 years. For Denise, the work brings ""great reward, great satisfaction"". ""I love the job,"" she says. But sometimes she can be up at 05:00 and not finish until 23:00. ""You never get to switch off, you're always worried, 'Is it covered?'. You get called and they say you're needed to go out. I never say no."" Denise says the money is not ""level with the job you do out there"", and some people ""just go elsewhere where it's more money and it's not unsociable hours"". The Homecare Association says lack of support in the community can lead to: hospitals unable to discharge patients who are medically ready emergency admissions of people whose conditions deteriorate through lack of appropriate care ""It makes little sense to neglect people at home in the community, wait until they reach crisis point, then admit them to the most expensive setting of care in an acute hospital,"" says the report.

The government says a new Â£162.5m fund will help ""bolster"" the homecare workforce, while the social care levy, announced last month, includes Â£5.4bn earmarked for social care over the next three years, with Â£500m to be spent on the workforce. But the LGA questions whether the levy will raise enough money to fund crucial reforms, and wants to see a greater share of it go to front-line social care.

"The bank on St Mary's will close in April 2022 The only bank on the Isles of Scilly is set to close next year. Lloyds Bank will close its branch on St Mary's on 25 April, 2022. Phil Moon, who runs a restaurant and takeaway on the island, said the closure had come as a ""shock"" and would make running his business ""more complicated"". Lloyds Bank said the decision was due to changes in customer behaviour meaning the branch was used less often. Mr Moon said: ""We obviously lost Barclays a couple of years ago and Lloyds became the only bank on the island so we never saw this coming."" He said his business regularly used the bank for change stock and for taking cash off the premises for security. ""It was a shock, and quite an unpleasant one at that, I'm pretty disappointed to be honest; it's going to affect all of us and businesses especially."" Steve Sims, the Isles of Scilly councillor for economy, tourism and transport, said: ""It's really sad... and it's another blow against the high street"". He added: ""We've got three properties right on the high street really which are now vacant."" Lloyds Bank said staff would be on hand to advise and support customers. A spokesperson added: ""A new community banker will be made available to help customers with their everyday banking and customers can also continue to bank locally by visiting the nearby Post Office, which is a short walk away from the branch."" Mr Moon said using the Post Office would see people ""who just want to do bank transactions"" having to join the queue with those wanting stamps or postal services. ""It's just going to slow things down and make things more complicated,"" he said. Postmaster Lindsay Rodger says she is working to find solutions to help customers affected by the closure Lindsay Rodger, Postmaster of the St Mary's Post Office said they were working on finding solutions to help those affected, and making sure there was a ""smooth transition"" for customers. She said: ""With the bank closing it will mean the loss of the only ATM on the Isles of Scilly and that is a great area of concern for me. ""Without that we will struggle to allow cash to foreign visitors, to people with cash point cards, people with independent banks who do not have the banking facilities through the Post Office. ""And for the vulnerable and the elderly that do not access online."" Ms Rodgers said she was in the process of looking into the possibility of installing an ATM at the Post Office.

"This video can not be played Tata says guidance is needed to safeguard thousands of jobs Tata Steel says it needs a route map from the UK government before it decides how it will make steel in the future. There are fears the steel industry, as the biggest single emitter of CO2 in the UK, might not fit into a new greener economy and thousands of jobs could be lost. That would damage communities in Port Talbot, Newport, Llanelli and Shotton. The UK government said it was supporting the steel industry. Tata Steel employs 6,600 people in Wales Tata Steel has already reduced its emissions and said it wants to go much further but has not yet worked out how. It said the industry alone could not solve the emissions problem and there had to be a partnership with government. Welsh industry's 23 million tonne carbon problem How are we doing with cutting emissions? What is Wales' role at the COP26 climate summit? A range of options are available to steelmakers, including using hydrogen, electric furnaces or carbon capture. Tata Steel employs 6,600 people in Wales on wages that are, on average, 36% higher than the UK average. There has been concern about jobs and questions about the firm's future because of its impact on the environment. Tata Steel's sustainability spokesman Martin Brunnock said: ""There's no point us saying we won't make steel in the UK because that doesn't solve your carbon problem. ""All we do then is import carbon through our borders in finished goods or coils of steel to be used in the UK."" Tata Steel, in Port Talbot, is one of the UK's biggest emitters of climate-warming gases At the Port Talbot steelworks, carbon dioxide emissions have already been reduced by recycling scrap steel back into the liquid steel. Tata said 20% of its scrap steel now goes back into the system and every 1% extra of scrap recycled reduces the plant's carbon emissions by 150,000 tonnes a year. But it needs to do more than that to reach its target. ""We can't do this alone. How do you get an energy infrastructure, hydrogen infrastructure, how do you create that carbon capture technology, how does that all work?"" Mr Brunnock said. He added ""revolutionary"" policies were needed and ""a route map would be really helpful"". There are concerns that changes to the way steel is made - to make it greener - could result in thousands of job losses . The demise of steel would lead to deprivation in Welsh communities, says Jaqueline Thomas Tata Steel employee Jaqueline Thomas said there had been a ""lack of empathy"" over the impact of changes to the economy on areas such as hers. ""I myself travel down from Tredegar in Blaenau Gwent and we lost Ebbw Vale steelworks in 2002 and we've seen how the economy has changed, how it's hit the area I live in,"" she said. ""Not just me but Redcar is the same and how the community has become deprived, lack of jobs - and what can we do? ""There's obviously a lack of empathy as well with the younger generation because they get very much disorientated about where their future lies and we've got to make sure that the steel industry survives for the young apprentices that also travel down here on a daily basis. ""I'd hate to see the steel industry shrink to a point where the community involvement is no longer there. There has always been a massive camaraderie amongst the communities... steel has always been at the heart of this community."" Tata Steel says it wants to make more changes, but is not sure how It is not about a future lack of demand. Tata Steel believes that the amount of steel used in the UK will increase by 10% by 2030 and many renewable energy projects and low carbon transport systems will rely on it. Already more than two-thirds of the steel it makes stays in the UK. Steel made at the Port Talbot plant goes into car production, food packaging, construction and even used to make walls that can generate electricity. Many of its customers want steel that is made in such a way that it has less impact on the environment. It is expected that will increase as companies will have to publish the impact of their supply chain on emission levels. The industry is already struggling with energy prices rising steeply and competition from overseas. The UK government's Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy said: ""We are already working closely with Britain's steel sector to support its transition to a low carbon future. ""We have previously announced a Â£250m clean steel fund to support the industry to reduce carbon emissions, and our industrial decarbonisation strategy sets out how it can be done in a way that prevents industrial activity from being outsourced overseas and supports competitiveness, jobs and clean growth.""

"Almost Â£2bn will be invested by the government into building new homes on derelict or unused land in England, the chancellor is expected to announce in Wednesday's Budget. The government said 160,000 greener homes could be built on brownfield land the size of 2,000 football pitches. It also pledged to invest Â£9m towards 100 urban ""pocket parks"" across the UK. However, concerns have been raised that not enough affordable homes are being built. Nigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal and General, told the BBC's Today programme the Â£1.8bn investment was the ""right direction of travel"", but was ""not enough scale right now"". He warned people living in smaller cities and towns were being ""left behind"" due to not enough homes being constructed. ""You shouldn't have to be rich to be green,"" he said. ""It's very difficult for poorer people to get on the green (housing) ladder. ""There's a lot of active listening going on (by the government), but we don't just want CGI housing - we want real housing built across the UK."" The government said the funding was part of its efforts to meet the UK's net zero target by 2050. It hopes the plans will help regenerate parts of England and support 50,000 new jobs. Six things that could affect you in the Budget Budget about investing in public services - Sunak The proposals also include creating so-called ""pocket parks"" - measuring the size of a tennis court - to create more green spaces. More than 2.5 million people across the UK currently live further than a 10 minute walk from their closest green space. Tim Farron, Liberal Democrat spokesperson for housing, said people buying new homes would be ""forced to fork out thousands to upgrade their homes in the future to cut their bills and reduce emissions"". ""In his Budget, the chancellor should bring forward new standards for greener homes to ensure all new homes are cheap to heat and produce minimal emissions,"" he said. Zoe Nicholson, Green Party leader of Lewes District Council, said building on brownfield sites made sense, but added the government's investment was an ""absurdly small amount of money"". ""It would be more effective if they handed this Â£2bn of funding to local authorities, which would allow them to build net zero council homes,"" she said,. ""This announcement seems to be little more than a gimmick intended to distract us from the fact that their agenda is to simply 'build, build, build' on our countryside to the benefit of greedy developers."" The Labour Party has not responded to requests for comment. As well as funding for new housing developments, the chancellor is expected to confirm Â£65m to develop new software to help with the digitisation of the town planning system. The first phase will see the system rolled out to up to 175 local authorities in England.

"This video can not be played Javid says Â£5.9bn for the NHS is ""new money"" to tackle waiting lists The NHS in England is to receive an extra Â£5.9bn in this week's Budget, the government has announced. The money will be used to help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans, which has been worsened by the pandemic, and also to buy equipment and improve IT. Chancellor Rishi Sunak called the announcement ""game-changing"". Health bodies welcomed the latest pledge but said it would not solve the problem of staff shortages. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said the funding was ""new money"" and that Mr Sunak would set out exactly where it was coming from during Wednesday's Budget and Spending Review. A simple guide to Budget 2021 Six things that could affect you in the Budget Budget 2021: Five things to look out for More than five million people are waiting for NHS hospital treatment in England, with hundreds of thousands waiting more than a year. The Â£5.9bn is on top of the Â£12bn a yearthat was announced in September.,external. That money will be raised through tax increases - the rise in National Insurance and, from 2022, the Health and Social Care Levy - and will be spent on resources such as staffing. The Â£5.9bn will be used to pay for physical infrastructure and equipment - not day-to-day spending. Some of the Â£5.9bn - Â£2.3bn - will be used to fund more diagnostic tests, like CT, MRI and ultrasound scans, the government said. More clinics in shopping centres for scans and tests -which the government had already announced- will be opened. These will help clear the backlog of tests by the end of this Parliament, the government said. Also included in the Â£5.9bn total is: Â£1.5bn on beds, equipment and new ""surgical hubs"" Â£2.1bn on improving IT and digital technology within the NHS A proportionate amount will also go to the health services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Access to tests and scans is a real bottleneck in the system at the moment, slowing down the ability of the NHS to work its way through the backlog in routine care and, sometimes, delaying the diagnosis of cancer. It has been known for years the NHS does not have enough equipment to carry out tests and scans. And the machines it has are ageing. The problems mean as demand has increased, performance has deteriorated. The aim is to get these tests done within six weeks of referral, unless it is an urgent cancer case. But currently around a quarter of patients wait longer than that. Before the pandemic fewer than 5% did. The funding will help, in time, improve the situation. But the big issue that it does not tackle is staffing - there is a shortage of specialists to carry out these tests. Around one in 10 posts are currently vacant. There are various reasons for this, including more part-time working, the numbers retiring and problems recruiting internationally because of the pandemic. Buying new machines is much easier than training, recruiting and retaining staff. Until that is resolved, many are sceptical about what this announcement will actually achieve. Waiting lists have grown as routine operations were cancelled throughout the pandemic and people who put off seeking help for symptoms come forward. Some of those in the healthcare sector warned it was not enough to keep up with costs and demand. Christopher Rigby, an NHS radiographer from Yorkshire, said: ""We haven't got the workforce to staff the hospitals we have now let alone all these new centres."" NHS Providers - which speaks for hospital and other NHS trusts - warned the health service needed more staff to deliver services. A body representing healthcare leaders, the NHS Confederation, said the funding ""falls short of what is needed to get services completely back on track"". The NHS is sending out a further two million invites for Covid booster jabs this week. The health secretary said ""we should actively be looking at"" making jabs mandatory for NHS staff, as they are for care workers. Mr Javid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would wear a face covering during Wednesday's Budget announcement in the Commons. But he said now was not time to activate England's ""Plan B"", that would make face masks mandatory in many places. Are you an NHS professional or patient affected by the NHS backlog?

"The signed trainers were bought by Nick Fiorella, a well-known collector A pair of trainers worn by the US basketball star Michael Jordan have sold for a record $1.47m (Â£1.1m) at auction. Jordan used the pair of red and white Nike Air Ships during his first season with the Chicago Bulls in 1984. That was the year he and Nike began their collaboration to create his signature brand of clothes and shoes. The price is the highest ever paid for game-worn footwear from any sport. Jordan is seen by many as the best player in the history of basketball. The $6bn surge sparked by an icon from 1985 Rare Jordan trainers fetch $615,000 at auction The shooting guard, who spent most of his career with the Chicago Bulls, became a global icon and helped raise the NBA's profile around the world. Jordan, who retired in 2003, also became the first billionaire player in NBA history. Michael Jordan - seen here in 1998 - is considered the greatest basketball player of all time ""This record-breaking result for the Jordan Nike Air Ships affirms the place of Michael Jordan and the Air Jordan franchise at the pinnacle of the sneaker market,"" said Sotheby's Brahm Wachter after Sunday's auction in Las Vegas. The signed trainers were bought by Nick Fiorella, a well-known collector. Before the auction, they had been estimated to sell for between $1m and $1.5m. They are, however, not the most expensive trainers ever sold. That record belongs to the rapper Kanye West, whose Nike Air Yeezy 1 Prototypes fetched $1.8m via a private sale in April. The record price for trainers has been broken several times in recent years, and the market now attracts interest from general buyers as well as leading collectors.

"Tesco's website and app are now up and running again, following a service outage that began on Saturday. The retail giant's services had crashed after what Tesco said were attempts ""to interfere with our systems"". The possible hack at Britain's biggest supermarket began with shoppers unable to order goods and track deliveries. Tesco initially said there was ""an issue"", but in a Sunday update said there had been deliberate disruption. The supermarket later confirmed onTwitter,externalthat its groceries website and app were back up and running, but it was temporarily using a ""virtual waiting room"" to manage the high volume of traffic. Why does the internet keep breaking? Tesco said the attempts to compromise its systems were made overnight from Friday to Saturday, but was not more specific. According to Downdetector,external, which monitors website outages, shoppers began reporting issues early on Saturday morning. The scale of the problem, and whether the issue was nationwide or only in certain areas, remained unclear on Sunday night. Shoppers complained over the weekend about a lack of information, with many wanting to know how to cancel orders and whether they can get money back. Earlier on Sunday, a Tesco spokesperson said: ""There is no reason to believe that this issue impacts customer data and we continue to take ongoing action to make sure all data stays safe. ""Since yesterday, we've been experiencing disruption to our online grocery website and app. ""An attempt was made to interfere with our systems which has caused problems with the search function on the site. We're working hard to fully restore all services and apologise for the inconvenience."" Meanwhile, shoppers were trying to change or cancel deliveries, or switch to other supermarkets. Tesco customer Chris Hodgson, who lives in Stoke-on-Trent, told the BBC the app had not been working properly for ""a couple of days"". He picked up his click-and-collect order on Sunday, but had only managed to do half his weekly shopping before the website went down. ""The collection member of staff hadn't been informed of any issues,"" Mr Hodgson said. ""After I showed him the website, he said it was an unusually quiet day. ""I asked if I could reject the whole order and was informed I could only reject substituted items. I'll have to go out again this afternoon. If you're on a budget it's annoying, it's an inconvenience. ""Nothing from Tesco, no way of contacting them. Really poor by Tesco,"" he said. Tesco has opened a check-out free store where customers use the app to choose groceries and leave with them Another customer, Rebecca, from North Wales, got a delivery of 120 Pepsi drinks on Sunday instead of her order. ""We were meant to get a week's shop this morning,"" she told the BBC. ""The website was down all yesterday so we couldn't amend or cancel. All we received was 120 cans of Pepsi Max."" Rebecca, who asked for her surname not to be used, added: ""I'd been going in to the order over and over yesterday, right up until the 11.45 deadline. I didn't try calling, there must be thousands in the same boat. ""Fortunately someone suggested that Asda had delivery slots for today so I managed to place an order last night (just before their deadline) for enough food for the next few days."" Tesco initially said on Saturday it was ""working hard to get things back up and running"", and apologised for the inconvenience. The firm's online sales have soared recently, especially during lockdown, with the supermarket ramping up capacity. Its latest financial results say the scale and reach of its online operations are ""unmatched in the UK"", with total sales topping Â£6bn. Tesco said it had 6.6 million app users. Tesco has faced previous hacks. In 2014 about 2,000 customer accounts were deactivated amid fears login details were compromised, and there was also a cyber attack on the supermarket's bank arm. But the problem is becoming more common globally. Earlier this year, international meat manufacturer JBS had to shut down about 25% of its operation. And large swathes of US fuel supply were closed after a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline. Few sectors have escaped the attention of cyber-criminals, with airlines, banks, universities, local authorities, utilities and tech giants such as Microsoft all having faced attacks on their computer systems.
