"This video can not be played Police arrive after explosion in Brussels central train station Belgian soldiers have shot a man suspected of being a would-be suicide bomber at Brussels Central Station, officials say. He was shot after reportedly setting off a small explosion and no-one else is believed to have been injured. Prosecutors later said the man had died. They are treating the incident as a terrorist attack. In March 2016, 32 people were killed in attacks on Brussels claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group. According to Belgian newspaper La Libre Belgique, quoting prosecutors, the man who was shot was wearing a rucksack and a bomb belt. A photograph taken inside the station showed flames He detonated a device when he attracted the attention of soldiers in the station, the paper says.

This video can not be played Nicolas Van Herrewegen saw a man with a suicide belt shout ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is great"" in Arabic) ""Then he cried 'Allahu Akbar' and he blew up a wheeled suitcase,"" he told AFP news agency. ""I was behind a wall when it exploded. I went down and alerted my colleagues to evacuate everyone. He [the suspect] was still around but after that we didn't see him."" ""It wasn't exactly a big explosion but the impact was pretty big,"" he added. ""People were running away."" Armed Belgian police have sealed off the scene Mr Van Herrewegen described the suspect as well-built and tanned with short hair, wearing a white shirt and jeans. ""I saw that he had something on him because I could see wires emerging, so it may have been a suicide vest,"" he said. Lawyer Remy Bonnaffe, 23, was waiting for a train and took a photograph of flames seconds after the explosion. He told Reuters news agency that people close to the explosion appeared unhurt and he saw no obvious damage to nearby walls. ""I'm happy that no-one was injured and that this was basically a failed attempt,"" he said. Arash Aazami arrived at the station just after the explosion. He told the BBC: ""As we entered into the station, we were evacuated loudly by some security personnel. ""Looked around, saw people running in the streets, trying to seek refuge and decided to do the same ourselves."" Police and soldiers guided people to safety outside the station As the station and Grand Place were evacuated, businesses and restaurants were ordered to close and draw down their shutters, RTL radio reports. Metro lines running through the station were also briefly suspended on orders of the police, according to the radio.

"Police are examining the van used in the attack A man has been arrested on suspicion of posting an offensive Facebook post about the London Finsbury Park attack. Police said a 37-year-old, believed to be the son of an owner of the Rhondda Cynon Taff company whose van wasused in Monday's attack, is in custody. Richard Evans allegedly posted: ""It's a shame they don't hire out steam rollers or tanks could have done a tidy job then."" His father, Lee Evans, said he condemned the remarks. South Wales Police said a 37-year-old man was being held on suspicion of displaying threatening, abusive, insulting written material with intent that is likely to stir up racial hatred. Community's shock at man's arrest Finsbury Park attack: Community holds vigil What we know so far Welsh hire van in mosque terror attack In pictures: Finsbury Park attack Comments made by an account under the name of Richard Gear Evans Facebook, which were then shared by others on Twitter, read: ""Glad I'm not running the van hire the police wouldn't like what my answer would be. ""It's my dad's company I don't get involved it's a shame they don't hire out steam rollers or tanks could have done a tidy job then."" The comments and account profile appear to have since been deleted. Lee Evans said: ""I want to condemn in the strongest possible terms these ill-considered Twitter comments, which in no way reflect my own view or indeed those of anyone else in the family. ""The attack in Finsbury Park was shocking and cowardly. Together with all the staff at Pontyclun Van Hire, I am doing everything I can to assist the Metropolitan Police in their inquiries."" Neighbours said Mr Osborne was friendly and polite Darren Osborne, 47, from Cardiff, is being held on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of terrorism, attempted murder and murder following the incident at Finsbury Park. On Tuesday evening, the Met's counter terrorism unit was given an extension until the early hours of Saturday to question Mr Osborne. The attack in Finsbury Park happened as an ill man was receiving first aid from the public near the mosque, where people had been saying Ramadan night prayers. The van was apparently driven at people who were helping him. Police said they were still trying to establish if there was a link between the man's death and the attack. Mr Osborne's family said they were ""massively shocked"" following his arrest The man died and nine people were taken to three London hospitals, while two others were treated for minor injuries. Witnesses said they heard the driver, who was detained by members of the public before police arrived, shout: ""I am going to kill Muslims."" One of Mr Osborne's neighbours said they thought they had seen him sleeping in a van on Saturday night. South Wales Police confirmed that 24 hours before the London attack it had responded to a 101 call following reports of an ""insecure van"" in the Llanedeyrn area of Cardiff. Officers found a man asleep inside, but no offence had been committed.

"The body of a Colorado pastor in search of a hidden treasure worth $2m (1.5m) has been found in New Mexico's Rio Grande River, according to police. Paris Wallace, 52, was reported missing a week ago after he travelled to the Rocky Mountains near Santa Fe seeking a bronze chest of gold and jewels. Forrest Fenn, a millionaire antiques dealer, hid the chest in 2010 and wrote a poem he claimed led to the treasure. Mr Wallace is the second Colorado man to die in search of the chest. The Office of the Medical Investigator has not confirmed Mr Wallace's identity, New Mexico State Police Lt Elizabeth Armijo told the BBC. But she told theDaily Sentinel,external""we believe, and all evidence thus far indicates, the deceased is Paris Wallace"". Mr Wallace, a pastor at the Connection Church in Grand Junction, Colorado, is one of thousands of people who has searched the rugged New Mexico terrain for Mr Fenn's gold. Mr Fenn has said the goal of concealing his 22-lb chest was to get people off the couch and out into nature. But last yearRandy Bilyeu, 54, diedafter he attempted to find the hidden fortune with his dog, Leo, and a raft. Mr Bilyeu's ex-wife reported him missing in January 2016, about 10 days after he embarked on the treasure hunt. The man's dog, which was alive, and raft were recovered the following day, but his body was not found until six months later. Mr Bilyeu's ex-wife, Linda, criticised Mr Fenn for costing her ex-husband his life over ""a hoax"". Thousands of people have travelled to the Rocky Mountains in search of Mr Fenn's hidden fortune On Sunday, Mr Wallace's body was found seven miles downstream from an area where police believe he was before he disappeared. His backpack was also discovered nearby. Police used GPS technology through Mr Wallace's mobile phone to track his Chevrolet Tahoe near a bridge about 50 miles north of Santa Fe. Inside the vehicle, authorities found a receipt for rope and other equipment. Search and rescue workers also found rope tied around a rock on a riverbank near the Rio Pueblo de Taos, a Rio Grande tributary, according to the Daily Sentinel newspaper. The death comes after Mr Fenn last week issued a warning to treasure seekers in a blog post. ""Please don't over extend yourself,""he said,external. ""I was 80 or about when I hid the treasure and it was not a difficult task. I will soon be 87 and I could go back and get it if I were so inclined, I think."" Mr Wallace's death has renewed calls for Mr Fenn to end the seven-year hunt. ""Only one man has the power to stop the madness. Yet, he continues to pretend he's doing a good deed by getting people off the couch and into nature"",Ms Bilyeu told the AP,external. New Mexico State Police Chief Pete Kassetas also urged Mr Fenn to ""stop this nonsense"". Mr Fenn, who called Mr Wallace's death a ""terrible loss"",told the Santa Fe New Mexican,external: ""My mind is open to finding a solution, but no decision has been made"". The 24-line poem that has sparked thousands to travel to the region in search of Mr Fenn's fortune was published in his memoir, The Thrill of the Chase. He has offered additional clues in other writings.

"This video can not be played Who are the DUP and what do they stand for? Democratic Unionist Party sources have urged the Conservatives to give a ""greater focus"" to their negotiations. A senior DUP source said the party could not be ""taken for granted"" - adding that if the PM  could not reach a deal, ""what does that mean for bigger negotiations she is involved in?"" No deal has been reached after 10 days of talks between the parties. But sources told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg they believed a deal would still be done. BBC Editors: What to expect in the Queen's Speech A simple guide to what's happening The Conservatives are hoping the DUP will sustain their minority government. The warning from a senior DUP source to BBC Northern Ireland political editor Mark Devenport comes the day before the government's Queen's Speech is presented to Parliament. Although they have not reached a final deal, DUP leader Arlene Foster has said it is ""right and proper"" that her MPs support the Conservative government's first Queen's Speech. A Conservative source said it was important the party ""gets on with its business"" as talks continue by putting forward Wednesday's Queen's Speech. Earlier cabinet minister Chris Grayling predicted a ""sensible"" deal would be reached. The transport secretary said the talks were ""going well"", adding that the DUP, which has 10 MPs, did not want another election or Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street. Theresa May is seeking to negotiate a so-called ""confidence and supply"" arrangement whereby the DUP will throw their weight behind the government in key Commons votes, such as on the Queen's Speech and Budgets. It is a week since DUP leader Arlene Foster visited Downing Street for talks with Theresa May, with reports that a final agreement is being held up by discussions over extra funding for Northern Ireland. This video can not be played Scaled back Queen's Speech will look a little different Should Mrs May lose any votes on the Queen's Speech, which are expected to take place next week, it would amount to a vote of no confidence in the government and put its future in doubt. But Mr Grayling told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he did not expect this to happen. ""The talks are going on but one thing I am absolutely certain of is that the DUP do not want to see another election and Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street,"" he said. ""We are having good, constructive discussions and I am confident we will reach a sensible agreement."" Former Prime Minister Sir John Major has urged Theresa May to reconsider her approach, saying a deal with the DUP could threaten the Northern Ireland peace process and ""carry baggage"" for his party. He has said the Conservatives should be able to govern anyway with the DUP's tacit support. Asked about the repercussions if there was no agreement, Mr Grayling replied: ""I am not pessimistic about this. I think we will have a sensible arrangement. ""We have got some days until we have a vote on the Queen's Speech. It is not on Queen's Speech day. The vote happens many days later as we have an extended debate first and I am sure we will have a sensible arrangement between the parties when that time comes."" The DUP had made it clear, he added, that they did not want ""an unstable government undermining our union"" and wanted to see us ""go ahead with the Brexit negotiations with a sensible government in place"".

"Republican Karen Handel praised Donald Trump in her victory speech US Republicans have won a closely contested congressional election in Georgia seen by many as a referendum on Donald Trump's presidency. Karen Handel retained the Atlanta seat with 53% of the vote, against 47% for her Democratic rival Jon Ossoff. The vacancy arose when Tom Price left to become health secretary. He had won the seat with a 23 point lead. In South Carolina, Republican Ralph Norman beat Democrat Archie Parnell in a solidly conservative area. President Trump congratulated both candidates. On the victory in suburban Atlanta, hetweeted,external: ""Congratulations to Karen Handel on her big win in Georgia 6th. Fantastic job, we are all very proud of you!"" Democrats were desperate to mark Tuesday's race as the moment the political tide began to turn in their favour. Instead, they woke up on Thursday to a president crowing about ""his"" triumph on Twitter. One race is of little consequence in determining who controls the House of Representatives, but the Georgia election - with its record-breaking cost and red-hot spotlight - matters. A lot. Democrats will surely be discouraged. They may be less willing to pour money into future races. The party's Bernie Sanders populist wing is second-guessing Mr Ossoff's decision to campaign as a moderate - heralding the possibility of more intra-party warfare in the days ahead. Republicans, on the other hand, can exhale. They'll feel more confident in pushing through their legislative agenda without ballot-box consequences. Nervous incumbents considering retirement in the face of a coming electoral wave may stick around. And, at least for now, their president gets a welcome bit of good news after weeks of Russia-related headaches. November will bring another round of electoral tests - including key governors races in Virginia and New Jersey - that will be on friendlier terrain for Democrats. Until then, it's going to be a long few months for those on the left. Jon Ossoff was a political newcomer Georgia's sixth district is a traditionally safe Republican seat but Democrats had hoped to capitalise on the president's low approval ratings. Spending on candidates was put at $56m (Â£44m), making it the costliest congressional election in US history. Democrats have already suffered narrow defeats in Kansas and Montana this year. Addressing jubilant supporters, Ms Handel thanked key Republican figures, including President Trump. ""I need to also thank Speaker Ryan and the House leadership and so many of the members across this country. And a special thanks to the President of the United States of America,"" she said. Mr Ossoff told his supporters they had provided ""a beacon of hope for people here in Georgia, for people across the country, and for people around the world"". This video can not be played The Georgia vote is the most expensive congressional election in history He also said they should celebrate having turned a conservative stronghold into a competitive district. ""We showed the world that in places where no-one thought it was even possible we could fight,"" Mr Ossoff said. In April, he narrowly failed to win the 50% needed to secure outright victory in a first round, forcing the run-off against Ms Handel. She had come a distant second in the first round, but the Republican vote had been split among 11 candidates. Republicans believed the run-off would favour them in an affluent seat they have held since 1979. They also believed thatlast week's shooting of Republicans on a Virginia baseball fieldwould count in their favour at the polls. The suspected gunman was a Democratic supporter and a Republican advert that sought to politicise the attack was condemned by Ms Handel. The South Carolina fifth-district seat, vacated when Mick Mulvaney became Mr Trump's budget director, had been expected to be an easy win for Republicans. The Republicans have so far staved off defeats by the Democrats this year. In April theynarrowly defended a deeply conservative Kansas seatvacated when Mr Trump appointed Congressman Mike Pompeo to lead the CIA. Last month,Republican Greg Gianforte won a special congressional election in Montana, despite being charged with assaulting a UK reporter.

"Police arrested the man for putting the baby's life in danger A court in Algeria has sentenced a man to two years in prison for dangling a baby out of a window in order to attract ""likes"" on Facebook. The man posted a picture of himself holding the baby out of a window in a high-rise building with the caption: ""1,000 likes or I will drop him."" It prompted other social media users to demand his arrest for child abuse. He was charged with endangering the baby's safety following his arrest on Sunday, police said. The child was dangled out of the 15th-floor window of an apartment block in the capital, Algiers, news site Al Arabiyareported,external. Africa Live: More updates on this and other stories Ramadan TV pranks go to extremes in ratings battle How Facebook's tentacles reach further than you think The man, who is a relative of the child, denied he put his life at risk, saying the image had been altered by social media users, Algeria's privately owned Ennahar TV reported. ""The picture was taken in a balcony with protective barriers. These were removed,"" he was quoted as saying. The child's father urged the court to forgive the man, saying he had just been playing a game. However, the judge ruled against him, saying the picture was clear and the child's life was in danger. Articles shared on social media about the incident got thousands of mostly angry reactions, reports BBC North Africa correspondent Rana Jawad. Many Algerians insulted the man, and praised the authorities for arresting him and sentencing him, she adds. Earlier reports incorrectly described the convicted man as the child's father. Got you!

"Victims of the Grenfell Tower fire are not being asked to move hundreds of miles from their homes, the team organising the emergency response says. The Grenfell Response Team also said it was not aware any victims were sleeping in parks and denied claims some could be made ""intentionally homeless"". Labour MPs have raised concerns some people are sleeping rough and others being offered housing in Lancashire. It comes as a doctor said some victims will take ""months"" to recover. Fourteen people are still in hospital after the fire, including eight receiving critical care and some in induced comas, NHS England has said. Police have said the number of people dead, or missing presumed dead, currently stands at 79. Labour MP for Kensington, Emma Dent Coad, said the co-ordination of the response to the fire had been ""appalling"", with ""people running around like headless chickens"". She toldBBC Radio 4's The World at Onethat she had heard ""countless reports"" of people who had lost their homes in the fire now sleeping rough. People ""are too scared to come forward because of worries over their immigration status"", she added. It comes as Labour MP for Tottenham, David Lammy, said he had heard victims of the blaze had been ""threatened"" with being declared ""intentionally homeless"". What we know so far Who are the victims? Visual guide to what happened People are made intentionally homeless if they leave accommodation they could have stayed in - meaning their local council does not have to provide them with housing. Mr Lammytweeted,externalthat he had heard survivors could be made intentionally homeless if they turned down accommodation offers - some 200 miles away, in Preston, Lancashire. However, the official Grenfell response team - made up of council and government staff, charity workers, the police and fire service  - rejected the claims. In a statement, the response team said it was not aware of any victims living in parks, that nobody was being forced into accommodation, and people were being homed ""as locally as possible"". Some 138 hotel placements have been made for people living in Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk, it added, while 112 additional residents from the wider area are now in hotels. ""No-one is being forced into housing they don't want. We will continue to work with everyone until we find them an offer of housing that they accept,"" it said.

More than Â£330,000 of a Â£5m emergency fund has been distributed to the affected families, the response team added. It said 314 people have now received financial assistance, while 40 households have been given a Â£5,000 government payment. The government has offered Â£500 cash payments along with a Â£5,000 bank payment to those affected, as part of a Â£5m emergency fund. A candlelight vigil was held in Westminster on Monday One week on from the fire, King's College Hospital clinical director Duncan Bew said some victims were being kept in an induced coma after the fire. He said staff had expected to see ""hundreds"" of patients with a range of injuries, including burns, smoke inhalation and caused by people ""jumping from windows"". ""We knew there were many more people in the building. As time went on and we realised that we weren't going to receive those casualties, it was very sad,"" he added.

"The Times feels Theresa May has been left exposed after the Democratic Unionist Party warnedits support for her minority government could not be taken for granted,external. It suggests two possible sticking points are the impact of any deal between the two parties on the peace process and the scale of the increase in future spending in Northern Ireland. The Guardian thinksthere is concern within the DUP,externalthat this extra spending could enrage English, Scottish and Welsh Tories over special treatment. The Sun reports that aminister has now put the chances of an agreement for five years,externalas only 50:50 due to the DUP's cash demands for Northern Ireland. The Daily Mirror is dismissive - saying ""you cannot even describe it as a coalition of chaos,externalas she has not been able to assemble a coalition"". The failure to secure agreement, says the paper, leaves her as the first prime minister in more than 40 years to present a Queen's Speech without a guaranteed majority. The Daily Telegraph says it understands theDUP is now prepared to walk away from a formal deal,externalwith the government entirely and decide whether to back the Tories on a ""case by case"" basis.

"One of the highlights of the Royal Family's summer calendar got under way on Tuesday, with the opening of Royal Ascot. Temperatures were so hot that members of the public wereallowed to remove their jacketsfor the first time in the event's history. But the first day of the annual racing festival started on a sombre note as Her Majesty led a minute's silence to remember the victims and those affected by recent tragedies. She was joined for a day at the races by senior members of the Royal Family as the temperature rose well above 30C. Prince William went to the races with the Duchess of Cambridge, who wore an Alexander McQueen dress with a bespoke hat. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall arrived during the Royal Parade, after the Queen, before the start of racing. Former England rugby player Mike Tindall, who is married to the Queen's grand-daughter Zara Tindall, enjoyed a joke with some of the younger royals, including Prince William, Princess Beatrice, and the Duchess of Cambridge. The Princess Royal joined the Cambridges along with the Earl and Countess of Wessex.

"This video can not be played Dr Angie Bone of Public Health England offers some tips and dispels some myths on staying cool In the week the sunshine never ends, the UK is close to matching a sizzling June run not seen in two decades. If Wednesday's temperature tops 30C - and forecasters confidently predict it will - that will be five days in a row. The last June that we sweltered for so long was 1995, when theheat affected us so much Robson and Jerome stayed at number one for the entire month.,external And if Wednesday reaches 33.9C, it will be the warmest day in any June since 1976 - the classic long hot summer. BBC Weather says it is ""very likely"" that these temperatures will be reached this week. The Met Officehas issued an amber Level 3 heat warning,externaluntil Thursday. It has advised people to stay out of the sun and to show awareness for people who may be vulnerable people, such as the elderly. Weather Watchers' picture gallery Tuesday is the fourth consecutive day where the temperatures have exceeded 30C somewhere in the UK. Monday was the UK's hottest day of the year so far, with 32.5C being reached at Hampton Water Works in Greater London. It's not just humans who need to keep cool - animals do too Of course, not all of the UK has seen particularly high temperatures - Edinburgh hovered around 18C on Tuesday, while Belfast was about 19C. However, by early afternoon on Tuesday it was 27C in Bristol, 30C in Chivenor and 30C in Hampton Water Works. And excessive heat should be seen in its proper context. While these temperatures are high for the temperate climate of the UK, they are lower than many parts of the world usually experience. For countries like Portugalwhere fires are currently ragingand people have died, heat can be particularly deadly, while heat waves inIndia can also prove fatal. And even in the UK, the heat can be problematic for older people, leading to bodies likethe NHS,external, the charityAge UK,,externaland theRoyal Voluntary Service,externalall issuing advice for the elderly when the temperatures rise. These include: Drinking six to eight glasses of water or fruit juices a day Dressing appropriately, such as in a hat and loose-fitting, light-coloured clothes Staying out of the sun during hottest parts of the day Also the RSPCA regularly issues warnings,externalabout the dangers of leaving dogs in hot cars. And for those (human) Britons simply trying to get a good night's rest, there's the#TooHotToSleep,externalhashtag on Twitter. But the British obsession with its recent temperatures has given rise to the rolling of eyes in other parts of the world, especially places like Australia. The news.com.au website,externalhas written a story about Brits not coping with our temperatures ""as high as, hmm, 32C"". Suffice to say, some of the reaction tothis story on Facebook,externalhas not been sympathetic. ""You sure wouldn't want to be in Australia in the middle of summer. Walk outside and you'll look like a shrimp on the Barbie,"" writes Julie Rae, while Mark Whiting scoffs that Britons ""need to get out more"". He also mentions how the town of Birdsville ""nudges the 50C mark"". However, a few people commenting on that same story have offered a more understanding point of view. Lawton Rose points out that ""the UK is just not built for this sort of weather"", while Australian Daniel Richardson also posted that hot weather feels like ""a different kind of heat when you live in an old city designed to mostly just handle cold"". Perhaps those Aussies with scathing views of Brits sweltering in the heat are grumpy because it's their winter right now. Just take a look at Bondi Beach. Meanwhile, in much of the UK...

"The fires have claimed the lives at least 64 people since Saturday Reports that a firefighting plane crashed during an operation to tackle huge blazes in central Portugal have been denied by the country's civil protection authority. This contradicts earlier reports that a Canadair aircraft went down near the central PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande area. More than 1,000 firefighters on the ground and planes from several countries are battling the fires. The fires have claimed the lives of at least 64 people since Saturday. Many of the victims died in their cars as they tried to escape. More than 130 people have been injured. Portugal fires: Varzeas mourns villagers who fled Civil protection officials have said they expect the blazes to be under control soon, but warn that soaring temperatures are hampering efforts. The week's highest temperatures in the area are expected to reach about 38C (100F) and, together with windy conditions, could reignite fires that have already been brought under control. Wildfires are an annual menace in Portugal.

"This video can not be played Police arrive after explosion in Brussels central train station Belgian soldiers have shot a man suspected of being a would-be suicide bomber at Brussels Central Station, officials say. He was shot after reportedly setting off a small explosion and no-one else is believed to have been injured. Prosecutors later said the man had died. They are treating the incident as a terrorist attack. In March 2016, 32 people were killed in attacks on Brussels claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group. According to Belgian newspaper La Libre Belgique, quoting prosecutors, the man who was shot was wearing a rucksack and a bomb belt. A photograph taken inside the station showed flames He detonated a device when he attracted the attention of soldiers in the station, the paper says. Brussels marks bomb attacks anniversary Spain links arrests to Brussels attacks Belgium country profile Nicolas Van Herrewegen, a railway sorting agent, said he had gone down to the station's mezzanine level when he heard someone shouting. This video can not be played Nicolas Van Herrewegen saw a man with a suicide belt shout ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is great"" in Arabic) ""Then he cried 'Allahu Akbar' and he blew up a wheeled suitcase,"" he told AFP news agency. ""I was behind a wall when it exploded. I went down and alerted my colleagues to evacuate everyone. He [the suspect] was still around but after that we didn't see him."" ""It wasn't exactly a big explosion but the impact was pretty big,"" he added. ""People were running away."" Armed Belgian police have sealed off the scene Mr Van Herrewegen described the suspect as well-built and tanned with short hair, wearing a white shirt and jeans. ""I saw that he had something on him because I could see wires emerging, so it may have been a suicide vest,"" he said. Lawyer Remy Bonnaffe, 23, was waiting for a train and took a photograph of flames seconds after the explosion. He told Reuters news agency that people close to the explosion appeared unhurt and he saw no obvious damage to nearby walls. ""I'm happy that no-one was injured and that this was basically a failed attempt,"" he said. Arash Aazami arrived at the station just after the explosion. He told the BBC: ""As we entered into the station, we were evacuated loudly by some security personnel. ""Looked around, saw people running in the streets, trying to seek refuge and decided to do the same ourselves."" Police and soldiers guided people to safety outside the station As the station and Grand Place were evacuated, businesses and restaurants were ordered to close and draw down their shutters, RTL radio reports. Metro lines running through the station were also briefly suspended on orders of the police, according to the radio. On 22 March of last year, three suicide bombers mounted twin attacks on the city's Zaventem airport and Maelbeek underground station. The same Brussels-based IS cell was also behind the gun and bomb attacks in Paris in November 2015, that killed 130 people. The French capital was jolted again on Monday whena man with an Islamist background died after ramming his car into a police vanon the Avenue des Champs-ÃlysÃ©e. London has also been on edge sincea van was driven into Muslim worshippers outside a mosqueon Sunday night, with one man dying and nine people injured.

"Journalist Lipika Pelham lives close to the Finsbury Park mosque, is a member of the local synagogue, and is accustomed to seeing girls in hijabs acting in the Nativity Play at her children's school. On Monday evening, nearly 24 hours after the van attack a few yards away, she was one of hundreds handing flowers to Muslim worshippers as they entered the mosque to pray. A sea of roses - pink, yellow, white and red - symbolised multicultural London. People's faces were glowing in the evening sun. These non-Muslims, mostly from the area, were offering roses to Muslim worshippers. A man in a Muslim skullcap and long white robe accepted a bouquet from a young Londoner in shorts and a sleeveless top. I stopped an Orthodox Jew in a black hat, Hananja Fisher, and asked him what brought him there. He pointed to his eyes. ""My tears. This is all too familiar to us Jews, such attacks."" I had received a message telling me about the rose-giving event from my female rabbi, Shulamit Ambalu, as I was talking to a Somali neighbour who had been in the mosque when the attack took place. Muhubo Barre always struck me as an extraordinary woman, raising 10 children in London, with a husband often away on business in Somalia. Her girls, wearing long Muslim robes and hijabs, would whizz past my house on scooters and bicycles on the way to school. Muhubo had been at the mosque when the attack occurred, during a break after the first prayer session. People poured out on to the street, but the imam - who went on to stop the crowd beating up the alleged attacker - urged them back inside, in case other assailants appeared. She went in and prayed that her older sons, who are 24 and 21, were safe. She heard that Salah, a friend of the family whose child is in year one at the local primary school where her younger children are pupils, was among those seriously injured. ""We finished the second prayer very quickly,"" she says. ""I walked home at 2:10am on my own. I was advised not to, but I wasn't afraid. Why should I be? The attacker has no community, he's a lone crazy man, whereas I have one."" By ""community"" she meant not only fellow Muslims, but neighbours like me, a British Bengali married to a white British man. Muhubo arrived in the UK in the 1990s from the autonomous region of Jubaland in south Somalia, as it became engulfed by a civil war which would leave Islamist militants largely in control. She acknowledges that the Finsbury Park mosque went through ""difficult times"" under the radical cleric, Abu Hamza, from 1997 to 2004, but says tensions have evaporated in recent years. On Saturday a ""More in common"" event was held at the Muslim Welfare House to commemorate the death of the MP Jo Cox, who in her maiden speech to Parliament famously said of her Batley and Spen constituency: ""We are far more united and have far more in common with each other than things that divide us."" This applies just as well to Finsbury Park. Last weekend Rabbi Shulamit was a guest at the mosque for Iftar, the breaking of the fast after nightfall during Ramadan. She found that she was simply able to walk in, without passing through any security checks - which are now routine at British synagogues. Rabbi Shulamit Ambalu, pictured recently with other faith leaders near London Bridge The imam initially assumed she was a Muslim worshipper, and invited to join the other women downstairs - she was amused, because the same would happen at any Orthodox synagogue. Then he realised his mistake and invited her to join him at the multi-faith Iftar. When she left the mosque she walked out into a warm summer night, just as large numbers of worshippers were arriving to pray. ""It felt like Jerusalem,"" she says. ""That sense of anticipation, holiness, the excitement of a festival night. The sense of the closeness and also the differences between us, and how at times that very junction of similarity and difference can be so creative and also so uncertain. I simply felt at home."" I remember all too well the times when Finsbury Park would be in the news, if not for football hooliganism spreading out from Arsenal's stadium, then for the extremism preached by Abu Hamza. In 1998, I sent a frivolous invitation to a party at our house to two of Abu Hamza's henchmen, including Omar Bakri Mohammed, who went on to head the al-Qaeda-affiliated group, al-Muhajiroun. I never imagined that they would ring my doorbell. I opened the door in my short dress with a glass of champagne, which I offered to the men. Omar Bakri Mohammed declined both the champagne and my outstretched hand. We had a chat in the hallway. The men never ventured into my living room, possibly because people were dancing there.  When they left, after about 20 minutes, I explained who the two guests had been - sending a shockwave through the party. Things have come such a long way since then. When I asked Muhubo Barre's eldest son, Ayub, 24, about Sunday night's attack, he said it had taken him a while to grasp that it could have been racially or religiously motivated. The idea seemed so strange. ""I didn't feel being Muslim in Finsbury Park, in London, was ever an issue,"" he said. ""I believe as a community we'll get through this."" Despite the recent tragic events - Manchester, London Bridge, Finsbury Park - I left the roses ceremony in an upbeat mood.

"Tourism to North Korea has come under close scrutiny Travelling to North Korea has always been a niche adventure for those seeking something off the beaten track. It's also been one of the few doors left for any exchange with the country. But thedeath of US student Otto Warmbiermight make travellers think twice whether the novelty factor of travelling to the world's most secretive country is really worth it. The 22-year-old held in North Korea for stealing a propaganda sign has died a week after returning home in a coma. Otto Warmbier (far right), during his trip to North Korea The picture emerging from online travel forums is one of quite divided opinions. It's a country that people either really want to see or that they condemn travelling to. Comments against travelling range from safety concerns to condemning the whole idea for ""subsidising a brutal regime"" and calling for a boycott of the tour groups. Those who still want to go remain intrigued by the ""bizarre"" nature of the destination and suggest that sticking closely to the rules should keep tourists safe. Travel companies that offer trips also often play along those lines in their advertising, describing it for instance as ""a hermit and magical country"", ""one of the last untouched places in the world"" or ""a surreal and lifetime experience"". Aware of the concerns over possible risks, most travel agencies explicitly address those worries and unanimously stress that North Korea is a safe place to visit. How did a North Korea holiday end in jail, and a coma? Washington condemns 'brutal' North Korea as student dies Tourists especially want to see the country's parades and celebrations Following the death of Mr Warmbier though, most agencies that the BBC contacted were not willing to talk, referring to statements they put out to the media but unwilling to give information beyond that. They're faced with what potentially could be a great problem for their business. The US student had his trip booked with Young Pioneers, a Beijing-based agency founded by Briton Gareth Johnson in 2008. While mainly focussing on North Korea, the agency also offers different destinations, equally ""off the beaten track"" as for instance the Chernobyl exclusion zone, promoting it with the hash tag ""#darktourism"". Young Pioneers has sinceput out a statement,externalexpressing its ""deepest sympathies"" to Mr Warmbier's family, adding that ""the way his detention was handled was appalling"". In an interview with website nknews.org, the company said it still believed that the country was safe as long as precautions were taken. It also pointed out that Mr Warmbier's arrest was the only one in the past 10 years, and that the company had taken over 8,000 tourists to the country. Andre Wittig of Berlin-based Pyongyang Travel agrees that North Korea remains a country that's safe to visit. ""There's not been a single time that we've had a situation that was even close to difficult,"" he told the BBC. While stressing that the death of Mr Warmbier is a terrible tragedy that must not be repeated, he does not feel it will discourage increasing numbers of tourists from going there. Megan Lacina, a 28-year-old from Los Angeles ran the Pyongyang marathon in April. She says she wouldn't make the same decision now. Before leaving I asked my friends: ""Oh, if I get detained will you devote your life to freeing me?"" It was a joke but then again, you do hear about all these stories. I was worried about how I would be treated as an American, but they do make very clear what you can and can't do. Everyone was extremely kind. People we met were timid and reserved but not unfriendly. I remember hearing about the staff-only floor at the hotel where Otto, who was then detained, took the sign. I can understand feeling very comfortable in the hotel, and forgetting just where you are in the world. During the marathon, the stadium was full of about 50,000 people. I heard someone say the people were told they had to be there. Before I went, I heard different opinions on whether I should go, but I didn't want to have a blanket, one-sided view of the country and people. My favourite moment was during the marathon. We could interact with people, and they were high-fiving me and cheering for me. I'm glad I got to go there and experience it, but if my trip was next week I couldn't imagine still going under the circumstances, and after what happened to Otto Warmbier. Ms Lacina spoke to the BBC's Kevin Ponniah Young Pioneers said in its statement that it would no longer organise tours for US citizens to North Korea. Other travel agencies offering North Korea tours have put out similar statements, also announcing they'd be reviewing whether they can still accept US citizens for their tours. Generally, travelling to North Korea for US citizens is legal, but the US state department warns its citizens against visiting the country and considers stopping them from doing so altogether. ""We have been evaluating whether we should put some type of travel visa restriction to North Korea,"" Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on the matter. ""We have not come to a final conclusion, but we are considering it."" Fred Warmbier has strongly criticised the agencies that run tours to North Korea Fred Warmbier, the student's father, in the meantime has strongly criticised the tour operators for ""luring"" Americans into the closed country, accusing them of providing ""fodder for the North Koreans, and my son happened to become fodder for the North Koreans"". While tourism to North Korea remains a niche, it's brought a steady flow of revenue to the country over the past years. Numbers are very hard to get and not reliable, but it's thought that about 100,000 foreigners visited the country in the past year. The vast majority of those though are Chinese - the number of non-Chinese tourists is estimated to be between 8,000 and 10,000 per year. Aside from the more traditional tours that take you to the capital and around, there's been an increasing push to also offer more ""normal"" tourist activities that don't merely focus on the bizarre elements of the last Stalinist dictatorship on the globe. Things on offer range fromsurfing on its remote sandy beachestoskiing in a newly built resortin the mountains. Yet the arrest and death of Mr Warmbier comes at a time of heightened tensions between North Korea and the US - and is likely to add to those very tensions. Pyongyang's recent string of rocket tests coupled with the regime's work to develop nuclear warheads has led the US to make North Korea a top priority, with Washington trying to get China to put pressure on its ally. Tensions between Washington and Pyongyang are high And it's not like the tourism sector is immune to the volatile situation. ""Where we do in fact see a difference in bookings is whenever there are growing tensions between the US and North Korea - this is obviously something that has people worried,"" Mr Wittig explains. ""Since the Trump administration in Washington has upped the rhetoric to include a possible military strike, people are naturally more hesitant and concerned about booking a trip to North Korea."" The growing tensions on the Korean peninsula are stoking concerns that Pyongyang will arbitrarily arrest tourists to keep them as bargaining chips in the diplomatic game. In this scenario, US citizens would obviously be prime targets. Currently, there are three US citizens in detention in North Korea, a businessman and two lecturers who had been working a university in Pyongyang. How did Otto Warmbier end up in a coma?

"Barclays PLC and four former executives have been charged with fraud over their actions in the 2008 financial crisis. The Serious Fraud Office case relates to the billions of pounds the bank raised from Qatari investors, enabling it to avoid a government bailout. But what happened nine years ago and why have the company's actions been investigated? There was a global financial crisis in 2008 and the financial markets plunged into chaos when the US government allowed the investment bank Lehman Brothers to go bankrupt. This was an unprecedented incident and led to a chain of events including the value of shares in other US banks plummeting. Barclays charged with fraud in Qatar case Simon Jack's blog: Why Barclays came under SFO fire Listen - Lord Myners: Barclays charge ""very, very significant"" The problems rapidly spread around Western countries with the Republic of Ireland going into recession and three Icelandic banks collapsing, and, in the UK, the government having to rescue several banks including Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. Barclays decided to go down a different path - and it is that decision that has led to the charges that it now faces. Barclays decided not to rely on the taxpayer and boosted its coffers by raising Â£4.5bn in June 2008 and another Â£7.3bn four months later from a number of investors including state-owned investment fund Qatar Holdings. The SFO investigation has been looking into exactly what Barclays paid to the Qatari investors for their participation in the October deal. A total of Â£346m in advisory fees was paid to Qatar Holding. Barclays also loaned Â£2bn to the state of Qatar only weeks after announcing the fundraising deal with the government-backed investment fund. Under the Companies Act 1985, it is unlawful for a bank to lend itself money - the legal term for which is financial assistance. Barclays has denied in court documents that the two transactions were linked. The SFO has charged Barclays PLC, not the bank, and four former employees, including ex-chief executive John Varley, with fraud in relation to the June fund raising. In addition, Mr Varley and Mr Jenkins have also been charged with the same offence in relation to the October 2008 fund raising and with providing unlawful financial assistance. The SFO questioned 44 people during its five-year investigation into the case. The four who have been charged all held senior roles during their time at the bank, but no longer work there. John Varley, aged 61, was chief executive at Barclays between 2004 and 2011. Roger Jenkins, 61, was the executive chairman of investment banking and investment management in the Middle East and North Africa. Thomas Kalaris, 61, was chief executive of Barclays wealth and investment management. Richard Boath, 58, was European head of financial institutions group. The defendants will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court at 14:00 BST on 3 July. Messrs Jenkins and Boath have both pledged to defend themselves against the charges, but there has been no comment yet from either of their other ex-colleagues. Barclays has said it is considering its position and awaiting further details. However, this may not be the end of the matter as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has reopened its investigation into the deal and is understood to be reviewing new evidence which could prompt it to reconsider a Â£50m fine against the banking giant four years ago, which had been put on hold.

" Coffee drinkers could face poorer-tasting, higher-priced brews, as a warming climate causes the amount of land suitable for coffee production to shrink, say scientists from London’s Kew Gardens. Coffee production in Ethiopia, the birthplace of the high quality Arabica coffee bean and Africa’s largest exporter, could be in serious jeopardy over the next century unless action is taken, according toa report, published in Nature Plants today. “In Ethiopia and all over the world really, if we do nothing there will be less coffee, it will probably taste worse and will cost more,” Dr Aaron Davis, coffee researcher at Kew and one of the report’s authors, told the BBC. Consumption has doubled in the last 35 years… 4.9bn kilos 1980 9.5bn kilos 2016 Production is susceptible to extreme weather... Billion kilograms 10 8 6 4 2 0 1980 2016 Due to climate change, existing coffee growing areas are projected to shrink 48%Central America 60%Brazil 70%South East Asia Source: International Coffee Organisation, Christian Bunn (Climatic Change Journal) Consumption is forecast to outstrip production for the third consecutive year, according to figures from the intergovernmental body for coffee, the International Coffee Organization (ICO). So far, stockpiles accumulated in high production years have avoided any coffee shortages or price hikes. But as exporters have been forced to tap into those supplies, their stock levels of coffee are currently low, the ICO says. Longer-term climate change worries aside, initial fears about this year’s weather in Brazil and Vietnam, the world’s two biggest coffee producers, have eased. Concerns remain though that any unforeseen weather events there in the next few months may mean a short-term bean shortage. However, it is the longer-term outlook that is a greater cause for concern to farmers and coffee drinkers alike. As Dr Tim Schilling, director of theWorld Coffee Research institute, an organisation funded by the global coffee industry, says: ""The supply of high-quality coffee is severely threatened by climate change, diseases and pests, land pressure, and labour shortages - and demand for these coffees is rising every year"". In some coffee areas, temperatures have already risen enough to begin having quality impacts, he adds. “The logical result of that is that prices will need to rise, especially for the highest quality coffees, which are the most threatened,” he adds. Current coffee growing areas in Ethiopia could decrease by up to 60% given a temperature rise of 4C by the end of the century, the study by Kew Gardens and collaborators in Ethiopia predicts. The 4C temperature increase is based on a scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions remain high from now until 2100. The forecast is one of the high-range greenhouse gas emission forecasts from the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). However, even when testing using a more conservative climate change scenario, the current coffee growing areas in Ethiopia would still shrink by 55%, Kew say. “A 'business as usual' approach would be disastrous for the Ethiopian coffee economy in the long-term,” say’s Kew’s Justin Moat, another of the paper’s authors. But Kew’s researchers are keen to stress that if action is taken, this situation can be avoided. Relocation of coffee-growing areas, combined with forest conservation and replanting, could see substantial growth in the area suitable for growing coffee in Ethiopia. “There is the potential to mitigate some of the negatives and actually increase the coffee-growing area by four-and-a-half-times compared with maintaining the status quo,” Dr Davis says. Footage and interviews collected in early 2016 from eastern Ethiopia. Parts of the country continue to battle drought, with 7.7 million people requiring emergency food aid Coffee provides a livelihood for close to 15 million Ethiopians, 16% of the population. Farmers in the eastern part of the country, where a warming climate is already impacting production, have struggled in recent years,and many are currently reporting largely failed harvests as a result of a prolonged drought. In the past 10 years, farmer Jamal Kasim has noted significant changes to his coffee harvest. ""In the first few years they bore a lot of fruit, but now they've become barren. I can't support or provide for my family,"" he says. Ethiopia may not be alone in experiencing potential problems with its coffee production. Researchpublished by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a United Nations-backed expert panel, outlines similar worries for Brazil. A 3C rise in temperature and a 15% increase in rainfall from pre-industrial levels in two of the country’s major coffee-producing states, Minas Gerais and Sao Paulo, could see the potential area for production dwindle from 70-75% to 20-25%. In the last few years, the worst drought in Brazil since records began almost a century ago has plagued the country’s main coffee-growing regions. Earlier this year, Brazil’s government went as far as discussing the possibility of importing coffee beans for the first time, but abandoned plans following opposition from producers. Production of the higher quality Arabica bean took a hit in the year from July 2014 to June 2015. Prolonged dry spells coupled with high temperatures in the state of Espirito Santo in the two years since have also resulted in lower harvests of the more bitter Robusta bean. And even now, across the region, reservoirs used by farmers to water their crops remain dry. State officials banned or restricted the use of irrigation in a number of towns during periods of extreme drought, while construction of new reservoirs to ensure water is stored more efficiently during rainy spells is ongoing. Satellite images show the change in water level in the Jaguari reservoir in Sao Paulo, Brazil, following the 2014 drought. “For the past four years, we have had rain levels way below average. The crops are suffering,” says Inacio Brioschi, a coffee farmer from Espirito Santo. Brioschi lost half his crop in 2016 and expects production to be 60% below average this year. Footage and interviews collected in early 2016 from Brazil’s Espirito Santo state. The BBC spoke to the same coffee farmers again in May 2017 and they reported that the situation had worsened this year. A single drought cannot be attributed to climate change, stresses Dr Peter Baker, of the Coffee and Climate initiative, a body funded in part by the coffee industry. However, these extreme weather events constitute a major challenge for the coffee industry. ""It's not just the fact that temperatures are going up steadily, these major climatic events that can last for months are most damaging,"" Dr Baker says. Climate-modelling studies support the idea the more extreme temperatures are arising from climate change, according to Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office's Hadley Centre. Droughts coupled with rising temperatures overall means weather events have a greater impact, he says. ""With temperatures rising across the globe, it's fair to say that when droughts occur, their effects are often more intense due to the warming driving more evaporation and drying the land more,"" Mr Betts says. While severe weather is impacting coffee farmers in Ethiopia and Brazil and scientists are forecasting a reduction in areas where high-quality coffee can grow, a number of coffee-growing countries are seeing record harvests. The reason, Dr Baker believes, is deforestation. “In nearly all countries where coffee production is currently expanding rapidly, deforestation is the primary source of new coffee lands. That’s apart from Brazil, where technological improvements can account for any productivity increases,” he says. In the long term, technology could play an even more important role in ensuring the future of coffee. In 2014, the complete genome sequence for Arabica was made public, making it easier to select plants able to cope with warmer conditions. In addition, the World Coffee Research institute is working on a plant breeding programme to “recreate” the Arabica coffee with “better breeding” to increase its diversity, making it more resistant to climatic changes. But this is not something that will happen overnight – and by then caffeine lovers could face rising prices and declining quality at their favourite coffee shop.

"So, he's said it. Mark Carney made the direct link between ""weaker real income growth"" and the process of leaving the European Union. Brexit is likely to make people poorer, the governor of the Bank of England said. Since the referendum the markets have sold off sterling, making the currency weaker and increasing inflation in the UK. That means that price rises are now running ahead of wage growth and real incomes are falling again. Mr Carney's speech at the Mansion House called for an ""innovative, co-operative and responsible"" approach to Brexit. ""Fragmentation is in no-one's interest,"" he argued when it came to the key relationship of financial services in particular. Some might describe that as a plea for a ""soft"" Brexit - no cliff edge at the end of exit negotiations, rather a ""slope"" - as the chancellor has described it. Time not right for rate rise, says Carney Carmakers call for transitional EU deal Rolls-Royce boss warns against a 'hard Brexit' Speaking alongside the governor, Philip Hammond said that no-one voted for Brexit to become poorer. He also made it clear that he wants to put the economy at the heart of the Brexit negotiations. Rather than sovereignty or controlling immigration, which are the issues likely to motivate other colleagues in the Cabinet and certainly in the Conservative Party. The tensions are clear. The chancellor - strengthened since the general election - gave the greatest detail yet about what his approach might mean for our future relationship with the EU. Yes, as he said at the weekend, the UK will be leaving the customs union. But he made the case for a new form of customs agreement with ""current border arrangements"" - which presumably means agreeing to some form of EU oversight for some years following Britain's exit from the union. It is nailing down this ""transition"" or ""implementation"" period which is important for many businesses. Some will be relieved that both Mr Carney and Mr Hammond are calling for Britain to play a longer game when it comes to the Brexit process. Others may fear that tying the UK formally to the EU after Britain leaves the union in March 2019 could mean, for a few years of transition at least, Brexit does not, quite, mean Brexit.

"The Queen's Speech on Wednesday will set out the government's proposed legislation and policies for the next session of parliament, as it continues negotiations on a post-election deal with the Democratic Unionist Party. BBC editors and correspondents have been looking at what might shape the government's programme. A Queen's Speech sets out the government's proposals for legislation in the coming parliamentary session. It does not therefore necessarily have to set out the government's detailed plans for how it intends to conclude an international negotiation. So do not expect Her Majesty to reveal precisely what form of Brexit Theresa May now wishes to pursue after her electoral setback. That will be determined by future discussions she will have with her party and our parliament where she has no majority. Instead, the Queen's Speech will set out the legislation that will be needed howsoever we leave the EU. The largest measure by far will be what has been dubbed ""the great repeal bill"". This is a misnomer. In fact it should be called ""the great continuity bill"". This bill will indeed repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and thereby take Britain out of the EU. But that is a technicality. More importantly the bill will transfer EU rules and regulations into UK law so there is no legal and financial chaos when we leave. The idea is to preserve the status quo in the short term so that after Brexit parliament can go through these many laws at its leisure and delete, amend or keep what it wants. This is such a huge exercise that the government will also have to set out how it intends to go through the estimated 19,000 laws it will need to transpose. It is likely to use fast-track procedures - known as secondary legislation - that will ensure decisions are taken quickly by ministers and officials and there is no parliamentary gridlock potentially lasting years. But this will be controversial as there will be less parliamentary scrutiny than normal of what the government is doing. And that is not all. The government has also made clear that it will also have to introduce other bills in areas where keeping EU law is not enough and where new legislation will be needed. These may cover immigration, customs, agriculture, fisheries, taxation, data protection, sanctions and nuclear safety. That is a lot of legislation. The political point is this - parliament will provide the domestic battleground for Brexit, where MPs try to shape Theresa May's negotiating position, and the weapons they will use will be the bills set out in this coming Queen's Speech. James Landale is the BBC's diplomatic correspondent. This Queen's Speech would normally reflect the winning party's manifesto. But this year, much of the interest is on what's going to be dropped or watered down. Some of the most contentious pledges seem likely to be ditched. So don't expect to see the scrapping of the winter fuel allowance or a reduction of the so-called ""triple lock"", under which the state pension rises in line with the highest of average earnings, the inflation rate or 2.5%. This was to be replaced by a ""double lock"" rising with earnings or inflation. What would this mean for the public finances? The ""double lock"" on pensions wasn't going to happen until 2020. And the cost of retaining the triple lock could be zero if the forecasts on earnings growing more than 2.5% are correct. It's hard to see how the controversial social care plan, which involved people having to sell their homes until they had only Â£100,000 left in their estates, could get through parliament in its current form, either. We don't know how much it would cost to retain the winter fuel allowance as there wasn't any detail on how it would be means tested. As for the so-called ""dementia tax"", the IFS says there also wasn't enough detail to cost either the original proposal or the subsequent U-turn. What would really make a big difference to public spending is if the government eases the restrictions on public sector pay increases, currently capped at 1%, or the freeze on working age benefits. There's been much talk about reining back on austerity. The new government could end up borrowing more, not less. When it comes to business, this manifesto took a far more interventionist approach than previous Tory pledges. From wading into the energy market with a cap on standard variable tariffs, to plans to ensure worker representation at board level. Theresa May also wanted to increase the amount levied on firms employing migrant workers. That hasn't gone down well with most firms who are wary of more regulation and fear any additional financial burdens when many are already grappling with rising costs and the uncertainty of Brexit. Could these measures also be diluted? Labour is keen on an even tougher energy cap so perhaps this eye catching measure will remain in the legislative programme. But it's the spectre of leaving the EU which overshadows everything for business and the economy. Theresa May is certainly under some pressure to take a less rigid approach and several business organisations have already started to wade in. Additionally, the so-called Great Repeal Bill, which aims to repatriate European law into British law before Brexit, should mean no sudden changes to rules and regulations over the next few years but deciding which laws should be kept or changed will be a huge undertaking. Emma Simpson is a BBC business correspondent. When the 91-year-old Queen begins to read out her speech, the ink freshly dried on the now much-discussed vellum, we should get our first clear indication of where providing support for the UK's ageing population sits in the new government's list of priorities. Will they deal with the very real problems faced by the social care system head on, or will they veer away from the issue after getting their fingers burned during the election campaign? The social care system helps people who are older or disabled with washing, dressing and medication, among many other things. With growing demand, squeezed budgets, fewer people getting council help, a shortage of care staff and care companies handing back local authority contracts, it is safe to say this complicated system is in crisis. For many experts, the Conservative manifesto missed the point on care. It gave with one hand - increasing the amount of people's money that was protected - and took with the other, by including the value of a person's home in all calculations. But it did nothing about what many see as the fundamental unfairness of a system that leaves some, particularly those with dementia, facing huge costs - sometimes running into the hundreds of thousands of pounds before they get help. Only four days after the manifesto launch was a cap or limit on the highest care costs promised, but by then the opposition description of a ""dementia tax"" had stuck. So has the election shifted the debate significantly? Is there now an appetite for finding a way to share the risk of very high dementia care costs in the way we share the risk of cancer or other health costs? After putting short-term money into social care last winter, the government was planning a green paper on funding this autumn. The other main parties have also talked about working towards a cross-party consensus. But what if the government puts social care into the ""too difficult to deal with right now"" tray? Well, that is described by at least one commentator as grim, because these problems won't go away. Alison Holt is the BBC's social affairs correspondent. Officials at Number 10 are, understandably, giving away no details as to how many of the government's ideas on improving UK security will make it into the Queen's Speech. There is talk of a Counter Extremism Bill, a Commission Against Extremism and measures to curtail online propaganda, but none of this is confirmed. But we do know from Theresa May's speech on the steps of Downing Street on 4 June the broad areas where she wants to see more effort being focused. She named extremism and hateful ideologies as the sources of current terrorist threats. This means both tackling online radicalisation and no longer allowing intolerance to fester. ""We need to work with allied democratic governments to reach international agreements that regulate cyberspace to prevent the spread of extremist and terrorism planning,"" she said in her speech. Her meeting in Paris on 13 June with the new French president appeared to reinforce this in principle but it may be too early to see detail inserted into the Queen's Speech. The prime minister has also suggested that custodial sentences could be extended for terrorist-related offences in the light of the prevailing threat. Military action against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, she said, is necessary to deprive terrorists of their safe spaces. There will be a comprehensive review of Britain's counter-terrorism strategy, made all the more urgent bythe Finsbury Park attack on Muslim worshippers. After four terror attacks getting through in just three months, nearly everyone can agree this needs to be undertaken in order to give the police and MI5 the capabilities they need, and to avoid other potential attackers failing to be spotted and then slipping through the surveillance net. Frank Gardner is the BBC's security correspondent. At the outset of the election, the big talking point for education was the 11-plus and the return of grammars in England. When the votes were counted, the most important figure was the 13-minus - the loss of Conservative MPs and the evaporation of the party's majority. With this new parliamentary arithmetic, there has been widespread speculation that plans for a new wave of grammars have already been ditched, as too controversial to get through the Commons. But nothing has been confirmed and grammar supporters might hold on to a couple of straws for a scaled-down return to selection. The Conservatives' new friends in the DUP are pro-grammar, and Graham Brady, the most high profile grammar-supporting MP, wields more influence than ever as the leader of Tory backbenchers. School funding proved to be one of the biggest grassroots issues during the election. And proposed changes to the funding formula, which looked vulnerable before the election, are now likely to be heavily revised, with a higher minimum amount per pupil. Apart from how school cash is allocated, head teachers have been loudly telling parents (otherwise known as ""voters"") that the overall level of funding is much too low. If the new government is to avoid even more vociferous protests, they might need much bigger investments. And there must be every chance that the proposed source of extra money - scrapping universal free school lunches for infants - will be ditched as unpopular and requiring legislation that would now be difficult to get past MPs. The other big education story was the impact of tuition fees on a resurgent youth vote. Seats with big student populations, such as Canterbury and Portsmouth South, showed huge swings to Labour, suggesting the promise to scrap fees had been a vote-winner. Will the government pause for thought? Will they want to be seen as piling more debt on to a younger generation already facing unaffordable housing and stagnating wages? Also will the new government press ahead with one of the overlooked give-aways in the manifesto - to write off teachers' tuition fees as long as they stay in teaching? If there is another election in the autumn, fees could be an even more topical issue, because that's exactly when fees and interest charges on loans are being increased again. Sean Coughlan is the BBC's education correspondent. The prime minister has made few pronouncements on NHS policy but from the moment she arrived in Downing Street last year she made clear her interest in mental health. It was, Theresa May said at the time and again in a speech in January, a ""burning injustice"" that not enough help was on hand for those suffering mental health problems. Given that the Conservatives' main election campaign health announcement was on mental health, its possible that this might feature in the Queen's Speech. The Tories said they would scrap the 30-year-old Mental Health Act which, they argued, had brought discrimination and injustice with concerns that individuals were held unnecessarily in hospitals and police cells. A new Mental Health Treatment Bill was promised. Mental health charities and professionals welcomed the idea of scrapping the old act but warned that a new bill would need plenty of work on detail and extensive consultation. Theresa May could restate the government's commitment to the plan in the Queen's Speech without being specific about the timing for a bill. Beyond that, health legislation seems unlikely. There is no appetite in Whitehall and the NHS for further system-wide reform. Simon Stevens, head of NHS England, has pushed on with radical plans for joined-up care involving local health and social care leaders. But he says they don't need new legislation. Ministers, aware that trying to push changes through Parliament without a majority will be difficult, are likely to let Mr Stevens get on with it. Hugh Pym is the BBC's health editor. The terror attacks at Manchester Arena and London Bridge changed the course of the election campaign and - together with the Finsbury Park attack on Muslim worshippers- provide the backcloth to the government's law and order priorities. Chief constables have begun putting the case for increased resources, in particular for neighbourhood policing, their arguments strengthened by public support following the heroic actions of officers during the attacks. Indeed, funding issues, with proposals on the way for a new formula for allocating central government cash to the 43 forces in England and Wales, are likely to overshadow proposals for police reform. Those plans - giving more control to police and crime commissioners, allowing outsiders to enter the police at senior ranks and establishing a national infrastructure police force - may have to be eased in gradually. Ministers are expected to reintroduce the Prisons Bill, which was aborted when the election was suddenly called, giving governors more say over the running of jails and bolstering the powers of inspectors. But the immediate challenge is to stabilise prisons, with more staff, improved drug-detection methods and a renewed focus on mental health. Watch out too for an overhaul of probation; a review of the semi-privatised system, brought in by Chris Grayling, should be published very soon. Danny Shaw is a BBC home affairs correspondent.

"How do you break the cycle of offending? Pat, 52, has been in and out of prison for her entire adult life, but now she thinks she can stay out for good. I remember the night before I left prison for the last time so clearly. I was filled with so much anxiety, fear and doubt. I remember being in that cell and not being able to sleep. I had this crazy urge to clean everything - I wanted it to be clean for the next woman that came in there, because I know how it feels to walk into a cell that's dirty and messy, feeling like doom, feeling like your life has ended. So it was really important for me to leave that room clean. Although I was really excited and wanting to go, I was so afraid. I felt really anxious because I'd been there so many times, waiting for that door to open, waiting for them to say: ""Are you ready Pat? It's time to go."" I was wondering what was going to happen to me. Where would I go? Would I stay out this time? I'd been in and out of prison since I was 19. I've lost count of how many sentences, but it must be more than 15. My lifestyle, being on the streets, doing drink and drugs, always led me to going back to prison - and was also the reason my kids went into adoption and foster care. On the morning of my release I was wearing my jeans and I had put my books and stuff in a plastic bag. They came to get me at about 05:30 in the morning. This video can not be played Pat tells Woman's Hour about her last night in prison I got to reception and was released. They gave me my bag and some money - Â£48. Not a lot, it's only intended to tide you over until your benefits get sorted out, and it never lasts very long. But having lived on Â£5.50 a week, it was like winning the lottery! I felt rich. Luckily I wasn't using [drugs] when I left - if I was, it would have been finished in no time and I would have been back to square one. This time, all I wanted to buy was some nice toiletries, nice creams and stuff, because I couldn't afford that while I was in prison. I just wanted to smell like a human being again. All I wanted were some toiletries - I just wanted to smell like a human being again I remember sitting in the waiting room, before we were taken to the gates. That was really nerve-wracking because I was in there with a lot of other women and they were talking about going to get a drink, going to see their boyfriends and having a nice time - some were talking about going to get more drugs. I was listening, thinking: ""That is not what I want. I'm going out there to fight for my life."" I was going out there to start afresh. I was scared as hell. I knew that if there wasn't anyone waiting for me out there I'd be gone. I wouldn't have made it, I wouldn't be here today. At one point I was thinking: ""This is a test - if you go out there and the people who are meant to help are not there to meet you, it's a sign that you are supposed to be an addict for the rest of your life."" In a new series, Woman's Hour is speaking to women about leaving prison. Listen to Sarah as she leaves prison in Durham Listen to Pat's interview in full More on theWoman's Hour website I had tried to get clean before, but always relapsed. Before my last sentence in 2015 I was in supported housing, but I felt very lonely. I felt like I was in this world on my own and no-one really cared. Then I made the mistake of getting in contact with an ex-partner, which was not a good idea. Before I knew it, I was using again - crack cocaine, heroin and alcohol. I felt ashamed and I didn't want to own up to the organisation where I was living, so I stayed away. Before I knew it I was back on the streets of Bristol as a sex worker, something I had always done to support my drug habit.  One night I told another working girl that I was really cold - I didn't have many clothes. ""Come to the van,"" she said. The van was run by an organisation called the One25 project, who work with street sex workers. They had a van that went around the streets, where we could just sit and feel safe for a while. We could wash, we could change our clothes. They used to give us condoms, and, in the winter, woolly hats. They'd feed us sandwiches and crisps and it's such a godsend. When you're out there at night, the little money you get is for your drink or your fix - food was the last thing on my mind, I just wanted the pain to stop. Just to be treated like a human being - not a prostitute - overwhelmed me. They were amazing. They gave me a bit of hope. I get so emotional when I think about what they've done for me. This time when I went to prison, thankfully, I was in Gloucester, where the One25 project comes in on a regular basis and one of the workers recognised me. She said: ""Pat, is that you?"" And I just started crying. I was in such a state that I was wetting the bed and sleeping underneath it. I was in so much pain and fear and I didn't even know what I was afraid of any more. But one fear that I did recognise is that the sentence would end and I would have to go back out there. And I just couldn't face it. The thought of going back out there and standing on a street corner, I just couldn't bear it. Thankfully the day I left prison they were there for me, and we went off for a meal, and damn, did I eat! I had chocolate cake and drinking chocolate - a fluffy drinking chocolate, mind. The day I left prison they were there for me, and we went off for a meal - and damn, did I eat! It was decided I would go into rehabilitation. I didn't think that I would be eligible because I'd been given that opportunity time and time and time again, and it had never worked. I didn't think the government would want to fund someone like me, at my age - I'm 52. But they did. So after our meal they took me to the Nelson Trust, a treatment centre for women who've been through traumatic experiences. I stayed there for six months and it changed my life completely. It's changed the way I think about myself and it's kind of changed my outlook of what I think people think of me. I think the most helpful thing was having that compassion and empathy from another woman who'd had similar experiences. It helped me look in the mirror and not just see a prostitute or a drug addict but actually see a beautiful, strong black woman who's got a lot to give. They loved me until I could love myself. That's something I had never been able to do. Growing up, all I will say is that I was never happy. I never felt right, I always felt the odd one out, the ugly duckling. At 14 I ran away from home. The minute I climbed through that window I stopped being a little girl - I very quickly became an adult, in an adult world. I roamed the streets from the age of 14 to 19. I remember being caught once for shoplifting and they put me in a children's home. I was there for about a week before I ran away with another girl. We roamed around Birmingham before I decided London was the place to be. I had heard so many stories about how in London you could make money, so off I went, and - just my luck - I ran into a pimp. A guy that liked money and liked girls bringing him the money. He had me going round with him while he stole. He taught me how to pickpocket and how to forge. I felt grown up, I felt like I'd arrived: ""This is it, I've hit the big time - make money, drive big flash cars, have nice clothes, this is how it's supposed to be."" At that time I wasn't really into drugs, I was just into drinking and making money. But by 20 I'd picked up my first crack pipe and a drug addict was born. At 21 I got my first sentence - five years, but I got parole. After that, there were only a couple of years when I wasn't in prison. When I got married I lasted three years, but when my marriage broke down I was straight back in prison. As I got older my situation outside was getting worse. I didn't have any real friends, I never had any accommodation, nowhere stable. Then, about 10 years ago, something changed. I saw my daughter. I'd been using drugs and woke up quite sick. I needed some heroin and I decided to go to south London to see how much money I could make. I was at a bus stop when someone tapped me on the back. When I turned around she said she was my daughter. Although I didn't recognise her, she said she recognised me and she'd recognise me anywhere. That was hard. The last time I'd seen my daughter she was small. The lady that tapped me on the shoulder had grown up. She was beautiful, she had her own family and I didn't recognise her. That broke something in me, but I still couldn't stop drinking or using. People think it's easy to stop - it's not. It's a hard journey back to any form of normality. According to the latestMinistry of Justice figures,external, there are close to 4,000 women in prison - a five-year high A Prisons Inspectorate survey found that 38% of women in prison had no accommodation to go to on release Figures for 2010 show that 45% of women leaving prison are reconvicted within one year For women who have served more than 11 custodial sentences the reoffending rate rises to 75% Source:Women in Prison,external I've been out of prison for two years now. I can't believe it - normally I'm back in by now. But I am out in the community, learning to live among people. The best thing is that my kids are back in my life. That's ongoing and will take some time. They're angry, they're hurt, and that's understandable because I've never been there for them. My family have also come back into my life - my mother, my stepdad, my sister. That's something I've never had. This is the first time in 34 years that I've been able to build a relationship with them. It's still very scary but as long as I'm not drinking and using drugs I have a chance. I don't want to go back to prison. I wouldn't survive - it's not about being beaten up or anything like that, I would just go mad. I would never have thought that I would be sitting down in clean clothes, clean underwear, with somewhere safe to go back to. And I'm not in a relationship and that's a big thing for me, because I've been in and out of relationships all my life. I just feel blessed. And I couldn't have done it without the support of all these women - and funnily enough I've always been so scared of women because I felt like such a failure - crap mum, gives up her children for drugs and alcohol, is always in and out of prison, what kind of woman is that? Every day I get stronger. My past doesn't define who I am. I can recover from that life. Yes, I was broken but I'm not unrepairable. With the help and support of other women I'm slowly being repaired and slowly being brought back to life.

"This video can not be played Police arrive after explosion in Brussels central train station Belgian soldiers have shot a man suspected of being a would-be suicide bomber at Brussels Central Station, officials say. He was shot after reportedly setting off a small explosion and no-one else is believed to have been injured. Prosecutors later said the man had died. They are treating the incident as a terrorist attack. In March 2016, 32 people were killed in attacks on Brussels claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group. According to Belgian newspaper La Libre Belgique, quoting prosecutors, the man who was shot was wearing a rucksack and a bomb belt. A photograph taken inside the station showed flames He detonated a device when he attracted the attention of soldiers in the station, the paper says. Brussels marks bomb attacks anniversary Spain links arrests to Brussels attacks Belgium country profile Nicolas Van Herrewegen, a railway sorting agent, said he had gone down to the station's mezzanine level when he heard someone shouting. This video can not be played Nicolas Van Herrewegen saw a man with a suicide belt shout ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is great"" in Arabic) ""Then he cried 'Allahu Akbar' and he blew up a wheeled suitcase,"" he told AFP news agency. ""I was behind a wall when it exploded. I went down and alerted my colleagues to evacuate everyone. He [the suspect] was still around but after that we didn't see him."" ""It wasn't exactly a big explosion but the impact was pretty big,"" he added. ""People were running away."" Armed Belgian police have sealed off the scene Mr Van Herrewegen described the suspect as well-built and tanned with short hair, wearing a white shirt and jeans. ""I saw that he had something on him because I could see wires emerging, so it may have been a suicide vest,"" he said. Lawyer Remy Bonnaffe, 23, was waiting for a train and took a photograph of flames seconds after the explosion. He told Reuters news agency that people close to the explosion appeared unhurt and he saw no obvious damage to nearby walls. ""I'm happy that no-one was injured and that this was basically a failed attempt,"" he said. Arash Aazami arrived at the station just after the explosion. He told the BBC: ""As we entered into the station, we were evacuated loudly by some security personnel. ""Looked around, saw people running in the streets, trying to seek refuge and decided to do the same ourselves."" Police and soldiers guided people to safety outside the station As the station and Grand Place were evacuated, businesses and restaurants were ordered to close and draw down their shutters, RTL radio reports. Metro lines running through the station were also briefly suspended on orders of the police, according to the radio.

"Ellen Higginbottom left a legacy of beauty, love and kindness say her family A man has been charged with the murder of an 18-year-old student whose body was found at a beauty spot. Ellen Higginbottom was found with multiple stab wounds at Orrell Water Park, Wigan early on Saturday. She had been reported missing by her family at 19:20 BST on Friday after failing to return home from college.

She was last seen on Friday at Orrell Water Park, according to friends A 47-year-old Wigan man is being held on suspicion of murder and a man and a woman, both 30 and from Wigan, are being questioned on suspicion of assisting an offender. Friends said Ellen was last seen at the water park. Police found her body at about 02:30 BST on Saturday during a search. Her family have released a tribute to her telling people not to label her killers as ""animals"". They stated:  ""Ellen loved animals and the psychology student in her would tell you it takes the complexity of a human mind to conjure such exquisite evil. ""People have also called for them to be strung up but we've thrown enough stones in rivers while camping for her to tell you that ripples reach the shore. Ellen Higginbottom was reported missing by her family after failing to return home from college ""Innocent people love, or at least loved, these monsters too, and I promise you, she'd also tell you that nobody deserves the pain we feel right now. What's the world coming to? ""Well, if a legacy is planting seeds in a garden you never get to see, then thanks to people like our remarkable Ellen it's coming to beauty and love and kindness."" Her boyfriend Ryan Warren said in a tribute on Facebook she was his ""rock"" who he and his family ""will miss dearly but will hold forever in our hearts"".

"The fires have claimed the lives at least 64 people since Saturday Reports that a firefighting plane crashed during an operation to tackle huge blazes in central Portugal have been denied by the country's civil protection authority. This contradicts earlier reports that a Canadair aircraft went down near the central PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande area. More than 1,000 firefighters on the ground and planes from several countries are battling the fires. The fires have claimed the lives of at least 64 people since Saturday. Many of the victims died in their cars as they tried to escape. More than 130 people have been injured. Portugal fires: Varzeas mourns villagers who fled Civil protection officials have said they expect the blazes to be under control soon, but warn that soaring temperatures are hampering efforts. The week's highest temperatures in the area are expected to reach about 38C (100F) and, together with windy conditions, could reignite fires that have already been brought under control. Wildfires are an annual menace in Portugal.

"This video can not be played Planes grounded at ""too hot"" Phoenix airport As temperatures climb in Phoenix, Arizona, more than 40 flights have been cancelled - because it is too hot for the planes to fly. The weather forecast for the US city suggests temperatures could reach 120F (49C) on Tuesday. That is higher than the operating temperature of some planes. American Airlines announced it was cancelling dozens of flights scheduled to take off from Sky Harbor airport during the hottest part of the day. The local Fox News affiliate in Phoenix said the cancellations mostly affected regional flights on the smaller Bombardier CRJ airliners, which have a maximum operating temperature of about 118F (48C). This video can not be played Firefighting in extreme Arizona heatwave The all-time record for temperatures in Phoenix is just slightly higher, at 122F, which hit on 26 June 1990. The cancelled flights were scheduled to take off between 15:00 and 18:00 local time. At higher temperatures, air has a lower density - it is thinner. That lower air density reduces how much lift is generated on an aircraft's wings - a core principle in aeronautics. That, in turn, means the aircraft's engines need to generate more thrust to get airborne. It's a well-known problem - a 2016 report from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) even warned that higher temperatures caused by climate change could ""have severe consequences for aircraft take-off performance, where high altitudes or short runways limit the payload or even the fuel-carrying capacity"". Those problems are why many countries in the Middle East, and some high-altitude airports in South America, tend to schedule long flights for the evening or night, when it is cooler. How do you get to sleep in hot weather? Portugal fire rages as temperatures soar Why are air combat kills so rare? Bigger aircraft like Boeing 747s and Airbus models have a slightly higher operating temperature, and have not been affected by the heat in Phoenix. An American Airlines statement providedto The Arizona Republic newspaper,externalsaid those jets should be fine up to 126-127F (53C) - just a little higher than what is expected. Those temperatures, however, are forecast for the aptly named Furnace Creek in Death Valley, in California, with some areas expecting new temperature records on Tuesday. The Death Valley National Parks Service has issued a warning to visitors to avoid hiking after 10am, and to ""travel prepared to survive"". Too hot for tennis?

"Police are examining the van used in the attack A man has been arrested on suspicion of posting an offensive Facebook post about the London Finsbury Park attack. Police said a 37-year-old, believed to be the son of an owner of the Rhondda Cynon Taff company whose van wasused in Monday's attack, is in custody. Richard Evans allegedly posted: ""It's a shame they don't hire out steam rollers or tanks could have done a tidy job then."" His father, Lee Evans, said he condemned the remarks. South Wales Police said a 37-year-old man was being held on suspicion of displaying threatening, abusive, insulting written material with intent that is likely to stir up racial hatred. Community's shock at man's arrest Finsbury Park attack: Community holds vigil What we know so far Welsh hire van in mosque terror attack In pictures: Finsbury Park attack Comments made by an account under the name of Richard Gear Evans Facebook, which were then shared by others on Twitter, read: ""Glad I'm not running the van hire the police wouldn't like what my answer would be. ""It's my dad's company I don't get involved it's a shame they don't hire out steam rollers or tanks could have done a tidy job then."" The comments and account profile appear to have since been deleted. Lee Evans said: ""I want to condemn in the strongest possible terms these ill-considered Twitter comments, which in no way reflect my own view or indeed those of anyone else in the family. ""The attack in Finsbury Park was shocking and cowardly. Together with all the staff at Pontyclun Van Hire, I am doing everything I can to assist the Metropolitan Police in their inquiries."" Neighbours said Mr Osborne was friendly and polite Darren Osborne, 47, from Cardiff, is being held on suspicion of the commission, preparation and instigation of terrorism, attempted murder and murder following the incident at Finsbury Park. On Tuesday evening, the Met's counter terrorism unit was given an extension until the early hours of Saturday to question Mr Osborne. The attack in Finsbury Park happened as an ill man was receiving first aid from the public near the mosque, where people had been saying Ramadan night prayers. The van was apparently driven at people who were helping him. Police said they were still trying to establish if there was a link between the man's death and the attack. Mr Osborne's family said they were ""massively shocked"" following his arrest The man died and nine people were taken to three London hospitals, while two others were treated for minor injuries. Witnesses said they heard the driver, who was detained by members of the public before police arrived, shout: ""I am going to kill Muslims."" One of Mr Osborne's neighbours said they thought they had seen him sleeping in a van on Saturday night. South Wales Police confirmed that 24 hours before the London attack it had responded to a 101 call following reports of an ""insecure van"" in the Llanedeyrn area of Cardiff. Officers found a man asleep inside, but no offence had been committed.

"Victims of the Grenfell Tower fire are not being asked to move hundreds of miles from their homes, the team organising the emergency response says. The Grenfell Response Team also said it was not aware any victims were sleeping in parks and denied claims some could be made ""intentionally homeless"". Labour MPs have raised concerns some people are sleeping rough and others being offered housing in Lancashire. It comes as a doctor said some victims will take ""months"" to recover. Fourteen people are still in hospital after the fire, including eight receiving critical care and some in induced comas, NHS England has said. Police have said the number of people dead, or missing presumed dead, currently stands at 79. Labour MP for Kensington, Emma Dent Coad, said the co-ordination of the response to the fire had been ""appalling"", with ""people running around like headless chickens"". She toldBBC Radio 4's The World at Onethat she had heard ""countless reports"" of people who had lost their homes in the fire now sleeping rough. People ""are too scared to come forward because of worries over their immigration status"", she added. It comes as Labour MP for Tottenham, David Lammy, said he had heard victims of the blaze had been ""threatened"" with being declared ""intentionally homeless"". What we know so far Who are the victims? Visual guide to what happened People are made intentionally homeless if they leave accommodation they could have stayed in - meaning their local council does not have to provide them with housing. Mr Lammytweeted,externalthat he had heard survivors could be made intentionally homeless if they turned down accommodation offers - some 200 miles away, in Preston, Lancashire. However, the official Grenfell response team - made up of council and government staff, charity workers, the police and fire service  - rejected the claims. In a statement, the response team said it was not aware of any victims living in parks, that nobody was being forced into accommodation, and people were being homed ""as locally as possible"". Some 138 hotel placements have been made for people living in Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk, it added, while 112 additional residents from the wider area are now in hotels. ""No-one is being forced into housing they don't want. We will continue to work with everyone until we find them an offer of housing that they accept,"" it said. It said people were being ""temporarily housed in hotel accommodation in or close to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea"". More than Â£330,000 of a Â£5m emergency fund has been distributed to the affected families, the response team added. It said 314 people have now received financial assistance, while 40 households have been given a Â£5,000 government payment. The government has offered Â£500 cash payments along with a Â£5,000 bank payment to those affected, as part of a Â£5m emergency fund. A candlelight vigil was held in Westminster on Monday One week on from the fire, King's College Hospital clinical director Duncan Bew said some victims were being kept in an induced coma after the fire. He said staff had expected to see ""hundreds"" of patients with a range of injuries, including burns, smoke inhalation and caused by people ""jumping from windows"". ""We knew there were many more people in the building. As time went on and we realised that we weren't going to receive those casualties, it was very sad,"" he added.

Victoria Vasey, director of North Kensington Law Centre,told BBC Radio 4's The World at Oneit is ""imperative"" people feel safe to come forward. The Home Office told the programme it will ""not use this tragic incident as a reason to carry out immigration checks on those involved"". ""We will not charge people who need to replace documentation that has been lost in the fire,"" it added. Anthony Disson and Ya-Haddy Sisi Saye are among five people to be formally identified by the police Five of the victims have so far been named. Anthony Disson, 65, Ya-Haddy Sisi Saye, 24 - also known as Khadija Saye- Abufars Ibrahim, 39, and Khadija Khalloufi, 52, were identified on Monday. Mohammad Alhajali, 23, was the first victim to be formally identified. Meanwhile, the BBC has learned that four separate government ministers werewarned fire regulations were not keeping people safe. In leaked letters seen by BBC One's Panorama, experts warned that those living in tower blocks like Grenfell Tower were ""at risk"". The Department for Communities and Local Government, which received the letters, said work to improve regulation and safety had already been under way. It comes as police warned the final number of victims from the fire in the 24-storey block could still change. Commander Stuart Cundy said his priority was to identify the people who died in the building and to recover their bodies as quickly as possible.

"An F15E fighter plane shot down the drone near Tanf, in southern Syria, the US military said A US jet has shot down an Iranian-made drone operated by forces backing the Syrian government in the south of the country, American officials say. The drone was thought to be armed and threatening US-led coalition troops on the ground, officials said. But Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the action amounted to ""complicity with terrorism"". The incident comes after the US shot down a Syrian fighter plane on Sunday and another drone earlier this month. The F-15 plane downed the drone around 00:30 on Tuesday (21:30 GMT Monday) north-east of Tanf, an outpost of the US-led coalition, according to a US military statement. The incident underscores the growing tensions in the region as a battle develops for the control of eastern Syria, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says. In another development, the US military announced officially that coalition forces had killed the top cleric of so-called Islamic State (IS), Turki al-Binali, in an air strike in Syria last month. IS supporters have also reported his death. Trump and the battle for eastern Syria Why is there a war in Syria? Why are air combat kills so rare? Military officials who spoke to CNN described it as a Shahed 129,a model unveiled by Iran in 2012. Iranian state TV broadcast footage of the Shahed 129 two years ago It is said by the Iranians to have a range of 2,000km (1,240 miles) and be capable of carrying bombs and missiles. ""They were threatening our forces on the ground,"" the US official quoted by AFP said. ""Their course was on a run toward our folks to drop a munition on them."" The last drone the US says it shot down was alsoreportedly destroyed near Tanfafter firing on coalition forces. Tanf has been used by Western special forces as well as Syrian rebel forces. The Syrian plane destroyed on Sunday, a Su-22 fighter bomber, washit after reportedly dropping bombs near the town of Tabqain Raqqa province. In response, Russia, one of Syria's main allies, announced that US-led coalition warplanes flying west of the River Euphrates would be tracked by Russian anti-aircraft forces in the sky and on the ground and treated as targets It suspended a hotline set up to avoid clashes between US and Russian aircraft in the region. With IS under growing pressure in Raqqa the fight is on for who controls the territory after its demise, our correspondent says. Iranian-backed pro-Syrian regime forces are pushing forward on a number of fronts, and the US is equally eager to resist what it sees as a widening of  Iranian influence. Iran says it attacked IS fighters in eastern Syria with long-range missiles on Sunday. This video can not be played Iranian TV footage of missiles being launched (no sound) So the tensions locally are mounting between the US and pro-regime forces; between the US and the Russians; and more broadly between Washington and Tehran. By accident or design, any one of these sources of friction could prompt a much more significant military encounter, our correspondent adds. Originally from Bahrain, Binali joined IS in 2014 and played a key role within the group acting as its top religious official and offering guidance to its leaders and militants alike, BBC Monitoring reports. US Central Command says he was killed by an air strike on 31 May in the eastern town of Mayadin. IS supporters went online to announce his death.

"Freida Devin, Chloe Stott and Katy Stott celebrated the job news A teenager whose mother was the first baby born on a Loganair plane has become a member of the cabin crew. Chloe Stott, 18, is the daughter of Katy Stott, who was born 2,000ft above Orkney in 1973 on a special air ambulance flight from the island of Stronsay to Kirkwall. The aircraft was only a few minutes into the short flight when Katy's mother Freida Devin gave birth. Chloe said she has always wanted to be a cabin crew attendant. Baby Katy was born on a flight in 1973 Thick fog prevented the aircraft from landing in Kirkwall, and Captain Jamie Bayley had to divert to Aberdeen. The baby was christened Katy Ferguson Leynair Devin, adopting the surname of the late doctor who helped, while inheriting Ley after Captain Bayley and nair from Loganair. Chloe, who has just moved from Orkney to Aberdeen, said: ""I've wanted to be a cabin crew attendant for as long as I can remember. ""It's probably linked to the unusual circumstances in which my mum was born but both of us share this interest. ""My family is originally from Orkney, so it's wonderful to be working for an airline which holds such established roots with the islands and I'm looking forward to working on some of the services operating to Kirkwall."" Mrs Devin, who now lives in Elgin, said: ""It's not how I imagined I'd give birth to my third child. ""I knew I was in capable hands, with everyone doing their best to keep me comfortable for the duration of the flight. ""It was only afterwards that I found out Katy was the first baby to be born on an air ambulance, which is an interesting conversation starter. ""I'm still grateful to everyone who was there to assist me on that summer night, over 40 years ago."" Captain Jamie Bayley with baby Katy Captain Bayley recalled: ""You can imagine the noise and stress in the small Islander cabin leading up to this moment and the huge relief at the birth of a healthy baby. ""We diverted to Aberdeen, which was especially opened for us, duly amended the flight plan to add another soul on board and we were greeted on arrival by police and ambulance.""

"An F15E fighter plane shot down the drone near Tanf, in southern Syria, the US military said A US jet has shot down an Iranian-made drone operated by forces backing the Syrian government in the south of the country, American officials say. The drone was thought to be armed and threatening US-led coalition troops on the ground, officials said. But Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the action amounted to ""complicity with terrorism"". The incident comes after the US shot down a Syrian fighter plane on Sunday and another drone earlier this month. The F-15 plane downed the drone around 00:30 on Tuesday (21:30 GMT Monday) north-east of Tanf, an outpost of the US-led coalition, according to a US military statement. The incident underscores the growing tensions in the region as a battle develops for the control of eastern Syria, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says. In another development, the US military announced officially that coalition forces had killed the top cleric of so-called Islamic State (IS), Turki al-Binali, in an air strike in Syria last month. IS supporters have also reported his death. Trump and the battle for eastern Syria Why is there a war in Syria? Why are air combat kills so rare? Military officials who spoke to CNN described it as a Shahed 129,a model unveiled by Iran in 2012. Iranian state TV broadcast footage of the Shahed 129 two years ago It is said by the Iranians to have a range of 2,000km (1,240 miles) and be capable of carrying bombs and missiles. ""They were threatening our forces on the ground,"" the US official quoted by AFP said. ""Their course was on a run toward our folks to drop a munition on them."" The last drone the US says it shot down was alsoreportedly destroyed near Tanfafter firing on coalition forces. Tanf has been used by Western special forces as well as Syrian rebel forces. The Syrian plane destroyed on Sunday, a Su-22 fighter bomber, washit after reportedly dropping bombs near the town of Tabqain Raqqa province. In response, Russia, one of Syria's main allies, announced that US-led coalition warplanes flying west of the River Euphrates would be tracked by Russian anti-aircraft forces in the sky and on the ground and treated as targets It suspended a hotline set up to avoid clashes between US and Russian aircraft in the region. With IS under growing pressure in Raqqa the fight is on for who controls the territory after its demise, our correspondent says. Iranian-backed pro-Syrian regime forces are pushing forward on a number of fronts, and the US is equally eager to resist what it sees as a widening of  Iranian influence. Iran says it attacked IS fighters in eastern Syria with long-range missiles on Sunday. This video can not be played Iranian TV footage of missiles being launched (no sound) So the tensions locally are mounting between the US and pro-regime forces; between the US and the Russians; and more broadly between Washington and Tehran. By accident or design, any one of these sources of friction could prompt a much more significant military encounter, our correspondent adds. Originally from Bahrain, Binali joined IS in 2014 and played a key role within the group acting as its top religious official and offering guidance to its leaders and militants alike, BBC Monitoring reports. US Central Command says he was killed by an air strike on 31 May in the eastern town of Mayadin. IS supporters went online to announce his death.

"The first two Despicable Me films were hugely successful at the box office - but the forthcoming third instalment finally reveals a long held secret. Gru - the loveable Steve Carrell-voiced character at the centre of the franchise - has a twin brother we never knew about. Dru has a lot more hair than his sibling and is considerably more cheerful - a personality trait which sometimes rubs his brother up the wrong way. But despite that, the pair team up in the film for an adventure we couldn't possibly give you any details of here lest we attract the ire of the spoiler police. The despicable duo join a long list of famous twins. But unlike Jedward, The Proclaimers and Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen, many twin siblings of showbiz figures choose to stay out of the limelight. Here are eight famous faces you might not have known have a twin. Scarlett Johansson is one of Hollywood's most recognisable faces - starring in films such as Lost in Translation and Vicky Cristina Barcelona. But she also has a considerably taller twin brother named Hunter - who often appears alongside her on the red carpet. He spends his time working with charities and helping with political campaigns - and in 2008 he helped to get President Obama elected. Few people know Vin Diesel (whose real name is Mark Sinclair Vincent) has a non-identical twin brother who is also in the entertainment industry. Paul Vincent generally stays out of the limelight, but in 2013, Diesel posted a picture online of his twin brother with the latePaul Walker, his former Fast and Furious co-star, captioning it: ""The two Pauls."" Kiefer Sutherland is an impressive chap. As his most famous role unequivocally proved, he can last a full 24 hours without eating, sleeping or going to the bathroom. But one lesser-known thing about the actor is that he has a twin sister called Rachel, who works as a post-production supervisor. Orange is the New Black star Laverne Cox made history in 2014 when she became the first transgender person to be nominated for an Emmy acting award. Her character in the prison drama, Sophia Burset, is also transgender - and in the first series we saw a flashback to before she transitioned, when she was a firefighter called Marcus. As Cox was relatively unknown at the time - least of all a trans actress - you may have thought some clever make-up was used to make her look like him. But in actual fact, her twin brother - musician M Lamar - was hired to play Marcus in a perfect piece of casting. Ashton Kutcher is well known for Punk'd and The Butterfly Effect, but he also has a twin brother named Michael - who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy as a child and had a heart transplant at 13. ""My brother was born with cerebral palsy and it taught me that loving people isn't a choice and that people aren't actually all created equal,"" the actor explained recently. ""We're all created incredibly inequal to one another, in our capabilities and what we can do and how we think and what we see. But we all have the equal capacity to love one another."" Hey, remember that time in Terminator 2 when the T1000 morphed into a clone of Sarah Connor in an attempt to lure and kill her son, but was stopped at the last minute by the real Sarah Connor turning up and saving the day? Great! Us too. You may have thought that it was done with a bit of CGI help - but it was actually Linda Hamilton's twin sister Leslie who appeared on screen. Usually, when a Hollywood script demands someone who looks exactly like you to appear on screen at the same time, special effects are used. Actors who appeared to have a twin on screen but were actually helped out by some post production techniques include Lisa Kudrow playing Phoebe and Ursula in Friends and Armie Hammer playing the Winklevoss twins in The Social Network. Will Young is one of the UK's most successful contestants to come out of a TV talent show, having won Pop Idol in 2001. But you may not know he also has a twin brother called Rupert. Not to be confused with the Merlin actor Rupert Young, Will's brother mostly avoids the showbiz world. But he would make an excellent red life jackets model, should he ever fancy a career change. Mr Robot star Rami Malek became thefirst minority actorin 18 years to win the Emmy award for best leading actor last September. He also has a twin brother named Sami, who works in Los Angeles as a teacher. Rami and Sami. Amazing.

"Mr Mourinho was Real Madrid's manager between 2010 and 2013 Manchester United manager JosÃ© Mourinho is innocent of tax fraud and had his tax affairs ratified by the Spanish government, according to his advisers. Mr Mourinho was accused by prosecutors of defrauding Spain of â¬3.3m (Â£2.9m; $3.6m) in taxes while he was Real Madrid coach from 2011 to 2012. A prosecutor said Mr Mourinho, 54, did not declare income from image rights in order to get an ""illicit benefit"". A statement released on his behalf said he ""has not received any notification"". The Gestifute Media release added: ""To this date, neither the Spanish tax authorities, nor the public prosecutor have contacted Jose Mourinho or his advisers who were hired for the inspection process."" Why are Spanish football stars in legal trouble? The statement also said Mr Mourinho ""paid more than â¬26m in taxes, with an average tax rate of over 41%"" during the three years until May 2013 and that he ""entered into a settlement agreement"" with the Spanish tax authorities after a change of rules in 2015. Mr Mourinho has been accused of two counts of tax fraud - â¬1.6m in 2011 and â¬1.7m in 2012. The Madrid prosecutor said the case was presented to a local court. Other prominent football figures have been accused of tax fraud in Spain in recent months. Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who played under Mr Mourinho and shares the same agent, is accused of defrauding tax authorities of â¬14.7m, by also hiding his income from image rights. He denies the accusations andis threatening to leave Spain.The Portugal international is set to give evidence in his case on 31 July. Mr Mourinho's advisers published this document from the Spanish tax authorities which they say ""attested that he... was in compliance with all tax obligations"" James Badcock, Madrid-based journalist JosÃ© Mourinho would join a growing list of football stars being investigated and prosecuted in Spain over accusations of tax evasion, in particular in connection with allegedly undeclared income from the sale of image rights by using companies based outside the country. In this way, Lionel Messi has been found guilty of fraud, and Cristiano Ronaldo accused by prosecutors of evading â¬14.7m. Cristiano Ronaldo and JosÃ© Mourinho are both clients of the football agent Jorge Mendes. Other Mendes charges being investigated for alleged tax evasion while playing in La Liga include Ricardo Carvalho, Ãngel Di Maria and Radamel Falcao. All are accused of using a similar system, whereby their image rights were owned by companies registered in the British Virgin Islands or Panama, and which allegedly received money from intermediaries based in Ireland. A statement released by Mr Mendes' company Gestifute last week, countering reports that he was being investigated alongside Radamel Falcao, said that the Portuguese agent did ""not participate or offer any services related directly or indirectly with financial, tax or legal consulting for his clients"". Other footballers have been accused of tax fraud in Spain: Barcelona and Argentina footballerLionel Messiwas handed a 21-month suspended jail term. His father Jorge, who manages his finances, was also convicted Barcelona defenderJavier Mascherano- also an Argentine - admitted tax fraud, escaping a jail term with a one-year suspended sentence Barcelona and Brazilian starNeymaris facing allegations of corruption and fraud over his transfer to the Spanish club in 2013 - a case which also involves his parents.

"With the need for more housing, developers are moving in to build on top of former landfill sites. But how safe are these places, and should people be concerned about living on top of them? The UK dumps nearly 50 million tonnes of industrial, commercial and domestic waste into landfill sites every year - enough rubbish to fill Wembley Stadium to the brim more than 50 times over. The process is tightly regulated. Meticulous records are kept of what we dump and where we dump it. But landfill hasn't always been this well managed - and Britain's appetite in years gone by for filling huge holes in the ground with waste is beginning to haunt us. There are 20,000 former landfill sites across the UK - 1,200 of them are on England's coastline. File on 4 has had exclusive access to an unpublished report commissioned by the Environment Agency, looking at these sites and the impact of flooding and coastal erosion. Prof Kate Spencer from Queen Mary University of London led the investigation and has now raised serious concerns about the impact not only on the environment - but on public health. Historic landfill sites buried underground are being exposed by coastal erosion One example can be found on Clinker Beach in East Tilbury, along the foreshore of the River Thames in Essex, where a layer of old clothes and plastics hangs out of a muddy bank. The spot has become a popular spot for treasure hunters. ""You see people rummaging through it, picking up bits of material and taking them home. Certainly I wouldn't touch any of this without gloves,"" says Kate. ""Here on the floor you can see these little black cylinders - they're the cells from inside old batteries and we know that batteries used to contain lead and mercury. We've analysed the waste and it contains pretty much all the nasty chemicals that you can think of at concentrations that would be predicted to cause significant ecological harm."" She says it would cost billions of pounds to clean up all the sites so it is important to identify which pose the biggest threat. ""We need to come up with some suitable management scenarios. The ultimate responsibility either lies with the local authority or with the Environment Agency but I don't think they have the resources to deal with it."" Barry Falgate, site manager at Dunbar landfill In 1990, the Environmental Protection Act set out a regime for regulating and licensing the disposal of controlled waste. One site in Dunbar, on the east coast of Scotland, handles 5,000 tonnes of waste every week from Edinburgh, which is around 30 miles away. ""Before we put any waste in, we put in a metre of engineered clay,"" explains site manager Barry Falgate. ""Then it's lined with a heavy duty plastic, then gravel on top, which catches the water which comes from the waste as it degrades. ""Then, when we've finished, we put plastic over the top and then we put soils on it. We have the aftercare of this site for at least 60 years, so we want to make sure that that waste is safe and we can control the waters and gases out of it. I was brought up around here so I care what we do."" The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs used to offer grants to local authorities to clean up contaminated land, via the Contaminated Land Capital Projects (CLCP) programme. This funding stream came to an end in March this year. Prof Kate Spencer says managing former landfill sites is essential In Amber Valley in Derbyshire battle lines are being drawn, where a developer wants to build 200 homes on a former landfill site. ""My mum stopped growing vegetables because of what was under the ground here,"" says campaigner Kellie Judson. ""We used to get foul smells on my mum's garden when I was a little girl - a TCP smell and an eggy smell."" Amber Valley Rugby Club now occupies the former landfill site - but they've been offered brand new facilities by the developer if they move. Underground testing has shown that remedial work could make the area safe, but Kellie and other residents are worried about an adjacent former landfill which contains known hazardous waste. ""We're concerned that contamination from the other site could potentially leach on to this one - that disturbing the ground in this area could pose a threat to people living locally,"" she says. Kellie Judson is leading the campaign against 200 new homes near a hazardous landfill site The development has twice been turned down by the planning board of Amber Valley Borough Council and it goes before the planning inspectorate next month. Whether it goes ahead or not, little will be done to further risk assess the surrounding area unless something new emerges, because government guidelines don't demand it. The deputy leader of the council, Trevor Ainsworth, supports the development plans. ""There are things in the ground that, on the face of it, would be dangerous to human health. However I know it can be remediated and made safe. It is one of our policies that we regenerate land that has been used as tips - lots of houses now have been built safely on old tips,"" he says. President of Amber Valley Rugby Club, Steve Evans, is backing the development, which includes plans for new pitches and changing rooms for the club A spokesman for Defra told the BBC: ""Our revised Statutory Guidance means more resource can be directed to those sites most in need and allows local authorities to take a more stringent, risk-based approach when identifying and cleaning up contaminated land."" The Local Government Association said: ""Councils take this issue very seriously and work closely with the Environment Agency, continuing to monitor sites long after they have closed.""

"This video can not be played Donald Trump says the US will 'handle' North Korea US President Donald Trump has called North Korea a ""brutal regime"" after the death of a US student who had been jailed there for more than 15 months. North Korea returned Otto Warmbier, 22, to the US last week, saying he had been in a coma for a year and that it was acting on humanitarian grounds. His parents said he had been subjected to ""awful torturous mistreatment"". Mr Warmbier, who was jailed for trying to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel, did not regain consciousness. Is visiting North Korea too risky? How harsh is prison in North Korea? How did Otto Warmbier's holiday end in his death? Mr Trump said that a ""lot of bad things happened"" to Mr Warmbier, but added: ""At least we got him home to be with his parents, where they were so happy to see him, even though he was in very tough condition."" President Trump said Mr Warmbier's death had deepened his administration's resolve ""to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency"". ""The United States once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim."" South Korea's President Moon Jae-in told CBS News on Tuesday it was ""quite clear"" that North Korea had ""a heavy responsibility in the process that led to Mr Warmbier's death"". Mr Warmbier was jailed for trying to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel Mr Warmbier's parents, Fred and Cindy, said in a statement that their son had died at 14:20 local time (18:20 GMT) on Monday at the Cincinnati hospital where he had been receiving treatment. They said he had ""completed his journey home"". They wrote: ""When Otto returned to Cincinnati late on June 13, he was unable to speak, unable to see and unable to react to verbal commands. ""He looked very uncomfortable - almost anguished. Although we would never hear his voice again, within a day, the countenance of his face changed - he was at peace. He was home, and we believe he could sense that."" This video can not be played Mr Warmbier, fourth from right, is seen shortly before his arrest They also said: ""The awful torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured that no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today."" The company Mr Warmbier travelled with, China-based company Young Pioneer Tours, has announced it will no longer take visitors from the US to the country. North Korea said Mr Warmbier had contracted botulism, a rare illness that causes paralysis, soon after his trial in March 2016. He was given a sleeping pill and had been in a coma ever since. But a team of doctors assessing him in Cincinnati said they had found ""no sign of botulism"". Mr Warmbier had suffered a ""severe neurological injury"" of unknown cause, the US doctors said, leading to an extensive loss of brain tissue. This video can not be played Otto Warmbier's father, wearing his son's jacket, told reporters last week his son had been treated ""brutally"" Mr Warmbier could open his eyes but showed no sign of response to communication. They said the most likely cause, given Mr Warmbier's young age, was cardiopulmonary arrest that had cut the blood supply to the brain. The BBC's Steve Evans in Seoul says the North Korean account clearly cannot be taken at face value. He says it is not known when Mr Warmbier had fallen into his coma and that there must be a suspicion it was quite recently, as the US was only told at the beginning of this month about his health situation. The North Koreans may have realised there was the possibility of an American citizen dying on their hands, our correspondent says. Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, who has helped free other Americans in North Korea, said he had met North Korean envoys 20 times during Mr Warmbier's incarceration and on no occasion was his health mentioned. He called for the release of the three US citizens still held in North Korea: Kim Dong-chul, a 62-year-old naturalised US citizen born in South Korea, who wassentenced to 10 years hard labourin April 2016 for spying Korean-American professor Kim Sang-duk (or Tony Kim) who was detained in April 2017. The reasons for his arrest are not yet clear Kim Hak-song, like Kim Sang-duk, worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) and wasdetained in May 2017on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" against the state There are also six South Korean citizens being held. Mr Trump was criticised in May when he said he would be ""honoured"" to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong-un at the ""appropriate"" time. 30 Dec 2015 - Mr Warmbier travels from Beijing to Pyongyang with a tour group 2 Jan 2016 - He is arrested at Pyongyang International Airport as he tries to leave the country. Later that month, North Korea announces it is holding Mr Warmbier for a ""hostile act"" 16 March 2016 - Mr Warmbiergoes on trial in Pyongyangwhere he confesses to stealing a propaganda poster, and is sentenced to 15 years of hard labour. North Korea says he slipped into a coma shortly after his trial Early June 2017 - US officials and Mr Warmbier's parents are told about his condition 13 June 2017 - He is released from North Korea and medically evacuated to the US.

"There's no way of knowing for sure how different types of people voted on 8 June - it's a private ballot, after all - but that doesn't stop polling companies giving it a go. Here are some of the things their surveys have been saying: According to a newly released study by Ipsos Mori, age was the the biggest dividing factor in this election since it began its estimates in 1979. YouGov agrees, calling age the ""new dividing line in British politics"". Both companies, and Lord Ashcroft's exit poll, found Labour did better among under 50s, and the Tories with older voters. According to Ipsos Mori, the 25 to 34 age group was where Labour got the biggest swing from the Conservatives. To illustrate its ""dividing line"" point, YouGov said Labour was 47 percentage points ahead among 18 and 19-year-olds - with the Conservatives 50 ahead among over 70s. Plenty has been said about this - see the BBC'sReality Check verdict here- and YouGov and Ipsos Mori agree that turnout among under 24s went up. According to Ipsos Mori, it increased by 16 percentage points from 2015 to 54%, although it warned that its turnout estimate should be treated with caution. Despite the apparent increases in turnout among young people, Ipsos Mori and YouGov both agreed that older people were still considerably more likely to vote. YouGov estimated the turnout among over 70s at 84%. A university education looks like an indicator as to how someone might have voted on 8 June. ""While the Conservatives' support decreases the more educated a voter is, the opposite was true for Labour and the Lib Dems,"" YouGov said. ""Alongside age, education has become one of the key electoral demographic dividing lines."" Ipsos Mori gave the Tories a whopping 17-point lead among people with no qualifications - and a seven point lead with voters educated to below degree level. But it said Labour had a 15-point lead among graduates (YouGov gave Labour a 17-point lead here). According to YouGov, class is ""no longer a very good indicator of voting intention"", finding little difference among the different socio-economic groupings between the two largest parties. In a reversal of the traditional class divide in British politics, Ipsos Mori found: ""The middle classes swung to Labour, while working classes swung to the Conservatives."" It's only two years since the last general election - and the Tories and Labour both kept 90% of their 2015 voters, Ipsos Mori says. Lord Ashcroft had this as 83% for Labour and 82% for the Tories. But only half of the Lib Dems' voters from last time around stayed with the party, Ipsos Mori said (more on this below). That was a finding from Ipsos Mori, which said Labour's lead here increased by six points to 54 points. Turnout among black and minority ethnic voters also increased by six points since 2015, it said. This was despite aconcerted effortby the Conservatives to close the gap with Labour. Remainers in last year's referendum tended to back Labour, Leavers the Tories. Labour led the Conservatives by 47% to 33% among Remainers - while the Conservatives beat Labour by 46% to 39% among Leavers, Ipsos Mori said. Lord Ashcroft found that just over two-thirds of people who voted Tory on 8 June had backed Leave a year earlier - two thirds of Labour voters voted for Remain. No great surprise here. YouGov found the most pro-Conservative readership was the Daily Telegraph, followed by the Express and the Mail, all titles that backed Theresa May's party. Guardian readers were most likely to back Labour followed by the Mirror's. The Lib Dems' vote share was only slightly down from 2015 - but as mentioned above, Ipsos Mori said  only half of the party's 2015 voters stayed with them this time. Where did the rest come from? Roughly the same number of Labour and Tories, says Ipsos Mori. But despite this ""significant churn"", the demographic profile of Lib Dems voters is ""little changed"", it said. YouGov interviewed,external52,615 adults between June 9 and 13. Ipsos Mori interviewed 7,505 adults between 21 April and 7 June. It weighted the results according to the actual results for each region. Lord Ashcroft surveyed,externalover 14,000 people on polling day who had already cast their vote.

"Journalist Lipika Pelham lives close to the Finsbury Park mosque, is a member of the local synagogue, and is accustomed to seeing girls in hijabs acting in the Nativity Play at her children's school. On Monday evening, nearly 24 hours after the van attack a few yards away, she was one of hundreds handing flowers to Muslim worshippers as they entered the mosque to pray. A sea of roses - pink, yellow, white and red - symbolised multicultural London. People's faces were glowing in the evening sun. These non-Muslims, mostly from the area, were offering roses to Muslim worshippers. A man in a Muslim skullcap and long white robe accepted a bouquet from a young Londoner in shorts and a sleeveless top. I stopped an Orthodox Jew in a black hat, Hananja Fisher, and asked him what brought him there. He pointed to his eyes. ""My tears. This is all too familiar to us Jews, such attacks."" I had received a message telling me about the rose-giving event from my female rabbi, Shulamit Ambalu, as I was talking to a Somali neighbour who had been in the mosque when the attack took place. Muhubo Barre always struck me as an extraordinary woman, raising 10 children in London, with a husband often away on business in Somalia. Her girls, wearing long Muslim robes and hijabs, would whizz past my house on scooters and bicycles on the way to school. Muhubo had been at the mosque when the attack occurred, during a break after the first prayer session. People poured out on to the street, but the imam - who went on to stop the crowd beating up the alleged attacker - urged them back inside, in case other assailants appeared. She went in and prayed that her older sons, who are 24 and 21, were safe. She heard that Salah, a friend of the family whose child is in year one at the local primary school where her younger children are pupils, was among those seriously injured. ""We finished the second prayer very quickly,"" she says. ""I walked home at 2:10am on my own. I was advised not to, but I wasn't afraid. Why should I be? The attacker has no community, he's a lone crazy man, whereas I have one."" By ""community"" she meant not only fellow Muslims, but neighbours like me, a British Bengali married to a white British man. Muhubo arrived in the UK in the 1990s from the autonomous region of Jubaland in south Somalia, as it became engulfed by a civil war which would leave Islamist militants largely in control. She acknowledges that the Finsbury Park mosque went through ""difficult times"" under the radical cleric, Abu Hamza, from 1997 to 2004, but says tensions have evaporated in recent years. On Saturday a ""More in common"" event was held at the Muslim Welfare House to commemorate the death of the MP Jo Cox, who in her maiden speech to Parliament famously said of her Batley and Spen constituency: ""We are far more united and have far more in common with each other than things that divide us."" This applies just as well to Finsbury Park. Last weekend Rabbi Shulamit was a guest at the mosque for Iftar, the breaking of the fast after nightfall during Ramadan. She found that she was simply able to walk in, without passing through any security checks - which are now routine at British synagogues. Rabbi Shulamit Ambalu, pictured recently with other faith leaders near London Bridge The imam initially assumed she was a Muslim worshipper, and invited to join the other women downstairs - she was amused, because the same would happen at any Orthodox synagogue. Then he realised his mistake and invited her to join him at the multi-faith Iftar. When she left the mosque she walked out into a warm summer night, just as large numbers of worshippers were arriving to pray. ""It felt like Jerusalem,"" she says. ""That sense of anticipation, holiness, the excitement of a festival night. The sense of the closeness and also the differences between us, and how at times that very junction of similarity and difference can be so creative and also so uncertain. I simply felt at home."" I remember all too well the times when Finsbury Park would be in the news, if not for football hooliganism spreading out from Arsenal's stadium, then for the extremism preached by Abu Hamza. In 1998, I sent a frivolous invitation to a party at our house to two of Abu Hamza's henchmen, including Omar Bakri Mohammed, who went on to head the al-Qaeda-affiliated group, al-Muhajiroun. I never imagined that they would ring my doorbell. I opened the door in my short dress with a glass of champagne, which I offered to the men. Omar Bakri Mohammed declined both the champagne and my outstretched hand. We had a chat in the hallway. The men never ventured into my living room, possibly because people were dancing there.  When they left, after about 20 minutes, I explained who the two guests had been - sending a shockwave through the party. Things have come such a long way since then. When I asked Muhubo Barre's eldest son, Ayub, 24, about Sunday night's attack, he said it had taken him a while to grasp that it could have been racially or religiously motivated. The idea seemed so strange. ""I didn't feel being Muslim in Finsbury Park, in London, was ever an issue,"" he said. ""I believe as a community we'll get through this."" Despite the recent tragic events - Manchester, London Bridge, Finsbury Park - I left the roses ceremony in an upbeat mood.

However, by early afternoon on Tuesday it was 27C in Bristol, 30C in Chivenor and 30C in Hampton Water Works. And excessive heat should be seen in its proper context.

"Barclays and four former executives have been charged with fraud over their actions in the 2008 financial crisis. The Serious Fraud Office case relates,externalto the way the bank raised billions of pounds from Qatari investors enabling it to avoid a government bailout. Former chief executive John Varley is one of the four ex-staff who will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 3 July. Barclays says it is considering its position and awaiting further details. ""The charges arise in the context of Barclays' capital raisings in June and November 2008. Barclays awaits further details of the charges from the SFO,""the bank said in a statement.,external It is the first time criminal charges related to the financial crisis have been brought against a bank in the UK. Q&A: Why has Barclays been charged with fraud? Barclays charged with fraud in Qatar case Simon Jack's blog: Why Barclays came under SFO fire Mr Varley, former senior investment banker Roger Jenkins, Thomas Kalaris, a former chief executive of Barclays' wealth division, and Richard Boath, the ex-European head of financial institutions, have all been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud in the June 2008 capital raising. In addition, Mr Varley and Mr Jenkins have also been charged with the same offence in relation to the October 2008 capital raising and with providing unlawful financial assistance. Mr Jenkins will ""vigorously defend"" himself against the charges, his lawyer has told Reuters. ""As one might expect in the challenging circumstances of 2008, Mr Jenkins sought and received both internal and external legal advice on each and every topic covered by the SFO's accusations,"" said Brad Kaufman from American firm Greenberg Traurig. Mr Boath, who last year took Barclays to an employment tribunal on the grounds of wrongful dismissal, also pledged to defend himself. He said in a statement: ""The SFO's decision to charge me is based on a false understanding of my role and the facts. I was not a decision-maker and had no control over what the bank did in 2008."" John Varley would for most have been an unlikely choice as the first former bank chief executive to face criminal charges over the events of the financial crisis. Avuncular, calm, Mr Varley was one of the City's patricians, often portrayed - rightly or not - as a check on Barclays' hard-charging investment bank, led by Bob Diamond. Now, along with the bank he once led, he faces two types of charges, both of which relate to fundraisings from Qatar in 2008. The first charge, conspiracy to commit fraud, relates to ""advisory"" fees paid to Qatar. The second - ""unlawful assistance"" - could be more serious. It relates to a Â£2bn loan advanced to Qatar after the fundraisings were negotiated, the implication being that there was a money-go-round at work - Barclays was handing Qatar some of the money it was using to support the British bank. John Varley, aged 61, was chief executive at Barclays between 2004 and 2011. Roger Jenkins, 61, was the executive chairman of investment banking and investment management in the Middle East and North Africa. Thomas Kalaris, 61, was chief executive of Barclays wealth and investment management. Richard Boath, 58, was European head of financial institutions group. Barclays took Â£12bn from Qatar in 2008, as banks scrambled to avoid nationalisation. The SFO looked into payments made to Qatar at that time and afterwards. It also investigated whether those payments were correctly disclosed and if they might have been an inducement to Qatar to support the British bank. The emergency funds allowed Barclays to avoid a government bailout in 2008 at a time when rivals Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland were forced to rely on a taxpayer rescue. This video can not be played Lord Myners tells Today Barclays charge is ""very, very significant"" The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has also reopened its probe into the deal and is understood to be reviewing new evidence which could prompt it to reconsider a Â£50m fine against the banking giant four years ago. The FCA imposed the penalty after finding that Barclays had failed to disclose the arrangements and fees it paid to the Qatari investors, but Barclays contested the fine and it was put on hold while the SFO conducted its investigation.

He also mentions how the town of Birdsville ""nudges the 50C mark"". However, a few people commenting on that same story have offered a more understanding point of view. Lawton Rose points out that ""the UK is just not built for this sort of weather"", while Australian Daniel Richardson also posted that hot weather feels like ""a different kind of heat when you live in an old city designed to mostly just handle cold"". Perhaps those Aussies with scathing views of Brits sweltering in the heat are grumpy because it's their winter right now. Just take a look at Bondi Beach. Meanwhile, in much of the UK...

"Charles Henderson found he still had smartphone access to his old car even though he'd sold it Charles Henderson loved his ""awesome"" convertible, particularly the fact that he could start, lock and unlock it remotely via his mobile phone. It was one of the first connected cars that synchronise wirelessly with smartphones for entertainment and work purposes. But after he sold the vehicle, he was astonished to discover that he could still control it using the associated smartphone app. ""I could have found out where the car was, unlocked it remotely, started it and driven off with it,"" he tells the BBC. Mr Henderson, from Austin, Texas, is global head of X-Force Red, IBM's offensive security group, so he knows a thing or two about security. He tests companies' defences, both physical and digital. ""We try to think like a criminal without actually acting like one,"" he says. ""It's the coolest job in the world."" So before selling his car back to the dealer he was sure to carry out a factory reset and wipe any personal data from the car's onboard computer. He didn't want the new owner getting access to his calendar, contacts and phone records. He then bought a new connected car made by the same manufacturer and was amazed when his old car still appeared alongside his new car on the app. ""These IoT [internet of things] devices are really smart but they're not smart enough to know that you've sold them,"" he says. The modern cliche is that cars are becoming smartphones on wheels ""I informed the car dealership but they didn't know how to handle this. So we went to the car manufacturer and it took a while before they took it seriously. They found it really difficult to cut off access."" The issue of personal data being left behind in devices we rent or own poses a serious risk - hackers could get access to it and use it for blackmail purposes or to steal our money using cloned identities. ""When they rent a car, many drivers sync their phones to the onboard Bluetooth without thinking that the data will stay in the car's computer. And they won't even think about clearing it before handing it back,"" says Mr Henderson. ""Yet they could be revealing sensitive corporate or private data unwittingly."" Ian Fogg, principal analyst at research firm IHS Markit, says: ""Your smartphone is now the hub for a range of experiences, whether that's in your connected car or your smart home. ""So it's a really critical to protect your data, and when selling it - or the devices it has synced with - to make sure all personal information is thoroughly removed from it."" Richard Stiennon is chief strategy officer for Blancco Technology Group, a company that specialises in data erasure. He admits that deleting this data is easier said than done. ""Simply going into a car's settings and deleting your phone from the list of previously paired Bluetooth devices does not guarantee that this will overwrite the data on the car's storage device,"" Mr Stiennon says. ""It will only prevent casual hackers like the next renter from seeing it. A better option is to overwrite all user data or perform a factory reset - if the vehicle allows it - to ensure the data is 100% erased and cannot be recovered."" If celebrities like Kim Kardashian sync their phones with cars, could hackers target their data ? Erasing data from a connected car is more difficult to do than on laptops, removable drives and mobiles. When you think about all the different car makes and models, each with their own operating systems and apps, syncing with so many different phone types, which also have their own versions of operating systems, complexity and lack of standards is the order of the day. Toby Poston, director of communications and external relations for the BVRLA (British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association) says: ""Each individual has the responsibility for making sure that their data is erased, but car makers could make it easier. ""Our members manage millions of hire cars and company cars and we would like to see all manufacturers introduce a 'data cleanse' button to their vehicles as well as enabling this to be done remotely."" There are also cyber-security, as well as data protection, issues. 'How foul-mouthed hackers messed up my life' Could you cope with smartphone rationing? Are Google, Amazon and others getting too big? How Facebook's tentacles reach further than you think More Technology of Business features,external ""If the driver's mobile network is infected with malware, it could access private information and copy it back to the car's infotainment system,"" says Mr Stiennon. ""This could lead to sensitive information like financial details, social security numbers and usernames and passwords being accessed and potentially breached."" It's also possible that an infected car could pass on the infection to your phone. The data we share with our cars has value, which is why there is sucha battle raging over who should control it and have access to it. Mr Stiennon cites the recent case ofthree employees of Enterprise-Rent-A-Car in the UK who stole the details of tens of thousands of the company's customers,externaland sold the data on to ""ambulance-chasing"" accident claims companies. As our cars become more connected do you know what data you're sharing with them? So the next time you hire a connected car it might be worth asking the rental provider what data removal options they provide and whether they can give you written proof that your personal data has been successfully and totally erased. ""When I resell my car, the manufacturer isn't involved in the exchange so isn't focused on the second user experience,"" says IBM's Mr Henderson. ""Although they are beginning to take this issue more seriously, it has to be everyone in the industry - not just the major players. The roads are not brand specific."" A report into Connected and Autonomous Vehicles,external(CAVs) commissioned by the UK's Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders concluded that ""the collection and use of data by CAVs is not a matter of significant concern for consumers. But how do we know consumers don't seem that bothered simply because they don't yet understand the implications? ""What happens when you get ransomware on your car and you can't drive to work that day?"" warns Mr Henderson. What indeed.

"The van driver ploughed into the back of a heavy goods vehicle east of Calais A driver was killed when a van crashed into lorries that had been forced to stop on a motorway near Calais by a makeshift barrier set up by migrants. The van, registered in Poland, burst into flames. The driver's identity is not yet known. Nine Eritreans were found in one of the lorries and taken into police custody. In 2016, the so-called Jungle migrant camp at Calais was closed, but hundreds of people have returned to the area in the hope of reaching the UK. Roadblocks, often built from tyres or rocks, were regularly placed on the A16 motorway leading to the port of Calais before the camp was dismantled in October. Migrants aimed to slow lorries down as they approached the port in the hope of climbing on board. Migrants 'cleared from Jungle camp' What next after the Jungle? AnEritrean man was killedin an accident involving a British motorist in October. But no further incidents had been reported on the A16 until late last month. The crash in the early hours of Tuesday was described as the first fatality involving a driver. Two lorries were forced to stop when tree trunks were placed in the road near Guemps, 12km (8 miles) east of Calais, at around 03:45 local time (01:45 GMT), local media said. The van was unable to brake in time and ran into the back of them. The driver died at the scene. Police said the nine Eritreans were being questioned on suspicion of manslaughter. Several hundred migrants are living in the Calais area in poor conditions. Some 7,000 had lived at the Jungle camp before it was dismantled.

"This video can not be played Mark Carney: UK wage growth ""anaemic"" The time is not right for an interest rate rise, Bank of England governor Mark Carney has said. Wage growth is falling, and the impact of Brexit on the economy is unclear, Mr Carney said in a speech at Mansion House in London. The pound fell sharply after Mr Carney's comments. Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond called for a smooth Brexit to avoid a ""cliff edge"" for businesses as the UK leaves the European Union. Kamal Ahmed: Carney and Hammond join forces on Brexit risk In his Mansion House speech, Mr Carney said: ""From my perspective, given the mixed signals on consumer spending and business investment, and given the still subdued domestic inflationary pressures, in particular anaemic wage growth, now is not yet the time to begin that adjustment [rate rises]. ""In the coming months, I would like to see the extent to which weaker consumption growth is offset by other components of demand, whether wages begin to firm, and more generally, how the economy reacts to the prospect of tighter financial conditions and the reality of Brexit negotiations."" As Brexit negotiations unfold, the UK economy will be influenced by the expectations of domestic consumers, firms, and markets about any transition period and what will happen in the longer term, Mr Carney said. He said companies on both sides of the Channel may ""soon need to activate contingency plans"". ""Before long, we will all begin to find out the extent to which Brexit is a gentle stroll along a smooth path to a land of cake and consumption,"" he said. Following Mr Carney's comments, the pound fell about 0.4% against the dollar to trade at $1.2682. The Bank governor warned that monetary policy, which is controlled by the Bank of England, ""cannot prevent the weaker real income growth likely to accompany the transition to new trading arrangements with the EU"". But he said the Bank's policy could influence how ""the hit to incomes is distributed between job losses and price rises"". Meanwhile, in his speech at Mansion House, Mr Hammond outlined priorities for a ""Brexit for Britain"", including a comprehensive free trade agreement for goods and services. He said the UK and the EU needed to negotiate ""mutually beneficial transitional arrangements to avoid unnecessary disruption and dangerous cliff edges"" from Brexit. The chancellor added that the UK needed ""frictionless customs arrangements"", especially on the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. He said the UK would ""almost certainly need an implementation period, outside the Customs Union itself, but with current customs border arrangements remaining in place, until new long-term arrangements are up and running"". Mr Hammond added that the negotiations need to take a ""pragmatic approach"" to the export of UK financial services, and he warned against ""protectionist agendas"" dressed up as arguments about supervisory oversight. However, he said there were also legitimate concerns, such as those raised by the European Commission about euro clearing. Last week the EU revealed a draft law that would give it the powerto move the lucrative euro clearing business out of Londonand keep it in the EU. Mr Carney echoed Mr Hammond's comments, saying that ""fragmentation of such global markets by jurisdiction or currency would reduce the benefits of central clearing.""

"Sir Vince said only the Lib Dems had a ""consistent and principled"" stance on Europe Sir Vince Cable says he is a candidate to become Liberal Democrat leader. The former business secretary, who has served as deputy leader and acting leader in the past, is throwing his hat into the ring after Tim Farron said he would stand down this summer. Sir Vince, 74, has been a senior figure in the party for over 20 years and won his Twickenham seat back at the election. Another ex-minister, Jo Swinson, has become deputy leader. Ms Swinson, who had been tipped for the top job butruled herself out last week, was elected unopposed as deputy after the deadline for applications passed at 17:00 BST. Lib Dem leadership: Runners and riders Swinson out of Lib Dem leadership contest Other possible leadership candidates include ex-ministers Norman Lamb and Sir Ed Davey. Announcinghis candidacy on the Lib Dem Voice website,,externalSir Vince said the ""political winds"" were moving in the party's direction and it could become a ""credible contender"" for power, with the Conservatives ""in disarray"" and Labour still lacking economic credibility. ""There is a big space in British politics which I am determined that we should occupy,"" he wrote. ""I am ready to commit my energy, enthusiasm and experience to the task of leading the Liberal Democrats through what will be a period of chronic uncertainty. With the prospect of another election looming large, we must be ready for the fight."" The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said Sir Vince, currently the party's economic spokesman, is likely to stress his economic background and his ministerial experience after five years serving in the coalition government. Sir Vince has said he will continue with the Lib Dems' call for a fresh referendum on any Brexit deal. He told Lib Dem Voice. ""We must fight for the British public to have a final say on the government's deal with a chance to stay in the EU if the deal is not good enough. To achieve this, we will need to work with like-minded people in other parties."" Sir Vince started his political career as a Labour councillor in the 1970s before defecting to the SDP and subsequently joining the Lib Dems. He served as deputy leader between 2006 and 2010 and as acting leader for several months after Menzies Campbell's resignation in 2007. Lord Campbell, who was 66 at the time, cited his age as one of the reasons for standing down. But Sir Vince told BBC Radio 5 Live that experience was a virtue, pointing out that William Gladstone had become prime minister for the last time when he was 82. ""Some of the brightest and most interesting people in British politics recently have been relatively old,"" he told the Adrian Chiles show. ""You remember Bernie Sanders in America as well... I don't feel old, I feel young and energetic and I'm very much up for a contest."" Sir Ed Davey, who also won his seat back after being defeated in 2015, said he would be announcing his intentions later this week. He told the BBC that a ""lot of people"", including his wife, had been encouraging him to run. The party is looking for a new leader after Mr Farron said he could no longer reconcile his Christian faith with his responsibilities as leader of a progressive political party.

"Shafa is only 16 but has already endured a forced marriage and a miscarriage In Sri Lanka the legal marriage age is 18, but under a decades-old community law, much younger Muslim girls can get married. As calls grow for this law to be amended, BBC Sinhala's Saroj Pathirana meets one young girl forced to marry against her will. When Shafa* was 15, she was forced to get married. ""While studying for exams, I fell in love with a boy,"" Shafa said, tears running down her cheeks. ""My parents did not like it. They sent me to my uncle's place. While I was studying there, a regular visitor told my aunt and uncle that he wanted to marry me."" Shafa, who comes from a Muslim family and lives in a remote village in Sri Lanka, refused. She wanted to marry the boy she loved, after completing her secondary school education. But despite her objections, her uncle and aunt arranged for her to marry their friend. Whenever she objected to the marriage, she was beaten. Her uncle and aunt even threatened to kill themselves if she did not listen to them. ""I cut my arms as there was no other option,"" said Shafa, pulling up her sleeves to show the scars. ""I also took some pills from my uncle's place. ""While I was being treated in hospital, they bribed the doctors and took me - together with my saline bottle - to a private hospital. A few days later they forced me to marry that man."" This video can not be played 'I cut my arm and said I don't want this marriage' Shafa decided to stay with her young husband as she could see no escape but he suspected she was continuing her relationship with her boyfriend. ""He regularly beat me,"" she said. ""When I told him that I was pregnant, he picked me up and threw me to the floor. ""He then told me that he only wanted me for the one night, he'd already had me and didn't need me any more."" It was at the hospital that she realised she had lost her baby as a result of the violence. When Shafa went to the police, they did not take her complaint seriously. One day she got a call from the mosque in the village. There, her husband agreed to continue the marriage but she refused. A few days later, she started getting phone calls and text messages from strangers, asking how much she charged to sleep with them. Shafa realised that her husband had published her photograph and telephone number on social media. The callers threatened her with filthy language and told her: ""We got your number from your husband."" ""I recorded all these calls. And I still have all the text messages,"" said Shafa, who could not stop crying but was determined to tell her story. Shafa's mother says she has struggled to hold the family together and seek help for her daughter Shafa's father did not want to get involved with what was happening. But Shafa's mother is now taking her daughter to a social welfare centre so she can get psychological and legal help in the wake of her traumatic marriage. They visit the centre in secret because openly seeking psychological help is still a taboo in Sri Lanka. Shafa's mother supports her five children by doing daily labour jobs in the village. She was evicted from her hometown by Tamil Tiger separatist rebels in 1990. ""I sent my daughter to my brother's place due to one incident. I never thought this would happen to her,"" she said. She says she objected to her daughter being forced to marry but her brother did not listen to her. ""It was a forced marriage,"" she said. ""I fear for her safety and her education now [because of the lies her husband has spread about her]. She can't go to classes. She can't even travel on a bus. Her whole future is uncertain."" Shafa still has scars on her arms from where she self-harmed to avoid a forced marriage Every year, hundreds of girls like Shafa from Sri Lanka's Muslim minority are forced to get married by their parents or guardians. Human rights lawyer Ermiza Tegal says Muslim child marriages have gone up from 14% to 22% within a year in the eastern province, a rise attributed to increased conservatism. Shafa was 15 years old but Muslim women's groups have documented girls as young as 12 being forced into marriage. Muslim girls in Sri Lanka are at risk from forced child marriage due to the lack of legal protection Sri Lanka's common law does not allow underage marriages. The legal age is 18. But a decades-old community law called theMuslim Marriage and Divorce Act (MMDA),externalallows Muslim community leaders, who are mostly men, to decide the marriage age. There is no minimum age, although a marriage involving a girl under 12 requires special permission from an Islamic magistrate. Girls and their mothers have suffered in silence for decades but Muslim women activists are now coming forward to seek reform of the MMDA, despite serious threats from mullahs and other conservative community leaders. One in three women in the developing world are married before they reach the age of 18 The nations with the highest rates of child marriage are Niger (76%), Central African Republic (68%) and Chad (68%) As a region, South Asia has the highest rate of child marriage - 17% of women are married by the age of 15 and 45% by the age of 18 Bangladesh has the highest rate of child marriage in the region (52%), followed by India (47%), Nepal (37%) and Afghanistan (33%) In Sri Lanka child marriage rates are at 2% by 15 and 12% by 18 Globally all but six countries specify minimum marriage ages - but many make exceptions on religious or other grounds, and in some nations laws are ignored Sources: Girls Not Brides; Pew Research Centre Sri Lanka plans to reform its constitution and so activists believe now is the moment to act. The United Nations and the EU have also recently urged the government to amend the MMDA and other discriminatory laws. But there is not a lot of hope, because a committee set up by the government nearly 10 years ago to look into MMDA reform failed to come up with any concrete proposals. Muslim groups such as Jamiyathul Ulama and Thawheed Jamaath have long resisted the call for change. Thawheed Jamaath treasurer BM Arshad said the organisation supported reforming the MMDA as long as proposals came from within the community, but it opposed setting a minimum marriage age. ""Neither Islam nor Thawheed Jamaath accept child marriages,"" said Mr Arshad. ""But Thawheed Jamaath will never agree to setting a minimum age for marriage. ""The need for the girl to get married should be the criteria for a marriage,"" he said. ""Some girls may not need to get married even after 18 years of age. It is the right of the person getting married to decide when they do."" He denied accusations that his organisation threatens Muslim women activists. Thawheed Jamaath spokesperson BM Arshad opposes a minimum age for marriage The centre Shafa and her mother attend has helped more than 3,000 Muslim women with various issues over the last three years, including 250 child marriage victims. ""I have to stay away from home because of the threats from men,"" said the social worker who runs the centre. ""I'm afraid to send my children to school. ""I have had to stay in my office and now I'm even afraid to take a tuk tuk home."" Activist Shreen Abdul Saroor of the Women's Action Network (WAN) was one of the few Muslim women who dared to reveal her face and her identity. ""Child marriage is statutory rape,"" she said. She insists that 18 years should be the legal marriage age for all communities in Sri Lanka, irrespective of their nationality or religion. A child is not physically mature enough to give birth to another child and they miss out on their education, she says. ""When we look at these children getting married, it affects the whole community. The whole community goes backward,"" said Ms Saroor. ""My message to the Muslim community and religious leaders is please do not destroy the childhood of these children."" Activist Shreen Saroor calls on the Muslim community to protect their girls Despite her trauma, Shafa was always a brilliant student and was determined to resume her studies. Her family hope she can get a good job but she still faces many challenges. ""Boys regularly come to me and make rude jokes when I go to tuition classes,"" she says. ""This is serious harassment. I feel down. I'm helpless. I don't know what to do."" But she refuses to let the bullies win, saying she wants to be a lawyer. ""Is it because you want to help other victims like you?"" I asked. ""Yes,"" she said. As her smiling eyes meet mine, I sense her determination. *Shafa's name has been changed to protect her privacy.

"Get in touch: bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk Pound slides after Carney comment on rates Barclays charged by SFO over Qatari investments Hammond says UK 'weary' over austerity Simon Neville Thanks for reading Business Live. We'll be back at 6am sharp tomorrow with more business news and analysis. US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors dumped energy shares following a dive in crude-oil prices. The S&P 500 index closed 0.67% lower at 2,437.03, the Dow Jones lost 0.3% to 21,467.14, and the Nasdaq fell 0.8% to 6,188.03. The prices of Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate both dipped by more than 2% per barrel on fresh fears of oversupply in the global market. BBC World Service It's just emerged that Sir Vince Cable is running for the leadership of the Liberal Democrats - but what would he do for the UK economy? World Business Report asked him earlier this month. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

US crude-oil prices on have fallen into bear-market territory, defined as a drop of at least 20% from its most recent peak. The fall on the West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil Futures of nearly 3%, sent the cost of a barrel to just under $43 during trading at 4pm, East-coast time. It means we are officially in bear territory because the WTI is down more than 20% from its 52-week high of $55.24 back in January. Good news for Facebook-owned Instagram, as bosses claimed it has increased the number of users for its Stories service by 50m since April. Facebook's global head of sales Carolyn Everson told CNBC: ""If you think about it a year ago when we sat together, Instagram Stories didn't exist. ""Today on the platform, we not only have 250m people using it, but actually a third (of the most viewed stories) are businesses using Instagram Stories and one million are advertisers."" But Instagram's gains have been at the cost of rival Snapchat, which saw its shares dive 3.3% to $17.29 on the back of the news. Instagram Stories overtook Snapchat  in April, when bosses said it had 200m active users. Ms Everson said copycat allegations were not true, because Facebook invented the ""Feed"" format first. US markets are still struggling today, as the low oil prices stayed at 10-month lows. Oil and gas companies were naturally the biggest-hit shares. But fast-food chain Chipotle was also badly dented, with shares set to record their biggest one-day fall this year. The company saw shares drop 6.3% to $429.86 after bosses admitted marketing and promotional costs are set to rise by between 0.2% and 0.3% in the current quarter, versus the first three months of the year. Investors in the burrito chain are worried that profits could be squeezed as a result. Bloomberg has pulled together a list of the highest paid CEOs in the US.,external For anyone who thought British CEOs get paid a lot... Hold onto your hats. Topping the list is the Wal-mart boss, but the list is dominated by tech firm chiefs (with notable mention to former Goldman Sachs executive John S. Weinberg, who bagged a massive sign on fee at Evercore Partners. The highest paid UK chief executive in 2016 was WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell taking home Â£40m, while the average UK chief executive bagged just over Â£5m last year,according to the Equality Trust,external Sticking with Qatar for a moment, the chief executive of Qatar Petroleum, Saad al-Kaabi (pictured), says he reckons the country can stay under ""blockade forever"" if it needs to. Speaking to Qatar-based TV network Al Jazeera, he said the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrainblockades against the countrywere not working. He explained: ""With what we have prepared, we can stay under the
blockade forever, and our gas and oil industries will not be affected. ""We [still] import everything we need for our
industries, maybe except some logistical needs, and UAE's port of Jebel Ali will
be the biggest loser [in the dispute], not us."" Going back to the comments earlier today from Standard and Poor's sovereign ratings chief, Moritz Kraemer, who was interviewed earlier today at the Global Markets Forum. He spoke at some length about Russia's credit rating and was asked about the country's ""positive outlook"" position S&P has stated previously. Mr Kraemer said: ""Any renewed deepening of geopolitical risks could
diminish the chances of an upgrade. This is because the
consequences of a tightening sanctions regime might choke off
the recovery of the Russian economy with fiscal but also
potential political risks."" But he added that, despite falling oil prices the country's economic recovery is ""surpassing our expectations and we have also seen progressive improvement in the Russian financial system"". Another economic powerhouse in the region, Qatar, was hinted at being downgraded though, over the recent sanctions introduced by neighbouring countries. He said: ""We do not see a wave of downgrades in the Middle East, 
but there are individual countries with a negative rating
outlook. Among them is Qatar"". Private hire firm Uber, which has faces some of its harshest criticism ever in recent months, said today it has introduced tipping on its app for riders in Houston, Minneapolis and Seattle. The company has beenhauled over the coalsdue to sexism allegations, harassment in the workplace and questionable conduct. It led to a slew of senior executives resigning and co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick taking an extended leave of absence. No word on whether the tipping policy - which Uber has resisted introducing in the past - will be introduced in other countries. But the company said it'll be adding more US cities over the coming weeks, eventually making it available throughout America. Labour MPs are attempting to persuade its leader Jeremy Corbyn to adopt a softer approach to Brexit -echoing the voices of some of the biggest business leadersin the country. In an open letter to the Guardian newspaper,external, 51 MPs, Peers and MEPs including Chuka Umunna, David Lammy and Lord George Foulkes, have called for the UK to remain a member of the Single Market. They write: ""Jeremy Corbyn has rightly said that Labourâs position on Brexit is to focus on a deal that prioritises jobs first. We are all united behind that goal. For us that means membership of the single market. ""A country can be a member of the single market without being a member of the EU and we must be clear â âaccessâ to the European single market is both different and inferior to âmembershipâ of the single market."" The Unison union is having its annual conference in Brighton today, and general secretary Dave Prentis (pictured) had some tough words for the Government. He told assembled members that he planned to campaign against the ""brutal"" Trade Union Act, which aims to make it harder for unions to strike, and wanted to ""smash"" the Government's cap on public sector pay rises. Mr Prentis said: ""This Government's austerity pay policies have crushed public
services under their heel. They have ground down public service employees. They're worried about their jobs, their families and can't go through another
five years of poverty pay. ""Now is the time to shout 'enough is enough'.
 ""This is the year to smash the pay cap. We will not stop taking industrial action because of the draconian
legislation against us."" The FTSE 100 produced a rare result today - compared with its behaviour in recent months. Typically, when the pound falls against the dollar, the FTSE rises. Logic being that, foreign investors can benefit from the low pound and stocks become ""cheaper"" when bought in dollars. This then pushes up the market. However, today was unusual because even though the pound was down (Â£1 is $1.2626 compared to 1.2742 dollars at the previous close) the FTSE was also down. The biggest fallers were primarily mining giants, including Antofagasta, Glencore, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Anglo American made up five of the seven biggest fallers). And they typically fall when the oil price is down - it fell 2.2% today. So - does this mean the FTSE starting to become more susceptible to oil price movements (as it traditionally was before the Brexit referendum) or will the dollar continue to be the major influence on the market?  For those of you suffering from the heat across much of the country, there has been one big beneficiary of the hot weather. Retail expert Steve Dresser complained earlier that Amazon had run out of fans, leading to Argos revealing it has sold nearly 100,000 fans on Monday. Investors weren't overly impressed with the extra business though. Shares in Sainsbury's (which owns Argos) were down 1.2% today. Allow Twitter content?

Chris JohnstonBusiness reporter, BBC News It is somehow
appropriate that the US company Boom Supersonic used the Paris air show to
say it has moved a step closer to getting a
Concorde-like passenger plane in the sky. After all, not
one but two Concordes are in the museum at Le Bourget airfield, where the huge
aerospace trade show is being held this week. Boom's founder,
Blake Scholl (pictured), aims to get a 55-seat passenger plane (about half
the number of seats BA offered in its Concorde) flying by 2023 after
getting a sub-scale demonstrator in the air by the end of next
year. Despite having
the likes of Richard Branson as backers, Boom has a long way to go before
passengers are forking out something like $5,000 for a return flight to New
York. That would still be substantially less than the price of a ride on nosiy
old Concorde, though. Ding ding! Stock markets across Europe have closed for the day. The FTSE 100 index of leading companies took a 51.1 point hit, down 0.68%, to 7472.71. Oil prices, comments from S&P and Carney's Brexit gloom all seem to have contributed to the lacklustre day.  The World at OneBBC Radio 4 This video can not be played The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has used a speech to city leaders at the Mansion House to say he wants to make the economy the top priority in Brexit negotiations. He said the government did not want to shut down migration, and said the customs union could be maintained for a time after the UK leaves the EU, during a 'transitional period' to protect key industries. The chief executive of Siemens in the UK, Juergen Maier, who is leading an industrial strategy review for the government, welcomes the idea of 'transitional' arrangements which he says, will give businesses more time to organise themselves. Mr Maier also told Martha Kearney it had taken a while to get the Brexit talks started, but it was now important to get on with the negotiations. The Prime Minister's link to the business world has quit after just 10 months, according to Joel Hills at ITV News. Theresa May has always had a difficult time trying to win the City over to her point of view - mainly due to the hardline position she took on Brexit before the recent election. General election campaigns typically involve business leaders signing numerous letters in support of Conservative Party policies, but they were remarkably silent this time round. The only letter thatcame along was last week, with the biggest business groups calling for a softer Brexit. Chris Brannigan is a former Royal Scots Dragoon Guards Lieutenant Colonel who commanded a tank squadron to liberate Basra in 2003. Allow Twitter content?

Standard and Poor's boss in charge of sovereign ratings, Moritz Kraemer, has been speaking to Reuters today about a range of topics. We'll delve into some of them later. But the main take home comments were he said S&P may not wait until the Brexit terms are known, before shifting its rating down again. S&P cut the UK to AA from AAA after the Brexit vote last year, with a negative outlook. He said: ""We will review the UK every six months... and if necessary more often... We will be watching the economic implications, the implications for the public finances, the constitutional implications like the whole Scotland situation... and things like the currency and if it will maintain its reserve status."" Chris JohnstonBusiness reporter, BBC News There are planes from lesser known manufacturers such as Russiaâs Irkut, and Canadaâs Bombardier, as well as Embraer of Brazil; helicopters, drones, and pretty much anything else that flies. That also includes missiles, with the likes of Raytheon showing off their wares. One of its missiles, the SkyCeptor, is promoted as being âlow-cost but high-performingâ compared with other âhit-to-kill effectorsâ. Although a new passenger jet can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, the global spend on defence aerospace technology leaves commercial aviation in its wake. Itâs no wonder that the hundreds of companies exhibiting at the show go out of their way to encourage the top brass from the air forces of the world to stop way, as well as wooing slightly less visible customers. The bulk of the aerial displays are performed by defence aircraft, be they jet fighters, transporters or helicopters performing sometimes hair-raising manoeuvres at high speed â and high decibels. An A380 might be able to carry several hundred passengers, but it most certainly cannot loop the loop. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The head of the Met Police and faith leaders joined a vigil on Monday night after the Finsbury Park terror attack. Commissioner Cressida Dick was among hundreds who took part after a van hit worshippers near the Muslim Welfare House mosque and community centre. Ramadan prayers took place on Monday after worshippers broke their fast, but leaders said it was quieter than usual. Darren Osborne, 47, from Cardiff, has been held on suspicion of attempted murder and alleged terror offences. This video can not be played Footage shows the suspected attacker being tackled before police arrive His family members have said they are """"shocked"" and ""devastated"". Mr Osborne's mother, sister and nephew said in a statement: ""We are massively in shock, it's unbelievable. It still hasn't really sunk in."" They added that their ""hearts go out to those who've been injured"". What we know so far In pictures: Finsbury Park attack Welsh hire van in mosque terror attack Theresa May's statement in full 'Everyone is on edge' after attack The attack took place shortly after midnight on Sunday night, close to Muslim Welfare House on Seven Sisters Road. The driver of the van was detained by bystanders before police arrived. Nine people were taken to three London hospitals after a van struck pedestrians. Two were treated for minor injuries at the scene. Several of the injured are believed to be seriously hurt. Those who were injured had been helping a man who had collapsed. He later died but it is not clear if that was because of the attack. Faith leaders addressed a crowd at the vigil outside nearby Finsbury Park Mosque. People from across the community had gathered in solidarity and to lay flowers. After a short silence, chairman of the mosque Mohammed Kozbar said the attack was ""on our families, on our freedom, on our dignity"". The man who died was a father of six children, he said. The Bishop of Stepney, Rt Rev Adrian Newman, said ""an attack on one faith is an attack on us all"". Ms Dick said the incident was ""quite clearly an attack on Muslims"", and the community would now see more police, including armed officers, in the area, ""particularly around religious establishments"". This video can not be played There is a sense among some of the community that an attack like this was inevitable Muslim worshippers then attended prayers at the mosque late into the night. At the scene, the BBC's Simon Clemison said: ""People came to prayer just as they would have done. ""It was pretty full - although one of the leaders of the mosque said it was quieter, he felt, quieter for one of the busiest times of Ramadan."" He said there was positivity as people came from other parts of the capital to pray with the community. But there were also some reservations amongst worshippers - ranging from the way the media reports events and on the community, to how politicians and decision-makers respond. Some people in the area said the attacks left them ""living in fear"" as they went about their daily business. Others said they wanted to show their support for the community - by taking flowers along to the site. One, Caroline Bucknall, told the BBC she had lived locally for 20 years. She said she saw people of all faiths at the vigil and while everyone was sad, the community spirit was ""very uplifting"". The government is working to tackle hate crime and ""all forms of extremism"" the home secretary has said. Writing in the Guardian,external, Amber Rudd said: ""We must unite the might of community spirit and the full force of the law to ensure every person in the UK is protected. Let there be no doubt we will be tough on terror wherever it strikes. And last night's attack was terrorism."" She said this latest ""attack on Britain"" united everyone in grief and anger, adding: ""It is vital, now more than ever, that we stand together and do not allow people who seek to use hate to divide us to succeed."" Officers have been carrying out searches at a property in the Cardiff area Security Minister Ben Wallace said the suspect was not known to the security services, and was believed to have acted alone. The BBC understands Mr Osborne grew up in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, and has lived at more than one property in Cardiff. He is also believed to have lived in Swindon. Police searches are being carried out in the Cardiff area. Faith leaders from across Wales met at Dar Ul-Isra Mosque in the Welsh capital on Monday evening to make a human chain wall as an act of solidarity with the Muslim community. The Finsbury Park attack is the fourth in the UK in three months, after incidents in Westminster, Manchester and on London Bridge. Prime Minister Theresa May said the attack was ""every bit as sickening"" as the others. She visited Finsbury Park Mosque on Monday and held talks with faith leaders. Labour leader and Islington North MP Jeremy Corbyn also visited the area, telling the BBC that ""an attack on a mosque, an attack on a synagogue, an attack on a church is actually an attack on all of us"".

"The government must secure a transitional Brexit deal to protect the future of the UK car industry, a trade group has said. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said Britain was highly unlikely to reach a final agreement with the EU by the March 2019 deadline. That meant carmakers could face a ""cliff edge"", whereby tariff-free trade was sharply pulled away. It warned the industry would suffer without a back-up plan in place. The EU is by far the UK's biggest automotive export market, buying more than half of its finished vehicles - four times as many as the next biggest market. EU: No plans for Brexit concessions Rolls-Royce warns against 'hard Brexit' UK car plants also depend heavily on the free movement of components to and from the continent. The SMMT said any new relationship with the EU would need to address tariff and non-tariff barriers, regulatory and labour issues, ""all of which will take time to negotiate"". ""We accept that we are leaving the European Union,"" said chief executive Mike Hawes. ""But our biggest fear is that, in two years' time, we fall off a cliff edge - no deal, outside the single market and customs union and trading on inferior World Trade Organization terms. ""This would undermine our competitiveness and our ability to attract the investment that is critical to future growth."" He called on the government to seek an interim arrangement, whereby the UK stayed in the single market and customs union until a new relationship was brokered. UK car manufacturing generated Â£77.5bn of turnover last year and accounted for 12% of all goods exports, according to the trade group. It added that almost a million people were employed across the wider automotive industry.

"Friends have been laying tributes to the teenager A 16-year-old boy has drowned in a reservoir. The boy reportedly got into difficulties while swimming with friends at Greenbooth Reservoir in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. Police were called to the moorland beauty spot on Monday. An underwater search team examined the area and later discovered the boy's body. His details have not been released and police said they did not believe his death was suspicious. Friends have been laying flowers at the scene all day. One told the BBC: ""I'm speechless, he was really well liked."" David Gillard, who lives nearby, said the reservoir was popular with teenagers. ""We get a lot of teenagers coming up to cool off and what they tend to do is jump off the rocks,"" he added. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the boy's family was being supported by specially-trained officers. Det Ch Insp John Harris said: ""My sincerest condolences are with the boy's family at hearing this heart-wrenching news."" David Walker, leisure safety manager at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), said: ""We understand the temptation to want to go swimming at open water sites, especially during the hot weather. ""Things to consider when open water swimming, even on a hot day, is that the water might be a lot colder or deeper than you were expecting and there may be strong currents and underwater debris that you cannot see from the bank.

"On Monday, a national minute's silence was held for victims of the blaze More than Â£200,000 of a Â£5m emergency fund has so far been given to families affected by last Tuesday's fire at Grenfell Tower in Kensington. As of Monday, 180 families directly affected by the blaze had received money, the Grenfell Response Team said. The GRT, which is organising the relief effort, said 78 families were on course to be rehomed locally by Monday night. Police have named five victims of the fire - 79 people died or are missing presumed dead after the blaze. Anthony Disson, 65, Ya-Haddy Sisi Saye, 24, also known as Khadija Saye, and Abufars Ibrahim, 39, and Khadija Khalloufi, 52 - were identified on Monday. Mohammad Alhajali, 23, was the first victim to be formally identified. Of those who were injured, 17 people remain in hospital, with nine in critical care, according to NHS England. What we know so far Who are the victims? Visual guide to what happened So far 126 hotel places have been found for residents of Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk. The GRT, which includes local and regional government from across London, central government, the British Red Cross, Met Police and London Fire Brigade, said in a statement that ""we completely accept residents' wishes to remain close to the community"". Anthony Disson and Ya-Haddy Sisi Saye are among five people to be formally identified by the police It went on: ""Work is taking place to assess the housing needs of all Grenfell Tower and Grenfell Walk families to identify suitable accommodation in Kensington and Chelsea and neighbouring boroughs."" Of those who were due to have been rehoused, the GRT said they would be living in Kensington and Chelsea or a neighbouring borough. The government has pledged to give Â£5,500 to all of those who lost their homes. Each household will receive at least Â£500 in cash and Â£5,000 paid into an account as part of a Â£5m emergency fund first announced on Friday. The fund for affected families, which was announced by the prime minister on Friday, will also: Help people having to stay in temporary accommodation Help meet funeral costs Cover legal representation for residents involved in the public inquiry An extra Â£1.5m will also pay for mental health support for the emergency services Meanwhile, the BBC has learned that four separate government ministers werewarned that fire regulations were not keeping people safe. In leaked letters seen by BBC One's Panorama, experts warn that those living in tower blocks like Grenfell Tower were ""at risk"". The Department for Communities and Local Government, which received the letters, said work to improve regulation and safety had already been under way. Police have warned the final number of victims from the fire in the 24-storey block could still change. Commander Stuart Cundy said his priority was to identify the people who died in the building and to remove them as quickly as possible. But he warned that not everyone would be identifiable and the operation would take ""many, many weeks"". ""This is an incredibly distressing time for families,"" he said. ""It is really hard to describe the devastation the fire caused."" Cdr Cundy said there may have been people inside the building that they did not know were there, but there also could be people who were reported missing and managed to escape. He urged those people to make themselves known to the authorities. The Met has also promised a ""wide ranging"" investigation into the blaze which will look at the construction of the building, the recent refurbishment, how it was managed and maintained, and fire safety measures. ""I would like to reassure everybody that we will be looking at all criminal offences that might have been committed by any individual or any organisation,"" said Cdr Cundy. ""Where offences have been committed, I will do everything in my gift to make sure they are brought to justice."" A minute's silence was held at 11:00 BST on Monday across the UK to remember the victims.

"Get in touch: bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk Pound slides after Carney comment on rates Barclays charged by SFO over Qatari investments Hammond says UK 'weary' over austerity Simon Neville Thanks for reading Business Live. We'll be back at 6am sharp tomorrow with more business news and analysis. US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors dumped energy shares following a dive in crude-oil prices. The S&P 500 index closed 0.67% lower at 2,437.03, the Dow Jones lost 0.3% to 21,467.14, and the Nasdaq fell 0.8% to 6,188.03. The prices of Brent Crude and West Texas Intermediate both dipped by more than 2% per barrel on fresh fears of oversupply in the global market.

US crude-oil prices on have fallen into bear-market territory, defined as a drop of at least 20% from its most recent peak. The fall on the West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil Futures of nearly 3%, sent the cost of a barrel to just under $43 during trading at 4pm, East-coast time. It means we are officially in bear territory because the WTI is down more than 20% from its 52-week high of $55.24 back in January. Good news for Facebook-owned Instagram, as bosses claimed it has increased the number of users for its Stories service by 50m since April. Facebook's global head of sales Carolyn Everson told CNBC: ""If you think about it a year ago when we sat together, Instagram Stories didn't exist. ""Today on the platform, we not only have 250m people using it, but actually a third (of the most viewed stories) are businesses using Instagram Stories and one million are advertisers."" But Instagram's gains have been at the cost of rival Snapchat, which saw its shares dive 3.3% to $17.29 on the back of the news. Instagram Stories overtook Snapchat  in April, when bosses said it had 200m active users. Ms Everson said copycat allegations were not true, because Facebook invented the ""Feed"" format first. US markets are still struggling today, as the low oil prices stayed at 10-month lows. Oil and gas companies were naturally the biggest-hit shares. But fast-food chain Chipotle was also badly dented, with shares set to record their biggest one-day fall this year. The company saw shares drop 6.3% to $429.86 after bosses admitted marketing and promotional costs are set to rise by between 0.2% and 0.3% in the current quarter, versus the first three months of the year. Investors in the burrito chain are worried that profits could be squeezed as a result. Bloomberg has pulled together a list of the highest paid CEOs in the US.,external For anyone who thought British CEOs get paid a lot... Hold onto your hats. Topping the list is the Wal-mart boss, but the list is dominated by tech firm chiefs (with notable mention to former Goldman Sachs executive John S. Weinberg, who bagged a massive sign on fee at Evercore Partners. The highest paid UK chief executive in 2016 was WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell taking home Â£40m, while the average UK chief executive bagged just over Â£5m last year,according to the Equality Trust,external Sticking with Qatar for a moment, the chief executive of Qatar Petroleum, Saad al-Kaabi (pictured), says he reckons the country can stay under ""blockade forever"" if it needs to. Speaking to Qatar-based TV network Al Jazeera, he said the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrainblockades against the countrywere not working. He explained: ""With what we have prepared, we can stay under the
blockade forever, and our gas and oil industries will not be affected. ""We [still] import everything we need for our
industries, maybe except some logistical needs, and UAE's port of Jebel Ali will
be the biggest loser [in the dispute], not us."" Going back to the comments earlier today from Standard and Poor's sovereign ratings chief, Moritz Kraemer, who was interviewed earlier today at the Global Markets Forum. He spoke at some length about Russia's credit rating and was asked about the country's ""positive outlook"" position S&P has stated previously. Mr Kraemer said: ""Any renewed deepening of geopolitical risks could
diminish the chances of an upgrade. This is because the
consequences of a tightening sanctions regime might choke off
the recovery of the Russian economy with fiscal but also
potential political risks."" But he added that, despite falling oil prices the country's economic recovery is ""surpassing our expectations and we have also seen progressive improvement in the Russian financial system"". Another economic powerhouse in the region, Qatar, was hinted at being downgraded though, over the recent sanctions introduced by neighbouring countries. He said: ""We do not see a wave of downgrades in the Middle East, 
but there are individual countries with a negative rating
outlook. Among them is Qatar"". Private hire firm Uber, which has faces some of its harshest criticism ever in recent months, said today it has introduced tipping on its app for riders in Houston, Minneapolis and Seattle. The company has beenhauled over the coalsdue to sexism allegations, harassment in the workplace and questionable conduct. It led to a slew of senior executives resigning and co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick taking an extended leave of absence. No word on whether the tipping policy - which Uber has resisted introducing in the past - will be introduced in other countries. But the company said it'll be adding more US cities over the coming weeks, eventually making it available throughout America. Labour MPs are attempting to persuade its leader Jeremy Corbyn to adopt a softer approach to Brexit -echoing the voices of some of the biggest business leadersin the country. In an open letter to the Guardian newspaper,external, 51 MPs, Peers and MEPs including Chuka Umunna, David Lammy and Lord George Foulkes, have called for the UK to remain a member of the Single Market. They write: ""Jeremy Corbyn has rightly said that Labourâs position on Brexit is to focus on a deal that prioritises jobs first. We are all united behind that goal. For us that means membership of the single market. ""A country can be a member of the single market without being a member of the EU and we must be clear â âaccessâ to the European single market is both different and inferior to âmembershipâ of the single market."" The Unison union is having its annual conference in Brighton today, and general secretary Dave Prentis (pictured) had some tough words for the Government. He told assembled members that he planned to campaign against the ""brutal"" Trade Union Act, which aims to make it harder for unions to strike, and wanted to ""smash"" the Government's cap on public sector pay rises. Mr Prentis said: ""This Government's austerity pay policies have crushed public
services under their heel. They have ground down public service employees. They're worried about their jobs, their families and can't go through another
five years of poverty pay. ""Now is the time to shout 'enough is enough'.
 ""This is the year to smash the pay cap. We will not stop taking industrial action because of the draconian
legislation against us."" The FTSE 100 produced a rare result today - compared with its behaviour in recent months. Typically, when the pound falls against the dollar, the FTSE rises. Logic being that, foreign investors can benefit from the low pound and stocks become ""cheaper"" when bought in dollars. This then pushes up the market. However, today was unusual because even though the pound was down (Â£1 is $1.2626 compared to 1.2742 dollars at the previous close) the FTSE was also down. The biggest fallers were primarily mining giants, including Antofagasta, Glencore, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Anglo American made up five of the seven biggest fallers). And they typically fall when the oil price is down - it fell 2.2% today. So - does this mean the FTSE starting to become more susceptible to oil price movements (as it traditionally was before the Brexit referendum) or will the dollar continue to be the major influence on the market?  For those of you suffering from the heat across much of the country, there has been one big beneficiary of the hot weather. Retail expert Steve Dresser complained earlier that Amazon had run out of fans, leading to Argos revealing it has sold nearly 100,000 fans on Monday. Investors weren't overly impressed with the extra business though. Shares in Sainsbury's (which owns Argos) were down 1.2% today. Allow Twitter content?

Chris JohnstonBusiness reporter, BBC News It is somehow
appropriate that the US company Boom Supersonic used the Paris air show to
say it has moved a step closer to getting a
Concorde-like passenger plane in the sky. After all, not
one but two Concordes are in the museum at Le Bourget airfield, where the huge
aerospace trade show is being held this week. Boom's founder,
Blake Scholl (pictured), aims to get a 55-seat passenger plane (about half
the number of seats BA offered in its Concorde) flying by 2023 after
getting a sub-scale demonstrator in the air by the end of next
year. Despite having
the likes of Richard Branson as backers, Boom has a long way to go before
passengers are forking out something like $5,000 for a return flight to New
York. That would still be substantially less than the price of a ride on nosiy
old Concorde, though. Ding ding! Stock markets across Europe have closed for the day. The FTSE 100 index of leading companies took a 51.1 point hit, down 0.68%, to 7472.71. Oil prices, comments from S&P and Carney's Brexit gloom all seem to have contributed to the lacklustre day.  The World at OneBBC Radio 4 This video can not be played The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has used a speech to city leaders at the Mansion House to say he wants to make the economy the top priority in Brexit negotiations. He said the government did not want to shut down migration, and said the customs union could be maintained for a time after the UK leaves the EU, during a 'transitional period' to protect key industries. The chief executive of Siemens in the UK, Juergen Maier, who is leading an industrial strategy review for the government, welcomes the idea of 'transitional' arrangements which he says, will give businesses more time to organise themselves. Mr Maier also told Martha Kearney it had taken a while to get the Brexit talks started, but it was now important to get on with the negotiations. The Prime Minister's link to the business world has quit after just 10 months, according to Joel Hills at ITV News. Theresa May has always had a difficult time trying to win the City over to her point of view - mainly due to the hardline position she took on Brexit before the recent election. General election campaigns typically involve business leaders signing numerous letters in support of Conservative Party policies, but they were remarkably silent this time round. The only letter thatcame along was last week, with the biggest business groups calling for a softer Brexit. Chris Brannigan is a former Royal Scots Dragoon Guards Lieutenant Colonel who commanded a tank squadron to liberate Basra in 2003. Allow Twitter content?

Standard and Poor's boss in charge of sovereign ratings, Moritz Kraemer, has been speaking to Reuters today about a range of topics. We'll delve into some of them later. But the main take home comments were he said S&P may not wait until the Brexit terms are known, before shifting its rating down again. S&P cut the UK to AA from AAA after the Brexit vote last year, with a negative outlook. He said: ""We will review the UK every six months... and if necessary more often... We will be watching the economic implications, the implications for the public finances, the constitutional implications like the whole Scotland situation... and things like the currency and if it will maintain its reserve status."" Chris JohnstonBusiness reporter, BBC News There are planes from lesser known manufacturers such as Russiaâs Irkut, and Canadaâs Bombardier, as well as Embraer of Brazil; helicopters, drones, and pretty much anything else that flies. That also includes missiles, with the likes of Raytheon showing off their wares. One of its missiles, the SkyCeptor, is promoted as being âlow-cost but high-performingâ compared with other âhit-to-kill effectorsâ. Although a new passenger jet can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, the global spend on defence aerospace technology leaves commercial aviation in its wake. Itâs no wonder that the hundreds of companies exhibiting at the show go out of their way to encourage the top brass from the air forces of the world to stop way, as well as wooing slightly less visible customers. The bulk of the aerial displays are performed by defence aircraft, be they jet fighters, transporters or helicopters performing sometimes hair-raising manoeuvres at high speed â and high decibels. An A380 might be able to carry several hundred passengers, but it most certainly cannot loop the loop. Â© 2025 BBC.

"What does Chancellor Philip Hammond's increasingly vocal stance on Brexit say about his intentions, his prime minister and his party? Is the chancellor intent on using his soft power to take on the hard Brexiteers? He's certainly using it to isolate one very vulnerable prime minister. Mr Hammond, while seemingly content to let her remain in political limbo, has also vented his frustration about his boss, making it clear that Theresa May's team had made sure he had been shut away during the election, forbidden to talk about the economy. He has suggested that this was the key, fatal, majority-losing mistake. His message now: ""It's the economy, stupid,"" and that goes for Brexit too. Monday's talks in Brussels are one baby step on a long journey to a new future. The election has changed everything. There are those in the Conservative Party who think the lesson was clear:hard Brexithas been rejected. ""Our power is now limited. To say it is a mess is to state the bleeding obvious,"" one former minister, an ardent campaigner for Leave, told us. Mr Hammond has criticised Theresa May's general election campaign A former minister on the other side of the debate made it clear she had kept her seat because she was an ardent Remainer and was pinning her hopes on the chancellor softening Brexit. Whether or not the chancellor is ""on manoeuvres"", Mr Hammond is certainly marshalling his arguments. A planned Mansion House speech was postponed because of the Grenfell fire, but was briefed as potentially lobbing a missile into Number 10 and that the chancellor was toying with the idea of arguing to stay in the Customs Union. He hasn't done that. Instead,he told the BBC's Andrew Marr programmethat he would prioritise the economy, jobs and skills, while adding: ""We're leaving the EU and because we're leaving the EU we will be leaving the single market. And by the way, we'll be leaving the Customs Union."" The postponed speech will now be delivered on Tuesday 20 June. Brexit negotiations: David Davis 'positive' as first meeting begins The key issues in EU/UK talks Brexit: All you need to know The people who will negotiate Brexit In a wider context, to understand the chancellor's language you have to decode the debate and the movement of the Tories biggest beasts, those who consider themselves the natural rulers, who feel that those they see as rebels, or Leavers, have seized control of their citadel. It looks as if a counter-strike by these forces is unfolding before our eyes. Consider: two former prime ministers, John Major and David Cameron, who were humiliated by Eurosceptics, have backed Mr Hammond's view, calling for the economy to be put first and for an agreement on Brexit with other parties. So has former Conservative leader William Hague. So has the only Tory hero of the hour, Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservatives' leader. Almost unnoticed, the generally rather underwhelming reshuffle was at the heart of the coup. Chancellor Phillip Hammond secure in place, Remainer Damien Green elevated to First Secretary of State, Remainer Gavin Barwell, former Croydon MP, the prime minister's new chief of staff, a critical appointment. David Cameron and Sir John Major have both backed Mr Hammond's stance on Brexit Brexit Secretary David Davis'stop team has been eviscerated. His main ministerial enthusiast for leaving the EU, David Jones, was sacked without warning. The other resigned. The department didn't know it was coming. More importantly, Mr Davis didn't know it was coming. One ally and former minister told us: ""It's a major blow. David is now isolated, he is concerned that half his senior team have been swept from beneath him."" Another friend ruefully admitted that Mr Davis's hand had been weakened by the loss of close allies but is hoping he is strong enough to stand firm without them. But the signs are that the core, indefinable, establishment of the Conservative Party, the party of business and occasional populist nationalism, is seizing back control. If the softies are on the rise, what is it they want? ""Putting the economy first"" is code for lots of things from staying in the single market, to staying in the Customs Union, to staying in the European Economic Area. Mr Hammond believes that the economy and jobs should be prioritised in Brexit talks But two things are at the heart of their demands. First, a gradual, gliding process of leaving the European Union, gracefully shedding its laws, institutions and benefits only very slowly: a ""transitional arrangement"" in the jargon. It is never said, but presumably this transition can be frozen into permanence at any point. Then, there's the rejection of Mrs May's contention that ""no deal"" - a very hard Brexit - is better than a bad deal. Some complain that ""hard"" and ""soft"" Brexit are meaningless, crude terms. They are correct to the extent that, like ""left"" and ""right"", they are big holdalls containing disputed goods. But, in this case, the key to the argument is immigration. At the heart of soft Brexit is a compromise: getting better access to the single market by ditching tough demands on immigration. So what did Mr Hammond say? He repeatedly emphasised that Brexit required a ""slope not a cliff"" and that no deal would be ""a very, very bad deal"" although one purpose-built to punish would be worse. Immigration will be a key topic in the Brexit negotiations He explicitly said he wanted as close to the tariff- and trade-barrier-free single market as we could get. That implies giving up something on immigration. So far it isn't enough to rile the right on the backbenches, but it leans heavily on one side of the debate. But peer into next year, and it is the sort of deal that might need the support of Labour, Lib Dem and SNP MPs. There is already detailed thinking about such a temporary Macronist alliance - akin to that which has just swept through French politics - in the voting lobbies. But maybe, just maybe, none of this is really about a final agreement with the EU but an interim one with cabinet colleagues. Few think Mrs May can survive long. There will probably be a leadership contest within the next few years, very possibly within the next few months. Few want to, to coin a phrase, jump off a cliff, and rather fancy instead sloping towards the future. Though still keeping his own Brexit cards close to his chest, Boris Johnson wrote yesterday about an ""open Brexit"" and not ""slamming the drawbridge on talent"". A very public message about the price for support in a leadership contest perhaps? There's some hard politics behind the soft option. What are the UK's Brexit trade options?

"This video can not be played Drone footage shows burnt-out cars on a road in the PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande area More than 1,000 firefighters are battling a forest fire in Portugal that has claimed the lives at least 64 people and injured more than 130 since Saturday. Many of the victims died after becoming trapped in cars as they tried to flee. Planes have been used to drop water over the PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande region. Civil protection officials have said they expect the blaze to be under control soon, but warn that soaring temperatures are hampering efforts. The week's highest temperatures in the area are expected to reach around 38C (100F) and, together with windy conditions, could reignite fires already quelled. Despite 70% of the fire now under control, officials said what remained was a source ""of great concern"". One of the victims has been identified as a 40-year-old firefighter who died in hospital. Many died inside their cars as they tried to escape or were a short distance from them when they became trapped. The government has declared a state of emergency in the forested region around PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, north-east of the capital, Lisbon. More than 1,000 firefighters are tackling the blaze in central Portugal Many people have lost their homes to the flames Civil protection commander Elisio Oliveira said there was great concern for the fires still burning. He described the operation as ""complex"" and said many residents were being forced to evacuate. The blaze continues to rage on several fronts. 'I could have died - I should have died' In pictures: Portugal forest fire Water tank saves 12 from Portugal fire One volunteer rescuer quoted by Reuters news agency said teams were not optimistic about bringing the blaze fully under control anytime soon. ""Low humidity, windy conditions and high temperatures will easily re-ignite the fire, and it will spread very fast,"" he said. This photo of exhausted firefighters taken by Pedro BrÃ¡s went viral on social media When asked about the plan for Tuesday, he added: ""It all depends on the weather."" Police believe the fires were started by lightning on Saturday during an intense heatwave and rainless thunderstorms. Wildfires are an annual menace in Portugal. More broke out there between 1993 and 2013 than in Spain, France, Italy or Greece, the European Environment Agency reported last year, despite the country's relatively small geographical size. Given that, was this year's tragedy preventable? Could Portugal have done anything more to save lives and minimise the damage? Read more:Just what makes Portugal such a tinderbox? One of the worst-hit areas was around the village of Nodeirinho. Thirty bodies were found inside cars and another 17 next to vehicles on the N-236 road. Portuguese media have dubbed the N-236 the ""road of death"". This video can not be played Gareth Roberts: 'You could hear the roar of the fire coming... we just sat and waited to die' A few miles north, 11 people died in the village of Pobrais, many as they tried to escape the flames. A survivor spoke of the roads being blocked and of no-one coming to their aid. Betty Jesus, a 50-year-old Venezuelan who has lived in the area for decades, said: ""I have witnessed a lot of fires, but never like this. The way it spread, the speed."" Virgilio Godinho, who lives in the village of Figueiro, said the fire quickly overwhelmed the community. ""The fire didn't spread by the ground, it spread through the air at the height of the trees. In five minutes all were on fire in an area of around 10km,"" he said. Portugal is observing three days of mourning for the victims. Wildfires rage in Portugal.

The company saw shares drop 6.3% to $429.86 after bosses admitted marketing and promotional costs are set to rise by between 0.2% and 0.3% in the current quarter, versus the first three months of the year. Investors in the burrito chain are worried that profits could be squeezed as a result. Bloomberg has pulled together a list of the highest paid CEOs in the US.,external For anyone who thought British CEOs get paid a lot... Hold onto your hats. Topping the list is the Wal-mart boss, but the list is dominated by tech firm chiefs (with notable mention to former Goldman Sachs executive John S. Weinberg, who bagged a massive sign on fee at Evercore Partners. The highest paid UK chief executive in 2016 was WPP boss Sir Martin Sorrell taking home Â£40m, while the average UK chief executive bagged just over Â£5m last year,according to the Equality Trust,external Sticking with Qatar for a moment, the chief executive of Qatar Petroleum, Saad al-Kaabi (pictured), says he reckons the country can stay under ""blockade forever"" if it needs to. Speaking to Qatar-based TV network Al Jazeera, he said the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrainblockades against the countrywere not working. He explained: ""With what we have prepared, we can stay under the
blockade forever, and our gas and oil industries will not be affected. ""We [still] import everything we need for our
industries, maybe except some logistical needs, and UAE's port of Jebel Ali will
be the biggest loser [in the dispute], not us."" Going back to the comments earlier today from Standard and Poor's sovereign ratings chief, Moritz Kraemer, who was interviewed earlier today at the Global Markets Forum. He spoke at some length about Russia's credit rating and was asked about the country's ""positive outlook"" position S&P has stated previously. Mr Kraemer said: ""Any renewed deepening of geopolitical risks could
diminish the chances of an upgrade. This is because the
consequences of a tightening sanctions regime might choke off
the recovery of the Russian economy with fiscal but also
potential political risks."" But he added that, despite falling oil prices the country's economic recovery is ""surpassing our expectations and we have also seen progressive improvement in the Russian financial system"". Another economic powerhouse in the region, Qatar, was hinted at being downgraded though, over the recent sanctions introduced by neighbouring countries. He said: ""We do not see a wave of downgrades in the Middle East, 
but there are individual countries with a negative rating
outlook. Among them is Qatar"". Private hire firm Uber, which has faces some of its harshest criticism ever in recent months, said today it has introduced tipping on its app for riders in Houston, Minneapolis and Seattle. The company has beenhauled over the coalsdue to sexism allegations, harassment in the workplace and questionable conduct. It led to a slew of senior executives resigning and co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick taking an extended leave of absence. No word on whether the tipping policy - which Uber has resisted introducing in the past - will be introduced in other countries. But the company said it'll be adding more US cities over the coming weeks, eventually making it available throughout America. Labour MPs are attempting to persuade its leader Jeremy Corbyn to adopt a softer approach to Brexit -echoing the voices of some of the biggest business leadersin the country. In an open letter to the Guardian newspaper,external, 51 MPs, Peers and MEPs including Chuka Umunna, David Lammy and Lord George Foulkes, have called for the UK to remain a member of the Single Market. They write: ""Jeremy Corbyn has rightly said that Labourâs position on Brexit is to focus on a deal that prioritises jobs first. We are all united behind that goal. For us that means membership of the single market. ""A country can be a member of the single market without being a member of the EU and we must be clear â âaccessâ to the European single market is both different and inferior to âmembershipâ of the single market."" The Unison union is having its annual conference in Brighton today, and general secretary Dave Prentis (pictured) had some tough words for the Government. He told assembled members that he planned to campaign against the ""brutal"" Trade Union Act, which aims to make it harder for unions to strike, and wanted to ""smash"" the Government's cap on public sector pay rises. Mr Prentis said: ""This Government's austerity pay policies have crushed public
services under their heel. They have ground down public service employees. They're worried about their jobs, their families and can't go through another
five years of poverty pay. ""Now is the time to shout 'enough is enough'.
 ""This is the year to smash the pay cap. We will not stop taking industrial action because of the draconian
legislation against us."" The FTSE 100 produced a rare result today - compared with its behaviour in recent months. Typically, when the pound falls against the dollar, the FTSE rises. Logic being that, foreign investors can benefit from the low pound and stocks become ""cheaper"" when bought in dollars. This then pushes up the market. However, today was unusual because even though the pound was down (Â£1 is $1.2626 compared to 1.2742 dollars at the previous close) the FTSE was also down. The biggest fallers were primarily mining giants, including Antofagasta, Glencore, BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Anglo American made up five of the seven biggest fallers). And they typically fall when the oil price is down - it fell 2.2% today. So - does this mean the FTSE starting to become more susceptible to oil price movements (as it traditionally was before the Brexit referendum) or will the dollar continue to be the major influence on the market?  For those of you suffering from the heat across much of the country, there has been one big beneficiary of the hot weather. Retail expert Steve Dresser complained earlier that Amazon had run out of fans, leading to Argos revealing it has sold nearly 100,000 fans on Monday. Investors weren't overly impressed with the extra business though. Shares in Sainsbury's (which owns Argos) were down 1.2% today. Allow Twitter content?

appropriate that the US company Boom Supersonic used the Paris air show to
say it has moved a step closer to getting a
Concorde-like passenger plane in the sky. After all, not
one but two Concordes are in the museum at Le Bourget airfield, where the huge
aerospace trade show is being held this week. Boom's founder,
Blake Scholl (pictured), aims to get a 55-seat passenger plane (about half
the number of seats BA offered in its Concorde) flying by 2023 after
getting a sub-scale demonstrator in the air by the end of next
year. Despite having
the likes of Richard Branson as backers, Boom has a long way to go before
passengers are forking out something like $5,000 for a return flight to New
York. That would still be substantially less than the price of a ride on nosiy
old Concorde, though. Ding ding! Stock markets across Europe have closed for the day. The FTSE 100 index of leading companies took a 51.1 point hit, down 0.68%, to 7472.71. Oil prices, comments from S&P and Carney's Brexit gloom all seem to have contributed to the lacklustre day.  The World at OneBBC Radio 4 This video can not be played The Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has used a speech to city leaders at the Mansion House to say he wants to make the economy the top priority in Brexit negotiations. He said the government did not want to shut down migration, and said the customs union could be maintained for a time after the UK leaves the EU, during a 'transitional period' to protect key industries. The chief executive of Siemens in the UK, Juergen Maier, who is leading an industrial strategy review for the government, welcomes the idea of 'transitional' arrangements which he says, will give businesses more time to organise themselves. Mr Maier also told Martha Kearney it had taken a while to get the Brexit talks started, but it was now important to get on with the negotiations. The Prime Minister's link to the business world has quit after just 10 months, according to Joel Hills at ITV News. Theresa May has always had a difficult time trying to win the City over to her point of view - mainly due to the hardline position she took on Brexit before the recent election. General election campaigns typically involve business leaders signing numerous letters in support of Conservative Party policies, but they were remarkably silent this time round. The only letter thatcame along was last week, with the biggest business groups calling for a softer Brexit.

But the main take home comments were he said S&P may not wait until the Brexit terms are known, before shifting its rating down again. S&P cut the UK to AA from AAA after the Brexit vote last year, with a negative outlook. He said: ""We will review the UK every six months... and if necessary more often... We will be watching the economic implications, the implications for the public finances, the constitutional implications like the whole Scotland situation... and things like the currency and if it will maintain its reserve status."" Chris JohnstonBusiness reporter, BBC News There are planes from lesser known manufacturers such as Russiaâs Irkut, and Canadaâs Bombardier, as well as Embraer of Brazil; helicopters, drones, and pretty much anything else that flies. That also includes missiles, with the likes of Raytheon showing off their wares. One of its missiles, the SkyCeptor, is promoted as being âlow-cost but high-performingâ compared with other âhit-to-kill effectorsâ. Although a new passenger jet can cost hundreds of millions of dollars, the global spend on defence aerospace technology leaves commercial aviation in its wake. Itâs no wonder that the hundreds of companies exhibiting at the show go out of their way to encourage the top brass from the air forces of the world to stop way, as well as wooing slightly less visible customers. The bulk of the aerial displays are performed by defence aircraft, be they jet fighters, transporters or helicopters performing sometimes hair-raising manoeuvres at high speed â and high decibels.

We'll be back at 6am sharp tomorrow with more business news and analysis. US stocks fell on Tuesday as investors dumped energy shares following a dive in crude-oil prices. The S&P 500 index closed 0.67% lower at 2,437.03, the Dow Jones lost 0.3% to 21,467.14, and the Nasdaq fell 0.8% to 6,188.03.

US crude-oil prices on have fallen into bear-market territory, defined as a drop of at least 20% from its most recent peak. The fall on the West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil Futures of nearly 3%, sent the cost of a barrel to just under $43 during trading at 4pm, East-coast time. It means we are officially in bear territory because the WTI is down more than 20% from its 52-week high of $55.24 back in January. Good news for Facebook-owned Instagram, as bosses claimed it has increased the number of users for its Stories service by 50m since April. Facebook's global head of sales Carolyn Everson told CNBC: ""If you think about it a year ago when we sat together, Instagram Stories didn't exist. ""Today on the platform, we not only have 250m people using it, but actually a third (of the most viewed stories) are businesses using Instagram Stories and one million are advertisers."" But Instagram's gains have been at the cost of rival Snapchat, which saw its shares dive 3.3% to $17.29 on the back of the news. Instagram Stories overtook Snapchat  in April, when bosses said it had 200m active users. Ms Everson said copycat allegations were not true, because Facebook invented the ""Feed"" format first.

"Human trials of a cholesterol-lowering vaccine to help prevent heart disease are under way after successful studies in mice. Researchers at the Medical University of Vienna are testing thesafety,externalof their experimental treatment in 72 volunteers. The jab is designed to stop fatty deposits from clogging the arteries. It would offer patients an alternative to taking daily pills to cut their risk of stroke, angina and heart attacks. It will take years more of testing to know if the treatment will be safe and effective enough for human use, Dr Guenther Staffler and colleagues from The Netherlands Organisation of Applied Scientific Research say in theEuropean Heart Journal,external. Even if it does become available, in six years' time, it should not be seen as an excuse for people to avoid exercise and eat lots of high-fat food, they add. The jab helps the body's immune system to attack a protein, called PCSK9, that would otherwise allow ""bad"" low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to build up in the bloodstream. The researchers envisage that patients could have a yearly booster shot to top up their immunity. In mice, the treatment cuts LDL cholesterol by up to50% over 12 months,externaland appears to protect against the build-up of fatty deposits in the arteries (atherosclerosis). Blocked arteries impede blood flow Cholesterol is a fatty substance found in the blood. We all need it, but too much ""bad"" LDL cholesterol increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases. ""Good"" high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, on the other hand, is beneficial because it helps transport other types of cholesterol from the blood to the liver, where it can be broken down. Some people have high cholesterol because of an inherited condition called familial hypercholesterolaemia. Poor diet, high alcohol consumption, smoking and inactivity are also linked with high cholesterol. People with high cholesterol can take cholesterol-lowering drugs, called statins, to reduce their risk of cardiovascular disease. But although these are very cheap and effective, they will not work for everyone. Some people dislike taking daily medication or forget to take it because they are feeling well. Rarely, there can be side-effects. Researchers have been looking at alternative treatment options that they can give to patients alongside or instead of statins. The vaccine induces immunity against a protein produced by the body, rather than something foreign The first phase of testing on 72 human volunteers should be completed by the end of the year. This will check if there are any safety issues or side-effects before more studies in people can begin. There is a concern that the therapeutic vaccine might increase the risk of diabetes. The researchers at the Medical University of Vienna who are conducting the human studies will be on the look out for this. Dr Tim Chico, a cardiologist from the University of Sheffield, said: ""Many questions remain about whether this approach could work in man. ""This is yet more proof that cholesterol causes heart disease, and lowering cholesterol reduces risk of heart disease, so it confirms the importance of a healthy lifestyle for everyone and medications such as statins for some people to reduce risk of heart disease."" Prof Sir Nilesh Samani, from the British Heart Foundation, said: ""Finding new ways to manage people's cholesterol levels is absolutely vital. ""Although only tested in mice, this vaccine could lead to a simple way to target high cholesterol and ultimately reduce people's risk of heart disease.""
