"This video can not be played ""I like beer"": Kavanaugh defends his high school drinking during testimony A classmate of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh has accused the judge of lying under oath about ""heavy"" alcoholic drinking. Charles Ludington said he was ""deeply troubled"" by Judge Kavanaugh's ""blatant mischaracterisation"". The judge denies drinking to the point of memory loss. The matter forms part of an FBI inquiry into the judge, as do allegations of sexual assault, which he also denies. President Donald Trump said he had not limited the inquiry's scope. The FBI inquiry has delayed a final vote on Judge Kavanaugh, who if confirmed is likely to make America's highest court more conservative. Rachel Mitchell, the Arizona prosecutor hired by Republicans to question one of the judge's accusers, Prof Christine Blasey Ford, during hearings last week,gave her memo,externalto senators on Sunday. In it, she questioned Prof Ford's credibility, calling her case weak and saying she did not think ""that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the Committee"". What did the classmate say aboutJudgeKavanaugh? Prof Ludington, who teaches at North Carolina State University, said he had seen Judge Kavanaugh slurring his words and staggering after excessive alcohol consumption while at Yale. The professor also said Judge Kavanaugh ""was often belligerent and aggressive"" when drunk. ""I can unequivocally say that in denying the possibility that he ever blacked out from drinking, and in downplaying the degree and frequency of his drinking, Brett has not told the truth."" What will the FBI inquiry actually do? How commonly do drinkers suffer blackouts? Why US top court is more political than UK's He noted that it was not Judge Kavanaugh's drinking habits in college that worried him - it was the fact that he made questionable statements under oath. ""If he lied about his past actions on national television, and more especially while speaking under oath in front of the United States Senate, I believe those lies should have consequences,"" Prof Ludington said. This video can not be played Trump: I'd be the world's worst drinker The professor plans to speak to the FBI on Monday, according to the New York Times. His statement contradicts another Yale classmate - former NBA player Chris Dudley - whotold the Washington Post,externalhe ""never, ever saw Brett Kavanaugh black out"" from alcohol consumption. When asked about Judge Kavanaugh's drinking habits during a news conference on Monday, Mr Trump said he thought his answers during the hearing were ""excellent"". ""He had a little bit of difficulty, he talked about things that happened when he drank,"" Mr Trump said. ""This is not a man who said that he was perfect with respect to alcohol."" The president's son, Donald Trump Jr, has said the #MeToo movement makes him more worried about his sons' future than his daughters'. ""I've got boys. I've got girls,"" Mr Trump Jrtold Daily Mail TV,external. ""And when I see what's going on it's scary."" He added that sexual assault victims should feel ""able to come out and be believed"" with the caveat: ""There has to be some credibility behind it."" This video can not be played How US teens talk about sexual assault Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Washington There was considerable confusion last Friday, when Donald Trump ordered a reopened investigation into the ""credible allegations"" against Brett Kavanaugh. In comments on Monday, the president did little to clear things up. What Mr Trump was clear about, however, was that while Judge Kavanaugh may have had ""difficulty as a young man"" with alcohol, that alone shouldn't disqualify him from the high court. Nobody, the president said, has questioned how the judge has behaved ""in the last 20 years"". Mr Trump's answer was a direct response to Democrats who have suggested that Judge Kavanaugh was less than forthcoming in his testimony under oath about his alcohol use while in high school and college. With the FBI delving into Judge Kavanaugh's background - including receiving a statement from a Yale classmate who says he misrepresented the extent of his alcohol use - there's the chance more details will emerge about Judge Kavanaugh's past actions. With his comments, the president is constructing a line of defence to keep undecided Senate Republicans - the votes necessary to confirm Judge Kavanaugh - from turning against the nominee when the final FBI report comes in. Judge Kavanaugh's behaviour at Yale is under the spotlight, with Prof Ludington and Mr Dudley among several of his classmates who have recently spoken out. The FBI inquiry is expected to be completed within a week. In terms of the sexual assault allegations, US media report that theFBI spoke on Sunday to another of the accusers, Deborah Ramirez. Opposition Democrats have accused the administration of trying to limit the scope of the inquiry, amid media reports that Judge Kavanaugh's third accuser - Julie Swetnick - would not be interviewed. Mr Trump has denied imposing any restrictions, saying he wanted the FBI ""to interview whoever they deem appropriate"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"His love songs have inspired millions, but over the weekend Sir Paul McCartney had a more direct role in the love story of one Canadian couple. The former Beatle was in Winnipeg, Manitoba, for a concert when he photo-bombed a couple taking pictures before their wedding. McCartney passed the couple while riding his bike along the river during his downtime on Saturday. The moment was immortalised by the couple's wedding photographer. Groom Steve Gregg was the first to spot the famous musician. ""He said congratulations as he rode by and Steve said, 'That was Paul McCartney,'""bride Jen Roscoe told the CBC after the pictures were posted online.,external But when McCartney and his two bodyguards hit a dead end, they had to turn around and ride past the couple again. That's when Mr Gregg plucked up the courage to ask for a picture.

"This video can not be played Tsunami survivor: ""I was hugging my wife, but when the wave came... I immediately lost her"" Volunteers have begun burying victims of Indonesia's deadly earthquake and tsunami in a mass grave. Friday's disaster devastated swathes of the eastern Sulawesi island and has left at least 844 people dead. Some remote areas have yet to be contacted, and there are fears that the death toll could rise further. A lack of heavy lifting equipment is hampering rescuers' attempts to reach people who remain alive in the ruins of collapsed buildings. Dozens of people are feared to be underneath the rubble of one hotel alone, the Roa-Roa in the devastated resort of Palu. Volunteers filling a mass grave were instructed to prepare for a total of 1,300 victims to arrive In Sigi, south of Palu, the bodies of 34 children were found at a church which was engulfed in mud and debris, Indonesia Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Arriani was quoted as saying by Reuters. She said the children were on a ""Bible camp"". An aerial photo of the devastation in the Donggala area, north of Palu Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency confirmed to the BBC that none of the country's tsunami detector buoys were working before Sulawesi was hit. Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said the 21 floating detection units - which are connected to deep sea sensors - had been damaged by vandals or stolen. A tsunami warning was still sent out - but it appears to have drastically underestimated the scale of the waves that would follow. Many people in Palu did not receive alerts because of power cuts caused by the tremor. There were also no sirens located along the coast. How warning system failed the victims Why Sulawesi's tsunami is puzzling scientists Air traffic controller hailed as quake hero In pictures: Search for survivors ""Communication is limited, heavy machinery is limited... it's not enough for the numbers of buildings that collapsed,"" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. Yenni Suryani, of Catholic Relief Services, said aid agencies were struggling to get staff into affected areas as the main airport at Palu was damaged, landslides had cut road links and ""power is out almost everywhere"". Some survivors have been looting shops for food, water and fuel, telling reporters they have run out of supplies. Reuters news agency reports that police are escorting aid convoys to prevent supplies being stolen. This video can not be played Indonesia quake looter: ""We need to eat"" President Joko Widodo visited the region, urging a ""day and night"" effort to rescue survivors. Military aircraft have been evacuating some of the injured Government officials say some 1,200 inmates escaped from three prisons in the region as the quake struck. In the hills above Palu, volunteers filling a mass grave were instructed to prepare for a total of 1,300 victims to arrive. Trucks arrived with bodies wrapped in orange, yellow and black body bags. They were dragged into the grave and motorised diggers poured earth on top. But many people are still looking for missing loved ones. Adi told AFP he was hugging his wife by the beach in Palu when the tsunami struck, and has not seen her since. ""When the wave came, I lost her,"" he said. ""I was carried about 50 metres. I couldn't hold anything."" By Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Palu Lying on a stretcher in the dark outside the Mamboro health clinic in Palu is a five-year-old girl with a broken leg. She was found alone, Doctor Sasono tells me. ""We don't know where her family is and she doesn't remember where they live."" His clinic has no power and is running out of medical supplies. A few metres from her stretcher bed are rows of bodies in bags. The smell of decomposition fills the air. Dr Sasono says they will be buried in mass graves to stop the spread of diseases: ""They are starting to smell. We want to wait for relatives to pick them up, but we can't wait any longer."" Rows of rubble lie all along the shoreline where vibrant fishing villages once stood. People's possessions lie smashed together, with cars and boats tossed around by the massive waves. Amid the rubble are tents where families are sleeping out in the open. Read Rebecca's first full report from the disaster zone The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles),externaljust off Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday, setting off a tsunami.

"A budget airline that began offering long-haul flights from UK airports earlier this year, including Stansted to the US, has collapsed. Primera Air said it was ceasing all operations at midnight on Monday after 14 years of operations. Flights to Washington and New York due to leave Stansted on Monday night were grounded and passengers have been told not to go to the airport on Tuesday. One flight from Birmingham to Malaga arrived on Monday evening. The airline, which had 15 planes, began offering low-cost flights from Stansted and Birmingham to North America - including Washington, Newark, and Toronto - earlier this year. Flights from Manchester to Malaga were due to start later this month. Most of the airline's business involved taking Scandinavian holidaymakers to destinations such as Spain, Greece, Italy, Egypt and Turkey. Canadian Angela Dorau and her husband are stranded in Paris Canadian Angela Dorau was in a queue to board a plane from Paris to Toronto with her husband when there was an announcement saying the flight had been cancelled. She said: ""Everybody was stranded. Currently my husband and I are in a dumpy motel by the airport trying to frantically scrounge together the funds to pay for another way home."" They are yet to find an alternative flight home - and she says what was supposed to be a budget trip looks like costing them an extra â¬2,000 (Â£1,780). The UK's Civil Aviation Authority has advised passengers who have travelled on an outward Primera flight they willneed to make their own arrangements,externalto return to the UK. The Danish-registered airline is not part of the Civil Aviation Authority's ATOL Protection scheme, which covers only passengers booked on package holidays. If you've paid by credit card for your flight, and paid more than Â£100, you may be able to claim compensation from your credit card firm under Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974. If you've paid by debit card, and paid more than Â£100, you could try to contact your bank and ask about ""chargeback"". However, to get this form of compensation, your bank would need to claw back your money from Primera, which is insolvent. If you booked through a travel agent which is ATOL-protected, you may be able to claim compensation via your travel agent. If you have travel insurance, and your insurance covers insolvency, you may be able to claim from your insurance firm. Consumer group Which? advises that you should contact your credit card issuer, travel agent, or insurer as soon as possible.

She flew out on Saturday and was due to come back this Thursday.Antony Meadley I was on a flight back to Newark (New Jersey) that was meant to depart at 5:55...an announcement went out at around 5:30. No one was given any plans, and everyone was just asked to leave...a horrible experience.Nickolaus Lachman The airline said it had failed to secure long-term financing, meaning it had ""no choice"" but to file for bankruptcy. Primera's decision to start competing with other low-cost long-haul operators such as Norwegian and Wow appears to have led to its demise. Signs that the airline was in trouble came in August, when it saidshort-haul flights from Birminghamto seven European destinations would end on 3 September. It also blamed the late arrival of new aircraft from Airbus that forced it to cancel flights and lease planes. When it began long-haul operations from Stansted in May, Primera was offering flights to New York's Newark airport, Boston, Washington DC and Toronto starting at Â£149 each way. It had planned to start flying from Madrid to New York, Boston and Toronto next month from â¬149 each way. Airline analyst Alex Macheras told the BBC the airline's growth ""simply wasn't sustainable"". ""The general feeling in the industry was: this airline is travelling a bit too fast in terms of their expansion with a fleet of that size,"" he said.

"One tenant Rrouse said kitchen units fell off the wall in a property he lived in Tenants living in shared houses in England could face eviction or increases in rent because of changes to government rules, the National Landlords Association (NLA) has warned. From Monday an extra 160,000 houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) have to be registered with local councils, almost triple the current figure. Tenants Union UK said any increases in rent would be unfair on tenants. The government said the new rules would raise housing standards for tenants. HMOs are homes where people, who are not related, sleep in separate rooms but share facilities such as kitchens or bathrooms. Mainly students, migrants and low-paid workers live in the half a million HMO properties in England. Currently about 64,000 of these HMOs are required to be licensed but the rule changes mean more properties will be required to be inspected and certificated by local authorities. Previously only houses of more than three storeys and with five or more people forming at least two households had to be licensed. The new rules remove the three-storey threshold,externaland apply to smaller homes. Rrouse says some of the HMOs in Leeds are the worst in the country because of their poor condition Rrouse, an environmental engineer from Leeds, has been living in HMOs for the past nine years, as he tries to save money to buy a house. ""Property prices are so high, so saving for a deposit is hard work, and rents for one-bed flats are extortionate. So the only way I can afford to build a deposit is to live in a HMO,"" he said. ""It's a sociable way to rent, but the quality of the properties can vary. I've had HMOs where gas leaks have been common, carpets haven't been fitted and whole kitchen units have fallen off the wall."" Figures from the Valuation Office Agency,externalshow that the private median rent for a room in England in 2017-18 was Â£385 a month. Over the past three years median room rents in England have risen twice as fast as median wages, leaving tenants like Rrouse concerned about any future increases. ""If rents do go up because of this new legislation I've got friends who'll struggle to pay their rent because they just haven't got the cash,"" he said. The Centre for Economics and Business Research estimates the licensing process will on average cost landlords Â£1,200 each, and collectively, more than Â£95m. Landlords say the extra licensing costs will result in rents having to be increased. Some landlords are also expected to reduce the number of rooms they rent out, meaning existing tenants would face eviction. The new rules, which only apply to properties in England, will also require landlords to provide extra refuse bins and make sure bedrooms within HMOs are a minimum size. An HMO is a property occupied by more than one household and by more than two people. For a property to be classified as an HMO, the residents must be sharing at least one basic amenity (i.e. toilet, bathroom or kitchen) Examples of HMOs include bedsits, shared houses, student halls and hostels Under the old licensing scheme HMOs that were three or more storeys and occupied by five or more people forming at least two separate households were required to be licensed The new mandatory licensing of HMOs will be extended so that smaller properties (i.e. any storey height) that house five or more people in two or more separate households will also require a licence Source: Centre for Economics and Business Research The NLA said the new regulations though are the latest burden being placed on private sector landlords. ""Extra regulation will increase landlords costs,"" says Richard Lambert, chief executive of the NLA. ""When costs go up, like any other business, landlords will look to pass on that additional cost in the price, meaning tenants will pay more in rent. ""Some landlords will also reduce the number of rooms they rent out to try and comply with the legislation, meaning some tenants will face eviction."" More than half of the 500,000 HMOs are now required to be licensed because of the new legislation If you live in an HMO your landlord must: Keep shared areas clean and in good repair - for example staircases and corridors Install smoke alarms and provide a fire escape Repair faulty gas and electrical appliances - the property has to have a gas safety check every year and the electrics must be checked every five years If your home does not meet the safety standards you should first complain to your landlord. If the problem is not fixed then you are advised to contact your local council. The council should inspect the property and can tell your landlord to fix the problem if it does not meet safety standards. If the landlord still does not follow the advice, the council can take over the management of the home in serious cases, such as your health or safety being at serious risk. If this happens, usually for a 12-month period, your tenancy rights stay the same and you pay your rent to the council. Source: Citizens Advice The number of HMO licences has been increasing in recent years as more people look to rent privately. Data from about 200 councils in England, obtained by a BBC Freedom of Information request, suggested the number of HMO licences has nearly trebled since 2013. Rogue landlords targeted by government Can a landlord kick me out? Number of middle-aged renters doubles Ben Clay, from Tenants Union UK, said it would be wrong for landlords to increase rents because of the introduction of new legislation. ""Renters are already facing a perfect storm of rent increases at a time when more people are having to deal with shrinking wage packets,"" he added. ""We welcome this additional legislation, but we feel that there is still further to go and that all rented accommodation should be subject to regulation, to ensure standards rise."" The Ministry of Housing and Local Government said the new rules would help protect at least 850,000 more people in privately-rented homes. A spokesman said: ""While the vast majority of landlords provide decent accommodation, these measures are about raising standards in private rented homes where landlords knowingly flout their responsibilities. ""Many of the properties that will be covered by the new rules, already fall under existing licensing schemes that will be transferred into mandatory licensing free of charge, so there will be no additional costs to those landlords.""

"The statues of Matilda and Donald Trump are on show in the Buckinghamshire village where Roald Dahl lived for 36 years Children's character Matilda has been portrayed as a statue standing up to US president Donald Trump to celebrate the book's 30th anniversary. The figures at the Roald Dahl Museum in Buckinghamshire were created as part of a ""reimagining"" of the schoolgirl, three decades on. Trump was the public's top choice for the heroine's modern-day nemesis, the Roald Dahl Story Company said. Matilda stood up to headmistress Miss Trunchbull in the 1988 book. The temporary statues at Great Missenden, where Dahl lived for 36 years, are positioned in fields opposite the town's library. The building was the inspiration for Mrs Phelps' library, where Matilda devours classic literature by the age of four and three months. Roald Dahl, pictured in 1971 Donald Trump topped the poll, ahead of Theresa May and Piers Morgan Bernie Hall, from The Roald Dahl Story Company, said: ""Matilda demonstrates that it's possible for anyone, no matter how small and powerless they feel, to defeat the Trunchbulls in their own lives - a message that feels even more relevant today than it did 30 years ago."" As part of the celebrations, Sir Quentin Blake has drawn eight images of Matilda Wormwood aged in her 30s. Roald Dahl, who also wrote The BFG, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach, died in 1990, aged 74. Four-year paint job on college gate Watch: 'How a wig changed my life' Why are dusters often yellow? To mark the anniversary Sir Quentin Blake has drawn what Matilda Wormwood would be doing in her 30s Mr Trump topped a public poll about what Matilda's life would be like now, including who she would be standing up to, with Prime Minister Theresa May coming second and TV presenter Piers Morgan third. More than half of those who voted said that she would also remain best friends with fellow student Lavender, while fans thought Bruce Bogtrotter - who devoured a whole cake in the book - would now be a Great British Bake Off contestant.

"This video can not be played Philip Hammond predicts a Brexit ""deal dividend"" The Conservatives cannot afford to look like the party of ""no change"", Chancellor Philip Hammond has warned colleagues. Mr Hammond said the Tories could not ""outspend"" Jeremy Corbyn's Labour with ""short-term gimmicks"". Instead he said they urgently needed to make the case for capitalism and ""take our people with us"". Speaking at the Conservative conference in Birmingham, he called for unity and a vision beyond Brexit. ""More than ever Britain will need strong leadership,"" he said. He told delegates that in case ""anyone, anywhere"" was in doubt, the Tories will ""always will be the party of business"". And he defended Theresa May's under-fire plan for post-Brexit trade with the EU, which has been dismissed by Brussels. ""That's what people said about the lightbulb in 1878,"" he said, claiming there would be a boost to the economy if a deal is agreed. Would young voters back Tories for Â£10,000? Get serious on Brexit deal, Raab warns EU Warning over 'stalling' tech tax talks Earlier Mr Hammond faced questions about his remarks apparently mocking ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson - one of the leading critics of the government's strategy - in a newspaper interview. Mr Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he did not want to talk about Mr Johnson, and ""get into the personalities"". But asked abouthis Daily Mail interview,externalin which he reportedly mimicked the former foreign secretary and said the former Leave campaign leader had ""never been a detail man"", he said: ""All of us are different in politics. ""Boris Johnson is a big picture man, a big character on the political stage. But this is a very detailed and complex negotiation. This video can not be played Tories applaud Sir Digby Jones's attack on Boris Johnson ""It doesn't require big sweeping statements, it requires meticulous attention to the negotiation strategy. ""Hundreds of civil servants are working round the clock on negotiating this package with the European Union and it requires that level of attention to detail."" The chancellor also said he would be revealing more about proposed tax rises to pay for extra NHS spending at the Budget, which takes place on 29 October. Johnson sets out 'better Brexit plan' What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? No deal? EU may leave UK with 'no choice' For Labour, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the chancellor's speech ""confirmed the bankrupt state of the Tory party, increasingly irrelevant and cut off from the real day to day life most people experience"". He added:  ""As the Tories sink into a pit of bitter infighting, we mustn't allow them to take the country down with it."" On Saturday former Brexit ministerSteve Baker attacked the Confederation of British Industry,external- which has warned about the prospects of the UK leaving the EU without a deal - calling them a ""grave menace to the political stability and economic prospects of the UK"". CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn responded by saying they represented 190,000 businesses and warning that ""shooting the messenger gets the country nowhere"". Ms Fairbairn was happier with the messages in Mr Hammond's speech, saying: ""Pride and confidence in British business has for too long been missing in Westminster. It made a comeback in the chancellor's speech today."" And on the main stage at the Tory conference on Sunday, the businessman and peer Lord Digby Jones - who was part of the Leave campaign and a former CBI chief - said reports Mr Johnson had used the f-word when referring to businesses' Brexit concerns ""showed him up for the irrelevant and offensive person he really is"". MeanwhileCity grandee Michael Spencer, a long-standing Tory donor, told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg that the party have ""lost their way"" and the PM had ""let herself down"" by failing to champion business.

"Customers have reported problems charging the iPhone XS and XS Max Apple has remained silent amid complaints that its new iPhone XS and XS Max smartphones fail to charge consistently when plugged in. Several users have reported that their device refuses to charge if it has been idle for a while. Some charge only if  the display is ""woken up"". Video blogger Lewis Hilsenteger dubbed the issue ""chargegate"" in a video demonstrating the problem. However, Apple has not yet commented on the issue. Mr Hilsenteger presents the Unbox Therapy channel on YouTube, which has more than 12 million subscribers. In a video published on Saturday, hetested nine iPhones,externalby plugging them into an official Apple power supply. While the 2017 iPhone X charged without problem, many of the new XS and XS Max phones refused to charge when plugged in. Most of the phones would charge only when the display was activated to wake up the device. However, one of them would not charge at all. Mr Hilsenteger said he had been alerted to the problem when a viewer had emailed him describing their troubles. He had not noticed the issue himself because he used wireless charging rather than the power cable on his device. ""Responding to those people on a platform like this should bring light to it and hopefully some sort of software fix, if possible,"" he said in the video. ""This is my job. I have to call this stuff out. I have to hold these companies accountable."" Several complaints about the XS and XS Max failing to charge have also been posted on Apple's discussion forum on its website. Complaints can also be found on social media, where some people have described being unable to charge their phone at all once the battery is exhausted. Some users have speculated that the problem is related to a recent change in Apple's security settings. Since iOS 11.4.1 was released, the lightning port on iPhones can be disabled when the phone has been idle for a while.  That could stop thieves, cyber-attackers or law enforcement officers accessing it. ""In some cases, it might not charge,"" the company advises on itswebsite,external. However, that does not explain why more iPhone XS and XS Max users are facing the issue. Apple has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment.

"This video can not be played Natasha's grandmother discovered the sandwich had sesame in it, Mr Ednan-Laperouse tells the Victoria Derbyshire programme A man whose daughter died after eating a Pret A Manger sandwich on a flight has described how he had to ring his wife to say she would die. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, went into cardiac arrest on a flight to Nice after buying the baguette at Heathrow Airport in 2016. Her father, Nadim, said her symptoms came on very fast, ""like an explosion"". ""I called my wife and told her to say goodbye. I knew she was going to die,"" he said. Natasha, from Fulham, west London, ate an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette and became ill after buying it at Terminal 5 early on 17 July 2016. Despite being administered with two EpiPens by her father, Natasha was declared dead at University Hospital of Nice later the same day Mr Ednan-Laperouse said halfway through the British Airways flight, she became severely allergic in reaction to sesame seeds contained in the sandwich, before dying later on the same day. ""Her whole body was covered in huge raised red welts - rather like as if she had been stung by hundreds of jellyfish,"" he toldBBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""That was the first time I had ever seen something like that - so it was clear to me it was a very very powerful allergenic reaction. ""She was feeling very unwell and then started having big difficulties in breathing."" The inquest into her death heard that sesame was not listed as an ingredient on the baguette's packaging. Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette death? EpiPen shortage 'worrying' users Pret taking risks, say allergy sufferers Mr Ednan-Laperouse said he injected his daughter with adrenaline from two EpiPens as she became unwell, but unfortunately they did not work. He added: ""Natasha said that she still couldn't breathe and desperately looked at me, she said: 'Daddy, help me, I can't breathe'. ""Those were her last words."" Her mother Tanya, described the last time she spoke to her daughter over the phone. ""Nad called me to say that she was going to die within a minute, maybe two, and that I had to say goodbye to her,"" she said. ""He said to me: 'This is the only chance, you have to say goodbye'. ""The grief began immediately after I spoke to her and then I actually collapsed. ""I was aware there were a lot of people around me so I couldn't scream or howl. ""I just literally fell. I was engulfed by grief. I lost the ability to stand or even to get up again."" UK regulations mean some foods can be sold without individual labels denoting which allergens they contain At the inquest,the court heard Pret did not label ""artisan"" baguettes as containing sesame seeds, despite there being six allergic reaction cases in the year before Natasha died. Her family are now campaigning for a change in food labelling laws, which they described as having ""played Russian roulette"" with their daughter's life. ""Things need to change now,"" Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said. ""In my eyes, tomorrow is not soon enough. It's not difficult to label products with allergens. ""Nobody else should ever have to suffer such a needless death."" In response, Pret chief executive Clive Schlee, said: ""We cannot begin to comprehend the pain the family have felt, and the grief they will continue to feel.

"Mylee Billingham died after being found stabbed at her father's home An eight-year-old girl, alleged to have been murdered by her father, had two ""defensive"" wounds to her hands, apparently caused as she tried to ward off a knife, a court has heard. Mylee Billingham also had an injury near her lip suggesting a hand was placed over her mouth, a forensic pathologist told jurors. She died from a single stab wound to the chest on 20 January in Brownhills, near Walsall. William Billingham, 55, denies murder. Giving evidence via video-link, Home Office-accredited pathologist Brett Lockyer said injuries found during a post-mortem examination included a ""superficial"" linear incised wound on her right middle finger. This video can not be played CCTV shows Mylee Billingham and her father Asked to comment on the wound and another injury to Mylee's left hand, Dr Lockyer told Birmingham Crown Court: ""This type of injury could be caused by sharp force with a weapon with a cutting edge, such as a knife or glass. Latest news and stories from the West Midlands ""It's in an area that can be regarded as defensive. I would regard this as being suggestive of a defensive-type mechanism."" The trial has previously heard claims Mr Billingham, a father-of-six, was struggling to cope with Mylee's mother, his ex-partner, Tracey Taundry'sMiss Taundry's decision to start a new relationship. Mr Billingham, of Valley View, Brownhills, did not attend the fourth day of his trial because of illness. William Billingham denies murdering his daughter Mylee Explaining the defendant's absence from the dock to jurors, Judge Paul Farrer QC said: ""Overnight he has been unwell and I am quite satisfied he is not well enough at the moment to be in court. ""Clearly it's not Mr Billingham's fault that he is not here and it's not something that you should hold against him in any way."" Mr Billingham also denies making a threat to kill Mylee's mother.

"Cern, based in Switzerland, is one of the world's largest centres for scientific research A senior scientist who said physics ""was invented and built by men"" has been suspended with immediate effect from working with the European nuclear research centre Cern. Prof Alessandro Strumia, of Pisa University, made the comments during a presentation organised by the group. He said,in comments first reported by the BBC's Pallab Ghosh, that physics was ""becoming sexist against men"". Cern said on Monday it was suspending Prof Strumia pending an investigation. It stated that his presentation was ""unacceptable"".

He produced a series of graphs,externalwhich, he claimed, showed that women were hired over men whose research was cited more by other scientists in their publications, which is an indication of higher quality.

Prof Strumia claimed there were examples where men were discriminated against Another one of the slides from Alessandro Strumia's talk at Cern When the BBC contacted Prof Strumia he said: ""People say that physics is sexist, physics is racist. I made some simple checks and discovered that it wasn't, that it was becoming sexist against men and said so."" Last month, Prof Jocelyn Bell Burnell told the BBC she believed thatunconscious bias against women prevented them from getting jobs in physics research. Anda major study published in 2012 in the US scientific journal PNAS,externalshowed that science faculty members rated identical job applications more highly when presented to them with a male name rather than a female name. Scientists reacted to Prof Strumia's presentation on social media, complaining about discrimination they had suffered in the course of their work. Allow Twitter content?

"The statues of Matilda and Donald Trump are on show in the Buckinghamshire village where Roald Dahl lived for 36 years Children's character Matilda has been portrayed as a statue standing up to US president Donald Trump to celebrate the book's 30th anniversary. The figures at the Roald Dahl Museum in Buckinghamshire were created as part of a ""reimagining"" of the schoolgirl, three decades on. Trump was the public's top choice for the heroine's modern-day nemesis, the Roald Dahl Story Company said. Matilda stood up to headmistress Miss Trunchbull in the 1988 book. The temporary statues at Great Missenden, where Dahl lived for 36 years, are positioned in fields opposite the town's library. The building was the inspiration for Mrs Phelps' library, where Matilda devours classic literature by the age of four and three months. Roald Dahl, pictured in 1971 Donald Trump topped the poll, ahead of Theresa May and Piers Morgan Bernie Hall, from The Roald Dahl Story Company, said: ""Matilda demonstrates that it's possible for anyone, no matter how small and powerless they feel, to defeat the Trunchbulls in their own lives - a message that feels even more relevant today than it did 30 years ago."" As part of the celebrations, Sir Quentin Blake has drawn eight images of Matilda Wormwood aged in her 30s. Roald Dahl, who also wrote The BFG, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and James and the Giant Peach, died in 1990, aged 74. Four-year paint job on college gate Watch: 'How a wig changed my life' Why are dusters often yellow? To mark the anniversary Sir Quentin Blake has drawn what Matilda Wormwood would be doing in her 30s Mr Trump topped a public poll about what Matilda's life would be like now, including who she would be standing up to, with Prime Minister Theresa May coming second and TV presenter Piers Morgan third. More than half of those who voted said that she would also remain best friends with fellow student Lavender, while fans thought Bruce Bogtrotter - who devoured a whole cake in the book - would now be a Great British Bake Off contestant.

"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""If the EU want a deal, they need to get serious"" The minister responsible for Brexit has told the EU to ""get real"" and reach a deal with the UK. Dominic Raab also said EU chiefs had disrespected Theresa May with ""jibes"" at a recent summit. He said the UK would leave without a deal rather than be ""bullied"" into signing a ""one-sided"" arrangement. Meanwhile EU figures hit back after Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt likened it to a Soviet-era prison, comments diplomats called ""insulting"". In a speech to the Conservative conference on Sunday, Mr Hunt compared what he said were the EU's attempts to stop members leaving with the actions of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. BBC Parliament: Live coverage of Conservative conference Tories must offer change, says Hammond Warning over 'stalling' tech tax talks Kuenssberg: Bumpy week expected His words were criticised by a number of European politicians and diplomats while a European Commission spokesman suggested everyone ""could benefit from opening a history book from time to time"". Speaking in Birmingham on Monday, Mr Raab said the government's proposed deal with the EU was not ""perfect"" but he urged Tory Eurosceptics who are campaigning for the plan to be ditched to get behind it. And Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted that there would be an economic bounce if and when a Brexit deal was agreed by the UK and the EU. He reminded people saying that a deal could not be struck that people had had the same scepticism about the electric light bulb ever working. This video can not be played Why the Chequers plan is on the rocks... With less than six months to go before Brexit day, the UK and the EU have not yet reached a deal on how separation will be managed and what their new relationship will look like. Mr Raab said that if the EU insisted on trying to ""lock us in via the back door"" of its customs union and single market, the UK could be left with ""no choice"" but to leave without a deal. The ""whole of the government machine is busy preparing for no deal"" - not because they want it to happen or because it's likely, but ""because it might happen"", he said. He dismissed ""lurid predictions from the prophets of doom"" about no-deal, including planes being grounded and ports blocked. This video can not be played Conservative Party splits - what do members think? Even if the UK did not reach an agreement with the EU, he said: ""I find it hard to believe that they would, for narrow political ends, seek to punish Britain in such a crass and counterproductive way."" Mr Raab criticised the EU over its reaction to Theresa May's proposals at last month's summit in Salzburg. ""Our Prime Minister has been constructive and respectful,"" he said. ""In return we heard jibes from senior leaders, and we saw a starkly one-sided approach to negotiation."" Brexiteers feel it keeps the UK far too close to Brussels and doesn't fulfil the Leave campaign's promise during the 2016 referendum campaign to ""take back control"". EU leaders have rejected the plan because they believe it would undermine the single market by allowing the UK to ""cherry pick"" from EU law. Theresa May says the ball is now in the EU's court and she wants a more detailed response from them on their objections. The government has said it will not agree to anything that divides Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK nor makes the country a member of the European Economic Area like Norway. One of the most vocal critics of the government's Brexit approach has been former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who branded Theresa May's plan ""deranged"" in a newspaper interview at the weekend. Despite not being in Birmingham, Mr Johnson made an eye-catching appearance as he was photographed running through fields near his Oxfordshire home. Given that Mrs May famously said her naughtiest moment was running through fields of wheat as a child, some pundits are wondering whether this was an attempt to ""troll"" the PM by the former Leave campaign frontman, who resigned in protest at the Chequers plan in July. Jeremy Hunt has seemingly provoked a diplomatic row after accusing the EU of seeking to punish the UK in order to ""keep the club together"". In Sunday's speech, he recalled a visit to Latvia earlier this summer and the role that the UK and others played in helping it transition from Soviet rule to becoming a modern democracy and market economy. ""What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream?"", he asked. ""The EU was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving."" Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, tweeted that the remarks were ""outrageous and offensive"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Cern, based in Switzerland, is one of the world's largest centres for scientific research A senior scientist has given what has been described as a ""highly offensive"" presentation about the role of women in physics, the BBC has learned. At a workshop organised by Cern, Prof Alessandro Strumia of Pisa University said that ""physics was invented and built by men, it's not by invitation"". He said male scientists were being discriminated against because of ideology rather than merit. He was speaking at a workshop in Geneva on gender and high energy physics. Prof Strumia has since defended his comments, saying he was only presenting the facts. Cern, the European nuclear research centre, described Prof Strumia's presentation as ""highly offensive"". The centre, which discovered the Higgs Boson in 2012, has removed slides used in the talk from its website ""in line with a code of conduct that does not tolerate personal attacks and insults"". Prof Strumia, who regularly works at Cern, presented the results of a study of published research papers from an online library. He told his audience of young, predominantly female physicists that his results ""proved"" that ""physics is not sexist against women. However the truth does not matter, because it is part of a political battle coming from outside"". He produced a series of graphs,externalwhich, he claimed, showed that women were hired over men whose research was cited more by other scientists in their publications, which is an indication of higher quality. He also presented data that he claimed showed that male and female researchers were equally cited at the start of their careers but men scored progressively better as their careers progressed. Seven trailblazing women in science Female scientists post 'distractingly sexy' photos Viewpoint: Women must fight sexism in science Prof Strumia pointed to behavioural research which he suggested may account for the disparity. One study, he told his audience, indicated that ""men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people"" and another, he claimed, suggested that there was a ""difference even in children before any social influence"". Prof Alessandro Strumia is based at Pisa University in Italy Prof Strumia said that these conclusions may ""not be fully right... (but) the opposite assumption of identical brains is ideology"". As evidence of discrimination against male researchers, Prof Strumia claimed that ""Oxford University extends exam times for women's benefit"" and ""Italy offers free or cheaper university for female (research) students"". He also said that he himself was overlooked for a job that he was more qualified for, which was given to a woman. Dr Jessica Wade, a physicist at Imperial College London who was at the meeting, told BBC News that Prof Strumia's analysis was simplistic, drawing on ideas that had ""long been discredited"". ""It was really upsetting to those at the workshop,"" she said. ""There were young women and men exchanging ideas and their experiences on how to encourage more women into the subject and to combat discrimination in their careers. Then this man gets up, saying all this horrible stuff."" She added: ""I don't understand how such a forward thinking organisation like Cern, which does so much to promote diversity in research, could have invited him to speak to young people just starting off in their research careers when his ideas are so well known."" Prof Strumia claimed there were examples where men were discriminated against Another one of the slides from Alessandro Strumia's talk at Cern In a statement, Cern - which currently has its first ever woman director-general - said that the organisers were not aware of the content of the talk,externalprior to the workshop. ""Cern is a culturally diverse organisation bringing together people from dozens of nationalities. It is a place where everyone is welcome, and all have the same opportunities, regardless of ethnicity, beliefs, gender or sexual orientation,"" it said. A Cern spokesman confirmed that there was a video recording of the presentation. Senior managers would decide whether to release part or all of it, it said.

A rights activist said the killers wanted to ""force women to shut themselves away at home"" Ms Qassem - who has 2.7 million followers on Instagram,external- tearfully revealed in a video posted on Saturday that she had received text messages saying ""you are next"" following the killing of Ms Fares. She said women who had made a name for themselves in Iraq faced being ""slaughtered like chickens"" and described Ms Fares as a ""martyr"". Ms Fares, 22, was killed when two motorcyclists opened fire at her car in broad daylight in the Camp Sarah area of central Baghdad. She had been living in the city of Irbil in the Kurdistan region for the past three year because she felt it was safer, but she occasionally travelled to the capital. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Fares was reportedly threatened and insulted on social media over her perceived lack of modesty, and some have speculated that religious extremists may have targeted her. The founder of the human rights group, the Iraqi al-Amal Association, Hanaa Edwar, told AFP news agency that the recent murders appeared to be ""threatening messages sent to activists in particular, but also to the whole of society"".

"This video can not be played Neighbour describes Mylee Billingham murder scene A man who stabbed his eight-year-old daughter in the chest in an apparent act of revenge against his ex-partner has been found guilty of murder. William Billingham, 55, used a kitchen knife to kill Mylee after ignoring her screams as he dragged her into his bungalow near Walsall on 20 January. Birmingham Crown Court heard he killed her moments after holding the blade to the neck of her mother, Tracey Taundry. Billingham was convicted of murder and making a threat to kill Miss Taundry. The jurors deliberated for about 80 minutes before unanimously convicting Billingham of the two charges. The unemployed factory worker opted not to give evidence and claimed he had no memory of stabbing Mylee. He said he was guilty of the lesser offence of manslaughter due to depression. Prosecutors said Billingham had ""turned his anger"" on Mylee to spite Miss Taundry after she began a relationship with a woman. Latest news and updates from the West Midlands The trial had heard how Billingham, who had six children with three women, produced a knife when his ex-partner arrived at his home in Brownhills to pick up their daughter. William Billingham admitted manslaughter due to depression but denied murder Miss Taundry told the court she heard the ""tink"" of the knife as she waited for Mylee to get a bag from inside. He told Miss Taundry ""I'm going to kill you"" before dragging Mylee back inside as she screamed ""mummy, mummy"" and ""please daddy, no daddy, stop it"", prosecutors said. CCTV footage of Billingham and Mylee visiting a local shop just hours before the stabbing was shown in court. Shortly afterwards, he posted a picture on Facebook of his daughter smiling. At 21:14 police responded to a 999 call of Billingham wielding a knife, moments after Miss Taundry arrived at the bungalow. This video can not be played CCTV shows Mylee Billingham and her father At the start of the trial, prosecutor Karim Khalil QC said of the killing: ""It was swift, deliberate, clinical, brutal. ""It was not some manic, unfocused assault. ""This was no accident and it was not a slight injury. It was a deep, violent thrust of a lethal weapon into the most vulnerable part of his young daughter's body."" Billingham - who stabbed himself in the stomach at the scene - ignored police requests for information about what had happened to Mylee as she lay injured on the floor. He had told officers he was a ""brilliant"" dad, but was assessed by forensic psychiatrist Philip Joseph who found him to be controlling and prone to violence. Mr Joseph told jurors: ""He has a particular difficulty in coping with the end of relationships and is likely to behave in an aggressive and intimidating manner."" Billingham was convicted of causing actual bodily harm in 1990 for an attack on his then girlfriend. He was cautioned in 2007 after Mylee's mother alleged he slapped her in the face. In accounts of his behaviour by two former partners, one woman claimed she had returned home to find Billingham hiding under her bed with a knife. Billingham told Tracey Taundry he would kill her before he murdered their daughter The woman alleged he then sat on a balcony holding their son and asked: ""Haven't you forgotten something?"" After the verdicts, Judge Paul Farrer QC said Billingham underwent an operation part-way through the trial after injuring his wrists while on remand. He missed three days of his trial due to a stay in hospital after the apparent attempt to end his life on 21 September. The jury had been told to ignore bandages covering Billingham's lower arms when he appeared in the dock. After the trial, Det Insp Jim Colclough, of West Midlands Police, said of the killing: ""It's the most selfish act you can think of.  It is the greatest breach of trust you can imagine. ""Mylee had every reason to believe that Billingham was the most trusted person in the world."" He described the 999 call as a ""terrible thing to listen to"". ""Officers were in the address for tens of minutes working on Mylee and at that time Tracey was unaware as to how serious the events were that had unfolded inside that address."" ""She will never heal from this situation. Mylee will always be missing. She will always be missing a daughter and Mylee's sisters will always be missing a sister.""

"The university made it ""clear"" it does not promote sex work A university has insisted it is not promoting prostitution after a sex workers' support group was given a stall at its freshers' fair.

But critics of the idea have included feminist campaigner and writer Julie Bindel, co-founder of law reform group Justice for Women. She said: ""This is beyond disgraceful.

"Honour of Kings has more than 200 million registered users One of China's most popular video games is testing the use of facial recognition to check users' ages. Honour of Kings' publisher Tencent announced the move at the weekend. It said the trial would initially,externalbe limited to ""thousands"" of new players based in Beijing and Shenzhen. The title has been criticised in local media overclaims children have become addicted to it,external. But one expert questioned whether the test could be scaled up. The mobile app resembles League of Legends and pits players against each other in multiplayer online battles set in a fantasy world. State data to limit China child gamers China targets gaming to fight myopia China yanks sale of Monster Hunter World Under pressure from local regulators, Tencentintroduced restrictions in July 2017to limit under-12s to one hour of gameplay a day and 13- to 18-year-olds to a maximum of two hours. Last month, the company added a real-name registration system to encourage players to keep to the rules. The facial-recognition test appears to be a further effort to discourage young players from trying to circumvent the time limits. Tencent said arandom selection of new players,externalwould be assigned to the test when they first signed into the game. But it has not disclosed the technology it will use to carry out the scans or how it intends to cross-reference the resulting IDs. Tencent highlighted that many users had previously voiced concerns about the idea of it using facial ID checks in games and said it would evaluate the results of the real-world trial ""in depth"". The Chinese state is currently engaged in a wider campaign to control video gaming. In addition to concerns over addiction, there have been warnings the activity could be linked to rising levels of near-sightedness. Regulators required Tencent to withdraw a localised version of another game - Monster Hunter World - in August In August, the ministry of educationannounced plans to develop its own age-restriction systemand to limit the number of online games available. But one expert questioned whether the latest move would be a success. ""This test is an extension of Tencent's existing Youth Guardian platform, which allows parents to monitor gameplay time and uses facial recognition, but this goes a step further by comparing user images with government photo records,"" said Piers Harding-Rolls, from the IHS consultancy. ""It is inevitable that this sort of technology will hold some limitations especially for younger children that go through a lot of facial changes as they grow. ""However, facial recognition technology is improving all the time.""

"Cern, based in Switzerland, is one of the world's largest centres for scientific research A senior scientist has given what has been described as a ""highly offensive"" presentation about the role of women in physics, the BBC has learned. At a workshop organised by Cern, Prof Alessandro Strumia of Pisa University said that ""physics was invented and built by men, it's not by invitation"". He said male scientists were being discriminated against because of ideology rather than merit. He was speaking at a workshop in Geneva on gender and high energy physics. Prof Strumia has since defended his comments, saying he was only presenting the facts. Cern, the European nuclear research centre, described Prof Strumia's presentation as ""highly offensive"". The centre, which discovered the Higgs Boson in 2012, has removed slides used in the talk from its website ""in line with a code of conduct that does not tolerate personal attacks and insults"". Prof Strumia, who regularly works at Cern, presented the results of a study of published research papers from an online library. He told his audience of young, predominantly female physicists that his results ""proved"" that ""physics is not sexist against women. However the truth does not matter, because it is part of a political battle coming from outside"". He produced a series of graphs,externalwhich, he claimed, showed that women were hired over men whose research was cited more by other scientists in their publications, which is an indication of higher quality. He also presented data that he claimed showed that male and female researchers were equally cited at the start of their careers but men scored progressively better as their careers progressed. Seven trailblazing women in science Female scientists post 'distractingly sexy' photos Viewpoint: Women must fight sexism in science Prof Strumia pointed to behavioural research which he suggested may account for the disparity. One study, he told his audience, indicated that ""men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people"" and another, he claimed, suggested that there was a ""difference even in children before any social influence"". Prof Alessandro Strumia is based at Pisa University in Italy Prof Strumia said that these conclusions may ""not be fully right... (but) the opposite assumption of identical brains is ideology"". As evidence of discrimination against male researchers, Prof Strumia claimed that ""Oxford University extends exam times for women's benefit"" and ""Italy offers free or cheaper university for female (research) students"". He also said that he himself was overlooked for a job that he was more qualified for, which was given to a woman. Dr Jessica Wade, a physicist at Imperial College London who was at the meeting, told BBC News that Prof Strumia's analysis was simplistic, drawing on ideas that had ""long been discredited"". ""It was really upsetting to those at the workshop,"" she said. ""There were young women and men exchanging ideas and their experiences on how to encourage more women into the subject and to combat discrimination in their careers. Then this man gets up, saying all this horrible stuff."" She added: ""I don't understand how such a forward thinking organisation like Cern, which does so much to promote diversity in research, could have invited him to speak to young people just starting off in their research careers when his ideas are so well known."" Prof Strumia claimed there were examples where men were discriminated against Another one of the slides from Alessandro Strumia's talk at Cern In a statement, Cern - which currently has its first ever woman director-general - said that the organisers were not aware of the content of the talk,externalprior to the workshop. ""Cern is a culturally diverse organisation bringing together people from dozens of nationalities. It is a place where everyone is welcome, and all have the same opportunities, regardless of ethnicity, beliefs, gender or sexual orientation,"" it said. A Cern spokesman confirmed that there was a video recording of the presentation. Senior managers would decide whether to release part or all of it, it said. When the BBC contacted Prof Strumia he said: ""People say that physics is sexist, physics is racist. I made some simple checks and discovered that it wasn't, that it was becoming sexist against men and said so."" Last month, Prof Jocelyn Bell Burnell told the BBC she believed thatunconscious bias against women prevented them from getting jobs in physics research. In 2015, Nobel laureateProf Tim Hunt resigned from his position at University College Londonafter telling an audience of young female scientists at a conference in South Korea that the ""trouble with girls"" in labs was that ""when you criticise them they cry"".

"Customers have reported problems charging the iPhone XS and XS Max Apple has remained silent amid complaints that its new iPhone XS and XS Max smartphones fail to charge consistently when plugged in. Several users have reported that their device refuses to charge if it has been idle for a while. Some charge only if  the display is ""woken up"". Video blogger Lewis Hilsenteger dubbed the issue ""chargegate"" in a video demonstrating the problem. However, Apple has not yet commented on the issue. Mr Hilsenteger presents the Unbox Therapy channel on YouTube, which has more than 12 million subscribers. In a video published on Saturday, hetested nine iPhones,externalby plugging them into an official Apple power supply. While the 2017 iPhone X charged without problem, many of the new XS and XS Max phones refused to charge when plugged in. Most of the phones would charge only when the display was activated to wake up the device. However, one of them would not charge at all. Mr Hilsenteger said he had been alerted to the problem when a viewer had emailed him describing their troubles. He had not noticed the issue himself because he used wireless charging rather than the power cable on his device. ""Responding to those people on a platform like this should bring light to it and hopefully some sort of software fix, if possible,"" he said in the video. ""This is my job. I have to call this stuff out. I have to hold these companies accountable."" Several complaints about the XS and XS Max failing to charge have also been posted on Apple's discussion forum on its website. Complaints can also be found on social media, where some people have described being unable to charge their phone at all once the battery is exhausted. Some users have speculated that the problem is related to a recent change in Apple's security settings. Since iOS 11.4.1 was released, the lightning port on iPhones can be disabled when the phone has been idle for a while.  That could stop thieves, cyber-attackers or law enforcement officers accessing it. ""In some cases, it might not charge,"" the company advises on itswebsite,external. However, that does not explain why more iPhone XS and XS Max users are facing the issue. Apple has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment.

"French singer and songwriter Charles Aznavour has died at 94 after a career lasting more than 80 years, a spokesman has confirmed. The star died at one of his homes in the south east of France. The performer, born to Armenian immigrants, sold more than 180 million records and featured in over 60 films. He was best known for his 1974 hit She and was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2017. Aznavour married three times and had six children. He was named entertainer of the century by CNN in 1998. Obituary: Charles Aznavour Charles Aznavour announces UK return Six of the best Charles Aznavour songs The singer was born in Paris in 1924 to Armenian parents who fled the country's genocide to begin a new life in the French capital. Aznavour's lyrics drew on his own experiences of growing up in deprivation as an immigrant. The singer was due to take on a seven-date tour across France and Switzerland, starting in November this year. He had recently returned from a tour in Japan, having been forced to cancel concerts this summer due to a broken arm. He recorded more than 1,200 songs in seven different languages and performed in 94 countries. Aznavour's song She was famously performed by Elvis Costello in the opening credits of Richard Curtis' film Notting Hill. Dubbed France's Frank Sinatra, Aznavour wrote his own songs on taboo subjects about marriage, homosexuality and male expression of emotions. His 1973 hit, What Makes a Man, was about a gay transvestite. Still performing to packed stadiums well into his 90s, Aznavour continued to write songs about his life, including his Swedish wife to celebrate 50 years of marriage. As well as a singer, he was a successful actor and played the lead in the 1960 film Shoot the Piano Player. He also appeared in the Oscar-winning The Tin Drum, playing a kindly Jewish toy seller. Aznavour sang for presidents, popes and royal families and at a number of humanitarian events. President Emmanuel Macron was a big fan of Aznavour and sang many of his songs during karaoke nights with friends when he was a student, according to former classmates. Aznavour was heavily involved in charity work and founded an organisation after the 1988 Armenian earthquake with friend Levon Sayan. In 2009 he was appointed ambassador of Armenia to Switzerland and he also became Armenia's delegate to the United Nations in Geneva. Singer Petula Clarke told the BBC, ""He was delightful to be with, he was very funny. He was a master - to see him on stage was something very, very special. ""He was mesmerising. He will be remembered for some magnificent songs. I will remember his as a great friend and a great artist."" Thousands of fans from around the world have paid their respects on Twitter, including some celebrities. Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan remembered the singer as an ""intelligent, eloquent, graceful & charming man."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Restaurants will be legally barred from keeping tips from staff under plans to be announced by Theresa May on Monday. The move follows a public outcry in 2015, when it emerged that many High Street chains routinely took up to 10% of tips paid by credit and debit card. Most chains have since stopped this practice, typically charging a much lower fee of 2.5% on tips paid by card. The hospitality trade body said the fact restaurants had acted voluntarily meant new legislation was unnecessary. ""We developed a Code of Practice  - together with Unite - which deals with the fair distribution of tips among all staff, not just waiters,"" said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""As a result, best practice has been promoted across the sector and we see no evidence of tips being withheld across restaurant chains."" Ms Nicholls also said smaller restaurants may need to retain ""a small amount"" from card tips to cover ""the not inconsiderable costs of credit card charges and processing payments"". Are online bookings killing restaurants? Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? Mrs May said the ""tough"" legislation, which would apply in England, Scotland and Wales, was part of the government's push to end exploitative employment practices. In 2016, Sajid Javid, then Business Secretary, saidtips should go in full to waiting staffand announced proposals to stop employer deductions from them, but stopped short of legislating. A government spokesperson was unable to say whether the legislation would also cover the common practice of customer tips left for waiting staff being redistributed to include back of house staff such as cooks and kitchen workers. Waiter Charles Archer relies on tip money Charles Archer, a part-time waiter at Pizza Express in Exeter, said he retained all his cash tips. With card tips, he keeps 70% with 30% going to kitchen staff, but there is no admin fee. He said he relied on tip money to pay for food with his basic salary used to pay his rent. ""Over the course of a week it can add up to a decent amount of money,"" he says. He said he did not expect the proposed legislation to change the situation of tips being shared with all restaurant staff unless the law specifically stated that tips had to go to the person that served them. ""Any law creating an increase in benefits [to waiters] will reduce benefits elsewhere,"" he said. ""These companies should be paying their staff more but they don't."" A restaurant owner, who runs four restaurants, but did not want to be named, said he welcomed the legislation because diners expected their tips to go to people who served them, not the restaurant. But he said service tips should be shared with kitchen staff, ""otherwise, someone front-of-house who's just started could be earning more than an experienced trained chef"". He said that some waiters on minimum wage would earn up to Â£15 an hour with tips, a rate he could not match for kitchen staff. Do you leave a tip in cash or pay it by card? It might make a difference to whether it ends up in the pocket of your server or is kept by the business. Cash tips are legally the property of staff. They can go straight to the person serving you or they can be pooled and shared out among staff - but they are not the property of the business. Card tips are different - they currently belong to the owner of the restaurant who has no legal duty to hand any of them over to staff (although in practice many do). The same applies to any service charge automatically added to a bill. How businesses decide to share these tips out varies widely. Some keep all the tips while some skim a percentage off the top. Others take a percentage to distribute to back of house staff. There are about 150,000 hotels, pubs and restaurants in the UK, employing about two million people. Unite regional officer Dave Turnbull said cracking down on tipping abuses was long overdue and the union would seek assurances that the legislation truly delivered fair tips. ""There will be question marks as to whether it will deal with the myriad of scams some restaurants use to pilfer staff tips to boost their profits,"" he said. Labour said the government's proposal copied another of its policies, which the party announced in June. Jeremy Corbyn had said,externalthen that a Labour government would legislate to ensure workers keep 100% of their tips. Are online bookings killing restaurants?

"Tesco Bank has been fined Â£16.4m by the UK financial regulator for failings surrounding a cyber-attack on its customers in November 2016. The Financial Conduct Authority said the bank,externalhad failed to exercise due skill, care and diligence in protecting its personal current account holders. The fraudsters got away with Â£2.26m.Tesco Bank said all the money had been refunded to account holders.,external It added it was ""very sorry"" for the impact the attack had had on customers. The FCA said that the attack had been largely avoidable and that Tesco had not responded to it with sufficient rigour, skill nor urgency. Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said the regulator would not put up with such behaviour. ""The fine the FCA imposed on Tesco Bank today reflects the fact that the FCA has no tolerance for banks that fail to protect customers from foreseeable risks,"" he said. ""In this case, the attack was the subject of a very specific warning that Tesco Bank did not properly address until after the attack started.  This was too little, too late.  Customers should not have been exposed to the risk at all."" The FCA said cyber attackers had exploited deficiencies in Tesco Bank's design of its debit card, its financial crime controls and in its financial crime operations team. Tesco Bank said it been the victim of a ""sophisticated criminal fraud"". While it did not lead to the theft or loss of any customers' data, there were 34 transactions where funds were debited from customers' accounts. The bank added that other customers had their normal service disrupted. Gerry Mallon, Tesco Bank's chief executive, said:-""We are very sorry for the impact that this fraud attack had on our customers. Our priority is always the safety and security of our customers' accounts and we fully accept the FCA's notice. ""We have significantly enhanced our security measures to ensure that our customers' accounts have the highest levels of protection. I apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused in 2016."" Tesco Bank's co-operation with the FCA's inquiry, and its agreement to an early settlement, meant the fine was reduced from Â£33.6m.

"Arnault is married to a former member of the body that handles the Nobel Prize for Literature A French photographer at the heart of a rape scandal that saw this year's Nobel Prize for Literature postponed has been handed a two-year prison sentence. On Monday a Swedish court found Jean-Claude Arnault, 72, guilty of raping a woman in an apartment in Stockholm in 2011. Arnault, who is well known in Sweden, is married to a former member of the centuries-old Swedish Academy. The crisis forced the academy to cancel this year's literature award in May. ""The defendant is found guilty of rape committed during the night between the 5 October and 6 October 2011,"" the Stockholm district court said while announcing its verdict. It added that the victim had also been ""awarded compensation for damages"" and ordered Arnault to pay about $12,000 (Â£10,000). Top literature prize postponed: What next? Landmark cancer therapy wins 2018 prize for medicine The victim's lawyer, Elisabeth Massi Fritz, said her client was ""relieved"" following the verdict, local media report. In late 2017, some 18 women came forward in a Swedish newspaper to accuse Arnault of sexual harassment and assault in the wake ofthe #MeToo movement, prompting an investigation by state prosecutors. He later denied all the alleged incidents, many of which were said to have happened at properties owned by the Academy or at his literary club. All but one of the cases ended up being dropped. In April this year, the Swedish cultural organisation handed over an internal report it had conducted through lawyers to judicial authorities. The same month, it voted against removing Arnault's wife, the poet and writer Katarina Frostenson, from its 18-person committee. Swedish Academy head quits Nobel body This, along with accusations of conflict of interest and the leaking of Nobel winners' names, is said to have divided the Academy and sparked a wave of resignations - including by Ms Frostenson and the Academy's head, Prof Sara Danius. Technically, members of the Swedish Academy cannot resign from their positions, which are assumed for life. But they can stop taking part in its activities.

"One tenant Rrouse said kitchen units fell off the wall in a property he lived in Tenants living in shared houses in England could face eviction or increases in rent because of changes to government rules, the National Landlords Association (NLA) has warned. From Monday an extra 160,000 houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) have to be registered with local councils, almost triple the current figure. Tenants Union UK said any increases in rent would be unfair on tenants. The government said the new rules would raise housing standards for tenants. HMOs are homes where people, who are not related, sleep in separate rooms but share facilities such as kitchens or bathrooms. Mainly students, migrants and low-paid workers live in the half a million HMO properties in England. Currently about 64,000 of these HMOs are required to be licensed but the rule changes mean more properties will be required to be inspected and certificated by local authorities. Previously only houses of more than three storeys and with five or more people forming at least two households had to be licensed. The new rules remove the three-storey threshold,externaland apply to smaller homes. Rrouse says some of the HMOs in Leeds are the worst in the country because of their poor condition Rrouse, an environmental engineer from Leeds, has been living in HMOs for the past nine years, as he tries to save money to buy a house. ""Property prices are so high, so saving for a deposit is hard work, and rents for one-bed flats are extortionate. So the only way I can afford to build a deposit is to live in a HMO,"" he said. ""It's a sociable way to rent, but the quality of the properties can vary. I've had HMOs where gas leaks have been common, carpets haven't been fitted and whole kitchen units have fallen off the wall."" Figures from the Valuation Office Agency,externalshow that the private median rent for a room in England in 2017-18 was Â£385 a month. Over the past three years median room rents in England have risen twice as fast as median wages, leaving tenants like Rrouse concerned about any future increases. ""If rents do go up because of this new legislation I've got friends who'll struggle to pay their rent because they just haven't got the cash,"" he said. The Centre for Economics and Business Research estimates the licensing process will on average cost landlords Â£1,200 each, and collectively, more than Â£95m. Landlords say the extra licensing costs will result in rents having to be increased. Some landlords are also expected to reduce the number of rooms they rent out, meaning existing tenants would face eviction. The new rules, which only apply to properties in England, will also require landlords to provide extra refuse bins and make sure bedrooms within HMOs are a minimum size. An HMO is a property occupied by more than one household and by more than two people. For a property to be classified as an HMO, the residents must be sharing at least one basic amenity (i.e. toilet, bathroom or kitchen) Examples of HMOs include bedsits, shared houses, student halls and hostels Under the old licensing scheme HMOs that were three or more storeys and occupied by five or more people forming at least two separate households were required to be licensed The new mandatory licensing of HMOs will be extended so that smaller properties (i.e. any storey height) that house five or more people in two or more separate households will also require a licence Source: Centre for Economics and Business Research The NLA said the new regulations though are the latest burden being placed on private sector landlords. ""Extra regulation will increase landlords costs,"" says Richard Lambert, chief executive of the NLA. ""When costs go up, like any other business, landlords will look to pass on that additional cost in the price, meaning tenants will pay more in rent. ""Some landlords will also reduce the number of rooms they rent out to try and comply with the legislation, meaning some tenants will face eviction."" More than half of the 500,000 HMOs are now required to be licensed because of the new legislation If you live in an HMO your landlord must: Keep shared areas clean and in good repair - for example staircases and corridors Install smoke alarms and provide a fire escape Repair faulty gas and electrical appliances - the property has to have a gas safety check every year and the electrics must be checked every five years If your home does not meet the safety standards you should first complain to your landlord. If the problem is not fixed then you are advised to contact your local council. The council should inspect the property and can tell your landlord to fix the problem if it does not meet safety standards. If the landlord still does not follow the advice, the council can take over the management of the home in serious cases, such as your health or safety being at serious risk. If this happens, usually for a 12-month period, your tenancy rights stay the same and you pay your rent to the council. Source: Citizens Advice The number of HMO licences has been increasing in recent years as more people look to rent privately. Data from about 200 councils in England, obtained by a BBC Freedom of Information request, suggested the number of HMO licences has nearly trebled since 2013. Rogue landlords targeted by government Can a landlord kick me out? Number of middle-aged renters doubles Ben Clay, from Tenants Union UK, said it would be wrong for landlords to increase rents because of the introduction of new legislation. ""Renters are already facing a perfect storm of rent increases at a time when more people are having to deal with shrinking wage packets,"" he added. ""We welcome this additional legislation, but we feel that there is still further to go and that all rented accommodation should be subject to regulation, to ensure standards rise."" The Ministry of Housing and Local Government said the new rules would help protect at least 850,000 more people in privately-rented homes. A spokesman said: ""While the vast majority of landlords provide decent accommodation, these measures are about raising standards in private rented homes where landlords knowingly flout their responsibilities. ""Many of the properties that will be covered by the new rules, already fall under existing licensing schemes that will be transferred into mandatory licensing free of charge, so there will be no additional costs to those landlords.""

"French singer and songwriter Charles Aznavour has died at 94 after a career lasting more than 80 years, a spokesman has confirmed. The star died at one of his homes in the south east of France. The performer, born to Armenian immigrants, sold more than 180 million records and featured in over 60 films. He was best known for his 1974 hit She and was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2017. Aznavour married three times and had six children. He was named entertainer of the century by CNN in 1998. Obituary: Charles Aznavour Charles Aznavour announces UK return Six of the best Charles Aznavour songs The singer was born in Paris in 1924 to Armenian parents who fled the country's genocide to begin a new life in the French capital. Aznavour's lyrics drew on his own experiences of growing up in deprivation as an immigrant. The singer was due to take on a seven-date tour across France and Switzerland, starting in November this year. He had recently returned from a tour in Japan, having been forced to cancel concerts this summer due to a broken arm. He recorded more than 1,200 songs in seven different languages and performed in 94 countries. Aznavour's song She was famously performed by Elvis Costello in the opening credits of Richard Curtis' film Notting Hill. Dubbed France's Frank Sinatra, Aznavour wrote his own songs on taboo subjects about marriage, homosexuality and male expression of emotions. His 1973 hit, What Makes a Man, was about a gay transvestite. Still performing to packed stadiums well into his 90s, Aznavour continued to write songs about his life, including his Swedish wife to celebrate 50 years of marriage. As well as a singer, he was a successful actor and played the lead in the 1960 film Shoot the Piano Player. He also appeared in the Oscar-winning The Tin Drum, playing a kindly Jewish toy seller. Aznavour sang for presidents, popes and royal families and at a number of humanitarian events. President Emmanuel Macron was a big fan of Aznavour and sang many of his songs during karaoke nights with friends when he was a student, according to former classmates. Aznavour was heavily involved in charity work and founded an organisation after the 1988 Armenian earthquake with friend Levon Sayan. In 2009 he was appointed ambassador of Armenia to Switzerland and he also became Armenia's delegate to the United Nations in Geneva. Singer Petula Clarke told the BBC, ""He was delightful to be with, he was very funny. He was a master - to see him on stage was something very, very special. ""He was mesmerising. He will be remembered for some magnificent songs. I will remember his as a great friend and a great artist."" Thousands of fans from around the world have paid their respects on Twitter, including some celebrities. Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan remembered the singer as an ""intelligent, eloquent, graceful & charming man."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Many Britons feel they have to watch the pennies after recent inflation rises and years of flatlining wages. This extends to their supermarket shop, withfour in 10 people,externalreporting they are concerned about the cost of food. Against this backdrop, grocery giant Tesco hasjoined the discount retailers,which the launch of ""value-orientated"" chain Jack's. Yet in relative terms, the British grocery shop remains one of the cheapest in the world. Britons spend an average of 8% of their total household expenditure on food to eat at home. This is less than any other countryapart from the US and Singapore,external, according to data from market research firm Euromonitor. Food spending varies considerably around the world. Greeks spend 16%, while Peruvians spend 26%. Nigerians spend the most on food in relative terms - 59% of their household budget. The food consumed in the UK is alsothe cheapest in Western Europe,external- costing 8% less than the EU average, according to EU statistical body Eurostat. It is also much cheaper in relative terms than the food bought by Britons' parents and grandparents. The proportion of household income spent on food hasmore than halved over the past 60 years,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), while spending on housing costs and leisure activities has doubled. Why have Britons come to spend less and less of their income on food? It's partly a reflection of how people shop. Store loyalty has decreased over time, with consumers more likely to shop around for the best prices. Four out of 10 would not care if their usual supermarket closed,one survey of 1,500 of UK consumers,externalfound. Almost one in five had switched from their main supermarket in the past year. Over the decades the traditional single weekly shopping trip has also given way to more frequent outings, for purchasing smaller baskets of goods. Unable to rely on past loyalty, supermarkets have had to work harder to attract customers. This is particularly true now there are more low-cost options available. DiscountersAldi and Lidl have grown quicklyin recent yearsand now have 13% of the UK's grocery market,,externalmaking it much harder for other supermarkets to raise their prices. As with many countries, the UK has benefitted from mostly rising incomes, while food production has become more efficient. Farming has become increasingly mechanised, which speeds up production and helps to maximise harvests. At the same time, the way food is transported, stored and distributed has become increasingly streamlined. All of this has helped to push down the price of groceries in the shops. The UK has also benefitted from the growth of trade between countries. It currently importsabout half,externalof all its food,up from a third in 1988.,external Retailers are able to source foods cheaply from around the world, without incurring the UK's oftenhigher manufacturing and processing costs. More like this Who are the children hoping to earn Â£24 an hour? Where a six-figure salary is 'low income' What British people think about Brexit now How housing has divided the young However, we cannot be certain that the era of ultra-low food prices will continue. One threat comes from the weather. This year, the Beast from the East brought snow and low temperatures in March and was followed by a summer heatwave. The combinationhit crop yieldsand has already led to increased prices. This combination caused the wholesale cost of carrots to rise by 80% and wheat by 20% between March and July, consultancyCEBR estimated.It believes these and other price rises could add Â£7 on to household bills every month. While episodes like this may still be relatively rare in the UK, most scientists agree that international weather patterns are becoming more extreme. If droughts and floods become more frequent, this is likely to boost global food prices. The UK's reliance on imported food means it is particularly affected by changes in the strength of the pound. Since the Brexit referendum in June 2016, the pound has fallen by as much as 17% against the euro and 29% against the dollar, although it has recovered somewhat since then. This has been followed by trade disputes, as food suppliers seek to pass a portion of theirrising import costs,externalon to retailers. One example of this was""Marmitegate"",when Tesco temporarily stopped stocking Unilever products after the manufacturer raised its prices. There are also fears that prices could riseif supplies are disruptedimmediately after Brexit and duties are increased on EU imports, which account for about 30% of the food eaten in the UK. If there is a ""no-deal"" Brexit, the UK should expect to see ""a pretty significant increase in the cost of fruit and veg, the cost of meat and the cost of dairy products"",according to Lord Price,former Conservative trade minister and ex-boss of Waitrose. However, we do not yet know what the impact of Brexit will be on food prices. Another suggestion is that duties on food imported from outside of the EUwill be lowered,externaland that the UKwill start to grow more at home.,external The UK is also subject to global trends beyond its control. By 2050, the world's population is predicted to increase by a third, withalmost 10 billion,externalmouths to feed. And tastes are changing. The growing middle class in countries like China now has more disposable income to spend on food, beyond the essentials. This includes eating more meat and dairy products. Such trends can lead to price rises if demand can't keep up, for example the24% spike in the price of butter. In January 2017, cold weather in Italy and heavy rainfall in Spain caused a""perfect storm"" for courgette importers, pushing up prices at a time of year when Western consumers demand healthier food. We are in an era of low food prices, compared with other countries and the UK's own history. If this changes, Britons may have to think hard about the choices they make. Public health could improve if price rises lead people to consume fewer calories. But it could also lead to worsening diets if fresh produce prices rise faster than those of processed food. Either way, environmental and economic factors may mean UK consumers face a future of higher food prices.

"Tesco Bank has been fined Â£16.4m by the UK financial regulator for failings surrounding a cyber-attack on its customers in November 2016. The Financial Conduct Authority said the bank,externalhad failed to exercise due skill, care and diligence in protecting its personal current account holders. The fraudsters got away with Â£2.26m.Tesco Bank said all the money had been refunded to account holders.,external It added it was ""very sorry"" for the impact the attack had had on customers. The FCA said that the attack had been largely avoidable and that Tesco had not responded to it with sufficient rigour, skill nor urgency. Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said the regulator would not put up with such behaviour. ""The fine the FCA imposed on Tesco Bank today reflects the fact that the FCA has no tolerance for banks that fail to protect customers from foreseeable risks,"" he said. ""In this case, the attack was the subject of a very specific warning that Tesco Bank did not properly address until after the attack started.  This was too little, too late.  Customers should not have been exposed to the risk at all."" The FCA said cyber attackers had exploited deficiencies in Tesco Bank's design of its debit card, its financial crime controls and in its financial crime operations team. Tesco Bank said it been the victim of a ""sophisticated criminal fraud"". While it did not lead to the theft or loss of any customers' data, there were 34 transactions where funds were debited from customers' accounts. The bank added that other customers had their normal service disrupted. Gerry Mallon, Tesco Bank's chief executive, said:-""We are very sorry for the impact that this fraud attack had on our customers. Our priority is always the safety and security of our customers' accounts and we fully accept the FCA's notice. ""We have significantly enhanced our security measures to ensure that our customers' accounts have the highest levels of protection. I apologise to our customers for the inconvenience caused in 2016."" Tesco Bank's co-operation with the FCA's inquiry, and its agreement to an early settlement, meant the fine was reduced from Â£33.6m.

"Lana Del Rey responded to Kanye West on Instagram following his SNL appearance Lana Del Rey has criticised Kanye West for his support of Donald Trump. The singer, who performed at West's wedding to Kim Kardashian in 2014, described his endorsement of the US president as ""a loss for the culture"". She wrote to West after an appearance on Saturday Night Live, which ended with an unscripted, pro-Trump rant. ""I can only assume you relate to his personality on some level,"" wrote Del Rey. ""Delusions of grandeur, extreme issues with narcissism. ""None of which would be a talking point if we weren't speaking about the man leading our country. ""If you think it's alright to support someone who believes it's OK to grab a woman... just because he's famous, then you need an intervention just as much as he does."" She signed off saying: ""Message sent with concern that will never be addressed."" Kanye West wore one of Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" hats on Saturday Night Live West played three songs on this weekend's episode of Saturday Night Live, hours after announcing he had changed his name to Ye. He dressed as a Perrier bottle while performing his latest single, I Love It; but later sported a red ""Make America Great Again"" cap to play Ghost Town with Kid Cudi and 070 Shake. Following that song, which closed the show, West delivered a rambling political speech to the audience. Kanye West defends Trump in new song Kanye West changes name to Ye A philosopher rates Kanye West's tweets It was not broadcast as part of the show, but excerpts filmed by the audience and shared on social media saw the rapper discuss his support for President Trump, his pledge to run for president in 2020, the need for a ""dialogue not a diatribe"" and other themes familiar from his recent interviews. ""So many times I talk to a white person and [they] say, 'How could you like Trump, he's racist?'"" he said at one point. ""Well, if I was concerned about racism I would've moved out of America a long time ago."" West had promised to deliver a new album, Yandhi, on Saturday but it failed to materialise He added: ""The blacks want always Democrats â¦ You know it's like the plan they did, to take the fathers out the home and put them on welfare â¦ Does anybody know about that? That's a Democratic plan."" Behind him, cast members remained silent, many bowing their heads and rolling their eyes. Some audience members cheered, while others booed. Comedian Chris Rock, a former Saturday Night Live performer who filmed some of the speech, can be heard laughing and saying ""Oh My God"" as it continued. West went on to suggest that Saturday Night Live had tried to stop him from making a political statement. ""They bullied me backstage. They said don't go out there with that hat on. They bullied me backstage. They bullied me."" But he ended his monologue by thanking the show ""even though some of y'all don't agree"". He then posted a message on Twitter explaining why he had worn the MAGA hat. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The 13th Amendment to the US Constitution, ratified after the civil war, abolished slavery and involuntary servitude. West, who caused uproar earlier this yearby referring to slavery as ""a choice"", appears to object to the amendment on the grounds that it ""allowed for prisoners to be used as slave labour,""observed political journalist Yashar Ali.,external ""But he doesn't articulate that in his tweet leaving people confused and others delighted."" West later clarified the comments in a late-night tweet that said he wanted to ""amend not abolish"" the 13th Amendment, calling it ""slavery in disguise - meaning it never ended."" The star's political stance has increasingly infuriated his fellow musicians, with the likes of John Legend and Chance The Rapper criticising his support of Donald Trump. Following Saturday's pronouncement, producer Swizz Beats - who is married to Alicia Keys - posted a video message to Kanye, saying black musicians feel ""uncomfortable"" with him ""representing somebody that's blatantly hurting our people"". ""We love you, we're not bullying you. But you gotta stop. That [expletive] ain't right."" Questlove, the drummer for the Roots, the rap group who also serve as the in-house band for Jimmy Fallon's US chat show, posted Rock's video with the caption: ""I'm going to sleep. I'm done man.

"Amelia Zekavica was hospitalised after eating a Pret sandwich Allergy sufferers hospitalised after eating Pret a Manger sandwiches have demanded change to the company's labelling. The coroner leading an inquest into the death of Natasha Ednan-Laperouse has alsodescribed the allergy labelling at Pret as ""inadequate"". Ms Ednan-Laperouse, 15, who was allergic to sesame seeds, died after eating a baguette from the food chain after being ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the pack, the coroner found. One allergy sufferer, who says she was hospitalised in 2017 after eating an unlabelled sandwich, said the company was ""taking unnecessary risks"". ""Other vendors have labels. Why wouldn't they?"" she said. Pret a Manger chief executive Clive Schlee promised ""meaningful change"" in the wake of the coroner's findings. Pret inquest: Labelling 'inadequate' in baguette death Can lessons be learned from Pret baguette allergy death? Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in a hospital in Nice after suffering an allergic reaction Beatrice, whose real identity the BBC has agreed not to disclose, was in hospital for 12 hours when she suffered an allergic reaction after eating a cheese sandwich from Pret. Like Ms Ednan-Laperouse, she is allergic to sesame seeds. ""Unbeknown to me [the sandwich] contained sesame seeds,"" she told the BBC. ""They weren't visible or labelled."" She was at work when she felt the reaction coming on. ""I took anti-histamines and went straight to hospital. I told staff there I would go into anaphylactic shock in 10 minutes,"" she said. ""It was the worst I've ever had. I was held upside down, put on oxygen and had more shots than I've ever had in my life."" After posting a photo from her hospital bed detailing the incident on social media, Beatrice was contacted by the company's ""apologetic"" managing director. She told him: ""You need to stick labels on your food before you kill someone."" The executive offered her a voucher, she says, but Beatrice was more interested in the labelling. ""I didn't do it to get money. I wanted to see a change,"" she told the BBC. She was told that a pilot was coming up in December 2017 or early 2018, in which stickers would be added to all packaging. ""They're taking unnecessary risks. It's not a viable business model when your company ends up in the media when someone eats your sandwich and dies."" Amelia Zekavica, a law student aged 20, is allergic to nuts, pulses, sesame seeds and ""almost anything furry"" she told the BBC. She described how when she was 18 years old, she fell ill within five minutes of eating a Chicken Caesar sandwich from Pret. ""I was quite scared. It's so terrifying when you have these kinds of allergies. It's like your own body is just killing itself."" Her mother made her vomit and gave her some anti-histamine tablets to get the swelling down from her lips and throat. At home, Amelia rested while her mother called the store to ask about the ingredients. Her father Milan recalled what happened next: ""Pret were no help whatsoever. They told my wife everything was online. ""We went on their website and found there was sesame in the Caesar dressing but this was not indicated on the packaging or in store."" Amelia became progressively unwell and spent four hours in A&E. ""Luckily she shook it off,"" said Milan. This is not the first time Amelia has had a bad allergic reaction. ""I'm always very careful. Each reaction is different and they can get progressively worse. ""When my mum and dad told me about the girl who'd died, it really struck a chord. The food industry should understand that there are people out there who have allergies. ""People can die. This is not stressed enough. Celiac awareness is stressed a lot - it's also bad but they don't die from it. ""The food industry needs to list all of the ingredients on the packaging. You shouldn't have to check online or ask for an ingredients book. Everything should be labelled."" A spokesperson for Pret a Manger said: ""We are very sorry for Amelia's experience and we would like to invite her and her family to get back in touch so we can give them the apology they deserve."" Mr Schlee, who joined Pret as CEO in 2003, said the company was ""deeply sorry for Natasha's death"". ""We cannot begin to comprehend the pain the family have felt and the grief they will continue to feel. ""We've listened to everything the coroner and Natasha's family have said this week and we will learn from it. ""All of us at Pret want meaningful change to come from this tragedy. We will ensure it does.""

"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died after eating the baguette bought from Pret at Heathrow Airport The inquest into the death of a girl who suffered a fatal reaction to sesame in a Pret a Manger baguette has shone a light on food allergen labelling. As the hearing concludes, experts say lessons need to be learned from the teenager's death. For people with food allergies, eating out can be a distressing experience. There is the fear factor of leaving the allergen-free comfort zone of a person's own kitchen, and often a feeling of embarrassment; of not wanting to ask too many questions of waiting staff, or to call attention to one's dietary needs. To combat those concerns, a new law aimed at making things easier for people with allergies to eat out safely was introduced in 2014. But experts say it doesn't go far enough. UK regulations mean some foods can be sold without individual labels denoting which allergens they contain Under current guidelines, takeaways and restaurants are only required to let customers know if any of the 14 most dangerous allergens - including peanuts, eggs and milk - are ingredients in their food. However, freshly handmade, non pre-packaged food does not have to be individually labelled, according to the UK'sFood Regulations 2014,external. The Pret baguette Natasha Ednan-Laperouse bought falls into this grey area. The 15-year-old, from Fulham,reacted to sesame in the sandwich she bought at Heathrow Airportin July 2016. Natasha's brother, father and mother attended the inquest at West London Coroner's Court Coroner Dr Sean Cummings recorded a narrative conclusion at West London Coroner's Court - finding that the teenager was ""reassured"" by the lack of specific allergen information on the packaging. He said the labelling was ""inadequate"" and he would be writing to the government about reduced food labelling on products made in shops. Sesame is one of the 14 allergens that consumers must be made aware of when it is used as an ingredient in food products Law student Amelia Zekavica, 20, who said she had suffered an allergic reaction to sesame in a Pret sandwich in the past, said businesses should do more. She said: ""The food industry needs to list all of the ingredients on the packaging. I think everything should be included. ""It's very serious. You shouldn't have to check and ask for an ingredients book or list, it should be labelled. ""The industry should understand that there are people out there who have allergies. People can die."" Sesame is one of the 14 allergens that consumers must be made aware of when it is used as an ingredient in food products, according toEU Regulations,external However, the EU rules say individual member states are responsible for deciding on how information about non pre-packaged food is provided to the customer The UK'sFood Regulations 2014,externalallow freshly handmade, non pre-packaged food to not be individually labelled Pret confirmed at the time of Natasha's death products would not have been individually labelled with allergen or ingredient information, and that this was within regulations However, Pret said there were signs in the fridge and at till points telling consumers with allergies to speak to a manager for advice or to seeits allergen guide,external Allergy blogger Nathalie Newman, who runs theIntolerant Gourmand site,external, backed Ms Zekavica's call. ""Labelling food is absolutely crucial, as in the severest form of allergies it can be the difference between life and death. ""Lessons have to be learned from this; we have the top 14 allergies for a reason and businesses should take responsibility for labelling."" Nathalie Newman has called for lessons to be learned David Pickering, of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, said the law was designed to ""reduce burdens on smaller businesses"" but suggested it may need to change. ""Big chains probably have a formulaic approach to making sandwiches, which is totally different to a local shop where they can make it up as they go along and it's potentially not as controlled,"" he said. ""[Businesses] can simply comply with the legislation - as Pret said they had in this case - but should also look to go further, to find better ways to communicate with people who have allergies. ""If businesses are complying and these situations still occur, then maybe the law needs to be looked at again."" Providing a safe eating experience for allergy sufferers should be paramount, according to Holly Shaw from Allergy UK. She said: ""Cases [like Natasha's] show that at the very severe end of the scale, lives can be lost if people come across something they're allergic to."" Data highlighted by the FSA, Allergy UK and the Anaphylaxis Campaign,externalsuggests children and young adults are ""disproportionately more prone to die from an allergic reaction than adults"". The FSA has launched a new campaign - easy to ASK - to encourage young people to ask food businesses about allergens when eating out. Its chairman Heather Hancock said: ""Living with a food allergy or intolerance is not easy and can have fatal consequences. ""It's crucial that [young people] feel confident to speak up and ask for allergen information, and that the people around them make that easier."" Ultimately, there is an onus on both businesses and customers with allergies to take responsibility, according to Ms Shaw. She said: ""We're at a place now where there's still work to be done, but allergy awareness is far more increased. ""Effective communication is really important for food business operators, who also need to make sure the [allergen] information they provide is accurate. ""It is important that allergen labelling is consistent. ""But people [with allergies] also have a responsibility to ask questions as well to make sure they are aware.""

"People who live on some Pacific islands are worried they will lose their homes to the sea if temperature rise exceeds 1.5C It is likely to be the most critical and controversial report on climate change in recent years. Leading scientists are meeting in South Korea this week to see if global temperatures can be kept from rising by more than 1.5C this century. The world has already passed one degree of warming as carbon emissions have ballooned since the 1850s. Many low-lying countries say they may disappear under the sea if the 1.5C limit is breached. After a week of deliberations in the city of Incheon, the researchers' new report is likely to say that keeping below this limit will require urgent and dramatic action from governments and individuals alike. One scientist told BBC News that our lives would never be the same if the world changed course to stay under 1.5C. 'Nature-based' plan to beat climate change 'Climate change moving faster than we are' Worries over China coal power boom 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA The new study is being produced by theIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,external(IPCC), a body set up to provide a clear scientific view for governments on the causes, impacts and solutions to rising temperatures. When the Paris climate agreement was signed in December 2015, there was delight and surprise among many delegates that countries had agreed that the long-term goal of the pact should be to keep global temperatures ""well below two degrees C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees C"". To examine the challenges and impacts of keeping temperatures below the 1.5C limit, the UN asked the IPCC to produce a special report, which the scientific body has delivered in record time. This week in Incheon, the scientists and government delegates will go through the final, short, 15-page Summary for Policymakers, the key distillation of the underlying scientific reports. This will be done word by word, to ensure everyone - scientists and governments alike - are in agreement on the text. The report will be the guiding light for governments as they decide how to develop their economies in the face of rising temperatures over the coming decades. ""The decisions we make now about whether we let 1.5 or 2 degrees or more happen will change the world enormously,"" Dr Heleen de Coninck, one of the co-ordinating lead authors of the report, told BBC News. ""But our lives, when keeping it below 1.5C with projected population rise and economic growth, will also look differently."" ""Lives of people will never be the same again either way, but we can influence which future we end up with."" Right now, the world has passed one degree of warming above the global temperatures that pertained around 1850, before widespread industrialisation. Leaked drafts of the new report suggest that global warming is on track to break the 1.5C mark by around 2040. This is potentially very bad news for low-lying island states and some of the least developed countries in the world who fear that 1.5C will cause sea-level to rise and threaten their survival. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Slowly and quite carefully. TheIPCC has been in existence for 30 years,externaland produces detailed assessments of the state of the climate every six or seven years. This special report has been almost three years in the making. The authors are all scientists who have been nominated by governments and international institutions. Droughts and heatwaves have struck several parts of the world in 2018, leading many people to question just how much impact climate change is having In this case, there are 86 lead authors from 39 countries, of which 39% are female. These researchers, who are unpaid, have reviewed the available scientific literature on the feasibility, impacts and costs of staying under 1.5C. They have then put together draft versions of their report, after having reviewed some 6,000 references all told. These draft reports were sent out to other experts and governments for review. In total, this report has had over 40,000 review comments. Because so many people are involved, and all these review comments have been taken on board, the IPCC has a reputation for being rather conservative, producing reports that have a very broad consensus. Those involved say the wide range of literature and the large number of authors involved is a key strength of the body. ""We don't base our reports on a single article that has an extreme conclusion, that contrasts with the available literature,"" said Dr Carolina Vera, a member of the IPCC bureau. ""The collective view of the available literature is the most robust contribution that we can provide to the governments."" If you add up all the promises to cut carbon made by countries that have signed the Paris climate agreement, it would see the world warm by more than 3C by the end of this century. For some scientists, there is not enough time left to take the actions that would keep the world within the desired limit. ""If you really look seriously at the feasibility, it looks like it will be very hard to reach the 1.5C,"" said Prof Arthur Petersen, from University College London and a former IPCC member. ""I am relatively sceptical that we can meet 1.5C, even with an overshoot. Scientists can dream up that is feasible, but it's a pipedream."" Hoesung Lee is the chairman of the IPCC As well as the science, there is also the politics. For some countries, especially those who are major exporters of fossil fuels, limiting carbon emissions more rapidly than at present is a challenge. ""The overall big question in this report is how we can still get to that 1.5C goal? What does it take?"", said Kaisa Kosonen from Greenpeace. ""There are those for whom 1.5C is a matter of life or death and they want the message to be clear. Others might want to suggest that there is not scientific certainty and the messages, for example on rapid fossil-fuel phase-out, should not be so straightforward."" The challenge of keeping temperatures below 1.5 is considerable. But, if it is accepted by the governments, the report is likely to say that it can be done, if the world is willing to take some very tough steps. These are likely to involve an intensification of cuts to CO2 emissions, a rapid move to renewable energy and quite possibly, the deployment of technologies to suck greenhouse gases from the air. This last option is seen as highly controversial. The report is also likely state that lifestyle and dietary choices can make a significant difference - but there are no simple or cheap solutions. ""There is no easy answer; it is a much more complicated answer,"" said Prof Jim Skea, who co-chairs one of the IPCC working groups. ""It has physical elements, it has social elements, it has political elements. The report, as it is scoped, allows us to go into these issues, but a crisp answer I don't think is what we were asked for by governments."" There has been quite a bit of speculation that the scientists are being forced to soften the contents of the report, or ""pull their punches"", on some of the major conclusions. What's happened is that there have been notable changes between different draft versions of the short Summary for Policymakers, which will be released officially on Monday 8 October. Researchers believe that wildfires in many locations have been impacted by rising temperatures This has led some critics to conclude that important aspects are being downplayed to suit the interests of countries with major fossil fuel industries, such as the United States, Saudi Arabia and Australia. But members of the IPCC say that they will not allow their conclusions to be watered down during the next few days when the Summary is gone through, line by line. ""What is really important for the work of the IPCC is the respect for the integrity and scientific rigour of the authors - that is at the heart of the work of the author teams,"" said ValÃ©rie Masson-Delmotte, a co-chair of the body. ""If one can imagine the governments holding the hands of the scientists, this means you don't know how science works!"" Quite likely, yes! IPCC sessions are closed from the public, to allow governments and scientists to speak freely. Governments often seek to make changes to the text - the scientists are there to ensure that if changes are made, they are consistent with the research. ""I've never been to an approval session that didn't go well after hours; it's kind of IPCC working practice now,"" said Prof Skea. ""Absolutely it will be a robust session and we are well geared up for it.""

"Two scientists who discovered how to fight cancer using the body's immune system have won the 2018 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine. The work, by Professor James P Allison from the US and Professor Tasuku Honjo from Japan, has led to treatments for advanced, deadly skin cancer. Immune checkpoint therapy has revolutionised cancer treatment, said the prize-giving Swedish Academy. Experts say it has proved to be ""strikingly effective"". Prof Allison, of the University of Texas, and Prof Honjo, of Kyoto University, will share the Nobel prize sum of nine million Swedish kronor - about $1.01 million or 870,000 euros. Accepting the prize, Tasuku Honjo told reporters: ""I want to continue my research ... so that this immune therapy will save more cancer patients than ever."" Prof Allison said: ""It's a great, emotional privilege to meet cancer patients who've been successfully treated with immune checkpoint blockade. They are living proof of the power of basic science, of following our urge to learn and to understand how things work."" Our immune system protects us from disease, but it has built-in safeguards to stop it from attacking our own tissue. Professor Tasuku Honjo and his team at Kyoto University Some cancers can take advantage of those ""brakes"" and dodge the attack too. Allison and Honjo, now both in their 70s, discovered a way to unleash our immune cells to attack tumours by turning off proteins that put the brakes on. And that led to the development of new drugs which now offer hope to patients with advanced and previously untreatable cancer. Immune checkpoint therapy is being used by the NHS to treat people with the most serious form of skin cancer, melanoma. It doesn't work for everyone, but for some patients it appears to have workedincredibly well, getting rid of the tumour entirely, even after it had started to spread around the body. Such remarkable results had never been seen before for patients like these. Professor James P Allison Doctors have also been using the treatment to help some people with advanced lung cancer. Prof Charles Swanton, from Cancer Research UK, congratulated the prize winners, saying: ""Thanks to this groundbreaking work, our own immune system's innate power against cancer has been realised and harnessed into treatments that continue to save the lives of patients. For cancers such as advanced melanoma, lung, and kidney, these immune-boosting drugs have transformed the outlook for many patients who had run out of options. ""The booming field of immunotherapy that these discoveries have precipitated is still relatively in its infancy, so it's exciting to consider how this research will progress in the future and what new opportunities will arise."" Medicine is the first of the Nobel Prizes awarded each year. The literature prize will not be handed out this year, after the awarding body wasaffected by a sexual misconduct scandal. 2017- Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young for unravelling how bodies keep a circadian rhythm orbody clock 2016 - Yoshinori Ohsumi for discovering how cellsremain healthy by recycling waste. 2015 - William C Campbell, Satoshi Åmura and Youyou Tu foranti-parasite drug discoveries. 2014 - John O'Keefe, May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser fordiscovering the brain's navigating system. 2013 - James Rothman, Randy Schekman, and Thomas Sudhof for their discovery of howcells precisely transport material. 2012 - Two pioneers of stem cell research - John Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka - were awarded the Nobel afterchanging adult cells into stem cells. 2011 - Bruce Beutler, Jules Hoffmann and Ralph Steinman shared the prize after revolutionising the understanding ofhow the body fights infection. 2010 - Robert Edwards fordevising the fertility treatment IVFwhich led to the first ""test tube baby"" in July 1978. 2009 - Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider and Jack Szostak for finding thetelomeres at the ends of chromosomes,external.

"Many Britons feel they have to watch the pennies after recent inflation rises and years of flatlining wages. This extends to their supermarket shop, withfour in 10 people,externalreporting they are concerned about the cost of food. Against this backdrop, grocery giant Tesco hasjoined the discount retailers,which the launch of ""value-orientated"" chain Jack's. Yet in relative terms, the British grocery shop remains one of the cheapest in the world. Britons spend an average of 8% of their total household expenditure on food to eat at home. This is less than any other countryapart from the US and Singapore,external, according to data from market research firm Euromonitor. Food spending varies considerably around the world. Greeks spend 16%, while Peruvians spend 26%. Nigerians spend the most on food in relative terms - 59% of their household budget. The food consumed in the UK is alsothe cheapest in Western Europe,external- costing 8% less than the EU average, according to EU statistical body Eurostat. It is also much cheaper in relative terms than the food bought by Britons' parents and grandparents. The proportion of household income spent on food hasmore than halved over the past 60 years,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), while spending on housing costs and leisure activities has doubled. Why have Britons come to spend less and less of their income on food? It's partly a reflection of how people shop. Store loyalty has decreased over time, with consumers more likely to shop around for the best prices. Four out of 10 would not care if their usual supermarket closed,one survey of 1,500 of UK consumers,externalfound. Almost one in five had switched from their main supermarket in the past year. Over the decades the traditional single weekly shopping trip has also given way to more frequent outings, for purchasing smaller baskets of goods. Unable to rely on past loyalty, supermarkets have had to work harder to attract customers. This is particularly true now there are more low-cost options available. DiscountersAldi and Lidl have grown quicklyin recent yearsand now have 13% of the UK's grocery market,,externalmaking it much harder for other supermarkets to raise their prices. As with many countries, the UK has benefitted from mostly rising incomes, while food production has become more efficient. Farming has become increasingly mechanised, which speeds up production and helps to maximise harvests. At the same time, the way food is transported, stored and distributed has become increasingly streamlined. All of this has helped to push down the price of groceries in the shops. The UK has also benefitted from the growth of trade between countries. It currently importsabout half,externalof all its food,up from a third in 1988.,external Retailers are able to source foods cheaply from around the world, without incurring the UK's oftenhigher manufacturing and processing costs. More like this Who are the children hoping to earn Â£24 an hour? Where a six-figure salary is 'low income' What British people think about Brexit now How housing has divided the young However, we cannot be certain that the era of ultra-low food prices will continue. One threat comes from the weather. This year, the Beast from the East brought snow and low temperatures in March and was followed by a summer heatwave. The combinationhit crop yieldsand has already led to increased prices. This combination caused the wholesale cost of carrots to rise by 80% and wheat by 20% between March and July, consultancyCEBR estimated.It believes these and other price rises could add Â£7 on to household bills every month. While episodes like this may still be relatively rare in the UK, most scientists agree that international weather patterns are becoming more extreme. If droughts and floods become more frequent, this is likely to boost global food prices. The UK's reliance on imported food means it is particularly affected by changes in the strength of the pound. Since the Brexit referendum in June 2016, the pound has fallen by as much as 17% against the euro and 29% against the dollar, although it has recovered somewhat since then. This has been followed by trade disputes, as food suppliers seek to pass a portion of theirrising import costs,externalon to retailers. One example of this was""Marmitegate"",when Tesco temporarily stopped stocking Unilever products after the manufacturer raised its prices. There are also fears that prices could riseif supplies are disruptedimmediately after Brexit and duties are increased on EU imports, which account for about 30% of the food eaten in the UK. If there is a ""no-deal"" Brexit, the UK should expect to see ""a pretty significant increase in the cost of fruit and veg, the cost of meat and the cost of dairy products"",according to Lord Price,former Conservative trade minister and ex-boss of Waitrose. However, we do not yet know what the impact of Brexit will be on food prices. Another suggestion is that duties on food imported from outside of the EUwill be lowered,externaland that the UKwill start to grow more at home.,external The UK is also subject to global trends beyond its control. By 2050, the world's population is predicted to increase by a third, withalmost 10 billion,externalmouths to feed. And tastes are changing. The growing middle class in countries like China now has more disposable income to spend on food, beyond the essentials. This includes eating more meat and dairy products. Such trends can lead to price rises if demand can't keep up, for example the24% spike in the price of butter. In January 2017, cold weather in Italy and heavy rainfall in Spain caused a""perfect storm"" for courgette importers, pushing up prices at a time of year when Western consumers demand healthier food. We are in an era of low food prices, compared with other countries and the UK's own history. If this changes, Britons may have to think hard about the choices they make. Public health could improve if price rises lead people to consume fewer calories. But it could also lead to worsening diets if fresh produce prices rise faster than those of processed food. Either way, environmental and economic factors may mean UK consumers face a future of higher food prices.

"One tenant Rrouse said kitchen units fell off the wall in a property he lived in Tenants living in shared houses in England could face eviction or increases in rent because of changes to government rules, the National Landlords Association (NLA) has warned. From Monday an extra 160,000 houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) have to be registered with local councils, almost triple the current figure. Tenants Union UK said any increases in rent would be unfair on tenants. The government said the new rules would raise housing standards for tenants. HMOs are homes where people, who are not related, sleep in separate rooms but share facilities such as kitchens or bathrooms. Mainly students, migrants and low-paid workers live in the half a million HMO properties in England. Currently about 64,000 of these HMOs are required to be licensed but the rule changes mean more properties will be required to be inspected and certificated by local authorities. Previously only houses of more than three storeys and with five or more people forming at least two households had to be licensed. The new rules remove the three-storey threshold,externaland apply to smaller homes. Rrouse says some of the HMOs in Leeds are the worst in the country because of their poor condition Rrouse, an environmental engineer from Leeds, has been living in HMOs for the past nine years, as he tries to save money to buy a house. ""Property prices are so high, so saving for a deposit is hard work, and rents for one-bed flats are extortionate. So the only way I can afford to build a deposit is to live in a HMO,"" he said. ""It's a sociable way to rent, but the quality of the properties can vary. I've had HMOs where gas leaks have been common, carpets haven't been fitted and whole kitchen units have fallen off the wall."" Figures from the Valuation Office Agency,externalshow that the private median rent for a room in England in 2017-18 was Â£385 a month. Over the past three years median room rents in England have risen twice as fast as median wages, leaving tenants like Rrouse concerned about any future increases. ""If rents do go up because of this new legislation I've got friends who'll struggle to pay their rent because they just haven't got the cash,"" he said. The Centre for Economics and Business Research estimates the licensing process will on average cost landlords Â£1,200 each, and collectively, more than Â£95m. Landlords say the extra licensing costs will result in rents having to be increased. Some landlords are also expected to reduce the number of rooms they rent out, meaning existing tenants would face eviction. The new rules, which only apply to properties in England, will also require landlords to provide extra refuse bins and make sure bedrooms within HMOs are a minimum size. An HMO is a property occupied by more than one household and by more than two people. For a property to be classified as an HMO, the residents must be sharing at least one basic amenity (i.e. toilet, bathroom or kitchen) Examples of HMOs include bedsits, shared houses, student halls and hostels Under the old licensing scheme HMOs that were three or more storeys and occupied by five or more people forming at least two separate households were required to be licensed The new mandatory licensing of HMOs will be extended so that smaller properties (i.e. any storey height) that house five or more people in two or more separate households will also require a licence Source: Centre for Economics and Business Research The NLA said the new regulations though are the latest burden being placed on private sector landlords. ""Extra regulation will increase landlords costs,"" says Richard Lambert, chief executive of the NLA. ""When costs go up, like any other business, landlords will look to pass on that additional cost in the price, meaning tenants will pay more in rent. ""Some landlords will also reduce the number of rooms they rent out to try and comply with the legislation, meaning some tenants will face eviction."" More than half of the 500,000 HMOs are now required to be licensed because of the new legislation If you live in an HMO your landlord must: Keep shared areas clean and in good repair - for example staircases and corridors Install smoke alarms and provide a fire escape Repair faulty gas and electrical appliances - the property has to have a gas safety check every year and the electrics must be checked every five years If your home does not meet the safety standards you should first complain to your landlord. If the problem is not fixed then you are advised to contact your local council. The council should inspect the property and can tell your landlord to fix the problem if it does not meet safety standards. If the landlord still does not follow the advice, the council can take over the management of the home in serious cases, such as your health or safety being at serious risk. If this happens, usually for a 12-month period, your tenancy rights stay the same and you pay your rent to the council. Source: Citizens Advice The number of HMO licences has been increasing in recent years as more people look to rent privately. Data from about 200 councils in England, obtained by a BBC Freedom of Information request, suggested the number of HMO licences has nearly trebled since 2013. Rogue landlords targeted by government Can a landlord kick me out? Number of middle-aged renters doubles Ben Clay, from Tenants Union UK, said it would be wrong for landlords to increase rents because of the introduction of new legislation. ""Renters are already facing a perfect storm of rent increases at a time when more people are having to deal with shrinking wage packets,"" he added. ""We welcome this additional legislation, but we feel that there is still further to go and that all rented accommodation should be subject to regulation, to ensure standards rise."" The Ministry of Housing and Local Government said the new rules would help protect at least 850,000 more people in privately-rented homes. A spokesman said: ""While the vast majority of landlords provide decent accommodation, these measures are about raising standards in private rented homes where landlords knowingly flout their responsibilities. ""Many of the properties that will be covered by the new rules, already fall under existing licensing schemes that will be transferred into mandatory licensing free of charge, so there will be no additional costs to those landlords.""

"Ben Francis is still only 26 but his business is expected to see turnover hit Â£100m this year The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to Ben Francis, founder of UK sportswear brand Gymshark. It is hard to know how a then 19-year-old Ben Francis had the time or the energy to get Gymshark up and running. While many young entrepreneurs have to juggle running their start-up with holding down a nine to five job, back in 2012 Ben was a full-time student by day, and a pizza delivery man by night. ""I'd wake up and go to Aston University [in Birmingham], then finish uni early afternoon, and work at Pizza Hut from 5pm till 10pm,"" he says. ""I could answer emails [about Gymshark] in between deliveries. Then I'd go home and sort out the website, and design new products."" After two exhausting years of this - with annual revenues of his nascent business hitting an impressive Â£250,000 - Ben quit both university and the world of pizzas to focus on his company. Fast-forward to today, and Gymshark expects turnover this year to reach Â£100m. A key to Ben's success has been giving freebies to key ""influencers"", such as bodybuilders like Lex Griffin (right) who have large numbers of social media followers Before Ben set up the business in 2012 it is fair to say that the entrepreneurial fire was already burning in his belly. As a young teenager he set up a website that sold car licence plates. A keen gym-goer, he then built and launched two iPhone fitness tracking apps, one of which earned him around Â£8,000. The idea for Gymshark followed; an online retail business aimed at fitness fanatics that originally sold health supplements. ""I was going to the gym and basically was interested in, and wanted to be involved in, the fitness industry,"" he says. ""I wanted to combine that with making a transactional website."" When Ben found that the profit margins from selling the supplements were too low, he dived into another area - clothing. ""I remember looking around, and I couldn't find any clothing I wanted to wear,"" he says. ""So I said, 'let's make it ourselves.'"" The company produces both male and female ranges of clothes Enlisting the help of his brother, and a group of friends, Ben bought a sewing machine and screen printer, and started to make gym vests and t-shirts in his parents' garage. ""My nan made curtains, so she taught me how to sew,"" he says. ""I remember thinking we had 10 orders to do, and to make 12-15 products it would take most of the day. But it was so much fun learning."" Now 26, Ben admits that after Gymshark first moved into clothing there was no immediate grand plan regarding growing the business. ""It was more a case of 'I really want to wear this,' so I made it,"" he says. And so the company started to make body builder vests that fitted slim teenagers, because most on the market were designed for older men who had already built up their muscle bulk. Ben adds that he would also guess on how much to price items. ""It was literally a case of what would we want to pay for something,"" he says. ""There was no considered approach. We were like, 'we would pay Â£20.'"" Gymshark now makes a wider range of fashion clothing Six years later, Gymshark now has more than 1.2 million customers, and 215 employees at its Solihull headquarters in the West Midlands. So how has the firm been able to grow so quickly? In short, it has been a very savvy user of social media. More specifically Gymshark decided it would send free clothing to key ""influencers"", prominent body-builders and other fitness fanatics - such as Lex Griffin and Nikki Blackketter. The hope was that such stars would talk positively about the products to their followers on YouTube and Instagram. The idea worked better than Gymshark could have dreamed, and sales soon skyrocketed. At the same time it worked hard to ensure its own social media accounts were as interesting and visual as possible. Today it has 2.4 million followers on Instagram and 1.5 million on Facebook. MoreThe Bossfeatures, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: 'They were not comfortable about hiring a woman' 'People thought we were interns but we were in charge' The dad who feeds his son burgers almost every day More recently the firm has held events around the world, inviting fans of the brand to meet some of its influencers. Hundreds of people typically attend. Another key factor in the continuing success of Gymshark is bringing in a more experienced pair of hands to help Ben run the business. Sportswear industry veteran Steve Hewitt joined as managing director in 2015, before being given the chief executive title in April last year. Ben remains the majority owner, with Mr Hewitt and chief strategic officer Paul Richardson also having substantial stakes. Another shareholder is Ben's friend Lewis Morgan who helped to launch Gymshark, but left the business a few years ago. Hundreds of fans typically attend Gymshark's events where people can meet some of its influencers Emily Sutherland, a features writer at trade magazine Drapers, says Gymshark's use of social media influencers has been key to its success. ""The influencers give shoppers a reason to buy into Gymshark over other brands, because they feel a personal connection,"" she says. Ms Sutherland adds that because Gymshark is an online-only and direct-to-consumer brand, it is ""able to remain nimble, react quickly to market changes, and isn't weighed down by expensive store costs"". As for the future, the plan is to expand Gymshark's overseas sales. Already 40% of its sales come from the US, and it aims to have 25 international country-specific online stores by 2020, up from 11 at present. The company may also open its first bricks-and-mortar store. ""I don't go shopping very often, but I'm thinking of the best way to do a permanent location somewhere,"" says Ben. ""I'm not sure, we'd need a lot of space. I want to do a cool destination.""

"This video can not be played Indonesia quake looter: ""We need to eat"" A picture of large-scale destruction is emerging in and around the Indonesian city of Palu after an earthquake and tsunami struck on Friday. At least 844 people are confirmed to have died but that figure is expected to rise sharply as more remote areas are reached. The authorities have said they will begin burying victims in mass graves, fearing disease could begin to spread. Dozens of people are thought to be trapped alive under the rubble. In Palu, rescuers are awaiting heavy machinery to search the ruins of a hotel and a shopping centre as aftershocks made it unsafe for them to go in. ""Communication is limited, heavy machinery is limited... it's not enough for the numbers of buildings that collapsed,"" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. Air traffic controller hailed as quake hero In pictures: Search for survivors A tsunami warning had been issued after the magnitude-7.5 earthquake hit on Friday, but it is unclear whether it was still in place when the waves hit. Videos show people screaming as 6m-high waves power over the beach - where a festival was being set-up - sweeping up everything in their path. Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the region to urge a ""day and night"" effort to rescue survivors. Mr Widodo has also agreed to accept international help for disaster response and relief, Thomas Lembong, the head of the Indonesian investment board said on Twitter on Monday. Meanwhile, Indonesia's justice ministry is reporting that 1,200 convicts escaped from three different detention facilities in the Sulawesi region following the earthquake and tsunami.

By Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Palu Lying on a stretcher in the dark outside the Mamboro health clinic in Palu is a five-year-old girl with a broken leg. She was found alone, Doctor Sasono tells me. ""We don't know where her family is and she doesn't remember where they live."" His clinic has no power and is running out of medical supplies. A few metres from her stretcher bed are rows of bodies in bags. The smell of decomposition fills the air. Dr Sasono says they will be buried in mass graves to stop the spread of diseases: ""They are starting to smell. We want to wait for relatives to pick them up, but we can't wait any longer."" Rows of rubble lie all along the shoreline where vibrant fishing villages once stood. People's possessions lie smashed together, with cars and boats tossed around by the massive waves. Amid the rubble are tents where families are sleeping out in the open. Read Rebecca's first full report from the disaster zone Blocked roads, a damaged airport and broken telecommunications have made it difficult to bring help into the affected area, and impossible to contact more remote regions. Roads crumbled as the ground underneath gave way ""We don't know for sure what is the impact,"" said Mr Nugroho. Local media report that mobile phone signals have been detected in the rubble of the shopping mall in Palu, and shouts have been heard under the debris of the Roa Roa Hotel. Dozens of people were known to be inside the Roa Roa hotel One volunteer, Thalib Bawano, told AFP news agency that three people had been rescued from the hotel rubble, where more than 50 people may be trapped. ""We also heard voices at several points, including a child,"" he said. ""They were asking for help, but they are still there till now. We gave them motivation... so they can have spirit because they are trapped between life and death."" ""We gave them water and food but that's not what they wanted. They wanted to get out. 'We want to get out, out, out. Help! Help!' they kept screaming. That's what we heard. Some were just knocking."" In Palu, people have been sleeping in the open, wary of returning to their homes, even if they are still intact. With hospitals damaged, injured people have been treated in the open and at least one military field hospital has been set up. The military has taken over the airport to fly aid in, and injured people and other evacuees out. ""What you'll see, you know, as the days go by and people don't have access to adequate hygiene supplies, shelter, you'll see the situation deteriorate if they don't get that access so, we've sent shelter kits,"" Tom Howells, programme director for Save The Children, said on Sunday. Military aircraft have been evacuating some of the injured A shattered mosque in Palu With supplies limited, people have been raiding damaged shops for food, water and medicine. ""We don't have any other choice, we must get food,"" one man told AFP. Meanwhile mass graves are being dug, one of them for up to 300 bodies. The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles),externaljust off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday, setting off a tsunami, US monitors say. The earthquake was powerful but shallow and with more lateral than vertical movement, not typically the kind of tremor that sets off tsunamis. Vice-President Jusuf Kalla has said the final death toll could be in the thousands while the Red Cross estimates that more than 1.6 million people have been affected. A sophisticated tsunami warning system was put in place across the whole Pacific region after the 2004 disaster, which killed nearly a quarter of a million people. It remains unclear why it was not effective this time, but Mr Nugroho said Indonesia's part of the network has suffered from a lack of funding.

"Cern, based in Switzerland, is one of the world's largest centres for scientific research A senior scientist has given what has been described as a ""highly offensive"" presentation about the role of women in physics, the BBC has learned. At a workshop organised by Cern, Prof Alessandro Strumia of Pisa University said that ""physics was invented and built by men, it's not by invitation"". He said male scientists were being discriminated against because of ideology rather than merit. He was speaking at a workshop in Geneva on gender and high energy physics. Prof Strumia has since defended his comments, saying he was only presenting the facts. Cern, the European nuclear research centre, described Prof Strumia's presentation as ""highly offensive"". The centre, which discovered the Higgs Boson in 2012, has removed slides used in the talk from its website ""in line with a code of conduct that does not tolerate personal attacks and insults"". Prof Strumia, who regularly works at Cern, presented the results of a study of published research papers from an online library. He told his audience of young, predominantly female physicists that his results ""proved"" that ""physics is not sexist against women. However the truth does not matter, because it is part of a political battle coming from outside"". He produced a series of graphs,externalwhich, he claimed, showed that women were hired over men whose research was cited more by other scientists in their publications, which is an indication of higher quality. He also presented data that he claimed showed that male and female researchers were equally cited at the start of their careers but men scored progressively better as their careers progressed. Seven trailblazing women in science Female scientists post 'distractingly sexy' photos Viewpoint: Women must fight sexism in science Prof Strumia pointed to behavioural research which he suggested may account for the disparity. One study, he told his audience, indicated that ""men prefer working with things and women prefer working with people"" and another, he claimed, suggested that there was a ""difference even in children before any social influence"". Prof Alessandro Strumia is based at Pisa University in Italy Prof Strumia said that these conclusions may ""not be fully right... (but) the opposite assumption of identical brains is ideology"". As evidence of discrimination against male researchers, Prof Strumia claimed that ""Oxford University extends exam times for women's benefit"" and ""Italy offers free or cheaper university for female (research) students"". He also said that he himself was overlooked for a job that he was more qualified for, which was given to a woman. Dr Jessica Wade, a physicist at Imperial College London who was at the meeting, told BBC News that Prof Strumia's analysis was simplistic, drawing on ideas that had ""long been discredited"". ""It was really upsetting to those at the workshop,"" she said. ""There were young women and men exchanging ideas and their experiences on how to encourage more women into the subject and to combat discrimination in their careers. Then this man gets up, saying all this horrible stuff."" She added: ""I don't understand how such a forward thinking organisation like Cern, which does so much to promote diversity in research, could have invited him to speak to young people just starting off in their research careers when his ideas are so well known."" Prof Strumia claimed there were examples where men were discriminated against Another one of the slides from Alessandro Strumia's talk at Cern In a statement, Cern - which currently has its first ever woman director-general - said that the organisers were not aware of the content of the talk,externalprior to the workshop. ""Cern is a culturally diverse organisation bringing together people from dozens of nationalities. It is a place where everyone is welcome, and all have the same opportunities, regardless of ethnicity, beliefs, gender or sexual orientation,"" it said. A Cern spokesman confirmed that there was a video recording of the presentation. Senior managers would decide whether to release part or all of it, it said. When the BBC contacted Prof Strumia he said: ""People say that physics is sexist, physics is racist. I made some simple checks and discovered that it wasn't, that it was becoming sexist against men and said so."" Last month, Prof Jocelyn Bell Burnell told the BBC she believed thatunconscious bias against women prevented them from getting jobs in physics research.

"Restaurants will be legally barred from keeping tips from staff under plans to be announced by Theresa May on Monday. The move follows a public outcry in 2015, when it emerged that many High Street chains routinely took up to 10% of tips paid by credit and debit card. Most chains have since stopped this practice, typically charging a much lower fee of 2.5% on tips paid by card. The hospitality trade body said the fact restaurants had acted voluntarily meant new legislation was unnecessary. ""We developed a Code of Practice  - together with Unite - which deals with the fair distribution of tips among all staff, not just waiters,"" said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""As a result, best practice has been promoted across the sector and we see no evidence of tips being withheld across restaurant chains."" Ms Nicholls also said smaller restaurants may need to retain ""a small amount"" from card tips to cover ""the not inconsiderable costs of credit card charges and processing payments"". Are online bookings killing restaurants? Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? Mrs May said the ""tough"" legislation, which would apply in England, Scotland and Wales, was part of the government's push to end exploitative employment practices. In 2016, Sajid Javid, then Business Secretary, saidtips should go in full to waiting staffand announced proposals to stop employer deductions from them, but stopped short of legislating. A government spokesperson was unable to say whether the legislation would also cover the common practice of customer tips left for waiting staff being redistributed to include back of house staff such as cooks and kitchen workers. Waiter Charles Archer relies on tip money Charles Archer, a part-time waiter at Pizza Express in Exeter, said he retained all his cash tips. With card tips, he keeps 70% with 30% going to kitchen staff, but there is no admin fee. He said he relied on tip money to pay for food with his basic salary used to pay his rent. ""Over the course of a week it can add up to a decent amount of money,"" he says. He said he did not expect the proposed legislation to change the situation of tips being shared with all restaurant staff unless the law specifically stated that tips had to go to the person that served them. ""Any law creating an increase in benefits [to waiters] will reduce benefits elsewhere,"" he said. ""These companies should be paying their staff more but they don't."" A restaurant owner, who runs four restaurants, but did not want to be named, said he welcomed the legislation because diners expected their tips to go to people who served them, not the restaurant. But he said service tips should be shared with kitchen staff, ""otherwise, someone front-of-house who's just started could be earning more than an experienced trained chef"". He said that some waiters on minimum wage would earn up to Â£15 an hour with tips, a rate he could not match for kitchen staff. Do you leave a tip in cash or pay it by card? It might make a difference to whether it ends up in the pocket of your server or is kept by the business. Cash tips are legally the property of staff. They can go straight to the person serving you or they can be pooled and shared out among staff - but they are not the property of the business. Card tips are different - they currently belong to the owner of the restaurant who has no legal duty to hand any of them over to staff (although in practice many do). The same applies to any service charge automatically added to a bill. How businesses decide to share these tips out varies widely. Some keep all the tips while some skim a percentage off the top. Others take a percentage to distribute to back of house staff. There are about 150,000 hotels, pubs and restaurants in the UK, employing about two million people. Unite regional officer Dave Turnbull said cracking down on tipping abuses was long overdue and the union would seek assurances that the legislation truly delivered fair tips. ""There will be question marks as to whether it will deal with the myriad of scams some restaurants use to pilfer staff tips to boost their profits,"" he said. Labour said the government's proposal copied another of its policies, which the party announced in June. Jeremy Corbyn had said,externalthen that a Labour government would legislate to ensure workers keep 100% of their tips. Are online bookings killing restaurants?

"Relations between Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau, pictured earlier this year, have occasionally been fraught The US and Canada have reached a new trade deal, along with Mexico, to replace the current North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) gives the US greater access to Canada's dairy market and allows extra imports of Canadian cars. Thedeal has 34 chapters,externaland governs more than $1tn (Â£767bn) in trade. US President Donald Trump, who has long sought to change Nafta, said the new deal was ""wonderful"". Until recently it looked as ifCanada could be excluded from a final trade agreementto replace Nafta which has been in place since 1994. The new USMCA is intended to last 16 years and be reviewed every six years. Following the agreement, Mr Trump tweeted that USMCA was a ""great deal"" for all three countries and solves the ""deficiencies and mistakes"" in Nafta. Allow Twitter content?

The US has been fighting trade wars on several fronts this year, includingplacing tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Mexico and Canada, as part of President Trump's America First policy. Tariffs on cars are also threatened. What is a trade war and why should I worry? Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Is Trump right about trade? The hundreds of pages of the agreement were released in the early hours of Monday and contain updated arrangements for Canada's dairy industry and measures aimed at shifting lower-paid car jobs from Mexico. On dairy, US farmers will have access to 3.5% of Canada's $16bn-a-year dairy market. On cars, Canada and Mexico have a quota of 2.6 million cars they can export to the US as a protection for their car industry if the US imposes a 25% global tariff on car imports In addition, 40% of car parts of vehicles produced in the USMCA area must be made in areas of North America, paying wages of $16 an hour On the lumber (or wood) industry, Canada secured protection from US anti-dumping tariffs through the preservation of a dispute-settlement mechanism. This video can not be played If Nafta trade deal was a hamburger... The US made a deal with Mexico in August, but relations with Canada over the trade pact had become increasingly strained in recent weeks. The Trump administration set Sunday as a deadline for Canada to strike a deal. A protectionist policy under the Mr Trump has seen the US forge ahead with individual trade deals, rejecting bigger multi-lateral trade agreements and posing a challenge to decades of global free trade. As part of this policy Mr Trump has also launched a trade war against China, whichhas already hurt companiesand couldcurb global economic growth. US-China trade row: What has happened so far? Andrew Walker, BBC Economics Correspondent Is this a win for President Trump? He certainly has got Canada and Mexico to agree some important things he wanted. It will be harder, or at least more expensive, for car makers to use parts from outside North America, notably from China. American dairy farmers are getting better access to the highly protected Canadian market. There may well be some political benefit for him in the forthcoming Congressional elections. But he has another wider objective - to reduce the imbalance in US international trade, with individual trade partners and globally. The US imports more than it exports and President Trump wants to change that. Judging whether he has won in that sense will need more time. However, many economists don't think trade balances are primarily the outcome of trade policy - instead they reflect government borrowing, private investment and savings decisions and international capital movements. The Canadian dollar jumped to a five-month high and the Mexican peso rose to its highest level for seven weeks on news of the deal. Meredith Crowley, international trade economist at the University of Cambridge, said the agreement on dairy looked to be a ""cosmetic concession"" so in one way Canada had done well out of the pact. She said the insertion of a minimum wage level for car parts workers could lead to similar clauses in other trade deals. ""If it turns out to be very politically popular in the US it could [be used again],"" she said, Canadian dairy farmers were critical.  ""We fail to see how this deal can be good for the 220,000 Canadian families that depend on dairy for their livelihood,"" said Pierre Lampron, president of Dairy Farmers of Canada. However, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: ""It's a good day for Canada"". Mexico's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said it was a good deal for his country and North America. The aim is for the agreement to be signed before Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto leaves office on 1 December. What is a trade war and why should I worry?

"This video can not be played Indonesia quake looter: ""We need to eat"" A picture of large-scale destruction is emerging in and around the Indonesian city of Palu after an earthquake and tsunami struck on Friday. At least 844 people are confirmed to have died but that figure is expected to rise sharply as more remote areas are reached. The authorities have said they will begin burying victims in mass graves, fearing disease could begin to spread. Dozens of people are thought to be trapped alive under the rubble. In Palu, rescuers are awaiting heavy machinery to search the ruins of a hotel and a shopping centre as aftershocks made it unsafe for them to go in. ""Communication is limited, heavy machinery is limited... it's not enough for the numbers of buildings that collapsed,"" said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency. Air traffic controller hailed as quake hero In pictures: Search for survivors A tsunami warning had been issued after the magnitude-7.5 earthquake hit on Friday, but it is unclear whether it was still in place when the waves hit. Videos show people screaming as 6m-high waves power over the beach - where a festival was being set-up - sweeping up everything in their path. Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited the region to urge a ""day and night"" effort to rescue survivors. Mr Widodo has also agreed to accept international help for disaster response and relief, Thomas Lembong, the head of the Indonesian investment board said on Twitter on Monday. Meanwhile, Indonesia's justice ministry is reporting that 1,200 convicts escaped from three different detention facilities in the Sulawesi region following the earthquake and tsunami.

By Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Palu Lying on a stretcher in the dark outside the Mamboro health clinic in Palu is a five-year-old girl with a broken leg. She was found alone, Doctor Sasono tells me. ""We don't know where her family is and she doesn't remember where they live."" His clinic has no power and is running out of medical supplies. A few metres from her stretcher bed are rows of bodies in bags. The smell of decomposition fills the air. Dr Sasono says they will be buried in mass graves to stop the spread of diseases: ""They are starting to smell. We want to wait for relatives to pick them up, but we can't wait any longer."" Rows of rubble lie all along the shoreline where vibrant fishing villages once stood. People's possessions lie smashed together, with cars and boats tossed around by the massive waves. Amid the rubble are tents where families are sleeping out in the open. Read Rebecca's first full report from the disaster zone Blocked roads, a damaged airport and broken telecommunications have made it difficult to bring help into the affected area, and impossible to contact more remote regions. Roads crumbled as the ground underneath gave way ""We don't know for sure what is the impact,"" said Mr Nugroho. Local media report that mobile phone signals have been detected in the rubble of the shopping mall in Palu, and shouts have been heard under the debris of the Roa Roa Hotel. Dozens of people were known to be inside the Roa Roa hotel One volunteer, Thalib Bawano, told AFP news agency that three people had been rescued from the hotel rubble, where more than 50 people may be trapped. ""We also heard voices at several points, including a child,"" he said. ""They were asking for help, but they are still there till now. We gave them motivation... so they can have spirit because they are trapped between life and death."" ""We gave them water and food but that's not what they wanted. They wanted to get out. 'We want to get out, out, out. Help! Help!' they kept screaming. That's what we heard. Some were just knocking."" In Palu, people have been sleeping in the open, wary of returning to their homes, even if they are still intact. With hospitals damaged, injured people have been treated in the open and at least one military field hospital has been set up. The military has taken over the airport to fly aid in, and injured people and other evacuees out. ""What you'll see, you know, as the days go by and people don't have access to adequate hygiene supplies, shelter, you'll see the situation deteriorate if they don't get that access so, we've sent shelter kits,"" Tom Howells, programme director for Save The Children, said on Sunday. Military aircraft have been evacuating some of the injured A shattered mosque in Palu With supplies limited, people have been raiding damaged shops for food, water and medicine. ""We don't have any other choice, we must get food,"" one man told AFP. Meanwhile mass graves are being dug, one of them for up to 300 bodies. The 7.5-magnitude quake occurred at a depth of 10km (6.2 miles),externaljust off the central island of Sulawesi at 18:03 (10:03 GMT) on Friday, setting off a tsunami, US monitors say. The earthquake was powerful but shallow and with more lateral than vertical movement, not typically the kind of tremor that sets off tsunamis. Vice-President Jusuf Kalla has said the final death toll could be in the thousands while the Red Cross estimates that more than 1.6 million people have been affected. A sophisticated tsunami warning system was put in place across the whole Pacific region after the 2004 disaster, which killed nearly a quarter of a million people. It remains unclear why it was not effective this time, but Mr Nugroho said Indonesia's part of the network has suffered from a lack of funding.

"Ryanair staff in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Portugal went on strike last week Ryanair has warned investors its full-year profits will be lower than expected, partly due to the recent wave of industrial action. The airline said its profits would be 12% lower than the â¬1.25-1.35bn (Â£1.11-1.2bn) previously forecast, and it now expects profits of between â¬1.1-1.2bn. Ryanair said this was due to higher oil prices, higher costs associated with EU flight compensation rules, and weaker fares due to the recent strikes. It warned it may lower forecasts again. Shares in the airline opened down 8%. Last week, cabin crew and pilots in Germany, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Portugal took industrial action which led to a number of flight cancellations. Ryanair said fares for the third quarter of the year were lower as forward bookings, particularly for the October school mid-terms and Christmas, were being affected by fear of further strikes. The carrier said it had not hedged its fuel bill against prices rises, and this meant it would be paying 10% more for its fuel thanks to the recent rise in the global price. Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary has called the strikes ""unnecessary"" Ryanair chief executive Michael O'Leary said: ""While we successfully managed five strikes by 25% of our Irish pilots this summer, two recent co-ordinated strikes by cabin crew and pilots across five EU countries has affected passenger numbers (through flight cancellations). ""Customer confidence, forward bookings and [third quarter] fares have been affected, most notably over the October school mid-terms and Christmas, in those five countries where unnecessary strikes have been repeated."" The airline is making cuts to some routes and closing some of its bases. Its four-aircraft Eindhoven base in the Netherlands will close, although most routes to and from Eindhoven will continue on overseas-based aircraft. It is taking the same action at its two-aircraft Bremen base in Germany and is making cuts at its Niederrhein base. Ryanair says all affected customers have been contacted by email or text message, and will be re-accommodated on other flights or refunded as they wish. After many years of ignoring workers' attempts to get it to recognise unions, Ryanair finally agreed at the end of 2017. But staff in a range of countries have continued to have issues with the company's employment practices, in particular its use of contracts based on Irish employment law and its insistence on paying staff through Irish bank accounts, which cause those based elsewhere extra inconvenience and costs. In a complex industrial relations background, involving different disputes in different countries with cabin crew and pilots with their own grievances, Ryanair broadly says it is offering staff what they have asked for. A striking cabin crew member at Frankfurt airport But staff in certain parts of the company's cross-border operations plainly do not agree, because the possibility of further strike action remains. Ryanair said in its statement it ""cannot rule out further disruptions in [the third quarter], which may require full-year guidance to be lowered further and may necessitate further trimming of loss-making winter capacity"". David Madden, an analysts at CMC Markets, said it was plain Ryanair's aggressive stance was having a negative impact on its business: ""In August 2017 the airline's share price hit an all-time high as the company made a concerted effort to improve customer service prior to that, and it clearly paid off."" He pointed out that since then, the shares had lost 38% ""Clients like cheap airfares, but they value flight certainty more, and the company is running the risk of doing long-term damage to the brand. The airline is still aiming to make over â¬1bn profit, so it's not like they can't afford to pay their staff well.""

"Those calling to boycott the vote have been celebrating Macedonia's vote on changing its name to North Macedonia looks to have fallen far short of the turnout required. Preliminary results show that just over a third of Macedonians voted in the referendum, with 50% needed. But with 90% of those who took part in favour of the change, the country's prime minister has urged parliament to ""confirm the will of the majority"". The vote aimed to end a long-running dispute with Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia. Athens had agreed to end its objections to Macedonia's EU and Nato membership bids if the change was passed. New name, same country? A choice for Macedonians The makeover that divided a nation Over 85% of votes have been counted so far, but a campaign by some nationalists - including the country's president - to boycott Sunday's referendum seems to have had an impact, with just 36% of eligible voters taking part. Prime Minister Zoran Zaev threatened to call early elections if parliament did not support the proposal, made non-binding by the poor turnout. These young voters backed a Yes vote, holding up placards for a ""European Macedonia"" ""If, as we all expect, we truly have a big visible, tangible majority for [voting in favour], out of those who voted, then the future is clear,"" he said after polls closed on Sunday. ""The vote of the MPs in parliament must resolutely be a vote for a responsible acceleration of the processes towards Nato and the European Union."" Macedonia declared independence during the break-up of Yugoslavia in 1991. But Greece objected to its new neighbour's name. The dispute harks back to ancient history, because both present-day Macedonia and northern Greece were part of a Roman province called Macedonia. And both claim the heritage of Alexander the Great two centuries earlier. Full story: What's in a name? The man who focused on one word for 23 years Greece's objections forced the UN to refer to the new country as ""the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"". Athens also vetoed Macedonia's attempt to join Nato in 2008 - and blocked its EU membership ambitions. The addition of one word to Macedonia's constitutional name: North. Since 1991, many suggestions have been proposed, then rejected. But last year's change of government in Macedonia finally brought the start of serious negotiations. Prime Minister Zoran Zaev is pushing a Yes vote for a future in the EU and Nato ""Our citizens were sick of that problem,"" says Macedonia's information minister, Damjan Manchevski. ""It had been weighing on Macedonia for such a long period of time and not letting us advance."" Greece will end its veto on Macedonia's accession to Nato and the EU. ""We don't change our name because we want to do it,"" Mr Zaev told the BBC. ""We do it because of our future in the EU and Nato. Everyone is aware why we do it."" That applies particularly to Macedonia's younger citizens. ""Young people in Macedonia are a quarter of the population - and they're one of the largest marginalised groups,"" says Dona Kosturanova of the Youth Educational Forum. ""They're struggling with poor education, high unemployment and few opportunities for prosperity. They're desperate to see advancement towards a prosperous environment."" Opponents say the country has been bullied by Greece and the EU, pointing to the fact that top European politicians urged the voters to back the change. The leader of the main opposition party, Hristijan Mickoski, was quoted as saying that the proposed deal ""will humiliate Macedonia"". President Gjorge Ivanov was among those who said they would be boycotting the vote. He described the proposed deal as ""historical suicide"". Meanwhile, Russia has been accused of fomenting opposition to the name change to stop Macedonia drifting into the West's orbit. Moscow denies the claim.

"This video can not be played Ford has agreed to refund hundreds of drivers after they suffered engine problems Ford has offered to refund thousands of pounds to customers whose engines have failed, following a BBC investigation. Hundreds of customers have said their cars with Ford EcoBoost engines have overheated, causing engine failure. Others have reported their cars with 1.6-litre EcoBoost engines have burst into flames while they were driving. Many 1.0-litre drivers had been told they had to pay for repairs, but Ford has now said it will cover the cost and refund customers who have already paid. The car giant said in a statement safety was its number one priority. ""Ford has already made substantial contributions towards the cost of 1.0-litre repairs, but ongoing discussions with customers show that Ford needs to go further to ensure reasonable repair costs are covered,"" it said. ""With any future cases, subject to being assessed and linked to potential 1.0-litre engine overheating, we will contribute 100% of the cost of repair at a Ford dealer. ""Furthermore, we will re-examine previous cases to ensure that this policy of a 100% contribution to the repair cost is applied consistently."" Ford said it had reworked 96% of affected cars. George Roberts, of Brandon, Suffolk, was driving his Fiesta ST 1.6-litre on a dual carriageway late at night when he realised his car was on fire. He noticed an orange glow at the side of the vehicle, pulled over to the side of the road and saw the flames. ""From the whole engine being on fire to the whole car, took about six minutes,"" he said. George Roberts was driving his Fiesta ST when the engine caught fire Mr Roberts said he was offered an insurance payout on his car, which he accepted despite it being less than it would have cost to replace his car with a similar model. He said: ""I've lost a lot of money through Ford, they don't seem massively bothered by it."" As for the issues with the 1.6-litre engines, Ford said it had issued avoluntary safety recall,externalthrough the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) in January on certain vehicles including the Focus, Kuga, C-MAX, Fiesta ST and Transit Connect models built between 2010 and 2015. It said it was contacting customers affected by the overheating problem to arrange for a coolant sensor to be fitted. The fault can cause the engine's cylinder head to crack, which in extreme circumstances could lead to a fire. Ford has been aware of the issue on the 1.6-litre EcoBoost since 2012, after several engine fires in the United States. A recall was issued in the US in 2014. Check if your car has had a safety recall,external(Source: UK government),external Gill Cronshaw, from Altrincham in Greater Manchester, was driving on a busy motorway when her Ford Focus 1.0-litre EcoBoost suffered a complete engine failure. ""There were no warning lights, there was no indication, the power just, as my foot was on the accelerator, I could just feel there was nothing left,"" she said. ""It was the most frightening experience of my life because you just feel completely powerless."" The incident happened in March, just three weeks after her car had had a service and MOT. When the breakdown service reached her, the engine had overheated. Ford has issued a recall on some engines and a safety notice on others ""The pipe had a very clear split, there were coolant stains all inside the bonnet, so I could see there had been quite a big failure, it wasn't wear and tear. ""Car dealer Evans Halshaw confirmed that it needed a new engine at a cost of Â£5,500, which I was obviously horrified at."" Mrs Cronshaw said Ford offered her a contribution of 55% of the cost of a new engine, but she ended up trading it in at a loss. Ford's 1.0-litre EcoBoost engine was introduced in 2010 and has been described by the company as a ""game-changer"". It has won 10 international awards and Ford has claimed it has set the benchmark for small, fuel-efficient engines. Louise O'Riordan, from north London, started aFacebook group,externalafter her 1.0-litre EcoBoost failed, and it now has more than 3,000 members. ""I needed to support others that are going through the same problems that we had,"" she said. ""It's got 3,000 members and we have over 1,200 engine failures, 1,000 of those have happened this year. ""We get over 100 [new members] a month at the moment.""

She is currently without a car after her 1.0-litre EcoBoost suffered a complete loss of power. ""It was a lovely drive,"" she said. Then she received a letter to say it needed a replacement coolant hose. Before she could have the work done, Mrs Backhouse said her car engine cut out. ""I noticed a light come on and it said 'service now', then the power started to go in the car. It felt sluggish,"" she said. While repairs were carried out, the replacement coolant hose was also fitted, and Mrs Backhouse was told her car had a fuse problem which had been fixed. She said just after she had driven out of the garage, the fault happened again. She was without a car for more than a month while trying to negotiate with her dealership and finance company. ""People say 'it's just a car, but it's not just a car it's a lifeline to us."" Mrs Backhouse's finance company eventually agreed she could sell it back, although she did lose the hire purchase payments she had made over the previous 18 months.

"Workers at two branches of the American diner chain TGI Fridays are holding walk-outs over changes they say will cost them hundreds of pounds a month. The firm has introduced a new pay policy, which redistributes customer tips from waiters to kitchen staff. The 24-hour strike will affect branches in Milton Keynes and Covent Garden. The Unite union has forecast a ""summer of disruption"" by unhappy employees. The firm said it pays its staff fairly and is working to find a resolution. Flagging consumer spending on casual dining combined with rises in the minimum wage are squeezing profits at mid-market restaurants like TGI Fridays. In February the chain introduced a system that takes 40% of tips paid by customers on credit and debit cards for redistribution to back-of-house staff. Unite said the aim was to reduce staff turnover in kitchens by giving them a pay rise without increasing costs. But the union said it would cost waiting staff on the minimum wage up to Â£250 a month in lost income. Dave Turnbull from Unite said it wasn't a question of waiting staff not wanting to share with their colleagues, but was about ""greedy"" owners who ""no longer want to pay their hardworking staff anything above the bare minimum"". The union said the action would be repeated and spread to further branches on consecutive Fridays, starting next Friday at the Trafford Centre, in Manchester, and London's Haymarket Piccadilly. TGI Fridays operates 83 restaurants across the UK. Its UK business is backed by Electra Private Equity. Mr Turnbull said: ""Unite is warning TGI Fridays of a summer of disruption if management don't do the decent thing and sit down with us to find a sensible solution to this dispute."" Thousands join TUC march over wages and workers' rights Profits off the menu at Ramsay restaurants What's eating the restaurant trade? A TGI Fridays spokesman said: ""We believe all our team members should be - and are - treated and paid fairly."" The spokesman said the firm was working with staff to find a resolution and aimed to keep the restaurants operating as normal despite the walk-out. Two years agoa government review of tipping practiceadvised that workers should retain all the tips given by the public. However there are no laws restricting restaurant practice and redistribution among non-waiting staff does not contravene best practice recommendations. In March TGI Fridays was among 43 hospitality sector firmsfined for failing to pay staff the National Minimum Wage. TGI Friday's had to repay Â£25 each to 2,300 staff for the purchase of their black uniform shoes.

"This video can not be played Should restaurants be forced to give your tip to your waitress? Waiting staff should receive their tips in full and it should be clearer to customers that gratuities are optional, the business secretary has said. Sajid Javid said a tip had to ""go to the people you intended it to go to"" and announced proposals to stop or limit employer deductions from tips. It follows claims that some restaurant chains were regularly holding back some or all of the tips meant for staff. The Unite union said it was a ""victory"" for staff but should be backed in law. Currently, there is no legal requirement for firms to hand over gratuities to their waiting staff. There are almost 150,000 hotels, pubs and restaurants in Britain, employing about two million people. What happens to waiters' tips? The war over tipping Inquiry into tipping abuse Announcing atwo-month consultation,externalon proposals that the government said would stamp out unfairness, Mr Javid told the BBC: ""Too many people were finding that when they were leaving tips for hardworking people they weren't actually going to those people. ""That's unacceptable. It's got to go to the people you intended it to go to, it's got to be a transparent process, it's also got to be voluntary for good service."" The proposals include: making it clearer for customers that tips are optional preventing or limiting any employer deduction from tips except for those required under tax law and updating the existingvoluntary code of practice,externalfrom the government and putting it on a statutory footing to increase employer compliance Mr Javid said the government would also look at legislation ""if necessary"". Unite had been campaigning for action after complaining that some firms were counting tips as part of a worker's pay. Dave Turnbull, Unite's officer for the hospitality sector, said any change would need backing in law to make it effective. ""Restaurant staff and hotel staff and back-of-house staff should be paid a living wage,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""They're highly skilled people, they've got a lot of customer service skills and it shouldn't be a situation where restaurant owners and large corporate companies take it for granted that customers are going to subsidise low pay."" Sajid Javid said the proposals would ""make tipping fairer"" for millions of service industry workers But Mr Turnbull said the proposals were a ""massive victory for all those waiting staff who have worked tirelessly to expose sharp practices in the hospitality industry"". ""All they want is what any worker wants - to take home what they have earned, no corners cut,"" he said. The British Hospitality Association (BHA), which represents more than 40,000 establishments in the UK, said it would meet with hospitality business leaders across the UK and conduct its own impact assessment. BHA chief executive Ufi Ibrahim told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Empower the customer to know exactly what happens to tips should they choose to leave them. ""Ensure that they know they don't have to leave a service charge, that they could opt to leave a cash tip if they wish to. ""And let them know where that money is going. But what we need to do I think is to ensure that transparency is compulsory."" The business secretary said customers expected tips to go to staff ""in full"" Food critic Jay Rayner told the BBC that the system of service charges and tipping ""has outlived its usefulness"". He believes tippingshould be scrapped,external, with waiters receiving a rise in their basic wage instead. ""It's a bizarre system that we have and it only applies in restaurants, pretty much,"" he said. Last year, restaurant chain Pizza Express announced it wouldstop deducting an 8% administration fee from staff tipsmade by card following pressure from unions and staff. The firm, which uses a ""tronc"" system where tips are collected together and distributed evenly through the staff, said tips made by card would be ""fully distributed"" among employees. Restaurant chain Giraffe scrapped its 10% admin fee on tips last year, joining the Restaurant Group, Carluccio's, Garfunkel's and Jamie Oliver's which do not deduct a fee. The consultation period runs until 27 June 2016. Should waiting staff get tips? Video, 00:01:12Should waiting staff get tips?

"Damian Wawrzyniak started the Twitter campaign #StopNoShows It's no secret that UK restaurants are struggling, with a clutch of big-name chains announcing closures in recent months due to weaker demand and rising overheads. But it seems another issue is adding to their woes - people not turning up for bookings. According to some estimates, ""no-shows"" account for 5-20% of total restaurant bookings across the country and can cost venues thousands of pounds a month. One example is the Beach House restaurant in Oxwich, Gower, south Wales, which reported having more than 100 last-minute cancellations over 10 days in April, ""most of which were no-shows"".

""I think over the Easter weekend we lost about Â£3,000,"" says managing director Neil Kedward. ""Any restaurant has a fragile economic model, and if a third of your covers don't turn up it can have a huge impact."" Damian Wawrzyniak, head chef and owner of House of Feasts in Peterborough, got so fed up with the problem he started a Twitter campaign called #StopNoShow which has since gone global. At its worst, he says, his high-end restaurant had 10-15 no-shows a month and sometimes for groups as large as 18 people. It can mean lost revenue, hiring too many staff for an evening and wasted food, Mr Wawrzyniak says. No-shows can cost restaurants thousands of pounds a month He blames third-party online booking sites, such as Bookatable, Resdiary and OpenTable, which advertise ""thousands of deals"" and let you make multiple reservations. OpenTable, however, does stop diners making several bookings in the same timeslot and blocks users who accumulate four no-shows within 12 months. Jay Rayner, the Observer's restaurant critic, thinks online booking has also depersonalised the relationship between restaurants and their customers. ""If you talk to an individual when you book, some form of connection has been made and it's much harder to screw a restaurant around. If it's all online people think less about the consequences, which is reprehensible."" One regular restaurant goer, Nicola Fahey, says she eats out once or twice a week and doesn't turn up for about half of her online bookings. Nicola Fahey finds cancelling online bookings a hassle ""If you have booked through Bookatable you feel that you don't really have access to the restaurant to call and cancel - you'd have to look them up or Google them, which is a hassle. ""You also think they're going to fill the spot, although if the restaurant has a massive three-month waiting list I would be more inclined to ring."" She does feel ""a bit bad"" if she has spoken to someone at the restaurant in person then doesn't show up, but doesn't really think about it if she booked online. ""In fact, I don't think I'd ever call up and cancel if I'd booked online - there's no guilt, there's no connection... I wouldn't even consider if it would have an impact [on the business]."" The Crockers Chef's Table charges bookers a non-refundable deposit Now some restaurants are fighting back and asking for non-refundable deposits upfront. The Crockers Chef's Table in Tring, Hertfordshire began charging Â£10-25 per head a few years ago, which would then be deducted from the final bill. But after a resurgence of no-shows in July, owner Luke Garnsworthy increased this to 50% of the cost of a meal (the restaurant only serves set menus at Â£45 or Â£80 per head). ""Even if someone pays a deposit and doesn't show up you are still left out of pocket,"" he explains. Others are going further and selling prepaid tickets for a meal in the same way as a theatre would for a play. Adopters include Heston Blumenthal's Fat Duck in Bray and The Man Behind The Curtain in Leeds. Heston Blumenthal's The Fat Duck in Berkshire asks guests to pay upfront Mr Kedward says the Beach House Restaurant has virtually stamped out no-shows since April, when it began charging a Â£20 per head penalty for drop-outs or late cancellations. This is taken from the booker's credit card if they don't turn up. However, some restaurant-goers dislike such charges. ""I have been put off places who have asked for a deposit, for example for someone's leaving lunch at work,"" Becky Tanter tells the BBC. ""It's hard to get people to commit to that and you risk losing money if you pay it yourself and someone drops out."" Carina Comeau says: ""It's rude not to call and cancel. However, a non-refundable deposit isn't right either. Unfortunately there are costs of doing business that the company must eat (pun intended)â¦ and losses from a no-show are one of them."" Mr Wawrzyniak says he would never charge fines or deposits as it might deter the regulars on which his restaurant depends. But he says he has reduced cancellations to zero another way: by taking his restaurant off third-party booking sites and raising awareness about no-shows on social media. ""We tell people about our menu, the research that went into it, and the costs and the waste if you don't turn up. ""Now we get guests telling us they've heard about the campaign and that they think no-shows are unacceptable, too.""

"Ben Francis is still only 26 but his business is expected to see turnover hit Â£100m this year The BBC's weekly The Boss series profiles a different business leader from around the world. This week we speak to Ben Francis, founder of UK sportswear brand Gymshark. It is hard to know how a then 19-year-old Ben Francis had the time or the energy to get Gymshark up and running. While many young entrepreneurs have to juggle running their start-up with holding down a nine to five job, back in 2012 Ben was a full-time student by day, and a pizza delivery man by night. ""I'd wake up and go to Aston University [in Birmingham], then finish uni early afternoon, and work at Pizza Hut from 5pm till 10pm,"" he says. ""I could answer emails [about Gymshark] in between deliveries. Then I'd go home and sort out the website, and design new products."" After two exhausting years of this - with annual revenues of his nascent business hitting an impressive Â£250,000 - Ben quit both university and the world of pizzas to focus on his company. Fast-forward to today, and Gymshark expects turnover this year to reach Â£100m. A key to Ben's success has been giving freebies to key ""influencers"", such as bodybuilders like Lex Griffin (right) who have large numbers of social media followers Before Ben set up the business in 2012 it is fair to say that the entrepreneurial fire was already burning in his belly. As a young teenager he set up a website that sold car licence plates. A keen gym-goer, he then built and launched two iPhone fitness tracking apps, one of which earned him around Â£8,000. The idea for Gymshark followed; an online retail business aimed at fitness fanatics that originally sold health supplements. ""I was going to the gym and basically was interested in, and wanted to be involved in, the fitness industry,"" he says. ""I wanted to combine that with making a transactional website."" When Ben found that the profit margins from selling the supplements were too low, he dived into another area - clothing. ""I remember looking around, and I couldn't find any clothing I wanted to wear,"" he says. ""So I said, 'let's make it ourselves.'"" The company produces both male and female ranges of clothes Enlisting the help of his brother, and a group of friends, Ben bought a sewing machine and screen printer, and started to make gym vests and t-shirts in his parents' garage. ""My nan made curtains, so she taught me how to sew,"" he says. ""I remember thinking we had 10 orders to do, and to make 12-15 products it would take most of the day. But it was so much fun learning."" Now 26, Ben admits that after Gymshark first moved into clothing there was no immediate grand plan regarding growing the business. ""It was more a case of 'I really want to wear this,' so I made it,"" he says. And so the company started to make body builder vests that fitted slim teenagers, because most on the market were designed for older men who had already built up their muscle bulk. Ben adds that he would also guess on how much to price items. ""It was literally a case of what would we want to pay for something,"" he says. ""There was no considered approach. We were like, 'we would pay Â£20.'"" Gymshark now makes a wider range of fashion clothing Six years later, Gymshark now has more than 1.2 million customers, and 215 employees at its Solihull headquarters in the West Midlands. So how has the firm been able to grow so quickly? In short, it has been a very savvy user of social media. More specifically Gymshark decided it would send free clothing to key ""influencers"", prominent body-builders and other fitness fanatics - such as Lex Griffin and Nikki Blackketter. The hope was that such stars would talk positively about the products to their followers on YouTube and Instagram. The idea worked better than Gymshark could have dreamed, and sales soon skyrocketed. At the same time it worked hard to ensure its own social media accounts were as interesting and visual as possible. Today it has 2.4 million followers on Instagram and 1.5 million on Facebook. MoreThe Bossfeatures, which every week profile a different business leader from around the world: 'They were not comfortable about hiring a woman' 'People thought we were interns but we were in charge' The dad who feeds his son burgers almost every day More recently the firm has held events around the world, inviting fans of the brand to meet some of its influencers. Hundreds of people typically attend. Another key factor in the continuing success of Gymshark is bringing in a more experienced pair of hands to help Ben run the business. Sportswear industry veteran Steve Hewitt joined as managing director in 2015, before being given the chief executive title in April last year. Ben remains the majority owner, with Mr Hewitt and chief strategic officer Paul Richardson also having substantial stakes. Another shareholder is Ben's friend Lewis Morgan who helped to launch Gymshark, but left the business a few years ago. Hundreds of fans typically attend Gymshark's events where people can meet some of its influencers Emily Sutherland, a features writer at trade magazine Drapers, says Gymshark's use of social media influencers has been key to its success. ""The influencers give shoppers a reason to buy into Gymshark over other brands, because they feel a personal connection,"" she says. Ms Sutherland adds that because Gymshark is an online-only and direct-to-consumer brand, it is ""able to remain nimble, react quickly to market changes, and isn't weighed down by expensive store costs"". As for the future, the plan is to expand Gymshark's overseas sales. Already 40% of its sales come from the US, and it aims to have 25 international country-specific online stores by 2020, up from 11 at present. The company may also open its first bricks-and-mortar store. ""I don't go shopping very often, but I'm thinking of the best way to do a permanent location somewhere,"" says Ben. ""I'm not sure, we'd need a lot of space. I want to do a cool destination.""

"This video can not be played A pilot pays tribute to traffic controller Anthonius Gunawan Agung for saving those on board his plane ""He is our national hero,"" says Batik Airways pilot Ricosetta Mafella. He is describing the Indonesian air traffic controller whose last act before he died was making sure the plane Mr Mafella was piloting safely escaped the earthquake and tsunami which has devastated Palu in Indonesia. Mr Mafella believes Mr Agung may have saved his life and those of his passengers. He has described him as a ""guardian angel"". On Friday afternoon, Anthonius Gunawan Agung, 21, was at the control tower of Palu airport as Mr Mafella's Batik Airways plane was on the runway. ""I was rushing to leave. There was a voice in my head that told me, just get out of here immediately,"" said Mr Mafella, 44. ""I told my crew and the ground crew to speed up."" Mr Mafella says he could very well have died if not for Mr Agung At 18:02, the plane took off. Less than a minute later, the 7.5 magnitude quake struck. As the control tower started to shake, people around Mr Agung fled, but he watched to make sure the plane was airborne. His last words were ""Batik 6321 clear for take off"". Then, apparently finding his way out blocked, he jumped from the crumbling tower. He died while awaiting treatment. These were the waves Mr Mafella saw from his plane Mr Mafella and the 147 passengers and crew on the flight had no idea what had just happened on the ground. But from the cockpit, Mr Mafella saw huge waves at the coastline. ""I saw it was a wave moving in a circle with a huge radius, it was getting bigger and bigger but I didn't know what it was,"" Mr Mafella told the BBC. ""I tried calling the air traffic controller a few times to tell him that I saw something, but there was no answer."" Aerial shots of debris and survival after tsunami How Palu suffered a 'worst case scenario' tsunami Mr Mafella only found out later why his calls went unanswered. ""I'm in a WhatsApp group with other air traffic controllers and one of them told me that they had asked Agung to get away from the tower,"" said Mr Mafella. ""But he said wait, wait, Batik [Air] is still here."" ""When I found out what happened, I was speechless. Workers rescue a person trapped in rubble At least 1,000 people are now known to have died in the quake and tsunami. Officials fear that number is expected to rise. Aid agencies say more than a million people have been affected. Yohannes Sirait, spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, told news outlet ABC Mr Agung's decision had potentially saved hundreds of others. He has been posthumously promoted by two levels ""as a form of appreciation for his outstanding dedication towards the deceased"" said the organisation. ""Agung dedicated himself to his job until the end of his life and did not leave the control tower until the plane took off,"" Didiet KS Radityo, the corporate secretary for Air Navigation Indonesia, told the Jakarta Post.

"This video can not be played Should restaurants be forced to give your tip to your waitress? Waiting staff should receive their tips in full and it should be clearer to customers that gratuities are optional, the business secretary has said. Sajid Javid said a tip had to ""go to the people you intended it to go to"" and announced proposals to stop or limit employer deductions from tips. It follows claims that some restaurant chains were regularly holding back some or all of the tips meant for staff. The Unite union said it was a ""victory"" for staff but should be backed in law. Currently, there is no legal requirement for firms to hand over gratuities to their waiting staff. There are almost 150,000 hotels, pubs and restaurants in Britain, employing about two million people. What happens to waiters' tips? The war over tipping Inquiry into tipping abuse Announcing atwo-month consultation,externalon proposals that the government said would stamp out unfairness, Mr Javid told the BBC: ""Too many people were finding that when they were leaving tips for hardworking people they weren't actually going to those people. ""That's unacceptable. It's got to go to the people you intended it to go to, it's got to be a transparent process, it's also got to be voluntary for good service."" The proposals include: making it clearer for customers that tips are optional preventing or limiting any employer deduction from tips except for those required under tax law and updating the existingvoluntary code of practice,externalfrom the government and putting it on a statutory footing to increase employer compliance Mr Javid said the government would also look at legislation ""if necessary"". Unite had been campaigning for action after complaining that some firms were counting tips as part of a worker's pay. Dave Turnbull, Unite's officer for the hospitality sector, said any change would need backing in law to make it effective. ""Restaurant staff and hotel staff and back-of-house staff should be paid a living wage,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""They're highly skilled people, they've got a lot of customer service skills and it shouldn't be a situation where restaurant owners and large corporate companies take it for granted that customers are going to subsidise low pay."" Sajid Javid said the proposals would ""make tipping fairer"" for millions of service industry workers But Mr Turnbull said the proposals were a ""massive victory for all those waiting staff who have worked tirelessly to expose sharp practices in the hospitality industry"". ""All they want is what any worker wants - to take home what they have earned, no corners cut,"" he said. The British Hospitality Association (BHA), which represents more than 40,000 establishments in the UK, said it would meet with hospitality business leaders across the UK and conduct its own impact assessment. BHA chief executive Ufi Ibrahim told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Empower the customer to know exactly what happens to tips should they choose to leave them. ""Ensure that they know they don't have to leave a service charge, that they could opt to leave a cash tip if they wish to. ""And let them know where that money is going. But what we need to do I think is to ensure that transparency is compulsory."" The business secretary said customers expected tips to go to staff ""in full"" Food critic Jay Rayner told the BBC that the system of service charges and tipping ""has outlived its usefulness"". He believes tippingshould be scrapped,external, with waiters receiving a rise in their basic wage instead. ""It's a bizarre system that we have and it only applies in restaurants, pretty much,"" he said. Last year, restaurant chain Pizza Express announced it wouldstop deducting an 8% administration fee from staff tipsmade by card following pressure from unions and staff. The firm, which uses a ""tronc"" system where tips are collected together and distributed evenly through the staff, said tips made by card would be ""fully distributed"" among employees. Restaurant chain Giraffe scrapped its 10% admin fee on tips last year, joining the Restaurant Group, Carluccio's, Garfunkel's and Jamie Oliver's which do not deduct a fee.

"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: ""If the EU want a deal, they need to get serious"" The minister responsible for Brexit has told the EU to ""get real"" and reach a deal with the UK. Dominic Raab also said EU chiefs had disrespected Theresa May with ""jibes"" at a recent summit. He said the UK would leave without a deal rather than be ""bullied"" into signing a ""one-sided"" arrangement. Meanwhile EU figures hit back after Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt likened it to a Soviet-era prison, comments diplomats called ""insulting"". In a speech to the Conservative conference on Sunday, Mr Hunt compared what he said were the EU's attempts to stop members leaving with the actions of the Soviet Union during the Cold War. BBC Parliament: Live coverage of Conservative conference Tories must offer change, says Hammond Warning over 'stalling' tech tax talks Kuenssberg: Bumpy week expected His words were criticised by a number of European politicians and diplomats while a European Commission spokesman suggested everyone ""could benefit from opening a history book from time to time"". Speaking in Birmingham on Monday, Mr Raab said the government's proposed deal with the EU was not ""perfect"" but he urged Tory Eurosceptics who are campaigning for the plan to be ditched to get behind it. And Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted that there would be an economic bounce if and when a Brexit deal was agreed by the UK and the EU. He reminded people saying that a deal could not be struck that people had had the same scepticism about the electric light bulb ever working. This video can not be played Why the Chequers plan is on the rocks... With less than six months to go before Brexit day, the UK and the EU have not yet reached a deal on how separation will be managed and what their new relationship will look like. Mr Raab said that if the EU insisted on trying to ""lock us in via the back door"" of its customs union and single market, the UK could be left with ""no choice"" but to leave without a deal. The ""whole of the government machine is busy preparing for no deal"" - not because they want it to happen or because it's likely, but ""because it might happen"", he said. He dismissed ""lurid predictions from the prophets of doom"" about no-deal, including planes being grounded and ports blocked. This video can not be played Conservative Party splits - what do members think? Even if the UK did not reach an agreement with the EU, he said: ""I find it hard to believe that they would, for narrow political ends, seek to punish Britain in such a crass and counterproductive way."" Mr Raab criticised the EU over its reaction to Theresa May's proposals at last month's summit in Salzburg. ""Our Prime Minister has been constructive and respectful,"" he said. ""In return we heard jibes from senior leaders, and we saw a starkly one-sided approach to negotiation."" Brexiteers feel it keeps the UK far too close to Brussels and doesn't fulfil the Leave campaign's promise during the 2016 referendum campaign to ""take back control"". EU leaders have rejected the plan because they believe it would undermine the single market by allowing the UK to ""cherry pick"" from EU law. Theresa May says the ball is now in the EU's court and she wants a more detailed response from them on their objections. The government has said it will not agree to anything that divides Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK nor makes the country a member of the European Economic Area like Norway. One of the most vocal critics of the government's Brexit approach has been former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, who branded Theresa May's plan ""deranged"" in a newspaper interview at the weekend. Despite not being in Birmingham, Mr Johnson made an eye-catching appearance as he was photographed running through fields near his Oxfordshire home. Given that Mrs May famously said her naughtiest moment was running through fields of wheat as a child, some pundits are wondering whether this was an attempt to ""troll"" the PM by the former Leave campaign frontman, who resigned in protest at the Chequers plan in July. Jeremy Hunt has seemingly provoked a diplomatic row after accusing the EU of seeking to punish the UK in order to ""keep the club together"". In Sunday's speech, he recalled a visit to Latvia earlier this summer and the role that the UK and others played in helping it transition from Soviet rule to becoming a modern democracy and market economy. ""What happened to the confidence and ideals of the European dream?"", he asked. ""The EU was set up to protect freedom. It was the Soviet Union that stopped people leaving."" Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, tweeted that the remarks were ""outrageous and offensive"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Restaurants will be legally barred from keeping tips from staff under plans to be announced by Theresa May on Monday. The move follows a public outcry in 2015, when it emerged that many High Street chains routinely took up to 10% of tips paid by credit and debit card. Most chains have since stopped this practice, typically charging a much lower fee of 2.5% on tips paid by card. The hospitality trade body said the fact restaurants had acted voluntarily meant new legislation was unnecessary. ""We developed a Code of Practice  - together with Unite - which deals with the fair distribution of tips among all staff, not just waiters,"" said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""As a result, best practice has been promoted across the sector and we see no evidence of tips being withheld across restaurant chains."" Ms Nicholls also said smaller restaurants may need to retain ""a small amount"" from card tips to cover ""the not inconsiderable costs of credit card charges and processing payments"". Are online bookings killing restaurants? Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? Mrs May said the ""tough"" legislation, which would apply in England, Scotland and Wales, was part of the government's push to end exploitative employment practices. In 2016, Sajid Javid, then Business Secretary, saidtips should go in full to waiting staffand announced proposals to stop employer deductions from them, but stopped short of legislating. A government spokesperson was unable to say whether the legislation would also cover the common practice of customer tips left for waiting staff being redistributed to include back of house staff such as cooks and kitchen workers. Waiter Charles Archer relies on tip money Charles Archer, a part-time waiter at Pizza Express in Exeter, said he retained all his cash tips. With card tips, he keeps 70% with 30% going to kitchen staff, but there is no admin fee. He said he relied on tip money to pay for food with his basic salary used to pay his rent. ""Over the course of a week it can add up to a decent amount of money,"" he says. He said he did not expect the proposed legislation to change the situation of tips being shared with all restaurant staff unless the law specifically stated that tips had to go to the person that served them. ""Any law creating an increase in benefits [to waiters] will reduce benefits elsewhere,"" he said. ""These companies should be paying their staff more but they don't."" A restaurant owner, who runs four restaurants, but did not want to be named, said he welcomed the legislation because diners expected their tips to go to people who served them, not the restaurant. But he said service tips should be shared with kitchen staff, ""otherwise, someone front-of-house who's just started could be earning more than an experienced trained chef"". He said that some waiters on minimum wage would earn up to Â£15 an hour with tips, a rate he could not match for kitchen staff. Do you leave a tip in cash or pay it by card? It might make a difference to whether it ends up in the pocket of your server or is kept by the business. Cash tips are legally the property of staff. They can go straight to the person serving you or they can be pooled and shared out among staff - but they are not the property of the business. Card tips are different - they currently belong to the owner of the restaurant who has no legal duty to hand any of them over to staff (although in practice many do). The same applies to any service charge automatically added to a bill. How businesses decide to share these tips out varies widely. Some keep all the tips while some skim a percentage off the top. Others take a percentage to distribute to back of house staff. There are about 150,000 hotels, pubs and restaurants in the UK, employing about two million people. Unite regional officer Dave Turnbull said cracking down on tipping abuses was long overdue and the union would seek assurances that the legislation truly delivered fair tips. ""There will be question marks as to whether it will deal with the myriad of scams some restaurants use to pilfer staff tips to boost their profits,"" he said. Labour said the government's proposal copied another of its policies, which the party announced in June. Jeremy Corbyn had said,externalthen that a Labour government would legislate to ensure workers keep 100% of their tips. Are online bookings killing restaurants?

"One of the things I never tire of saying here is that two things can be true at the same time. The latest seemingly contradictory duet? Well, it is true that the next few days in Birmingham matter a lot to the Tory party - and to whether the prime minister's vision of Brexit survives the next few weeks and its passage through Parliament in the Autumn. It is also true that what happens in Birmingham is not where the crucial moving parts really are. Despite all the clamour and genuine unhappiness in parts of the Tory party about the Chequers compromise - the anger that it is a ""betrayal"" of the vote, along with more tepid frustration that if we end up in a half in/half out situation what was the point of it at all? It is, cabinet ministers say privately, ""crazy"", ""unrealistic"", ""pointless"", to suggest that there is a real chance of changing her fundamental position right now. Of course, the precise shape of the Brexit deal is not yet set. Theresa May: 'I do believe in Brexit' Johnson refuses to rule out May challenge At-a-glance: Chequers plan But the view at the top of government is that it is simply too late for any kind of dramatic redrafting. Remember, after all, it took more than two years to get to this point of compromise. Remember too, that the EU is well aware that the PM is not going to shift, if she does indeed compromise further, until after this week. That's one of the reasons why the unexpected rebuff at the Salzburg summit was such a surprise, after an unwritten deal had been done not to rock the boat until after the Tory conference. The real action, the real drama will play out in the next three weeks between our negotiators and the senior actors in the UK government and Brussels and members of the EU. There is a sense here that the big conversation is happening elsewhere. Where of course the next few days do matter, is in setting the general mood and direction of the Tory party in the next few months. That will of course have an impact on MPs who will have to make their decisions about an eventual deal in Parliament through this Autumn. Ministers joke that getting to a deal with Brussels might end up being the easy bit. Without a majority, Number 10 can't be sure they will be able to get a deal through. The government machine expects that they will probably have the numbers - that MPs ultimately with the choice of a deal, or potential chaos, will choose something that looks more stable. But they can't guarantee that entirely. And MPs who might be swithering in the middle do, and will in the coming weeks, listen to the views of their party members. Expectations of the conference this week are low. Ministers are braced for a very bumpy week. But the most critical conversations are yet to be had and may well not take place here at all.

"This video can not be played Conservative donor Michael Spencer: The Tories have ""lost their way"" A major Conservative donor has told the BBC the Tories have ""lost their way"" and the prime minister has ""let herself down"" by failing to champion business. City grandee Michael Spencer said the party had been ""foolish on occasion to adopt some of the language of the socialists"" in order to ""buy"" votes. He told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg the gamble had not paid off. In the interview, Mr Spencer also refused to endorse Theresa May to continue as party leader after Brexit. Mr Spencer, 63, is chief executive of investment organisation NEX Group and spent almost four years as party treasurer under David Cameron, from January 2007 to October 2010. He has been a Tory party member since university and financial supporter for many years, but has not donated since the last general election. Mr Spencer voted for the UK to remain in the EU, but said he was supportive of the ""democratic decision"" to leave. Raab warns of limits to Brexit compromise Tory ministers brace for a bumpy week When asked about Mrs May's chances of hanging on as party leader, Mr Spencer said that would ""depend on her success"" in delivering Brexit. He added: ""Is it conceivable if she does a brilliant job on Brexit? Of course it's conceivable."" Asked if it was likely, he said: ""We better wait and see,"" while making it clear he believed there was no merit in changing the leader before the Brexit negotiations are complete. On Brexit itself, Mr Spencer said it was ""profoundly unlikely"" that there would be no deal with the EU. He added: ""That's not grown up politics on either side."" But the initial deal, he suggested, could be a ""first stage"" with ""further developments down the line"".

"This video can not be played The prime minister rejects Boris Johnson's claims that she doesn't believe in Brexit Never, before the UK's Brexit vote, had European makers and shakers taken such a keen interest in domestic British politics. Now, they're hooked. ""It's partly the mad drama of it all,"" one EU diplomat emphasised to me. ""I mean: who knew the British could be so volatile. What happened to the stiff upper lip?"" But many other decision-makers in Europe have persistently pointed out to me the need to ""keep an eye"" on what UK politicians say about the Brexit process at home, in contrast to what they may agree or seem open to in Brussels. A famous example of this was former Brexit Secretary David Davis announcing to the UK back in December that a freshly agreed joint EU-UK Brexit report, signed off by Theresa May and the president of the European Commission, was actually nothing but a ""statement of intent"". Theresa May: 'I do believe in Brexit' Johnson refuses to rule out May challenge While this weekend, the former Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, claimed that the UK's joint commitment with the EU to an Irish border backstop (basically: a fall-back position to avoid a hard border) was explained to him by the Prime Minister and her advisers as merely a ""form of words necessary to float the negotiations [with the EU] off the rocks"". Were those really Theresa May's thoughts on the backstop - which is a crucial point in the UK's exit agreement with the EU? Or did she choose to ""sell"" the backstop to her then foreign minister in that way in order to get him to sign up to her negotiations with Brussels? Or did Mr Johnson make the whole thing up to grab headlines, put the prime minister under even more pressure at home and throw another big spanner in the works of her negotiations with Brussels? Whatever the reality, European politicians' main takeaway is that the UK government has proved to be a somewhat unreliable partner in Brexit negotiations - also fond of posturing at home (a la ""Brussels can go whistle for its money"") and of catchy but rather empty slogans like ""Brexit means Brexit"", ""red, white and blue Brexit"" and ""Global Britain"". Delegates at the conference in Birmingham European watchers of UK politics expect more of the same at this week's Conservative Party Conference. So why the huge European interest? What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? Davidson calls for Tory Brexit 'silence' European Research Group Tories won't back PM's plan The Brexit factions reshaping UK politics At-a-glance: Chequers plan Well, it's not so much the details of the conference that mesmerise EU Brexit negotiators but rather what is hoped might follow straight after. The accepted wisdom in Brussels is that Theresa May couldn't possibly afford to really negotiate with the EU (meaning give as well as take) in the weeks leading up to the Conservative Party Conference. To have conceded anything more to Brussels, off the back of her Chequers Brexit plan which is much derided within her own party, could have finished her off politically. So, the Brussels logic goes, the UK Prime Minister will put on a big show of strength for domestic consumption during her party conference - tough on EU migration, tough on foreigners purchasing UK houses, tough on Brusselsâ¦ in order to buy herself enough breathing space at home after the conference to finish off negotiations in Brussels. And where are we with that - with so little negotiating time left? Well, despite the uproar in the UK following the recent EU leaders' summit in Salzburg, nothing of Brexit negotiations' substance actually changed there. What was true of negotiations before the summit: that both sides had advanced massively as regards the UK's exit treaty but that the Irish border remained the key sticking point that the EU welcomed some points in the Prime Minister's Chequers Brexit proposal, such as her suggestions on future EU-UK security relations, but rejected others, on Ireland and on future EU-UK economic relations remained the case afterwards too. The EU insists it will never back away from its commitment to member country Ireland and to the communities both sides of the Irish border to get a legally binding commitment from the UK that no hard border will appear between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Irish border is focusing minds This is in order to safeguard the Northern Ireland peace process. Many European voices tell me they believe that UK negotiators see the Irish border issue as an economic one that can be solved with give and take on both sides, rather than a social, historical issue with the potential for a resumption of violence. In fact, many in the UK now see the Irish border issue as a constitutional one. The idea that Northern Ireland would follow EU customs rules and regulatory standards, separate from the rest of the UK, after Brexit is seen by some - including the prime minister - as unacceptable. So can this circle be squared after the Conservative Party Conference? My EU sources are quietly confident. They point to the potential, written into the Belfast agreement, for more devolution from the rest of the UK. But there is a distinct possibility that the tone could instead harden further on both sides. Meaning no deal. Or, just maybe, in the complex world of Brexit, a flare-up or three between the EU and UK between now and the end of the year could actually increase the chance of a successful outcome. Why? Because both sides - and Theresa May in particular - need to show how tough the negotiations fight was. In which case I'd suggest the autumn Brexit timetable could slip. EU leaders will decide in a couple of weeks whether enough progress (and I'm told this means progress in atmosphere and intention rather than a resolution of all outstanding negotiation issues) has been made in order to call a special Brexit summit in November. This could slip to the EU leaders' summit in December calling a Brexit meeting in January (still in time for the UK parliamentary vote on a Brexit deal). Or, this November, EU leaders and Theresa May will thrash out all the outstanding issues on the withdrawal agreement (notably the Irish border) and on the political declaration outlining the EU-UK post Brexit relationship. It is do-able. Just. And it would be what the prime minister always wanted - the European Commission out of the way - just her with her European peers pushing through to a deal both sides are aiming for. But to increase the chances of getting one, communication between the EU and UK has to be improved. That's something both have learned from the crass misunderstandings on both sides at the Salzburg summit. ""Conversations are fluid now,"" a high-level contact told me. ""It has to be if we are to reach a deal. We do not need to be face to face with Theresa May or Dominic Raab to communicate. We all know the next EU leaders' summit will have to be carefully co-ordinated between the British and European sides. Unlike Salzburg."" Watch this space.

"Restaurants will be legally barred from keeping tips from staff under plans to be announced by Theresa May on Monday. The move follows a public outcry in 2015, when it emerged that many High Street chains routinely took up to 10% of tips paid by credit and debit card. Most chains have since stopped this practice, typically charging a much lower fee of 2.5% on tips paid by card. The hospitality trade body said the fact restaurants had acted voluntarily meant new legislation was unnecessary. ""We developed a Code of Practice  - together with Unite - which deals with the fair distribution of tips among all staff, not just waiters,"" said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""As a result, best practice has been promoted across the sector and we see no evidence of tips being withheld across restaurant chains."" Ms Nicholls also said smaller restaurants may need to retain ""a small amount"" from card tips to cover ""the not inconsiderable costs of credit card charges and processing payments"". Are online bookings killing restaurants? Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? Mrs May said the ""tough"" legislation, which would apply in England, Scotland and Wales, was part of the government's push to end exploitative employment practices. In 2016, Sajid Javid, then Business Secretary, saidtips should go in full to waiting staffand announced proposals to stop employer deductions from them, but stopped short of legislating. A government spokesperson was unable to say whether the legislation would also cover the common practice of customer tips left for waiting staff being redistributed to include back of house staff such as cooks and kitchen workers. Waiter Charles Archer relies on tip money Charles Archer, a part-time waiter at Pizza Express in Exeter, said he retained all his cash tips. With card tips, he keeps 70% with 30% going to kitchen staff, but there is no admin fee. He said he relied on tip money to pay for food with his basic salary used to pay his rent. ""Over the course of a week it can add up to a decent amount of money,"" he says. He said he did not expect the proposed legislation to change the situation of tips being shared with all restaurant staff unless the law specifically stated that tips had to go to the person that served them. ""Any law creating an increase in benefits [to waiters] will reduce benefits elsewhere,"" he said. ""These companies should be paying their staff more but they don't."" A restaurant owner, who runs four restaurants, but did not want to be named, said he welcomed the legislation because diners expected their tips to go to people who served them, not the restaurant. But he said service tips should be shared with kitchen staff, ""otherwise, someone front-of-house who's just started could be earning more than an experienced trained chef"". He said that some waiters on minimum wage would earn up to Â£15 an hour with tips, a rate he could not match for kitchen staff. Do you leave a tip in cash or pay it by card? It might make a difference to whether it ends up in the pocket of your server or is kept by the business. Cash tips are legally the property of staff. They can go straight to the person serving you or they can be pooled and shared out among staff - but they are not the property of the business. Card tips are different - they currently belong to the owner of the restaurant who has no legal duty to hand any of them over to staff (although in practice many do). The same applies to any service charge automatically added to a bill. How businesses decide to share these tips out varies widely. Some keep all the tips while some skim a percentage off the top. Others take a percentage to distribute to back of house staff. There are about 150,000 hotels, pubs and restaurants in the UK, employing about two million people. Unite regional officer Dave Turnbull said cracking down on tipping abuses was long overdue and the union would seek assurances that the legislation truly delivered fair tips. ""There will be question marks as to whether it will deal with the myriad of scams some restaurants use to pilfer staff tips to boost their profits,"" he said. Labour said the government's proposal copied another of its policies, which the party announced in June. Jeremy Corbyn had said,externalthen that a Labour government would legislate to ensure workers keep 100% of their tips. Are online bookings killing restaurants?

"Those calling to boycott the vote have been celebrating Macedonia's vote on changing its name to North Macedonia looks to have fallen far short of the turnout required. Preliminary results show that just over a third of Macedonians voted in the referendum, with 50% needed. But with 90% of those who took part in favour of the change, the country's prime minister has urged parliament to ""confirm the will of the majority"". The vote aimed to end a long-running dispute with Greece, which has its own region called Macedonia. Athens had agreed to end its objections to Macedonia's EU and Nato membership bids if the change was passed. New name, same country? A choice for Macedonians The makeover that divided a nation Over 85% of votes have been counted so far, but a campaign by some nationalists - including the country's president - to boycott Sunday's referendum seems to have had an impact, with just 36% of eligible voters taking part. Prime Minister Zoran Zaev threatened to call early elections if parliament did not support the proposal, made non-binding by the poor turnout. These young voters backed a Yes vote, holding up placards for a ""European Macedonia"" ""If, as we all expect, we truly have a big visible, tangible majority for [voting in favour], out of those who voted, then the future is clear,"" he said after polls closed on Sunday. ""The vote of the MPs in parliament must resolutely be a vote for a responsible acceleration of the processes towards Nato and the European Union."" Macedonia declared independence during the break-up of Yugoslavia in 1991. But Greece objected to its new neighbour's name. The dispute harks back to ancient history, because both present-day Macedonia and northern Greece were part of a Roman province called Macedonia. And both claim the heritage of Alexander the Great two centuries earlier. Full story: What's in a name? The man who focused on one word for 23 years Greece's objections forced the UN to refer to the new country as ""the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"". Athens also vetoed Macedonia's attempt to join Nato in 2008 - and blocked its EU membership ambitions. The addition of one word to Macedonia's constitutional name: North. Since 1991, many suggestions have been proposed, then rejected. But last year's change of government in Macedonia finally brought the start of serious negotiations. Prime Minister Zoran Zaev is pushing a Yes vote for a future in the EU and Nato ""Our citizens were sick of that problem,"" says Macedonia's information minister, Damjan Manchevski. ""It had been weighing on Macedonia for such a long period of time and not letting us advance."" Greece will end its veto on Macedonia's accession to Nato and the EU. ""We don't change our name because we want to do it,"" Mr Zaev told the BBC. ""We do it because of our future in the EU and Nato. Everyone is aware why we do it."" That applies particularly to Macedonia's younger citizens. ""Young people in Macedonia are a quarter of the population - and they're one of the largest marginalised groups,"" says Dona Kosturanova of the Youth Educational Forum. ""They're struggling with poor education, high unemployment and few opportunities for prosperity. They're desperate to see advancement towards a prosperous environment."" Opponents say the country has been bullied by Greece and the EU, pointing to the fact that top European politicians urged the voters to back the change. The leader of the main opposition party, Hristijan Mickoski, was quoted as saying that the proposed deal ""will humiliate Macedonia"". President Gjorge Ivanov was among those who said they would be boycotting the vote. He described the proposed deal as ""historical suicide"". Meanwhile, Russia has been accused of fomenting opposition to the name change to stop Macedonia drifting into the West's orbit. Moscow denies the claim.

And she urged the Tory party - in Birmingham for their annual conference - to ""come together"" and back it. Boris Johnson has called her so-called Chequers plan ""deranged"".

Mrs May, who campaigned for Remain in the 2016 EU referendum, hit back at Mr Johnson in her Andrew Marr interview. She said: ""I do believe in Brexit. Crucially, I believe in delivering Brexit in a way that respects the vote and delivers on the vote of the British people while also protecting our union, protecting jobs and ensuring we make a success of Brexit for the future. ""That's why I want us to get a really good free trade deal with the European Union, which is what lies at the heart of the Chequers plan.""

Anti-Brexit campaigners stage a protest outside the Conservative conference The Labour Party has said it will back Mrs May in Parliament if she agrees to their plan for a customs union with the EU and a Brexit deal that guarantees workers' rights and protects jobs.

Later on Sunday, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt hit back at the EU's negotiation stance in his speech to the party conference. He said the EU seemed to want to ""punish"" the UK for leaving, and added: ""If you turn the EU club into a prison, the desire to get out of it won't diminish, it will grow and we won't be the only prisoner that will want to escape."" Mr Hunt also addressed EU leaders directly, saying: ""If you reject the hand of friendship offered by our prime minister, you turn your back on the partnership that has given Europe more security, more freedom, more prosperity, more opportunities than ever before in history."" In the main conference hall, pro-Brexit former CBI chief Sir Digby Jones gave a watching Mrs May a boost with a speech hailing her for standing up to the EU ""bully boys"" and attacking Mr Johnson as an ""irrelevance"". By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent, in Birmingham Just like the Labour conference last week, the Conservatives are keen to show us they have plenty of songs on their playlist. But just like the Labour conference last week, one record is louder than all the others and seems jammed on repeat: Brexit. Autumn guarantees two things: leaves falling off trees and Conservative conferences in which there is a series of deftly choreographed Johnsonian interventions, before and during the main event. Forty-eight hours on from his 4,000 or so words for the Daily Telegraph, one word from Mr Johnson is sufficient to grab a headline or two today: ""deranged"". The big question of the next few days, beyond the Brexit noise: does the PM offer any indication, however vague, of the possibility of her shifting on her much criticised Brexit plan? But former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who like Mr Johnson quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit proposals, told Sky News the Chequers plan ""will die"" because ""it's just wrong"". He said he expected a free trade deal to be struck along the lines of a Canada-style agreement, adding that ""we are going to have a very scary few months"" as talks with the EU entered their final stages, but that was ""normal"". On the Andrew Marr Show, Mrs May also defended the ""hostile environment"" immigration policies she introduced as home secretary,  which led to people from the so-called Windrush generation losing their jobs, welfare benefits and right to remain in the UK. She apologised for the fact that many long-standing UK residents of Caribbean origin had been caught by her Immigration Act, but declined to apologise for the policy itself. This video can not be played Theresa May on hostile environment policy: ""I apologise for the fact that some people who should not have been caught up in that... were caught up"" Mrs May wants to use the Conservative conference to focus on domestic issues as well as Brexit, after Labour unveiled a string of new policies at its conference last week.

"Relations between Donald Trump and Justin Trudeau, pictured earlier this year, have occasionally been fraught The US and Canada have reached a new trade deal, along with Mexico, to replace the current North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) gives the US greater access to Canada's dairy market and allows extra imports of Canadian cars. Thedeal has 34 chapters,externaland governs more than $1tn (Â£767bn) in trade. US President Donald Trump, who has long sought to change Nafta, said the new deal was ""wonderful"". Until recently it looked as ifCanada could be excluded from a final trade agreementto replace Nafta which has been in place since 1994. The new USMCA is intended to last 16 years and be reviewed every six years. Following the agreement, Mr Trump tweeted that USMCA was a ""great deal"" for all three countries and solves the ""deficiencies and mistakes"" in Nafta. Allow Twitter content?

The US has been fighting trade wars on several fronts this year, includingplacing tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from Mexico and Canada, as part of President Trump's America First policy. Tariffs on cars are also threatened. What is a trade war and why should I worry? Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Is Trump right about trade? The hundreds of pages of the agreement were released in the early hours of Monday and contain updated arrangements for Canada's dairy industry and measures aimed at shifting lower-paid car jobs from Mexico. On dairy, US farmers will have access to 3.5% of Canada's $16bn-a-year dairy market. On cars, Canada and Mexico have a quota of 2.6 million cars they can export to the US as a protection for their car industry if the US imposes a 25% global tariff on car imports In addition, 40% of car parts of vehicles produced in the USMCA area must be made in areas of North America, paying wages of $16 an hour On the lumber (or wood) industry, Canada secured protection from US anti-dumping tariffs through the preservation of a dispute-settlement mechanism. This video can not be played If Nafta trade deal was a hamburger... The US made a deal with Mexico in August, but relations with Canada over the trade pact had become increasingly strained in recent weeks. The Trump administration set Sunday as a deadline for Canada to strike a deal. A protectionist policy under the Mr Trump has seen the US forge ahead with individual trade deals, rejecting bigger multi-lateral trade agreements and posing a challenge to decades of global free trade. As part of this policy Mr Trump has also launched a trade war against China, whichhas already hurt companiesand couldcurb global economic growth. US-China trade row: What has happened so far? Andrew Walker, BBC Economics Correspondent Is this a win for President Trump? He certainly has got Canada and Mexico to agree some important things he wanted. It will be harder, or at least more expensive, for car makers to use parts from outside North America, notably from China. American dairy farmers are getting better access to the highly protected Canadian market. There may well be some political benefit for him in the forthcoming Congressional elections. But he has another wider objective - to reduce the imbalance in US international trade, with individual trade partners and globally. The US imports more than it exports and President Trump wants to change that. Judging whether he has won in that sense will need more time. However, many economists don't think trade balances are primarily the outcome of trade policy - instead they reflect government borrowing, private investment and savings decisions and international capital movements. The Canadian dollar jumped to a five-month high and the Mexican peso rose to its highest level for seven weeks on news of the deal. Meredith Crowley, international trade economist at the University of Cambridge, said the agreement on dairy looked to be a ""cosmetic concession"" so in one way Canada had done well out of the pact. She said the insertion of a minimum wage level for car parts workers could lead to similar clauses in other trade deals. ""If it turns out to be very politically popular in the US it could [be used again],"" she said, Canadian dairy farmers were critical.  ""We fail to see how this deal can be good for the 220,000 Canadian families that depend on dairy for their livelihood,"" said Pierre Lampron, president of Dairy Farmers of Canada. However, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said: ""It's a good day for Canada"". Mexico's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said it was a good deal for his country and North America. The aim is for the agreement to be signed before Mexico's President Enrique Pena Nieto leaves office on 1 December. What is a trade war and why should I worry?

"The Chancellor of the Exchequer will do something relatively rare on Monday: take to a public platform to argue about the economy and business. As I have written in the past, Philip Hammond's approach has been simple as the Brexit arguments swirl with ever greater degrees of ill-temper: make like a submarine. Quietly, often with the support of the Business Secretary, Greg Clark, the Chancellor has been pushing the government towards the closest relationship possible with the European Union. Businesses that have the most entwined export relationships with the EU say anything else would be economically calamitous. Mr Hammond agrees. But he has rejected chances of regular interviews or public platforms to make his case. Why? To understand that you have to go back to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last January. In front of an audience of British business leaders, the Chancellor spoke of wanting ""very modest"" changes for business once the UK had left the EU. He thought the comments relatively obvious and anodyne. They blew up into a row that kept the newspapers in headlines for two days aspro-Brexit Conservatives attacked himfor arguing for the softest of soft Brexits - and Mr Hammond decided that the mute button would henceforth be his political weapon of choice. On Monday the Chancellor speaks at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham. Given that each appearance is punctuated by long periods under the waves, those close to Mr Hammond know that each ""surfacing"" is closely watched. His speeches are not just economic; they are political. And the politics of his speech are all to do with the former foreign secretary and his reported use of an expletive, when asked about business objections to Brexit. CBI chief Carolyn Fairbairn has rejected claims made about the lobby group by former Brexit minister Steve Baker Boris Johnson appears to have been particularly riled by the CBI, the business lobbying group. His sentiments were backed on Sunday by Steve Baker, the former Brexit minister, who said the CBI was ""a grave menace to the political stability and economic prospects of the UK"". Mr Baker said the CBI had undue political influence, particularly over relationships with the EU, which brought this tart response from its director-general. ""CBI represents 190k businesses and has had record numbers joining since ref [referendum],""Carolyn Fairbairn tweeted,external. ""We speak for a wider range of firms than anyone else. Shooting messengers gets country nowhere."" Mr Hammond wants to make it clear he has far more sympathy with Ms Fairbairn than he does with Mr Baker or Mr Johnson. He will say business must be at the heart of Conservative party policy. Without their support, Brexit will be all the more difficult, he believes. The Chancellor knows he has a difficult hand, with an economy that many of the statistics show has suffered since the referendum. A multi-billion pound promise of more money for the NHS which has brought forth requests for more funding from other government departments that run the police and the armed forces. They are requests Mr Hammond would like to resist while the nation's debts still stand at Â£1.8trn, or more than 80% of our national income. And Brexit, which the Treasury feels has very little economic upside. He will have to nod to all these issues in his speech. But it is clear that he wants one message to be heard. If it is not relentlessly pro-businesses, the Conservative party will only add to its problems. The last thing it needs is a war with companies that deploy billions of pounds of investment in Britain and around the world.

"Restaurants will be legally barred from keeping tips from staff under plans to be announced by Theresa May on Monday. The move follows a public outcry in 2015, when it emerged that many High Street chains routinely took up to 10% of tips paid by credit and debit card. Most chains have since stopped this practice, typically charging a much lower fee of 2.5% on tips paid by card. The hospitality trade body said the fact restaurants had acted voluntarily meant new legislation was unnecessary. ""We developed a Code of Practice  - together with Unite - which deals with the fair distribution of tips among all staff, not just waiters,"" said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""As a result, best practice has been promoted across the sector and we see no evidence of tips being withheld across restaurant chains."" Ms Nicholls also said smaller restaurants may need to retain ""a small amount"" from card tips to cover ""the not inconsiderable costs of credit card charges and processing payments"". Are online bookings killing restaurants? Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? Mrs May said the ""tough"" legislation, which would apply in England, Scotland and Wales, was part of the government's push to end exploitative employment practices. In 2016, Sajid Javid, then Business Secretary, saidtips should go in full to waiting staffand announced proposals to stop employer deductions from them, but stopped short of legislating. A government spokesperson was unable to say whether the legislation would also cover the common practice of customer tips left for waiting staff being redistributed to include back of house staff such as cooks and kitchen workers. Waiter Charles Archer relies on tip money Charles Archer, a part-time waiter at Pizza Express in Exeter, said he retained all his cash tips. With card tips, he keeps 70% with 30% going to kitchen staff, but there is no admin fee. He said he relied on tip money to pay for food with his basic salary used to pay his rent. ""Over the course of a week it can add up to a decent amount of money,"" he says. He said he did not expect the proposed legislation to change the situation of tips being shared with all restaurant staff unless the law specifically stated that tips had to go to the person that served them. ""Any law creating an increase in benefits [to waiters] will reduce benefits elsewhere,"" he said. ""These companies should be paying their staff more but they don't."" A restaurant owner, who runs four restaurants, but did not want to be named, said he welcomed the legislation because diners expected their tips to go to people who served them, not the restaurant. But he said service tips should be shared with kitchen staff, ""otherwise, someone front-of-house who's just started could be earning more than an experienced trained chef"". He said that some waiters on minimum wage would earn up to Â£15 an hour with tips, a rate he could not match for kitchen staff. Do you leave a tip in cash or pay it by card? It might make a difference to whether it ends up in the pocket of your server or is kept by the business. Cash tips are legally the property of staff. They can go straight to the person serving you or they can be pooled and shared out among staff - but they are not the property of the business. Card tips are different - they currently belong to the owner of the restaurant who has no legal duty to hand any of them over to staff (although in practice many do). The same applies to any service charge automatically added to a bill. How businesses decide to share these tips out varies widely. Some keep all the tips while some skim a percentage off the top. Others take a percentage to distribute to back of house staff. There are about 150,000 hotels, pubs and restaurants in the UK, employing about two million people. Unite regional officer Dave Turnbull said cracking down on tipping abuses was long overdue and the union would seek assurances that the legislation truly delivered fair tips. ""There will be question marks as to whether it will deal with the myriad of scams some restaurants use to pilfer staff tips to boost their profits,"" he said. Labour said the government's proposal copied another of its policies, which the party announced in June. Jeremy Corbyn had said,externalthen that a Labour government would legislate to ensure workers keep 100% of their tips. Are online bookings killing restaurants?

" Three years ago, thousands of babies were born with braindamage in Brazil, after their mothers contracted the Zikavirus during pregnancy. Their most prominent symptom was microcephaly -abnormally small heads. While the Zika crisis was at its height, I learned that myown baby girl, Katy, had microcephaly too. Over the next few years, as she grew into a toddler, I often thought about Brazil’s Zika babies. I wondered how they were developing and how their families were coping. This spring, I went to Brazil to find out. Two little boys are sitting cross-legged on mats in a brightly lit room filled with noise in Recife, north-eastern Brazil. Supporting each child is a grown-up in a blue coat. A third strums out a samba song on guitar. With help, one of the boys, Guilherme, is able to beat a drum in time with the music. But his little friend Daniel is unable to lift himself out of the arms of his attending therapist. Daniel smiles as he listens to the song, then nods off. Both boys are growing up with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS), a set of physical impairments caused when their mothers were infected with the Zika virus while they were pregnant.  In Brazil, more than 3,000 children were born with CZS, following the outbreak in 2015 and 2016. The most well-known symptom is microcephaly – abnormally small heads. Three years ago the world’s news outlets were filled with pictures of screaming newborns, their heads so small that their scalps folded into a mass of wrinkles. Guilherme didn’t look like that, exactly. But since he was born at the height of the Zika outbreak, his mother Germana Soares insisted doctors run some tests on her boy. “The tests took a while to come back and when they did the doctor gave me the news in the worst manner possible, that is, with a bunch of predictions,” recalls Germana.  “He’s never going to walk, he’s not going to survive more than a year, things like that.” Guilherme cannot walk – yet – but he has exceeded many expectations. I watch as he is strapped into a web of bungee ropes and begins to bounce joyously  up and down, a treatment known as spider therapy. He also has a few words – “No!” definitely seems to be one of them – and when he gets the chance he grabs my microphone with surprising dexterity and strength. “He has a really strong personality, he is very strong-willed,” says Germana. “He knows what he wants and when it’s a no, it’s a no.” Maybe these character traits come from his mum. After the initial shock of Guilherme’s prognosis, Germana did more research about the challenges that lay ahead. She learned that her son would be much slower to develop than his peers. “But I had been trying to have a baby for six years and I just wanted to have my boy,” she says. “So, I brought him home and dived into the world of having a disabled child.” She soon started a WhatsApp group with other mothers she met at Guilherme’s numerous medical appointments. This evolved into a support network called the United Mothers of Angels, or UMA. More than 400 women belong to this Zika sisterhood. They refer to one another asguerreiras, or warriors, and Germana is their indomitable leader. After Guilherme’s physio session, I watch as she wheels him on to a bus paid for by the state government to take them home. I ask if all the Zika mums have access to this service. “No, I am one of the only women that have access to this,” she says. “It’s because I am the leader of the association, I am very outspoken and a thorn in the side of the authorities. “They think if they give me this service I’ll shut up, but I think if they can offer it to me they can offer it to everyone – and it’s not going to shut me up.” Back in 2015, when I was coming to terms with my own child’s diagnosis of microcephaly, the Zika mums of Brazil were portrayed as grieving victims of an uncontrollable disease. But three years on, the outbreak is over and it’s these women who are proving uncontrollable. Germana’s son Guilherme came under the care of Dr Vanessa van der Linden, the paediatric neurologist credited with first spotting the trend of microcephaly in Recife. Her first CZS case was in August 2015. The CT brain scans indicated a congenital infection, but the lab results came back negative for the usual suspects: toxoplasmosis, HIV, rubella and CMV, a common virus that can cause disabilities in babies. So Dr Vanessa – Brazilians like to call doctors by their first name – set to work investigating a genetic cause. But then she started seeing other microcephaly cases in her public hospital in Recife. On 14 September, she saw three babies with the condition in one day. Typically she saw babies like that once every two or three months. “Most congenital infections are sporadic,” she says. “So we needed to think of a new agent that can cause an infection, like an epidemic.” Dr Vanessa notified Recife’s health secretary, and asked for financial support to step up her investigations. She also phoned another paediatric neurologist whose opinion she valued: her mother, Ana. “I said, ‘Mummy, I think there is something strange. I think there is a new disease because I saw a lot of patients in two or three weeks with microcephaly and congenital infections.' “Two days after that she called me back. ‘Vanessa, I think it’s true because I had seven patients with microcephaly on the same day.’” A few weeks later, her brother Helio – another neurologist in Goiania, over 2,000km away – WhatsApped Vanessa some infant brain scans. He was seeing the same thing. Much to his colleagues’ amazement, Dr Helio immediately notified the city’s health minister, and in time that child was identified as Goiania’s first congenital Zika case. Many of the mothers told Dr Vanessa that they'd had a rash during their pregnancy. It was just like dengue fever, they said, except the test for dengue came back negative. We now know that the Zika virus infects and kills radial glia – the cells that go on to become neurons in the brain. There is only so much a neurologist can tell a parent about their child based on an MRI brain scan. But in those first black-and-white images of the Zika babies, Dr Vanessa saw hints of what was to follow. The frontal lobe was most badly affected, and this has serious implications for motor function. Now all 130 of her Zika-affected patients have problems with movement. The cortex was also badly affected and the neurons leading to the white matter in the brain had calcified. This suggested epilepsy. Sure enough, two-thirds of her patients experienced seizures in their first year - double the frequency of a comparable group of children with cerebral palsy. She now believes that about 90% of her CZS patients have epilepsy. Beyond these similarities, though, the children affected by Zika are a mixed bunch. About 60% of Dr Vanessa’s CZS patients have profound and multiple learning disabilities, but some don’t seem cognitively delayed at all. Some patients engage well with the world, others seem autistic. And while some children have small heads, others don’t have microcephaly, but hearing and vision impairments or spasticity in their limbs. The Zika babies – whose many stories all became the same story, of the crisis, the outbreak – are emerging as a diverse and fascinating group of toddlers. In August 2015, the same month that Dr Vanessa saw her first case of microcephaly related to Zika, my own daughter was sent for a brain scan. She was eight months old and no trouble at all. Whereas her brother had been a difficult, colicky baby, Katy would sit quietly in her bouncy chair, her hands folded demurely together. But while the other babies born around the same time began to interact with the world around them – gurgling and smiling, grasping rattles and sitting upright – Katy’s babyhood seemed to drift on throughout that summer. She didn’t smile or fix on things clearly with her eyes. She didn’t reach out for objects, and, for a long time, she couldn’t support her head. I will never forget how tenderly the hospital paediatrician examined her, his hands gently pressing her tummy, folding her legs onto her. The morning after the brain scan, he called us back into the hospital on the pretext of needing to redo a blood test. “To be honest, the scan was not completely normal,” he said when we got there. He pointed at the image on his computer screen – an apple-shaped black-and-white cross-section of our daughter’s brain – and said the black areas were too large, and the white areas were too small. Katy was diagnosed with ventriculomegaly, meaning there was too much fluid and not enough brain. Later, the neurologist added a diagnosis of microcephaly. The pregnancy and birth had been quite normal, so the doctor surmised that Katy probably had an underlying disease, and warned that our son might have it too. We knew, at least, that it wasn’t congenital Zika syndrome because we hadn’t been travelling in the affected areas. It was to be another two-and-a-half years before we learned that Katy’s condition was caused by a rare genetic disorder and that our son is unaffected. But that first winter was miserable. Katy didn’t laugh or smile. We couldn’t leave the house with her because it was too cold, and our buggy did not support her floppy little body. She couldn’t master the complicated chain of movements required to swallow, and we didn’t have the right chair to feed her properly. She was constipated and angry, and my head was filled with thoughts of her death. In the evening, our screens were filled with images of Brazil’s microcephaly babies. I thought: ""How much harder would it be if our private ordeal was an international news story too?"" In early 2016, Maria Carolina became the third child in the city of Petrolina to be born with microcephaly. “People were curious about her,” recalls her mother, Leticia Conceicao da Silva. “When I gave birth, the room was full. Everyone wanted to see her, to take a look at her. “There were other mothers who didn’t want to share a room with us. They would say that my child was weird, that she looked like an animal.” The nurses drew a curtain around Leticia and her baby. That first day of Maria Carolina’s life set the tone for the next few months, as mother and daughter learned to cope with two contradictory pressures from society: to cover up and to submit to the gawping of strangers. A reporter from the local paper called up. “They wanted to spend the day with me and with her so they could understand what our life was like,” Leticia says. “But I turned them down, because I realised that they just wanted to sell more newspapers by exploiting my daughter.” She loathed the tone of the reports she saw on TV, in which microcephaly was presented as a ghastly abnormality instead of a well-understood medical condition. Crass remarks about the Zika babies abounded – they were strange, they were ugly, they looked like E.T. At the same time Leticia struggled with a crisis of confidence. She had raised four other children, but how would she cope with this unexpected burden? Slowly, with support from a counsellor, she came to the conclusion that she would do it in more or less the same way. As we talk, Leticia feeds Maria Carolina some porridge. She is in good health and eats well. Leticia hopes that one day Maria Carolina will walk and talk like her older brothers and sister. “That is my dream and I think it is hers too,” she says. “Because when she sees her siblings playing around, she gets anxious and excited, she wants to do the same things.” We are talking in a health centre in Petrolina, where seven or eight families have gathered together. On the floor next to me a physiotherapist is working with a little girl called Maria Luiza. He bends her over a Swiss ball while a large white dog licks her back, stimulating her muscles. I am surprised to see such esoteric therapy on offer in Petrolina. The city is 500km from the coast, in an isolated, impoverished region known as thesertao. But I learn that more conventional therapies are also available. Both Maria Luiza and Maria Carolina go to different kinds of therapy two or three times a week – a rate that compares favourably to the special needs families I know in the UK. Not everyone can make it to such services. The Brazilian government says 70% of children with CZS have received some form of specialist treatment - which suggests that almost 1,000 children have been left without. Maria Luiza’s mother, Rafaela Coelho Araujo, feels differently about the news coverage of Zika in 2015 and 2016. Her child was not diagnosed with microcephaly at birth and it was only when Rafaela saw a news bulletin that she understood her child had the same condition. “I used to like watching the news because I would learn from it,” she says. “I understood that it wasn’t happening just to me, there were other children in the same situation as her.” However, like Leticia, Rafaela struggled to cope with the prying eyes of strangers. Then one day, her counsellor suggested that if she found the staring hard to deal with, she cover her child up. Rafaela considered the suggestion. “I thought to myself: 'Why ever would I hide my daughter?' So I started to go out with her in public and people would look at us. I would look back at them with a smile on my face. “They would ask me if she was ill. I would say she just had microcephaly. Sometimes I would pray to God to get more wisdom about how to reply to those people as I didn’t want to sound rude. I would run out of patience - but I would take a deep breath and try to stay polite.” The mothers I am meeting are taking part in an event organised by Germana Soares, president of the United Mothers of Angels. She is midway through a road trip through the sertao with an educational psychologist, a sanitation expert and a social worker. The trip has been funded – after some nagging – by the health secretary of the state of Pernambuco. Zika-affected families are at a turning point. Many have got over the initial shock of diagnosis, and reached a point of emotional and medical stability. Their attention is now turning outwards, to the social aspects of disability: how will their children live in this world? Where will they go to school? How will they be able to fulfil their potential in society? “Being part of UMA gave us two options – either be a victim and don’t do anything, or become a protagonist in the lives of these kids, making sure they have access to their rights,” says Germana. “Our fight is to look for a better quality of life for these kids.” Although Brazil has equal access legislation, it is not enforced in a systematic way. The main way to make things happen is to pester the powers-that-be. Leadership is important. Last November, Germana became the first Zika mum in Recife to secure a day-care placement for her child. Within weeks of posting this breakthrough on Facebook, another six families in the city followed suit. As she travels through the sertao, Germana is hoping to transform the mums she meets into guerreiras. But it’s not so straightforward. Many of the women were very young when they became pregnant and are locked into traditional gender roles. Some of them rarely leave the house without their husbands. And the culture of the sertao is steeped in old-fashioned beliefs in providence. “Many families will say it’s up to God to cure the children and they will sometimes stop their children’s treatment,” says Germana, frustrated. “Everyone has to play their part. God gave men intelligence to create medicine – he shouldn’t have to descend from the heavens to give it to children.” It has been suggested that the Zika virus came to Brazil during the 2013 Confederations Cup. To be specific, some suspect it accompanied players or supporters from Tahiti, who played a match against Uruguay in Recife on 23 June (Tahiti lost 8-0). At that time French Polynesia was in the middle of a Zika outbreak, which spread to Easter Island, the Cook Islands and New Caledonia. An alternative theory, recently put forward by Brazilian researchers, is that it accompanied immigrants from Haiti, or Brazilian soldiers who had been stationed in the country. The virus was first discovered in Uganda in 1947. A common question about Zika – and a cause of public scepticism about the disease  – is why no birth defects had been seen anywhere before the virus landed in Brazil. In fact, a retrospective study, published in 2016, found 19 cases of birth abnormalities in French Polynesia that were probably linked to Zika. Around that time, it seems the virus may also have mutated to become more virulent. But the Zika outbreak in Brazil in 2015 was the first time the virus had a chance to run amok in a densely-populated area. The virus’s favourite host, theAedesaegyptimosquito, does not fly far. Recife has a population of 1.5 million and in poorer areas the dwellings are low-lying and close together. Aedes aegypti mosquito Families affected by Zika overwhelmingly come from low-income backgrounds. Recent research by the statistician Wayner Vieira de Souza shows that the prevalence of microcephaly in the poorest parts of Recife was six times higher than in the wealthier parts. Poor people are simply more exposed to mosquitoes. They live closer to the ground, are unlikely to have air conditioning at home, and travel by bus rather than car. More than a third of Brazilians don’t have access to a constant supply of water, so they keep it in tanks – and theAedesaegyptimosquito likes to breed in clean, still water. In December 2015, the Brazilian government deployed 220,000 soldiers to go door-to-door with health inspectors in Recife and other affected parts of the country, to check whether residents were covering their water tanks. Such efforts may have had an impact on the number of breeding grounds, but a 2017 report by Human Rights Watch was critical of the government’s focus on the domestic arena, rather than on large-scale improvements to the sanitation network. With the responsibility of preventing Zika infection placed squarely on mothers, I wondered whether the Zika mums now felt guilty for their children’s disabilities. Source: Brazilian Ministry of Health - Information based on notification dates by states to the ministry of health for congenital Zika syndrome. “A certain sector of society blames women for everything,” says Germana Soares. “The government was irresponsible because the mosquito should have been controlled.” She says the Brazilian government needs to account for what happened by paying families affected by Zika compensation in the form of a monthly stipend. She and other activists have teamed up with a sympathetic MP, who is pushing for legislation to give the women 5,000 reais ($1,200) a month for life. “This is separate from disability benefits,” says Germana. “This is the government acknowledging there was an epidemic.” Melissa Vitoria Severina was born with a head circumference of 26.5cm. The average for baby girls in Brazil at full term is 34.5cm Now, at two years old, she has a pretty heart-shaped face and glistening brown eyes. She has an obvious visual impairment, but listens attentively to the world around her. When I reach two fingers towards her, she grabs them in her fists. My daughter is exactly a year older, and Melissa Vitoria reminds me powerfully of how she used to be. She is wearing a brace to keep her legs separated following recent hip surgery, but her mother Cassiana carries her awkward bundle with ease. Meanwhile, Melissa Vitoria’s twin brother Edson Miguel jumps around, trying to get his mother’s attention. Unlike his sister, he doesn’t seem to have been affected by Cassiana’s Zika infection at all. “Melissa has a wheelchair but it stays in my mother’s house,” says Cassiana. “Because he always wants to play with it, and ends up breaking bits off it.” Edson Miguel weighs 13kg (28.6lb) his sister weighs just 7.5kg. Cassiana says she can’t afford to pay for the fortified milk powder her daughter needs. She lays Melissa Vitoria on her bed to do some physio exercises. She extends her daughter’s arms and gently taps her wrists to encourage the fists to open. One by one, Cassiana extends the fingers to accompanying whimpers from the little girl. After the twins were born, prematurely, in January 2016, Cassiana didn’t want to hold them. “The doctor said that was a shame,” she recalls.  “I was crying a lot, I wasn’t well. I felt such deep anguish. I was overcome by negative thoughts, of doing bad things to the children.” She remained in hospital for three weeks. On one occasion when Melissa wouldn’t stop crying, Cassiana began to squeeze the baby girl. Someone saw what she was doing and the next day a psychologist came to talk to her and her mother. “Since then my mum has really helped me to look after Melissa,” says Cassiana, speaking quietly, with a nervous smile. “For two months after I left the hospital, I still wanted to give the babies away - but my mum refused.” Things improved after Cassiana was given anti-depressants. She no longer takes the medication, but happiness remains elusive - she feels numb. “It is bad to live without emotion,” she says. “I look for it, but I can’t find it."" She blames herself for Melissa’s disability, saying that she had wanted to hold off getting pregnant for another year, but her husband pressed her to start a family. She should have listened to her instincts, she says. Her husband is unemployed, but he is often out of the house. Cassiana doesn’t trust him to look after the children anyway. Since she doesn’t work either, the family gets by on the single minimum wage they are entitled to for caring for a disabled person, worth 950 reais a month ($230). Six days later, we meet Cassiana and Melissa again, at an eye appointment at the Altino Ventura Foundation, a charity that has diagnosed 285 cases of congenital Zika syndrome. Of these, the organisation is involved in rehabilitation work with 161 children – the rest are on a waiting list. It’s an agonising funding gap for parents and doctors, since early intervention strategies become less effective as children get older and their brains lose plasticity. “We feel so sorry and frustrated,” says the organisation’s president, Liana Ventura, “We could do so much more for these children if we had more help.” Cassiana arrives, pushing Melissa in the wheelchair so coveted by her brother. She relays the week’s main drama. The previous day – the same day that her daughter underwent a brain scan – Cassiana was in her kitchen when she heard a cry from the red clay path that runs alongside her house. “Mummy, snake! Mummy, snake!” Rushing outside, she saw her son playing with a black snake. “I was completely desperate, not knowing what to do, because I was at home alone in the house,” she says. “So I grabbed a knife and cut the snake in two and the two bits were squiggling around. “He doesn’t stop, he’s very active – he’s very different from my little girl. He has enough energy for both of them.” Melissa is called in to see the doctor, a visiting eye specialist from the US, Dr Linda Lawrence. Nearly all children with congenital Zika syndrome have problems with their vision. The disease impacts both the mechanics of the eye and how images are processed in the brain. The doctor waves a paddle displaying a line drawing of a face in front of Melissa. “We’re looking to see if she can process the contents of a human face, especially the eyes and the mouth,” she explains. “It’s a higher cognitive visual skill.” Despite her crossed eyes Melissa fixes her gaze on the face and smiles. The doctor is impressed. “She’s trying to figure it out, she’s trying to understand – and that’s a really good cognitive skill,” she says. Cassiana’s story is so different from mine in many ways. I never had to worry about making ends meet, or  look after my special-needs child single-handedly. Nor did I have to look after another baby of the same age while fending off media requests for interviews. But although our situations are different, I think our daughters are very similar. Katy was registered severely sight-impaired soon after her brain scan. But cognitive visual impairment improves as children’s brains develop. Slowly, Katy’s obsession with door frames and window jambs evolved into an interest in human faces. She was 18 months old when she learned to recognise her mother and me by sight. But even now, she likes to reach up and feel the face of the person who is talking to her. If it’s someone special, she may then grab that person by their ear or hair, pull them roughly down, and dig her teeth into their scalp: a kiss. Looking back on the period of lamentation I went through after Katy’s brain scan, I'm embarrassed about feeling such self-pity about my little girl. But there is a period of adjustment where you dispense with the expectations that come pre-packaged with babies – that they will walk and talk, or one day have a job and get married. Some parents even have to get used to the idea that their child will live a short life, marked with physical pain. But the great thing about this process is that at the end of it, your child will start to surprise you. We reacted with joy as Katy started to hold her head, to roll, to sit. To learn the difference between pushing and pulling. To pick an object up. To pass it from one hand to another. The month before I came to Brazil, she propped herself up from a lying position for the first time. In Melissa Vitoria, I saw that same curiosity and determination to transform her own situation. I wanted to say to Cassiana: “Be patient – wait and see, your little girl might surprise you.” But I kept quiet. Insofar as parents of disabled children are experts, their field of knowledge is limited to their own child. Cassiana’s children are not the only twins affected differently by the Zika virus. Doctors know of another five such cases in Brazil, which include Vanessa van der Linden’s very first Zika microcephaly patient, from August 2015. Doctors are interested in these twins because they still don’t understand why the Zika virus affects some babies more than others. Not only is the range of disability very wide, but 94% of babies whose mothers contracted Zika during pregnancy were born without any apparent impairments at all (though a further 8% developed problems in their first year). Part of the reason is certainly the gestational age at the point of infection, with women who caught Zika in the first trimester at greater risk of having babies with more severe disabilities. But this is not always the case, and there must be other factors. The viral load at the moment of infection might be one. Another could be the patient’s genetic profile – maybe some people have a built-in defence against the virus. Since Melissa and Edson are non-identical this could explain the differences between them. The Brazilian geneticist Mayana Zatz harvested neural progenitor cells from three sets of non-identical twins where, like Cassiana’s children, only one seemed to be affected by CZS. Then in the lab she infected the cells with the Zika virus. In each case, the virus replicated more quickly in the twin with microcephaly, which seems to confirm there is a genetic element to how babies respond to the virus. The finding is significant, because in time governments may be able to identify populations that are more susceptible to the disease. However, it is unlikely that Cassiana will ever know the full explanation for her daughter’s disability. The difference between her children may simply have been caused by the physical characteristics of their placentas – maybe Melissa’s had a weak spot which allowed the virus to enter. Or maybe, says Dr Ernesto Marques at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Recife, it was just a matter of timing: Cassiana caught Zika, passed it on to her daughter, then built up an immunity to the disease that protected her son. But he adds that the true picture may be even more complex. “I would say although one of the kids doesn’t have microcephaly or perhaps doesn’t even have any hearing or visual problems – I am still concerned about that kid. And I think we should keep following him - I’m sure the mother will."" Recent experiments with Zika indicate that there may be further problems ahead. “We don’t know what other kinds of cognitive development impact Zika could have. Maybe it’s not as severe as the other one – but some impact still could exist.” For scientists, Zika remains an intriguing mystery. But for people directly affected by the virus the science is confusing and highly dubious. The interplay of co-factors means that a mother may experience no symptoms of Zika during pregnancy but give birth to a very disabled child. At the same time she may know other women who had rashes and fever while pregnant, but whose children seem fine. So it shouldn’t be a surprise that many of the families I meet in Brazil do not believe Zika was responsible for their children’s disabilities, but instead put their faith in a variety of conspiracy theories. One of the theories is that the birth defects were caused by an out-of-date batch of rubella vaccines that were distributed across the north-east. Another is that the larvicide sanitation agents put in people’s water tanks to stop theAedes aegyptimosquito breeding was itself poisonous. Even Germana Soares believes this “poison” exacerbated the effects of the Zika virus. “The multiple neural deformities and the way they vary – I believe it’s down to the poisoning,” she tells us. “No-one believes it was just Zika!” Perhaps this disturbing trend is down to the way conspiracy theories spread on social media: during the outbreak, Zika myths were three times more likely to be shared than reliable news stories about the disease. However, I know from personal experience that we special-needs parents often tell ourselves stories to explain our children’s impairments. Especially in the early days, there is an irresistible urge to construct tenuous, far-fetched theories which explain everything. We might point the finger at other people or organisations, or it might be enough to blame ourselves through some imagined parenting misdemeanour. We do this, I think, to give ourselves a sense of control over the situation. When it comes to Zika, there are still so many unanswered questions about the disease that a fairy tale may well be more palatable to families than half the truth. Bruna Bezerra learned that her child would have microcephaly when she was six months pregnant. She had never heard of the condition, so the doctor pointed at the ultrasound image and said: “You see those two little circles? Those are his eyes. And above that is just nothing.” “Hearing that just killed me,” Bruna recalls. She wept for the whole two-hour journey from Recife back to her house in the hills around Caruaru. But when she got home her husband’s reaction surprised her. “Well, what does that change?” he asked her. “He’s still our baby.” Baby Benjamin was born with a skull circumference of 24cm (the average for boys is 35.2cm) and his scalp was as wrinkled as a napkin in a restaurant. But his motor skills developed – by 15 months he was able to hold himself steady while being carried, and he could see and hear well. He became very attached to his father Mario, and would laugh whenever he heard his voice. With their daughter, Mario had been awkward and stand-offish, Bruna says, but with Benjamin he was much more hands-on. The couple had made a living sewing, but after Benjamin was born Bruna decided to study for a nursing qualification, so that she could take better care of the boy. This was an impossible dream. Benjamin had appointments every day, and these were often in Recife. On those days, Bruna and the baby would leave home at 03:00 in the morning to get the government bus to Caruaru, then wait hours for a connecting bus to the state capital. They would get home at 20:00 or 21:00 at night. Bruna swipes through photos of Benjamin on Facebook. Her old phone recently broke and she has lost most of the pictures she had of her son, so she is reliant on the ones saved on social media. Finally she finds what she’s looking for: Benjamin at 15 months. He is propping himself up on a floor mat and beaming at the camera. The day after this photo was taken, Benjamin was taken into hospital in Recife. He had developed hydrocephaly, a build-up of fluid in the brain. He underwent an operation to have a valve implanted to release the pressure. After the procedure, Bruna noticed that Benjamin’s testicles and abdomen were swollen. Doctors told her not to worry, but she knew something was wrong. “He stopped eating, he stopped smiling, he looked like a different child – it wasn’t Benjamin anymore,” Bruna says. Twenty-eight days after the operation, Benjamin required a blood transfusion. He slipped into a coma and was transferred to an intensive care unit at a different hospital. The following day Benjamin opened his eyes, but he couldn’t move. He had rashes on his forehead and bottom that looked like burned skin - a generalised infection, a doctor said. He died eight days later, on 9 April, 2017. As she recalls these events, Bruna quivers with rage. “A nurse actually said to my face: ‘Oh Mum, you know your child’s diagnosis – you know these kids aren’t going to live forever.’ I said: ‘A child could only have a few minutes to live, but you still need to look after him. That’s your duty of care!’ “You get to the hospital and they see your address – they see you are from the countryside and they assume you are illiterate and don’t know anything.” Benjamin’s body arrived in Bruna’s village the day after his death. The family received no financial help with the burial. In fact, Bruna’s welfare payment for Benjamin was due to be paid into her bank that very day, but when she checked later on, it wasn’t there. The payments had already been cut off. Officials in Brazil’s health ministry have pointed to these deaths as part of the reason for a slight rise in infant mortality in 2015. “If it depended on me, I would have lived my whole life in the ICU with him, but would that have been good for him?” asks Bruna. “I think perhaps it’s selfish to want him to stay alive if he wasn’t well. He rested and maybe that was God’s will.” But it was hard for Mario to accept. Bruna says that he shut himself off, and cried for a month. The couple disassembled Benjamin’s cot, but at Mario's insistence everything else in the nursery remains exactly as it was. He is now working as a hospital porter – a job he managed to get with help from a doctor who Bruna met in the ICU. This doctor is also paying for Bruna to finally get her nursing qualification. “I did not manage to help Benjamin, but I would like to help other children,” she says. So she leaves home every day at 17:00 to do the course and gets home at midnight. She is still in touch with the other Zika mums in Caruaru, and every now and then they will call her up to see how she is doing. They invite her to their meet-ups, but she can’t bear to go. It is thought that about half the residents living on low incomes in the affected parts of Brazil caught the Zika virus during the 2015-2016 outbreak. This is probably why it came to an end. Once a certain number of people have immunity to a disease it stops spreading through a population, a phenomenon known as “herd immunity”. Since 2015, cases of Zika have been reported in more than 40 countries, though none has seen an outbreak on the scale witnessed in north-eastern Brazil. But this merciful lull in infection rates has a downside. Some experts have expressed concern that the market is starting to lose interest in a vaccine. The French drug company Sanofi announced last year that because of changes in US government funding for its Zika vaccine the work had been “indefinitely paused”, though it could be restarted if there is another outbreak. At least nine other potential vaccines are undergoing clinical evaluation, however, and some are in phase II trials. But there are many challenges ahead. Crucial details about how the virus operates – in particular, how it interacts with dengue – remain unknown. Because of the obvious ethical problem with testing a drug on pregnant women, the efficacy of any vaccine will be difficult to gauge. Scientists will have to use indirect methods, and will only know for sure whether it works when it is used during an outbreak. And there will be another outbreak. “It’s a matter of when,” says Dr Ernesto Marques, infectious diseases specialist at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation. “I don’t know when – maybe 10 years from now, maybe five years from now. It’s going to happen. First it’s going to happen somewhere else before it happens here again.” As Germana devoted her life to Guilherme and to UMA, cracks began to show in her marriage. In the end, the arrival of the child that she and her husband had longed for over many years precipitated their separation. Germana says that three-quarters of the women in UMA split up with their partners after having their babies. “Instead of becoming the woman’s partner, the men become another burden, saying, ‘Oh, you don’t give me any attention, all the attention is going to him. Where is my wife?’” she says. “And they start to look for other women.” In 2015 and 2016 it was reported that mothers of Zika-affected babies were being “abandoned” by the children’s fathers. That certainly happened, but it would be wrong to think the Zika mums had no say in the matter. I met several women who told me they took the initiative in leaving the family home. “My ex-husband drinks a lot,” explains Francileide Ferreira, who has four other children as well as her disabled two-year-old. “He brings the wrong sort of people home and I couldn’t deal with it any more, especially with a child like this. So I decided to leave the house. Now I have to pay rent, but it’s still worth it.” Marcione Rocha moved to Recife from Betania, a small city six hours’ drive away. “Where I lived there is no treatment for my daughter,” she says. “All the therapies, paediatricians, we don’t have them there.” After making numerous long trips to the city, she decided to relocate permanently with her little girl, Perala, and her three other children, leaving her husband behind. “What I left behind wasn’t too important,” Marcione says. “The most important thing is to be with her, to help her develop, to be with the four of them. It wasn’t bad for me having her – it brought positive changes to my life.” As she speaks, she dabs blusher on to a fellow Zika mum’s face. We are at UMA’s headquarters in Recife, and a party is in full swing to celebrate mother’s day. The building is packed with perhaps 70 women who are getting free makeovers, massages and dental check-ups. A lawyer arrives to advise the women about government benefits. There is also a local MP, a counsellor, and four news crews. Germana Soares is too busy directing all this traffic to spend time with the other mums, but in the afternoon, she finally grabs a moment to have some fun. She throws herself into the middle of a raucous, selfie-taking scrum and leads the others in a chant of “We will never be defeated.” Meanwhile, their children are in the next room, being cared for by volunteers. Mattresses are laid across the tiled floor. A few of the children sit upright and play with brightly-coloured toys, others lie down and gaze at cartoons on smartphones held in front of them, or doze through the humid afternoon. Able-bodied siblings linger nearby or scamper about in search of amusement. I watch the news crews go about their work. I wonder how they will put their packages together, and how I would report this story myself if I didn’t have a child with microcephaly. Sadly, disabled babies are almost always described in negative terms – not just by the press, but by doctors and even by their own parents. That is because impairments are identified by observing what a child can’t do, rather than what they can do. Eventually, though, the people close to a child rise to the occasion. They learn to see him or her as an individual with his or her own special needs and potential. But when people with little experience of disability walk into a room like this one, filled with children with significant needs, they don’t see this specialness – they just see lots of children who can’t sit up, crawl, or even swallow. They only see the can’t. To them, the love of the children’s parents is noble or brave, perhaps even a little delusional. The coverage of Zika in 2015 and 2016 was predicated on this idea of families caught up in a tragedy. Is there a sense of disappointment in learning that your child will probably never walk or talk or fulfil the other expectations you might have had during pregnancy? Yes. Is there a period of adjustment? Definitely. But loving your child is never brave. It’s the easiest thing in the world. Built with Shorthand",Positive,1.0

"This video can not be played Ryder Cup 2018: How Europe secured victory over the United States Europe thrashed the United States 17Â½-10Â½ to regain the Ryder Cup - prompting wild celebrations, tears, and one player dressing as a pillar box at Le Golf National in France. Open champion Francesco Molinari beat Phil Mickelson to get Europe to the 14Â½-point winning mark, simultaneously becoming the first European to win five points in one Ryder Cup. The Italian, who was immediately drenched in beer by celebrating fans, said it ""means more than winning majors"". Spaniard Sergio Garcia secured a victory of his own to surpass Sir Nick Faldo as the Ryder Cup's leading points scorer with 25Â½, then sobbed as he was called a ""legend"" by team-mate Justin Rose. ""I don't usually cry, but I couldn't help it, what a week,"" he said. ""It's been a rough year, but we fought hard. I'm so thankful to Thomas Bjorn for believing in me."" Tommy Fleetwood and Rory McIlroy led 'thunder clap' cheers with an exuberant 70,000-strong crowd, while captain Thomas Bjorn embraced each of his ""amazing"" players. ""Some people say golf is boring - well, this is certainly not boring,"" said Bjorn. ""I've experienced a lot of Ryder Cups but this is the top one."" His opposing captain Jim Furyk said: ""You have to tip your cap, they outplayed us."" This video can not be played Ryder Cup 2018: Captain Thomas Bjorn and the European team lift the Ryder Cup Why WhatsApp was key to Europe's victory Listen: The Cut podcast - Europe win the Ryder Cup Read: How Europe regained Ryder Cup, relive the action Read: All the results and stats Jon Rahm, Ian Poulter, Thorbjorn Olesen, Henrik Stenson and Alex Noren joined Molinari and Garcia in winning singles matches after the Americans, trailing 10-6, had threatened a comeback by winning 3Â½ of the first five points on the final day. Poulter - nicknamed 'The Postman' because he 'always delivers a point' - found a pillar-box fancy-dress outfit to the delight of the partisan crowd, then led the charge on to the 18th green when Noren holed a 35-foot putt to win the final match. That spirit has prevailed throughout the European team all week. They went in to the match as underdogs despite the US not having won in Europe since 1993. The American side boasted 31 major titles, and 11 of their players are in the world's top 17. But Le Golf National is a different course to those the Americans are used to playing on - the tight fairways and deep, penal rough, a world away from the vast majority of PGA Tour courses. Only three of the American dozen had played a competitive round at the home of the French Open before this week, and it showed as the European players, who have played in excess of 200 rounds between them, looked more at ease. This video can not be played Paul Casey, Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson feature in final day best shots The Americans put their best players out at the top of Sunday's singles order and the gamble appeared to be paying off for captain Jim Furyk with three wins and a halved match out of the first five. ""We got some momentum but the Europeans responded well as they have all week,"" said Furyk. ""Europe did a good job on a golf course they know pretty well but they did a great job playing it. They hit key shots and knocked in the clutch putts. But it's been a wonderful week."" Both the opening matches went down to the 18th, with Justin Thomas defeating McIlroy after an epic battle to put the American's first point on the board before Brooks Koepka rolled in a three-footer to share his equally entertaining match with Paul Casey - the only one of the 28 matches to end all square. This video can not be played Ryder Cup 2018: Rory McIlroy mobbed by fans in Ryder Cup victory interview McIlroy was two ahead after four holes but Thomas hit back with birdies on the eighth and 10th. They were still level on the 18th but after Thomas boomed his drive down the middle, McIlroy pushed his tee shot into a bunker. His ball plugged and he was unable to get it out with his first attempt. His third shot careered into the water to effectively end the contest, with Thomas hitting his second to eight feet. The point meant the American, who was joint eighth at the French Open earlier in the summer, finished as his team's top points scorer with four, from five matches. World number two Rose failed to recover from losing the second and third holes to Webb Simpson and was three down after eight. The Englishman birdied the par-three 16th but the American holed his second shot to close out a 3&2 win. Fleetwood, who won four matches in partnership with Molinari on Friday and Saturday, also harboured hopes of becoming the first European to win all five matches at a single Ryder Cup but they were crushed by Tony Finau. None of the first 11 holes were halved but the American won eight of them to the Englishman's three to go five ahead and he eventually won 6&4. Poulter donned a pillar box outfit while celebrating Europe's victory But then the tide turned. Poulter, so often the European to spark a momentum change, holed a birdie putt on the 14th to edge ahead of world number one Dustin Johnson in their see-saw contest and the roar reverberated around the course. Moments later, those around the 14th green were roaring again when Olesen completed an unlikely 5&4 victory over Jordan Spieth to put Europe 11Â½-9Â½ ahead. Olesen had not played since losing in the fourballs on Friday morning and his victory was built on four birdies on the front nine as he went five clear, while Spieth, who has been one of the US team's star players with three points, never recovered from three successive bogeys. Poulter, unbeaten in five previous singles matches, then went two holes up on Johnson after the American dumped his second to the par-four 15th into the water. Up on the 16th, Rahm missed a short putt to allow Tiger Woods to get back within a hole but the Spaniard nailed his approach to the 17th to four feet and holed the putt to add another blue point. Rahm punched the air in delight, striding around the green in raucous celebration, before calming himself enough to console Woods, who had waited patiently to congratulate his conqueror. This video can not be played Passionate Poulter & ruthless Rahm feature in final-day key battles The defeat left Woods, who won his first tournament in five years at the Tour Championship last week, with zero points from his four matches. Bryson DeChambeau and Mickelson also ended with zero points, while all the Europeans contributed. Johnson won the 16th to stay in touch with Poulter but the thousands gathered round the 17th green were expecting to celebrate another European point minutes later. Poulter, for once, failed to deliver, missing a six-footer to win the match. However, he strode to the final tee, smashed his drive down the middle and flicked a mid-iron to six feet, a putt conceded by Johnson, to put Europe 13Â½-9Â½ ahead and just one point from regaining the trophy. Any one of Molinari, Garcia, or Stenson could have secured the winning point - and it was the Italian who did so. The winning moment came when Mickelson, three down with three to play, hit his tee shot on the par-three 16th into the water and conceded the hole and match.

Mr Hunt also addressed EU leaders directly, saying: ""If you reject the hand of friendship offered by our prime minister, you turn your back on the partnership that has given Europe more security, more freedom, more prosperity, more opportunities than ever before in history."" In the main conference hall, pro-Brexit former CBI chief Sir Digby Jones gave a watching Mrs May a boost with a speech hailing her for standing up to the EU ""bully boys"" and attacking Mr Johnson as an ""irrelevance"". By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent, in Birmingham Just like the Labour conference last week, the Conservatives are keen to show us they have plenty of songs on their playlist. But just like the Labour conference last week, one record is louder than all the others and seems jammed on repeat: Brexit. Autumn guarantees two things: leaves falling off trees and Conservative conferences in which there is a series of deftly choreographed Johnsonian interventions, before and during the main event. Forty-eight hours on from his 4,000 or so words for the Daily Telegraph, one word from Mr Johnson is sufficient to grab a headline or two today: ""deranged"". The big question of the next few days, beyond the Brexit noise: does the PM offer any indication, however vague, of the possibility of her shifting on her much criticised Brexit plan? But former Brexit Secretary David Davis, who like Mr Johnson quit the cabinet over Mrs May's Brexit proposals, told Sky News the Chequers plan ""will die"" because ""it's just wrong"". He said he expected a free trade deal to be struck along the lines of a Canada-style agreement, adding that ""we are going to have a very scary few months"" as talks with the EU entered their final stages, but that was ""normal"". On the Andrew Marr Show, Mrs May also defended the ""hostile environment"" immigration policies she introduced as home secretary,  which led to people from the so-called Windrush generation losing their jobs, welfare benefits and right to remain in the UK. She apologised for the fact that many long-standing UK residents of Caribbean origin had been caught by her Immigration Act, but declined to apologise for the policy itself. This video can not be played Theresa May on hostile environment policy: ""I apologise for the fact that some people who should not have been caught up in that... were caught up"" Mrs May wants to use the Conservative conference to focus on domestic issues as well as Brexit, after Labour unveiled a string of new policies at its conference last week. She hasannounced plans to tackle a big increase in rough sleeping, to be funded by a tax on foreign-owned homes.

"Ruth Davidson has called for a ""period of silence"" among her Conservative colleagues to allow the prime minister to get a Brexit deal ""over the line"". The Scottish Tory leader said the two years following the EU referendum had provided enough time for debate. Her comments follow Boris Johnson's description of the Chequers plan as ""deranged and entirely preposterous"". She told the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland it was now time to get behind the prime minister. Theresa May: ""I do believe in Brexit"" What is a ""Canada-style"" trade deal? At a glance: Chequers plan As Tory activists assembled in Birmingham for their party conference, she said: ""There's been time over the last two years for debate. ""The former foreign secretary was in one of the great offices of state during the time that much of this plan was being constructed - and praised it as soon ago as November of last year. ""Now is the time for Conservatives to get behind the prime minister, give her the space to get the deal done and to back her to deliver for the country. ""In terms of a period of silence, I would be very welcoming of one."" Her comments followed another strident intervention in the Brexit debate by the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson. He told the Sunday Times: ""Unlike the prime minister, I fought for this, I believe in it, I think it's the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016."" Theresa May laterinsisted she did believe in Brexit,telling the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that the Chequers plan had the ability to deliver a good free trade deal with the European Union. Ms Davidson also said she would go into the next election with a manifesto commitment to block a second Scottish independence referendum because in 2014 ""the people of Scotland were promised this would be a once in a generation event"". Asked about calls for another referendum on any Brexit deal, she said: ""In terms of our history in Scotland, I've been pretty vocal about the fact that you can't re-run referendums if you are a nationalist because you didn't get the result you want. ""I'd be pretty hypocritical if I said you could re-run this Brexit referendum because it wasn't the result the I argued for.""

"Restaurants will be legally barred from keeping tips from staff under plans to be announced by Theresa May on Monday. The move follows a public outcry in 2015, when it emerged that many High Street chains routinely took up to 10% of tips paid by credit and debit card. Most chains have since stopped this practice, typically charging a much lower fee of 2.5% on tips paid by card. The hospitality trade body said the fact restaurants had acted voluntarily meant new legislation was unnecessary. ""We developed a Code of Practice  - together with Unite - which deals with the fair distribution of tips among all staff, not just waiters,"" said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""As a result, best practice has been promoted across the sector and we see no evidence of tips being withheld across restaurant chains."" Ms Nicholls also said smaller restaurants may need to retain ""a small amount"" from card tips to cover ""the not inconsiderable costs of credit card charges and processing payments"". Are online bookings killing restaurants? Whatâs eating the restaurant trade? Mrs May said the ""tough"" legislation, which would apply in England, Scotland and Wales, was part of the government's push to end exploitative employment practices. In 2016, Sajid Javid, then Business Secretary, saidtips should go in full to waiting staffand announced proposals to stop employer deductions from them, but stopped short of legislating. A government spokesperson was unable to say whether the legislation would also cover the common practice of customer tips left for waiting staff being redistributed to include back of house staff such as cooks and kitchen workers. Waiter Charles Archer relies on tip money Charles Archer, a part-time waiter at Pizza Express in Exeter, said he retained all his cash tips. With card tips, he keeps 70% with 30% going to kitchen staff, but there is no admin fee. He said he relied on tip money to pay for food with his basic salary used to pay his rent. ""Over the course of a week it can add up to a decent amount of money,"" he says. He said he did not expect the proposed legislation to change the situation of tips being shared with all restaurant staff unless the law specifically stated that tips had to go to the person that served them. ""Any law creating an increase in benefits [to waiters] will reduce benefits elsewhere,"" he said. ""These companies should be paying their staff more but they don't."" A restaurant owner, who runs four restaurants, but did not want to be named, said he welcomed the legislation because diners expected their tips to go to people who served them, not the restaurant. But he said service tips should be shared with kitchen staff, ""otherwise, someone front-of-house who's just started could be earning more than an experienced trained chef"". He said that some waiters on minimum wage would earn up to Â£15 an hour with tips, a rate he could not match for kitchen staff. Do you leave a tip in cash or pay it by card? It might make a difference to whether it ends up in the pocket of your server or is kept by the business. Cash tips are legally the property of staff. They can go straight to the person serving you or they can be pooled and shared out among staff - but they are not the property of the business. Card tips are different - they currently belong to the owner of the restaurant who has no legal duty to hand any of them over to staff (although in practice many do). The same applies to any service charge automatically added to a bill. How businesses decide to share these tips out varies widely. Some keep all the tips while some skim a percentage off the top. Others take a percentage to distribute to back of house staff. There are about 150,000 hotels, pubs and restaurants in the UK, employing about two million people. Unite regional officer Dave Turnbull said cracking down on tipping abuses was long overdue and the union would seek assurances that the legislation truly delivered fair tips. ""There will be question marks as to whether it will deal with the myriad of scams some restaurants use to pilfer staff tips to boost their profits,"" he said. Labour said the government's proposal copied another of its policies, which the party announced in June. Jeremy Corbyn had said,externalthen that a Labour government would legislate to ensure workers keep 100% of their tips. Are online bookings killing restaurants?
