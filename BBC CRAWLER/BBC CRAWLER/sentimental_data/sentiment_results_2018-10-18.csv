"This summit was, in some ways, quite predictable. Not a crisis moment like Salzburg. Not a success where Theresa May could walk away with something that felt like a significant achievement. As we know, both sides, in principle, want a deal. So last night and through this afternoon the EU and the UK agreed to keep the show on the road. But as we move towards what the legal deadlines imply are the closing moments of this whole process, some of its moments are becoming pretty strange. EU ready to extend transition period Row over Commons 'meaningful vote' The prime minister had a hint of warmth from some parts of the EU empire for the idea of drawing out the implementation period, to give more time to work out the long term fixes. But even so, the politics put such a straitjacket on proceedings that she can't even quite manage to be completely clear about that. So we heard today about a proposal that's not a proposal but an ""idea that's emerged"". An extension to an extension that's not a request for a longer transition period but a desire perhaps to have the option. It might sound like Kafka. But it's the words of a government struggling to keep a set of almost impossible promises. Please upgrade your browser The sound of a prime minister desperately trying to keep to the contradictory pledges that she has made in order to survive. The circumstances for Theresa May in Brussels have not got worse in the last 24 hours. But they are hardly better. And when she gets home, a nightmare awaits. There's upset about the parliamentary games ministers are proposing. And irritation and disbelief at the proposal of an extension. One former loyal Remainer Brexit minister, Lord Bridges, told me the idea of a longer transition is dead on arrival. Each new compromise brings a confrontation with her party. When Theresa May's promises are broken, ministers know there's a risk that it will break her government, and her leadership too.

"Sign on Fermanagh border The Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has rejected claims of ""scaremongering"" after concerns were voiced about a return to violence in the event of a hard border after Brexit. On Thursday the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) said the fears were ""very real"". Leo Varadkar said he wanted to ensure other leaders knew his government was not ""in any way exaggerating"". Tories must be united as EU, says Hunt EU ready to extend transition period Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop DUP politicians criticised his remarks. However, on Friday Mr Coveney said Mr Varadakar's comments were warranted and the taoiseach was ""dealing in facts"". ""We are trying to protect a very precious peace and normality on the island of Ireland,"" he said. This video can not be played 'Concerns about a return to violence are very real' ""If you speak to families living in the border area they will talk in very emotive terms about their fears of the re-emergence of that border infrastructure and it's important to be honest about that. ""It doesn't suit some people's political narrative. ""It certainly doesn't suit people who advocate for Brexit because this is very awkward and difficult to deal with but it's the truth,"" he added. Mr Coveney said he believed a no deal outcome was still very unlikely. In the event of a no deal scenario, he added that there were no physical contingency plans for border infrastructure as it would not be accepted. ""I'm not going to create the impression that somehow by accident we're going to fall into a situation of being forced to reintroduce border infrastructure"" he said. ""I trust the British prime minister in terms of her commitments - it has been made in writing,"" he added. The taoiseach also claimed Brexit was preventing a return to power sharing in Northern Ireland. Mr Varadkar said he took a copy of The Irish Times to dinner with the leaders to demonstrate his point about a hard border. Wednesday's edition of the paper featureda front page interview with the daughter of a man killed in an IRA bombing,externalat a customs centre. The Irish PM said: ""I just wanted to make sure that there was no sense in the room that in any way anyone in Ireland, or in the Irish government, was exaggerating the risk of a return to violence in Ireland."" Responding to his comments, DUP MP Sammy Wilson hit out at his ""use of a victim of the IRA,"" describing it as ""scraping the bottom of the barrel"". Mr Wilson accused Mr Varadkar of stirring up ""false fears about barriers along the border"". ""His behaviour is despicable, low and rotten,"" he added. DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly tweeted: ""Foolish and dangerous talk - common sense must prevail here. ""The hardening of the border during the Troubles was a result of security issues due to paramilitary violence - not customs, tariffs etc."" In her post-summit press conference Theresa May said the idea of having the option to extend the transition period could be ""a further solution"" to the search for a ""backstop"" to ensure no hard border. Northern Ireland's devolved government at Stormont collapsed in January 2017 following a bitter row over a flawed green energy scheme and attempts to restore it have stalled. Sinn FÃ©in leader May Lou McDonald said there could be no excuse ""for a return to conflict under any circumstances or provocation"". She added: ""We cannot take peace and progress for granted is it something that constantly needs care and nurturing."" Mr Varadkar said: ""We have gone now two years without a functioning executive and assembly in Northern Ireland. ""The two major parties have been unable to come together to form a coalition government which they had been able to do for most of the past 20 years"". ""We can see the uncertainty around Brexit is already having an affect, if we are to have a hard Brexit imagine the effects that could potentially follow"". Please upgrade your browser On Friday, European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said a deal with the United Kingdom was 90% done, although there was still a chance no accord would be reached due to ongoing stumbling blocks over the Irish border. Mr Barnier told France Inter radio: .""Ninety percent of the accord on the table has been agreed with Britain. ""I'm convinced a deal is necessary, I'm still not sure we'll get one.""

"This video can not be played Mr Macron meant ""start"" but actually said ""stop"", aides say France's president mixed up his English when he said in error that UK visitors would need French visas if there was a no-deal Brexit, aides say. Emmanuel Macron had meant to say that British people would not need visas in such circumstances. The confusion came as Mr Macron was speaking to the media in English at the end of an EU summit in Brussels. Instead of ""we will not stop visas"" he meant to say ""we will not start visas"", the ElysÃ©e Palace explained. UK citizens currently enjoy visa-free travel in the EU, but that could change with Brexit. The UK is set to leave the 28-nation bloc on 29 March 2019. The BBC's Gavin Lee raised the visa issue with President Macron at Thursday's news conference, after leaders had failed to achieve a breakthrough on Brexit. By Gavin Lee, BBC News, Brussels The mix-up came after I asked President Macron whether newspaper reports of UK citizens needing visas for work or holidays in the event of a no-deal was true. The president's response was that ""we will not stop visas, it is fake news, as some other leaders would say"", and he went on to say ""we will definitely deliver visas for people"". His team now say it was a case of a ""second language"" slip-up, and that President Macron meant to say ""we will not start visas for British people"". The press team for the ElysÃ©e Palace say the position of the French for their ""no-deal"" contingency planning is one that would categorically not mean visas for British people, UNLESS the UK suddenly imposed them on French workers and tourists in the UK. They say they would aim for a deal which allows for a ""special status"" agreement for workers and tourists for both countries, that avoids the need for any ""official visa system"". In the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Macron said, measures would be taken to cover flights, ferries and businesses as well. A draft law has been tabled in the upper house of the French parliament,externalthat will let the government set new rules for Britons visiting France after Brexit. The draft suggests they will be treated as ""third country"" visitors - a similar category to Americans or Chinese. The preamble of the bill raises the possibility that visas may be imposed. But, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the bill also gives the government the power to adapt or suspend the need for visas and residence permits for UK citizens. A deal remains elusive mainly because of wrangling over the future Northern Ireland border. Brexit risks reinstating physical controls at the border, which were scrapped under the Northern Ireland peace settlement. The current Brexit plan is for a transition period of 21 months from the end of March, to smooth the UK's path to a future relationship outside the EU. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that transition could be extended ""for a few months"", if needed. But some Brexit campaigners have reacted angrily to the suggestion. EU ready to extend transition period Brexit: All you need to know Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop ""I do prefer a deal and I want a deal, but I will never favour a bad deal,"" Mr Macron said on Thursday. ""In case of no deal our responsibility is to ensure that the life of our people will not be so far impacted."" Mr Macron described the ""dynamic"" of the Brexit negotiations as ""positive because there is a willingness on the British side to find a solution"". He said ""now it's for Prime Minister May to propose a solution, but we will not compromise on the key elements of the mandate we gave to [EU negotiator] Michel Barnier"". The French president also denied suggestions that the UK prime minister had been snubbed late on Wednesday, when four EU leaders went out for a drink in the Grand Place in the centre of Brussels. He told the BBC that Theresa May had left the summit earlier, and said she would certainly be invited in future. ""I am always happy and open to share a drink with the different leaders, so obviously Theresa May will be very much welcome,"" he said. Update 19 October 2018: Our story was amended after the ElysÃ©e Palace explained that Mr Macron had meant to say ""we will not start visas"" for British people, but had inadvertently used the verb ""stop"" instead.

"This video can not be played Adam Clayton shows us around (and through) U2's 30-metre long ""barricage"". ""The two things you can't have up here are vertigo and a need for stability."" U2 bassist Adam Clayton is giving me a tour of ""the barricage"", a 29-metre long, double-sided LCD screen that the band climb inside of every night of their Experience and Innocence tour. The walkway spans the entire length of Amsterdam's Ziggo Dome, linking the main stage and a smaller, circular platform at the far end of the arena. ""It's a very expensive way of getting from the big stage to this little one down here,"" laughs Clayton. But it's much more than that. The screens rise and fall throughout the show, transmitting live footage, political slogans and colourful animations. They can also go transparent at the flick of a switch, allowing U2 to appear and disappear behind the wall and even tussle with the images around them. ""The magic act, if there is one, is to shrink the venue and make it disappear,"" says Bono, who barrels around the 89-ton structure every night with a perilous disregard for his own safety. ""When you get an intimacy with a crowd of 20,000, it's a very moving thing."" U2's Zoo TV show was the first pop concert to use large-format video screens U2 have been pushing the boundaries of concert technology since 1992's Zoo TV tour, an all-out blitz on the senses that combined 32 video screens, live satellite feeds and floating Trabants in a carnival of glamour, sleaze and irony. The subsequent PopMart tour famously incorporated a giant revolving lemon, while 2009's 360Â° tour featured a $30m (Â£23m) custom-built steel ""claw"". But the aim has always been the same. ""When we were playing club gigs up and down the M1, it was always 'What's the fastest route to proximity with our audience?'"" explains Bono. ""Now we use a lot of technology to serve that end. But it's the same thought: 'Is there a place in this show where people have a bad seat? Well, we're going to camp right there.'"" All of U2's stages are designed by the band's creative director Willie Williams in conjunction with London firm Stufish Entertainment Architects, whose other clients include Madonna, Lady Gaga, Take That and Beyonce. There's ""definitely an arms race of one-upmanship"" between bands, says the studio's CEO Ray Winkler. ""Bands are very conscious that there's competition out there - so they aspire to deliver something bigger, brighter and better."" That's why you'll see Coldplay handing out wristbands that light up in time to the music, or Beyonce and Jay-Z floating over fans' heads on a hydraulic platform. Beyonce and Jay-Z's stage takes more than 50 trucks to transport between venues Winkler always asks his clients the same questions: ""What is the story that you want to tell? What is the emotive arc of the show? And then, what are the means we can use to deliver that? ""Just because you have the technology, it doesn't mean you need to use it,"" he adds. ""You have to use it intelligently."" U2 worked closely on their stage concept withEs Devlin, the British designer whose long list of credits includes Kanye West, Adele, and the opening ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympics. Together, they found a way of using the video screens that can be both impressive and disorientating. In opening number The Blackout, silhouettes of the band flicker in and out of static, like ghosts trying to break into the realm of the living. Then the musicians are revealed, inside the cage and thrashing about in strobe-lit angst. But the show is just as powerful when the screens ascend to the ceiling and leave the band to perform Pride (In the Name of Love) on individual podiums situated at the four corners of the arena. Do they ever miss the intimacy of playing club gigs? ""They were great when we were learning our jobs but it's very hard to go back there,"" says Clayton. ""By the time you get into your 30s, you want to be in theatres and arenas. You don't want to be going back."" Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

But cutting-edge technology comes at a cost. Across the music industry, average ticket prices are at a record high of $96 (Â£73) - up 14% from last year. U2's tickets sit on both sides of that figure, reaching the eye-wateringly high price of Â£400 but bottoming out at just Â£40. ""We like to think our audience are not paying the price - it's us,"" says Bono. ""We could do a stripped-down show in a stadium, playing our greatest hits and the economics of that would be wildly more fair to the band. But I think it'd be unfair to the audience. ""We're trying to give them the best experience we can and we're prepared to pay for itâ¦ largely."" This video can not be played Bono and Adam Clayton explain how technology changes the way they tour. Putting their money where their mouths are, the band have revamped the entire Experience tour for its European outing. It now opens with images of the continent in ruins after World War Two and ends with the band performing in front of the EU flag, making a plea for tolerance and unity. ""Starting the show after the Second World War, in that devastation, in that awfulness was a bit scary for us,"" says Bono. ""We opened the tour in Berlin and it was just silence, for very understandable reasons. ""But out of the rubble came this idea of Europe and that maybe, even though we speak different tongues, we could somehow use the same voice. ""I think it's a beautiful, romantic concept, Europe, but it's ended up as a cold concept for a lot of people. You just think about the bureaucracy in Brussels, which is why I guess a lot of people in the UK wanted to leave."" Have the band thought about how the pro-EU message will go down in the UK? ""It's certainly going to be an interesting reception,"" says Clayton. ""I think our audience is probably going to be split several different ways, and I guess what we want to see is what comes out of it."" On a personal level, U2 are particularly worried about the Irish border situation. ""Since the peace process and that border evaporating, it's been a very different world for us,"" says Clayton. ""The closer we got to Europe, the more faint that border became. So we're very concerned about what happens between us and the North."" The Experience tour is possibly the band's most political show to date They don't pretend to have any solutions, even though Bono shoots off to Brussels after our conversation to rattle some cages. Instead the repeated theme of their show is that love can be a force for change, redemption and resistance - even if you're part of a globe-conquering rock band. ""I think part of the feeling in a U2 show is that the four of us stuck together,"" says Bono. On stage, he recalls how they were recording Achtung Baby in Berlin when the wall came down, but the band members were erecting walls of their own. ""It was important to tell people it has not always been rosy in the garden, as my dad would say. Achtung Baby was a very difficult time for our band. We nearly broke up before we got that song, One. ""So there are stresses and strains in trying to do your best work, as we still do. Every night it has to be the best night of anyone's life. And do you know what? That's a bit much."" That stress came to the fore last month when Bono's voice disappeared during a concert in Berlin. The band were forced to abandon the show after just seven songs - and the singer was visibly emotional as he croaked out an apology to the audience. This video can not be played Bono: ""I think we can't go on. It's not right for you"" ""I didn't even have a sore throat before the concert,"" he says. ""I was completely in perfect voice and then [snaps fingers] it was gone."" It's not the first time either. A case of ""desert throat"" affected the PopMart tour in Las Vegas, and in U2's autobiography Bono revealed he'd been diagnosed with ""nasal allergies"". So is that what happened in Berlin? ""That's probably closest to the answer, actually,"" he says. ""It's very humbling to be a person who can develop intense allergic reactions. That is not how I see myself."" The fact it happened in front of almost 30,000 people made it worse, he adds. ""Something like 5,000 of them had come from outside Germany, so they're not getting the cost of their flights back or their hotels back. I feel really awful about that, so we'll find a way to thank them."" Health-wise the singer has not had a great run over the last decade. He herniated a disc on the 360Â° tour andsuffered multiple fracturesin a ""freak"" bicycle accident in 2015. In the sleeve notes for the band's latest album, Songs of Experience, he also refers to a recent ""brush with mortality"" that inspired several of his lyrics. ""I did have some issues,"" he says. ""But they're gone and I'm not."" U2's tour hits the UK on 19 October U2, however, are preparing a disappearing act of their own. As their Amsterdam show draws to a close, Bono thanks the audience and declares: ""We don't know when we'll see you again."" Given the setlist leaned so heavily on their mid-career pivot into art rock, are they contemplating a similar period of reinvention? Not necessarily, says Adam Clayton. ""We've been hard at it for four years now - just constant touring,"" he smiles. ""I think we just need to go away for a little bit and give the audience a break.""

Harry and Meghan, sitting cross-legged in a  circle of fluorescently dressed men and women, talking about their experiences in an 'anti-bad-vibe circle'. At the end of it all, a group hug. For Meghan perhaps this was business as usual. Yoga and surfing and opening up in front of (and then hugging) strangers is par for the course for an enlightened Californian. But for the House of Windsor? For the sixth-in-line to the throne? Gosh. Wow. The times they are a-changin'.

"Avril (left) and Peter Griffiths denied a string of charges from the 1980s and 90s A husband and wife who raped and indecently assaulted young girls have been given lengthy jail terms. Peter Griffiths, 65, was sentenced to 21 years and Avril Griffiths, 61, was sentenced to 15 years. Cardiff Crown Court heard the couple - dubbed ""the Fred and Rose West"" of their Barry estate in the Vale of Glamorgan - abused girls on a boat and at home in the 1980s and 1990s. Judge Jeremy Jenkins said the couple had ""few if any sexual boundaries"". During the trial, claims were made that police officers were present when a young girl was raped on a boat while others watched. South Wales Police said it was investigating after allegations of contact between officers and Peter Griffiths were reported. 'A partnership in sexual exploitation' Police present at boat rape, court told Accused pair 'like Fred and Rose West' It comes after the court heard how the couple ""destroyed"" the lives of their three victims. In a statement, one woman, who cannot be identified, said: ""I feel what has happened to me has destroyed my life, they destroyed my childhood. ""I blamed myself for a long time. The abuse has affected my mental health all my life."" She said she was constantly scared she was going to be attacked, and that she had turned to heroin because it ""numbed my emotions"". Some of the abuse took place at the couple's home in Barry ""I do not think I will escape the abuse I suffered at the hands of them,"" she added. Another victim said she had tried to take her own life in the past because of the abuse, and that she had ""never felt able to tell anyone what happened"". She said she was still ""fighting demons"", had been a heroin user and was ""frightened of relapsing into a life I left behind"". The Griffiths' third victim said: ""I'm so scared because when Peter raped me I felt powerless. I have flashbacks, with him on top of me and her next to me, it's a recurring nightmare."" The couple'sabuse took place throughout 1980s and 90s, where Peter Griffiths used his wife, who is deemed to have a low IQ, as ""bait"" to lure young girls to him so he could rape them. Attacks took place in their home, on a boat and in the back of a van, while on one occasion Mrs Griffiths held a girl down telling her it ""wouldn't hurt"" as her husband raped her. One of their victims described them as the""Fred and Rose West"" of their housing estate. Peter and Avril Griffiths were described by police as depraved and sadistic Det Sgt David Rich said: ""Today's sentences reflect the gravity of the crimes which have been committed by Peter and Avril Griffiths. This couple who were responsible for appalling abuse have now been brought to justice. ""I would like to commend the three victims in this case who have shown immense strength and courage throughout the investigation and court proceedings.  I hope today's sentence provides some closure for them and their families as they attempt to move forward with their lives. ""Survivors of abuse by predators like Peter and Avril Griffiths deserve to see them brought to justice and we are determined to do all we can to help them."" Det Ch Insp Justin Evans said: ""Following the convictions of Peter and Avril Griffiths, two people have reported allegations of non-recent sexual offences to police. ""We are investigating these allegations and they are being supported by specially trained officers."" Peter Griffiths was found guilty of eight offences of rape, two of taking an indecent photograph of a child and three of indecent assault. His wife was found guilty of five offences of rape, two of taking an indecent photograph of a child and two of indecent assault.

The aim is to cut down on so-called authorised push payment (APP) scams, in which people are conned into sending money to another account. A total of Â£145m was stolen from bank customers in this way in the first half of the year, with many victims unable to get the money back because current legislation means they are liable for any losses incurred if they authorise a payment themselves. One such victim was Angelene Bungay of Shrewsbury, who wasduped into paying Â£13,000to someone posing as the builder carrying out her loft conversion. The situation has become more critical owing to the popularity of payments via smartphones and online. However, regulators and consumer groups have been stressing that banks and building societies should introduce the new system quickly. Gareth Shaw, from consumer group Which?, said: ""Customers will wonder why banks have dragged their heels and not implemented this system years ago, as it could have prevented a significant amount of fraud. With losses to bank transfer fraud increasing drastically it's clear this measure can't come in soon enough."" Under current plans, banks and building societies should have the technology in place by April, with the system up and running by July. ""This is an important step and we would like to see the banks implement this new protection as quickly as possible, giving everyone greater protection against fraud,"" said a spokeswoman for payments watchdog, the Payment Systems Regulator. UK Finance, which represents the UK's banks, said the latest plans provided ""some useful clarity"" and that the industry was fighting fraud on many fronts. Banking trade body UK Finance offers the following advice: Never disclose security details, such as your PIN or full banking password Don't assume an email, text or phone call is authentic Don't be rushed - a genuine organisation won't mind waiting Listen to your instincts - you know if something doesn't feel right Stay in control - don't panic and make a decision you'll regret Refund hopes rise for payment scam victims Half a billion stolen in banking scams Could smartphones replace bank branches?

"Recorded crime has gone up by 9% in England and Wales, fuelled by rises in violent offences and robbery,official figures show.,external The Home Office data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show police forces in England and Wales registered a total of 5.6 million offences in the year to June, compared with 5.2 million offences in the previous 12 months What else did the figures reveal? The number of homicides - covering murder, manslaughter and infanticide - in England and Wales has hit the highest point for more than 10 years. It is the fourth year in a row that there has been a rise. NB: Homicide figures exclude terror attacks and the Hillsborough disaster. The number of people being caught has risen too but the charge rate is still lower than it has been in the past. Meanwhile, offences involving violence recorded by police have gone up. This is not necessarily a reflection of rising crime, but instead could be a result of changes to recording rules and processes. These Home Office statistics are published at the same time as the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is based on people's experiences of crime. The results of this separate survey show that violent crime remained steady at 1.2 million offences in the last year and has not risen much in the last four years . Why more young people are using Crimestoppers But the statisticians at the ONS believe that crimes involving knives are going up. There was a 12% increase in violent crimes where a knife or a sharp object was used. These are offences like robbery, rape and murder. There were 40,000 in the last year. NB: Knife crime figures exclude Greater Manchester Police due to data comparability problems. But there are also some crimes that are dropping. Computer misuse offences are down by 30%, according to the crime survey. And if you own a bike this may be good news - bike thefts have dropped too - although they were pretty high last year. Joe Traynor, from the ONS said that while there had been ""continued falls in overall levels of crime"" over recent decades, in the last year the trend had been more stable. ""To put today's crime survey figures into context, only two out of 10 adults experienced crime in the latest year,"" he said. Correction 19 October 2018: The second chart on homicide charges has been amended to reflect that while the number of people being caught has risen, the charge rate is still lower than it has been in the past.

At least 600 ""highly skilled"" roles will be added in Manchester working on software, machine learning and AWS, its cloud computing business. The company will also create 250 and 180 jobs at its development centres in Edinburgh and Cambridge respectively. Doug Gurr, Amazon's UK country manager, described the new roles as ""Silicon Valley jobs in Britain"". Liam Fox, the International Trade Secretary, said the new positions were an ""enormous vote of confidence in the UK"". Amazon will have about 27,500 employees in the UK by the end of this year, with 6,500 people in its corporate, AWS and R&D divisions. That means more than 20,000 people work in its 17 ""fulfilment centres"", or warehouses, and 40 delivery stations in the UK.

"The injured policeman was put in an ambulance after the crash Two teenage girls are among four people arrested after a police officer was run over during a police chase. The officer, 43, suffered leg injuries when he was hit by a van being pursued by officers at 07:30 BST in Blackley New Road, Blackley, Manchester. He had been responding to a disturbance at a nearby flat when a man fled in a black Citroen Berlingo. Two girls aged 16 and 17 and two men, both 23, are being held on suspicion of assault and theft of a motor vehicle. The van hit an officer, three police vehicles and five cars in Blackley New Road, say police Greater Manchester Police said officers attempted to speak to the van driver before it hit the officer. Three police vehicles and five cars in Blackley New Road were also struck by the vehicle. Witnesses told the BBC the van reversed as the driver tried to get away from two chasing police cars, but then hit a wall. Police confirmed the van was later recovered a few miles away in Newton Heath. The police officer has now been released from hospital and is recovering at home. Supt Chris Hill of Greater Manchester Police said: ""Whilst the injured officer came straight back into work from hospital on his new crutches, he's been sent home to recover with his family and we all wish him a speedy recovery. Blackley New Road remains closed at the junction with Delaunays Road while investigative work is carried out. The police officer's protective vest was carried away by a colleague after the crash Witness Jack Heys, 23, told the BBC: ""It was madness. ""The van driver scraped the side of my car as he was trying to get away from two chasing police cars. ""He was right beside me and I waved my hands at him as if to say 'What are you doing?'. ""It then hit a policeman. The van driver was desperate to get away and reversed but hit a wall."" Mr Heys added: ""There were two women in pyjamas in the back of the van - they seemed to know him.""

"Kleenex is scrapping ""Mansize"" branding from its tissue boxes after 60 years on the shelves as consumers called it out for being sexist. The company said the tissues would now be called ""Extra Large"". One customer questioned the firm after her four-year-old son asked if ""girls, boys and mummies"" can use them. Kleenex told shoppers to ""keep an eye out"" for the new branding, saying some of its new larger boxes are already on sale.

Kleenex thanked customers for their concern and confirmed the new ""Extra Large"" labelling. The BBC has approached Kleenex for comment, but the company has yet to respond. However, in a statement given tothe Daily Telegraph,external, a spokesman for its parent company, Kimberly-Clark, said the firm was registering ""a consistent increase of complaints on gender concern"". He added: ""Kimberly-Clark in no way suggests that being both soft and strong is an exclusively masculine trait, nor do we believe that the Mansize branding suggests or endorses gender inequality. ""Nevertheless, as we remain committed to developing the best possible products for our consumers and take any feedback extremely seriously, we decided to renovate our current product and update the product subbrand as Kleenex Extra Large."" A number of products have drawn criticism for ""sexist branding"" in recent years - but what do you think? In February, the CEO of PepsiCo was hit with a wave of condemnation after announcing the company was developing a range of crisps especially for women.Indra Nooyi highlighted the importance of fitting the snack into a handbag and reducing how loudly the crisps crunch when eaten. Bike manufacturer Pinarello, who supply bicycles to Team Sky, got in trouble in last November over its electronic road bikes.The company said the bike was aimed at weekend riders and female riders who want to ""follow easily the men's pace"". Nikon became the centre of attention in September last year when they recruited 32 new brand ambassadors to represent their cameras. The problem?They were all men. Shoe shop Clarks faced a backlash in August 2017 as they launched their new children's school shoe brands. The boys' shoe, with insoles decorated with footballs, was branded ""Leader"".The girls' shoe, however, carried a heart pattern on the inside and was named ""Dolly Babe"". The Advertising Standards Authority - which regulates adverts in the UK - told the BBC it had not received any complaints about the product, but it was carrying out ""a significant amount of work around gender stereotypes in ads"". Plans include setting new standards on adverts that feature stereotypical gender roles or characteristics, and cracking down on those which mock people for not conforming to stereotypes.

However, regulators and consumer groups have been stressing that banks and building societies should introduce the new system quickly. Gareth Shaw, from consumer group Which?, said: ""Customers will wonder why banks have dragged their heels and not implemented this system years ago, as it could have prevented a significant amount of fraud. With losses to bank transfer fraud increasing drastically it's clear this measure can't come in soon enough."" Under current plans, banks and building societies should have the technology in place by April, with the system up and running by July. ""This is an important step and we would like to see the banks implement this new protection as quickly as possible, giving everyone greater protection against fraud,"" said a spokeswoman for payments watchdog, the Payment Systems Regulator. UK Finance, which represents the UK's banks, said the latest plans provided ""some useful clarity"" and that the industry was fighting fraud on many fronts.

"A case of BSE - so-called mad cow disease - has been confirmed at a farm in Aberdeenshire. BBC Scotland understands the ""isolated"" case involves a beef herd in the Huntly area. Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said a movement ban was now in place on the unnamed farm. Investigations are under way to identify the origin of the disease - the first in Scotland in a decade - which was found after an animal died. What you need to know about BSE The case involving a five-year-old animal was identified before entering the human food chain. Four others from the herd were being destroyed as a precaution. There are understood to have been16 cases in the UK since 2011,external, with the last in 2015 whenfarming officials confirmed a case of BSE in Carmarthenshire, Wales. That was discovered following routine tests carried out when a farm animal dies. The monitoring of BSE has been an important function since the crisis of 1986 when 180,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million slaughtered in order to eradicate the disease in the UK. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a brain disorder in cattle that can be transmitted to humans who eat infected meat. Mad cow disease - as it is more commonly known, because of the animals' erratic behaviour and movements - destroys their brains by eating away the nerve tissue. The first recorded case in the UK was in 1986. About 180,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million slaughtered in order to eradicate the disease. There was nationwide alarm following the confirmation of the first deaths caused by transmission of BSE to humans in 1996. At the time there were fears that hundreds of thousands of people might die as a result of eating infected beef. As it turned out 178 people have died of the human form of mad cow disease, known as Variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD).  It is believed that these individuals were genetically more sensitive to succumbing to the disease than the wider population. Since then, cattle are closely monitored for signs of the disease and it seems that, in this instance, the surveillance system has worked well. The cause is not known at this stage. But if it is an isolated case there is very little if any risk to human health. According to Prof Matthew Baylis, Chair of Veterinary Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, ""BSE in cattle in the UK is largely over but there is still the odd detected case - one in 2014, two in 2015 and now one in 2018. It is too early to say if this case is significant"". On the Aberdeenshire case, Scotland's Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: ""I would urge any farmer who has concerns to seek veterinary advice."" She added: ""While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. ""We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question."" Andrew McCornick, president of NFU Scotland, said: ""It is disappointing to learn of this BSE case within the Aberdeenshire area."" He added: ""Whilst we lose ournegligible risk status, it is not unexpected to see a new case and demonstrates the efficacy of the surveillance measures in place. This simply brings us back in line with the rest of Great Britain, reverting back to where we were 18 months ago. ""When Scotland applied for BSE negligible risk status it was with the full knowledge that there was every possibility of a sporadic case of BSE emerging as has been the case in France and Ireland."" Ian McWatt, director of operations in Food Standards Scotland, said that there were strict rules in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed. Although the BSE case in Scotland is significant, the industry is genuinely not concerned about any immediate impact. Movement restrictions only apply to the farm identified. Unlike in the 1980s and 90s, the disease is more clearly understood.  There have long been cases of BSE and there will continue to be so. But the practice of feeding infected meat and bonemeal back to the cattle was what led to the rapid acceleration in numbers which became the crisis. Some of the most recent cases are a legacy of that - the offspring of older cattle. But the Aberdeenshire case is in a five-year-old animal and so it is likely that it was just predisposed to the condition. A lot has changed since the BSE crisis. Brain and spinal cord no longer enter the food chain and there's a more rigorous process for monitoring. So the risk to human health is virtually nil. And it is not a condition that can be passed from animal to animal, other than through birth. The biggest concern is in international confidence. BSE has long been a barrier to exporting beef as other countries did not want anything to do with nations where there had been cases. It has been a decade since the last case in Scotland.  A country is classed as 'negligible risk' 11 years after the birth of the last known case and that status was achieved in 2016.  This latest case takes them back a step but only to the same level as the rest of the UK. But with Brexit on the horizon - and wider trade deals being a big part of that - there are fears that this will be a barrier to entering new markets.

"This video can not be played Mr Macron meant ""start"" but actually said ""stop"", aides say France's president mixed up his English when he said in error that UK visitors would need French visas if there was a no-deal Brexit, aides say. Emmanuel Macron had meant to say that British people would not need visas in such circumstances. The confusion came as Mr Macron was speaking to the media in English at the end of an EU summit in Brussels. Instead of ""we will not stop visas"" he meant to say ""we will not start visas"", the ElysÃ©e Palace explained. UK citizens currently enjoy visa-free travel in the EU, but that could change with Brexit. The UK is set to leave the 28-nation bloc on 29 March 2019. The BBC's Gavin Lee raised the visa issue with President Macron at Thursday's news conference, after leaders had failed to achieve a breakthrough on Brexit. By Gavin Lee, BBC News, Brussels The mix-up came after I asked President Macron whether newspaper reports of UK citizens needing visas for work or holidays in the event of a no-deal was true. The president's response was that ""we will not stop visas, it is fake news, as some other leaders would say"", and he went on to say ""we will definitely deliver visas for people"". His team now say it was a case of a ""second language"" slip-up, and that President Macron meant to say ""we will not start visas for British people"". The press team for the ElysÃ©e Palace say the position of the French for their ""no-deal"" contingency planning is one that would categorically not mean visas for British people, UNLESS the UK suddenly imposed them on French workers and tourists in the UK. They say they would aim for a deal which allows for a ""special status"" agreement for workers and tourists for both countries, that avoids the need for any ""official visa system"". In the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Macron said, measures would be taken to cover flights, ferries and businesses as well. A draft law has been tabled in the upper house of the French parliament,externalthat will let the government set new rules for Britons visiting France after Brexit. The draft suggests they will be treated as ""third country"" visitors - a similar category to Americans or Chinese. The preamble of the bill raises the possibility that visas may be imposed. But, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the bill also gives the government the power to adapt or suspend the need for visas and residence permits for UK citizens. A deal remains elusive mainly because of wrangling over the future Northern Ireland border. Brexit risks reinstating physical controls at the border, which were scrapped under the Northern Ireland peace settlement. The current Brexit plan is for a transition period of 21 months from the end of March, to smooth the UK's path to a future relationship outside the EU. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that transition could be extended ""for a few months"", if needed. But some Brexit campaigners have reacted angrily to the suggestion. EU ready to extend transition period Brexit: All you need to know Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop ""I do prefer a deal and I want a deal, but I will never favour a bad deal,"" Mr Macron said on Thursday. ""In case of no deal our responsibility is to ensure that the life of our people will not be so far impacted."" Mr Macron described the ""dynamic"" of the Brexit negotiations as ""positive because there is a willingness on the British side to find a solution"". He said ""now it's for Prime Minister May to propose a solution, but we will not compromise on the key elements of the mandate we gave to [EU negotiator] Michel Barnier"". The French president also denied suggestions that the UK prime minister had been snubbed late on Wednesday, when four EU leaders went out for a drink in the Grand Place in the centre of Brussels. He told the BBC that Theresa May had left the summit earlier, and said she would certainly be invited in future. ""I am always happy and open to share a drink with the different leaders, so obviously Theresa May will be very much welcome,"" he said. Update 19 October 2018: Our story was amended after the ElysÃ©e Palace explained that Mr Macron had meant to say ""we will not start visas"" for British people, but had inadvertently used the verb ""stop"" instead.

"A key part of the Brexit negotiations has been the border that separates Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The border is a matter of great political, security and diplomatic sensitivity in Ireland. Therefore the UK and EU agreed that whatever happens as a result of Brexit there should be no new physical checks or infrastructure at the frontier. This is where the controversial ""backstop"" comes in. At present, goods and services are traded between the two jurisdictions with few restrictions. That is because the UK and Ireland are part of the EU's single market and customs union, so products do not need to be inspected for customs or standards. But after Brexit, all that could change - the two parts of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which could mean products being checked at the border. The preference of both sides is to prevent this happening through a deep and comprehensive trade deal. However, the UK's ambition to leave the customs union and the single market, could make that very difficult. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. And if both sides couldn't reach agreement on a deal keeping the border as open as it is now - that's where the backstop would come in. So how might it it work? There are several options: This is what the EU originally proposed. It would involve Northern Ireland alone remaining in the EU's single market and customs union, leaving Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) free to strike trade deals. But the DUP - a Northern Ireland unionist party that propped up Theresa May's minority Conservative government - objected to this. It said it would see Northern Ireland treated differently and could threaten the union. Boris Johnson has alsospecifically ruled this out. After the DUP's objections, Mrs May agreed a backstop involving the whole of the UK retaining a very close relationship with the EU - staying in the customs union - for an indefinite period. It would also see Northern Ireland staying even more closely tied to some rules of the EU single market. These arrangements would apply unless and until both the EU and UK agree they are no longer necessary. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) The backstop would not apply if the UK left the EU without a deal but the potential problems with the border would remain. The backstop plan was agreed by UK-EU negotiators and formed part of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in November 2018 (often referred to as the Brexit ""divorce deal""). It sparked a backlash from many Conservative MPs (and the DUP) at Westminster and several of her own ministers resigned in protest. Please upgrade your browser They feared that the backstop would be used to permanently trap the UK in the EU customs union, preventing the country from striking its own trade deals. Ultimately, her deal was voted down three times, leading to her resignation. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is committed to ""getting rid"" of the backstop, describing it as ""anti-democratic"". His government has instead proposed the idea of a ""single regulatory zone"" on the island of Ireland. That would mean Northern Ireland continuing to follow EU rules on animal health, food safety and manufactured goods. It would effectively mean a new regulatory border in the Irish Sea with checks and controls at ports. The DUP say they can accept this as long as there is a role for the Northern Ireland Assembly to give ongoing consent to these arrangements. On customs, the UK has said Northern Ireland must leave the EU customs union. However the Prime Minister believes checks at the Irish frontier can be avoided by instead having customs processes mainly at company premises. The EU is sceptical about this and the latest negotiations have focused largely on customs. Many Brexit supporters say what are known as ""alternative arrangements"" could be used to avoid checks at the border. The phrase is normally used to refer to technical or technological solutions. These include things like trusted traders schemes and using GPS to track lorries. The EU has committed to working on alternative arrangements but has said no systems which could solve the border problem are currently ""operational"".

"Turkish forensic investigators have searched the Saudi consul's residence as well as the consulate US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox have pulled out of an investment conference in Saudi Arabia. Their moves come amid allegations the country was behind the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Mr Khashoggi has not been seen since entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October, where Turkish officials allege he was murdered. Saudi Arabia, which denies the killing, allowed investigators inside overnight. Bot campaign follows Khashoggi disappearance What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? Jamal Khashoggi in his own words The Future Investment Initiative summit will take place from 23 to 25 October in the Saudi capital Riyadh. It is being hosted by Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman to promote his reform agenda. His plan for economic and social modernisation, called Vision 2030, aims to reduce Saudi Arabia's dependence on oil and provide new jobs. As a result, Mr Mnuchin's decision to boycott the summit is seen as a substantial blow to the prince's agenda, correspondents say. Investment bank Goldman Sachs became the latest business to say it would not send any executives to the conference. However, a number ofmajor businesses - including Pepsi and EDF - are still intending to godespite growing pressure for a boycott. Mr Mnuchin announced he would pull out of the summit following a discussion with President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Pompeo went to Riyadh earlier this week to discuss the disappearance with Saudi King Salman. He said he had been assured that Saudi Arabia would investigate the matter, and that he had told Mr Trump to give the country ""a few more days"" before deciding whether to take action. Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance It is not clear. Mr Khashoggi was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October, to pick up paperwork that would allow him to marry his fiancÃ©e Hatice Cengiz. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Turkish officials believe Mr Khashoggi was killed by a team of Saudi agents inside the consulate, with his body then removed. Saudi Arabia has denied the claims, and initially insisted Mr Khashoggi had freely left the embassy. The Turkish authorities say they have audio and video evidence of the killing - although these have not been made public. Turkish media with close links to the government have published gruesome details on the alleged audio, saying screams, andthe voice of the consul, Mohammed al-Otaibi, could be heard in the recording,external. The Yeni Safak newspaper, which is close to the government, quotes him as telling alleged Saudi agents sent to Istanbul: ""Do this outside. You're going to get me in trouble."" Meanwhile,Turkish media say they have identified a 15-member team of suspected Saudi agents,externalwho flew into and out of Istanbul on the day of the disappearance. This video can not be played US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says the Saudis will respond in a ""timely fashion"" However, Saudi Arabia says reports on Mr Khashoggi's death are ""completely false and baseless"" and that it is ""open to co-operation"" to find out what happened. Several high-profile human rights groups have demanded that Turkey ask the UN to investigate the possible killing of Mr Khashoggi. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists said that a ""one-sided"" investigation by Saudi Arabia was not good enough. On Wednesday and Thursday, Turkish investigators spent almost nine hours searching the Saudi consul's residence, before moving on to the consulate itself about 200m (650ft) away, according to Reuters news agency. Several vehicles with Saudi diplomatic number plates were filmed by CCTV cameras moving from the consulate to the residence just under two hours after Mr Khashoggi entered the consulate. Late on Thursday, Turkish officials told journalists police were searching Belgrad Forest - a secluded woodland more than 10km (six miles) from the capital Istanbul - as well as Yalova city nearby. An official told Reuters they suspected that Mr Khashoggi's remains had been disposed of in ""a farm house or villa"" in one of those areas. Investigators had taken samples from the Saudi consulate and the consul's home, and would analyse them for traces of Mr Khashoggi's DNA, the official, who Reuters did not name, added. Saudi Arabia is a key ally to many Western countries, especially the US. As one of the world's biggest oil exporters, it has significant influence on the world stage. The Dutch and French finance ministers, and the head of the International Monetary Fund, are amongst those now boycotting the summit. On Thursday Donald Trump told reporters it ""certainly looks"" like Mr Khashoggi is dead, adding ""it's very sad"". He said there would be ""very severe"" consequences if Saudi Arabia was proved to have killed the journalist. However, Mr Trump has also been accused of providing cover to the Saudi government. He previously said he would not cancel military contracts with Saudi Arabia because ""I don't want to hurt jobs"", and also said he was unhappy Saudi Arabia was being treated as ""guilty until proven innocent"". Russian President Vladimir Putin has said it is a pity that Mr Khashoggi has gone missing, but that Russia cannot damage relations with Saudi Arabia without hard facts. Hatice Cengiz said she waited outside the consulate for 11 hours, but did not see her fiancÃ© Mr Khashoggi is a prominent journalist who has covered major stories for various Saudi news organisations. He served as an adviser to top Saudi officials, but later fell out of favour with the government. He went into self-imposed exile in the US last year, and wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post. On Thursday,the Washington Post published Mr Khashoggi's latest column,external- a call for press freedom across the Arab world. The newspaper said the column had been submitted by Mr Khashoggi's translator the day after he was reported missing. It had initially held off from publishing the column, but decided to go ahead after accepting Mr Khashoggi was not going to return safely. In his column, Mr Khashoggi criticised the state of press freedom in the Arab world, saying it left Saudis ""either uninformed or misinformed"". Government moves to suppress journalists ""no longer carry the consequence of a backlash from the international community"", he wrote. ""Instead, these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence."" 2 October 03:28: A private jet carrying suspected Saudi agents arrives at Istanbul airport.

Asked how the conservator did not spot the frame's double thickness and apparent weight from the attached shredder, he replied: ""You address what you see, it was more like a sculpture. If it says the frame is integral, you don't rip it apart."" This is not the first time a work of art has been created by accident or opportunism. Andy Warhol's famous collection of Campbell's soup cans started off as individual pieces which didn't sell particularly well, and then were brought back together and sold as a single unit as if that was always the intention. Even dear old Marcel Duchamp, who as we know started all this, only retrospectively decided his bicycle wheel placed on top of a stool was a work of art, as opposed to an amusing distraction for him in his studio in Paris. So there is precedent for an object to be retrospectively deemed an artwork by the artist. Review: Banksy's Love is in the Bin âââââ But that doesn't answer the question which is crossing most people's minds, I would imagine; would it have been worthless if the action had succeeded, and the canvas had fully shredded? Possibly. But, I think, unlikely. Judging by the title that Banksy has given the work, the intention was for the artwork to be a shredded canvas on the floor, beneath an empty frame. So you could argue that the installation piece of an empty frame on a wall, with the shredded canvas beneath it, would actually be worth more, than what could be considered an 'incomplete' artwork, stuck in the frame. The new Banksy video also shows the reaction of Oliver Barker, the auctioneer on the night - who appears both miffed and worried by the shredding. Barker pointed out to the Art Newspaper that Banksy often employs misshapen frames in his works, ""and that's part of the joke"". ""The accusation that we were somehow negligent in the way this was catalogued does not stand up. We did everything,"" he added. ""Going forward, are we going to question a frame like this? Absolutely."" A Sotheby's spokesman said: ""The new narrative is that Banksy did not destroy a work on its premises, he created one, adding value not detracting. ""It is a different work to the one that appeared in the catalogue, but nonetheless it is an intentional work of art, not a destroyed painting.""

"Recorded crime has gone up by 9% in England and Wales, fuelled by rises in violent offences and robbery,official figures show.,external The Home Office data published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show police forces in England and Wales registered a total of 5.6 million offences in the year to June, compared with 5.2 million offences in the previous 12 months What else did the figures reveal? The number of homicides - covering murder, manslaughter and infanticide - in England and Wales has hit the highest point for more than 10 years. It is the fourth year in a row that there has been a rise. NB: Homicide figures exclude terror attacks and the Hillsborough disaster. The number of people being caught has risen too but the charge rate is still lower than it has been in the past. Meanwhile, offences involving violence recorded by police have gone up. This is not necessarily a reflection of rising crime, but instead could be a result of changes to recording rules and processes. These Home Office statistics are published at the same time as the Crime Survey for England and Wales, which is based on people's experiences of crime. The results of this separate survey show that violent crime remained steady at 1.2 million offences in the last year and has not risen much in the last four years . Why more young people are using Crimestoppers But the statisticians at the ONS believe that crimes involving knives are going up. There was a 12% increase in violent crimes where a knife or a sharp object was used. These are offences like robbery, rape and murder. There were 40,000 in the last year. NB: Knife crime figures exclude Greater Manchester Police due to data comparability problems. But there are also some crimes that are dropping. Computer misuse offences are down by 30%, according to the crime survey. And if you own a bike this may be good news - bike thefts have dropped too - although they were pretty high last year. Joe Traynor, from the ONS said that while there had been ""continued falls in overall levels of crime"" over recent decades, in the last year the trend had been more stable. ""To put today's crime survey figures into context, only two out of 10 adults experienced crime in the latest year,"" he said.

"Dalian Atkinson played for Aston Villa, Ipswich Town and Sheffield Wednesday Two police officers could face criminal charges over the death of former footballer Dalian Atkinson who was shot with a Taser. The ex-Aston Villa striker, 48, died in August 2016 after contact with officers at his father's house in Shropshire. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said it had referred a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). West Mercia Police said it ""understands the need for answers"". Mr Atkinson started his career at Ipswich Town before moving to Sheffield Wednesday, Real Sociedad, Aston Villa and FenerbahÃ§e in Turkey. The IOPC said during its investigation, three West Mercia Police officers were interviewed twice under criminal caution and served with gross misconduct notices. The actions of the third officer have not been referred to the CPS. Aston Villa fans paid tribute to their former striker The IOPC said the officers attended Meadows Close in Trench, Telford, and were ""involved in detaining Mr Atkinson outside"" an address at about 01:30 BST on 15 August 2016. It said the former footballer was taken by ambulance to the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford where he later died. ""The investigation gathered evidence which indicates that police contact with Mr Atkinson involved the use of a Taser, followed by a period of restraint and other uses of force,"" the IOPC added. Latest news and stories from the West Midlands An inquest into the circumstances surrounding the death has yet to be held amid a delay in the testing of toxicology samples. Dalian Atkinson's funeral was held in Telford West Mercia Police Assistant Chief Constable Martin Evans confirmed a Taser was deployed while responding to an incident involving Mr Atkinson. ""We understand the need for answers by those directly affected by this tragedy and also by the wider community that West Mercia Police serves,"" he added. ""It would be inappropriate for us to comment further at this time.""

"Stuart Richards died when his Ford Mondeo was struck on the M40 A car which crashed killing three people after driving the wrong way on a motorway had been involved in a collision five days earlier, police have said. The Subaru was towing a caravan when it hit a Ford Mondeo and a Ford Focus on the M40 in Oxfordshire on Monday. The Mondeo driver Stuart Richards, 32, and the Subaru driver and passenger, both in their 80s, died in the crash. Thames Valley Police said it had referred itself to the police watchdog. The force said on 10 October a report of a damage-only road traffic collision involving the Subaru Forester in High Wycombe was made to them. It said it had made a mandatory referral to the Independent Office for Police Conduct in relation to the fatal collision ""due to previous police contact"". The M40 northbound was closed overnight after the crash Police said Mr Richards was from Stockport in Greater Manchester. The two occupants of the Subaru have not been formally identified. The northbound carriageway was closed overnight after the crash, which happened between junction 6 for Watlington and junction 8A for Oxford. Mr Richards was in the Army for nine years, serving as an engineer and safety officer in Iraq, Afghanistan and Jordan. After leaving he worked as a health and safety adviser for Persimmon Homes.

"This video can not be played What is the 'Dutch reach'? Measures to help protect cyclists, including encouraging people to adopt the ""Dutch reach"", are expected to be included in the new Highway Code. The method of opening a car door using the hand furthest from the handle forces drivers to turn and look behind them for passing cyclists. The code will also give updated guidance on how to avoid the dangers of close overtaking of cyclists. Cycling UK said the move was a major step for cycle safety. In 2017 101 cyclists died in road traffic collisions. The announcement was welcomed by Jeff Boulton,whose son Sam died after being hit by the door of a taxi while cycling in Leicester in July 2016. He was knocked off his bike, and fell into the path of a moving van. His father said he was relieved the government was planning to update its guidance. ""If only one person is saved from Sam's tragic fate because the driver or passenger has adopted the Dutch reach... then that's a life worth saving,"" he said. Cyclist Sam Boulton died after being hit by the door of a taxi Duncan Dollimore, head of campaigns at Cycling UK, which has campaigned for changes to the Highway Code, said he was delighted by the announcement. ""Close overtakes and people opening car doors in front of cyclists are not only dangerous, they also put people off riding a bike,"" he said. Rule 163 of the Highway Code states that when passing cyclists, drivers should give ""as much room as you would when overtaking a car"". Cycling UK is calling for the code to include guidance on a minimum distance to give when overtaking, suggesting a minimum of 1.5m when travelling under 30mph and 2m over 30mph. The organisation also recommends the code should require vehicles to give way to pedestrians and cyclists when turning. It also wants rules advising cyclists to wear helmets and fluorescent clothing to be changed, arguing they currently promote ""victim-blaming"" and deflect responsibility from drivers in the case of collisions if the cyclist does not follow this advice. Cycling and walking minister Jesse Norman said that while Britain had ""some of the safest roads in the world"" there was still more to be done to protect cyclists, pedestrians and other vulnerable road users. ""Cycling and walking are increasingly being understood as crucial parts of an integrated approach to issues of health, obesity, air quality and town and city planning. ""But this will only happen if people feel safe on the roads,"" he said. Highways England has also announced a Â£3m contract with Sustrans to improve the National Cycle Network.

"Chemists have been told by the NHS to check whether young children are in urgent need of adrenaline pens before dispensing the devices. Pharmacists must ask parents and carers how many auto-adrenaline injectors they have before deciding how many to give. Only children who have no pens - including expired but usable devices - should get the standard prescription of two pens, the guidance says. It follows a shortage of EpiPens, the adrenaline pen most often prescribed. The new NHS guidance to pharmacists and dispensing doctors relates to 0.15mg pens, prescribed to children who weigh less than 25kg (four stone). The Department of Health told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme new supplies were ""expected within the next week"" and patients with the greatest need would be prioritised. 'Use some EpiPens past expiry date' EpiPen shortage 'worrying' users Adrenaline auto-injectors (AAIs) are prescribed to people with potentially serious allergies, such as to: nuts milk fish shellfish eggs some fruits People are recommended to keep two of the devices with them at all times for cases of anaphylaxis - a severe and sometimes life-threatening reaction often caused by allergies - as one is not always enough. They can be used only once and usually have an expiry date that lasts for a minimum of 12 months. A global shortage of EpiPens has had a knock-on effect on the alternative brands of auto-adrenaline injectors, Jext and Emerade, which are now also in short supply. The new guidance from the NHS says a ""critical supply issue"" for 0.15mg pens means they need to be conserved for those who ""truly need them"". It says pharmacists and dispensing doctors must follow a flowchart of questions, or a ""validation protocol"", before dispensing the pens to patients, ""other than when there is an immediate clinical need"". The flowchart involves checking with parents and carers how many of the devices the patients have, including expired ones that are not discoloured and do not contain particles. It says pharmacists and dispensing doctors should give: two devices for those who have no pens, including no expired ones that are usable (i.e. pens that are not discoloured and do not contain particles) one device for those who have one pen they can use - either an in-date device or an expired but usable one a delayed prescription for those who have two pens that are in date or one pen that is in date and one that has expired but is still usable Pens kept at schools and nurseries are not included. The guidance says: ""The purpose of the validation is to ensure that every eligible patient has at least one in-date device and that a situation is avoided where some patients have two in-date devices, whilst others have none. ""This does mean that many patients will have to carry one in-date pen and one expired pen. We are aware of this and clinical experts have agreed this advice until the shortage eases."" The Department of Health and Social Care said that if no new devices can be obtained, expired pens can be used in an emergency, ""as this is safer than not using them"". The department says expired devices, as long as they are not discoloured, containing particles, or showing other signs of damage, will not be dangerous but the potency of the adrenaline may have reduced. It comes as the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) agreed to extend the use of some batches of 0.15mg and 0.3mg Jext AAIs four months beyond their labelled expiry dates. The extension applies to only the deviceslisted here,external. Other AAIs should not be used after their expiry date without first checking with your medical practitioner. The Jext devices will continue to ""work safely and as intended"" within the extended use-by date, the MHRA said. ALK, the company behind Jext, said it had ""significantly increased production"" of its AAI devices in the wake of the global shortage of EpiPens. However, the time needed to manufacture its products, along with the scale of the demand, meant it had not been able to meet the shortfall so far. The extension granted by the MHRA follows its decision last month to agree for some batches of 0.3mg EpiPens - for those who weigh more than 25kg - to be used past their normal use-by date. In both cases, the medicines regulator said it had agreed to the requests, made by the producers of the devices, after reviewing evidence on the drugs' shelf lives. Nuts, shellfish and eggs are among the foods that can trigger allergies food - such as peanuts, milk/dairy foods, egg, wheat, fish and seafood, sesame and soya insect stings - from bees and wasps medication - such as antibiotics and ibuprofen latex - rubber gloves, balloons, swimming caps Q&A: What is anaphylaxis? A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""We are working closely with all the manufacturers of adrenaline auto-injectors to improve the supply situation as quickly as possible.

"The injured policeman was put in an ambulance after the crash Two teenage girls are among four people arrested after a police officer was run over during a police chase. The officer, 43, suffered leg injuries when he was hit by a van being pursued by officers at 07:30 BST in Blackley New Road, Blackley, Manchester. He had been responding to a disturbance at a nearby flat when a man fled in a black Citroen Berlingo. Two girls aged 16 and 17 and two men, both 23, are being held on suspicion of assault and theft of a motor vehicle. The van hit an officer, three police vehicles and five cars in Blackley New Road, say police Greater Manchester Police said officers attempted to speak to the van driver before it hit the officer. Three police vehicles and five cars in Blackley New Road were also struck by the vehicle. Witnesses told the BBC the van reversed as the driver tried to get away from two chasing police cars, but then hit a wall. Police confirmed the van was later recovered a few miles away in Newton Heath. The police officer has now been released from hospital and is recovering at home. Supt Chris Hill of Greater Manchester Police said: ""Whilst the injured officer came straight back into work from hospital on his new crutches, he's been sent home to recover with his family and we all wish him a speedy recovery. Blackley New Road remains closed at the junction with Delaunays Road while investigative work is carried out. The police officer's protective vest was carried away by a colleague after the crash Witness Jack Heys, 23, told the BBC: ""It was madness. ""The van driver scraped the side of my car as he was trying to get away from two chasing police cars. ""He was right beside me and I waved my hands at him as if to say 'What are you doing?'. ""It then hit a policeman. The van driver was desperate to get away and reversed but hit a wall."" Mr Heys added: ""There were two women in pyjamas in the back of the van - they seemed to know him.""

Their moves come amid allegations the country was behind the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Mr Khashoggi has not been seen since entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October, where Turkish officials allege he was murdered. Saudi Arabia, which denies the killing, allowed investigators inside overnight. Bot campaign follows Khashoggi disappearance What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? Jamal Khashoggi in his own words The Future Investment Initiative summit will take place from 23 to 25 October in the Saudi capital Riyadh. It is being hosted by Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman to promote his reform agenda. His plan for economic and social modernisation, called Vision 2030, aims to reduce Saudi Arabia's dependence on oil and provide new jobs. As a result, Mr Mnuchin's decision to boycott the summit is seen as a substantial blow to the prince's agenda, correspondents say. Investment bank Goldman Sachs became the latest business to say it would not send any executives to the conference. However, a number ofmajor businesses - including Pepsi and EDF - are still intending to godespite growing pressure for a boycott. Mr Mnuchin announced he would pull out of the summit following a discussion with President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Pompeo went to Riyadh earlier this week to discuss the disappearance with Saudi King Salman. He said he had been assured that Saudi Arabia would investigate the matter, and that he had told Mr Trump to give the country ""a few more days"" before deciding whether to take action. Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance It is not clear. Mr Khashoggi was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October, to pick up paperwork that would allow him to marry his fiancÃ©e Hatice Cengiz. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Turkish officials believe Mr Khashoggi was killed by a team of Saudi agents inside the consulate, with his body then removed. Saudi Arabia has denied the claims, and initially insisted Mr Khashoggi had freely left the embassy. The Turkish authorities say they have audio and video evidence of the killing - although these have not been made public. Turkish media with close links to the government have published gruesome details on the alleged audio, saying screams, andthe voice of the consul, Mohammed al-Otaibi, could be heard in the recording,external. The Yeni Safak newspaper, which is close to the government, quotes him as telling alleged Saudi agents sent to Istanbul: ""Do this outside. You're going to get me in trouble."" Meanwhile,Turkish media say they have identified a 15-member team of suspected Saudi agents,externalwho flew into and out of Istanbul on the day of the disappearance. This video can not be played US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says the Saudis will respond in a ""timely fashion"" However, Saudi Arabia says reports on Mr Khashoggi's death are ""completely false and baseless"" and that it is ""open to co-operation"" to find out what happened. Several high-profile human rights groups have demanded that Turkey ask the UN to investigate the possible killing of Mr Khashoggi. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Reporters Without Borders and the Committee to Protect Journalists said that a ""one-sided"" investigation by Saudi Arabia was not good enough. On Wednesday and Thursday, Turkish investigators spent almost nine hours searching the Saudi consul's residence, before moving on to the consulate itself about 200m (650ft) away, according to Reuters news agency. Several vehicles with Saudi diplomatic number plates were filmed by CCTV cameras moving from the consulate to the residence just under two hours after Mr Khashoggi entered the consulate. Late on Thursday, Turkish officials told journalists police were searching Belgrad Forest - a secluded woodland more than 10km (six miles) from the capital Istanbul - as well as Yalova city nearby. An official told Reuters they suspected that Mr Khashoggi's remains had been disposed of in ""a farm house or villa"" in one of those areas. Investigators had taken samples from the Saudi consulate and the consul's home, and would analyse them for traces of Mr Khashoggi's DNA, the official, who Reuters did not name, added. Saudi Arabia is a key ally to many Western countries, especially the US. As one of the world's biggest oil exporters, it has significant influence on the world stage. The Dutch and French finance ministers, and the head of the International Monetary Fund, are amongst those now boycotting the summit. On Thursday Donald Trump told reporters it ""certainly looks"" like Mr Khashoggi is dead, adding ""it's very sad"". He said there would be ""very severe"" consequences if Saudi Arabia was proved to have killed the journalist. However, Mr Trump has also been accused of providing cover to the Saudi government. He previously said he would not cancel military contracts with Saudi Arabia because ""I don't want to hurt jobs"", and also said he was unhappy Saudi Arabia was being treated as ""guilty until proven innocent"". Russian President Vladimir Putin has said it is a pity that Mr Khashoggi has gone missing, but that Russia cannot damage relations with Saudi Arabia without hard facts. Hatice Cengiz said she waited outside the consulate for 11 hours, but did not see her fiancÃ© Mr Khashoggi is a prominent journalist who has covered major stories for various Saudi news organisations. He served as an adviser to top Saudi officials, but later fell out of favour with the government. He went into self-imposed exile in the US last year, and wrote a monthly column in the Washington Post. On Thursday,the Washington Post published Mr Khashoggi's latest column,external- a call for press freedom across the Arab world. The newspaper said the column had been submitted by Mr Khashoggi's translator the day after he was reported missing. It had initially held off from publishing the column, but decided to go ahead after accepting Mr Khashoggi was not going to return safely. In his column, Mr Khashoggi criticised the state of press freedom in the Arab world, saying it left Saudis ""either uninformed or misinformed"". Government moves to suppress journalists ""no longer carry the consequence of a backlash from the international community"", he wrote.

But realising this was ""not going to happen"", it was decided to publish the column. In it, Mr Khashoggi - who went into self-imposed exile last year after reportedly being warned by Saudi officials to stop criticising the crown prince's policies - presented a strong criticism of the state of press freedom in the Arab world, which, he claimed, leaves its people ""either uninformed or misinformed"".

"Avril (left) and Peter Griffiths denied a string of charges from the 1980s and 90s A husband and wife who raped and indecently assaulted young girls have been given lengthy jail terms. Peter Griffiths, 65, was sentenced to 21 years and Avril Griffiths, 61, was sentenced to 15 years. Cardiff Crown Court heard the couple - dubbed ""the Fred and Rose West"" of their Barry estate in the Vale of Glamorgan - abused girls on a boat and at home in the 1980s and 1990s. Judge Jeremy Jenkins said the couple had ""few if any sexual boundaries"". During the trial, claims were made that police officers were present when a young girl was raped on a boat while others watched. South Wales Police said it was investigating after allegations of contact between officers and Peter Griffiths were reported. 'A partnership in sexual exploitation' Police present at boat rape, court told Accused pair 'like Fred and Rose West' It comes after the court heard how the couple ""destroyed"" the lives of their three victims. In a statement, one woman, who cannot be identified, said: ""I feel what has happened to me has destroyed my life, they destroyed my childhood. ""I blamed myself for a long time. The abuse has affected my mental health all my life."" She said she was constantly scared she was going to be attacked, and that she had turned to heroin because it ""numbed my emotions"". Some of the abuse took place at the couple's home in Barry ""I do not think I will escape the abuse I suffered at the hands of them,"" she added. Another victim said she had tried to take her own life in the past because of the abuse, and that she had ""never felt able to tell anyone what happened"". She said she was still ""fighting demons"", had been a heroin user and was ""frightened of relapsing into a life I left behind"". The Griffiths' third victim said: ""I'm so scared because when Peter raped me I felt powerless. I have flashbacks, with him on top of me and her next to me, it's a recurring nightmare."" The couple'sabuse took place throughout 1980s and 90s, where Peter Griffiths used his wife, who is deemed to have a low IQ, as ""bait"" to lure young girls to him so he could rape them. Attacks took place in their home, on a boat and in the back of a van, while on one occasion Mrs Griffiths held a girl down telling her it ""wouldn't hurt"" as her husband raped her. One of their victims described them as the""Fred and Rose West"" of their housing estate. Peter and Avril Griffiths were described by police as depraved and sadistic Det Sgt David Rich said: ""Today's sentences reflect the gravity of the crimes which have been committed by Peter and Avril Griffiths. This couple who were responsible for appalling abuse have now been brought to justice. ""I would like to commend the three victims in this case who have shown immense strength and courage throughout the investigation and court proceedings.  I hope today's sentence provides some closure for them and their families as they attempt to move forward with their lives. ""Survivors of abuse by predators like Peter and Avril Griffiths deserve to see them brought to justice and we are determined to do all we can to help them."" Det Ch Insp Justin Evans said: ""Following the convictions of Peter and Avril Griffiths, two people have reported allegations of non-recent sexual offences to police. ""We are investigating these allegations and they are being supported by specially trained officers."" Peter Griffiths was found guilty of eight offences of rape, two of taking an indecent photograph of a child and three of indecent assault. His wife was found guilty of five offences of rape, two of taking an indecent photograph of a child and two of indecent assault.

"This video can not be played The Duchess of Sussex received a tiara from one little girl They say when in Rome, do as the Romans do. And the Duchess of Sussex did just that by trying her hand at Aussie Rules football in Melbourne. Meghan tossed the oval ball during a reception held for her and Prince Harry on the third day of their tour of Australia and New Zealand. It was part of a sporting demonstration for the This Girl Can campaign. Thousands of people turned out to see the couple, who recently announced they are expecting a baby. Prince Harry and Meghan abandoned their strict schedule and instead spent 25 minutes meeting royal fans. Some members of the crowd gave the parents-to-be presents for their unborn child, including 10-year-old Courtney Pistone. She gave Meghan a large Teddy bear. ""I gave it to her for the nursery,"" she said. ""I thought it would be suitable because we didn't know if it was a boy or a girl and both boys and girls like bears."" Some members of the crowd sang Stand By Me - a song the couple chose for their wedding service in May. The duke and duchess then went on to a reception at Government House. During a fitness display by 150 women, Meghan was convinced to throw an Australian Football League (AFL) game ball as part of the This Girl Can campaign, a Sport England initiative licensed to Vic Health in Australia. ""I'm not sure I will be good,"" she said, before giving it a go. ""I'm not sure I did it right!"" she added. Jerril Rechter, who showed the couple around, said: ""She did pass an AFL football. She did a handball. That's a pretty incredible thing for anybody to do."" During another demonstration, Meghan got a shock when a group of school children demonstrated a miniature F1 race track.

"A case of BSE - so-called mad cow disease - has been confirmed at a farm in Aberdeenshire. BBC Scotland understands the ""isolated"" case involves a beef herd in the Huntly area. Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said a movement ban was now in place on the unnamed farm. Investigations are under way to identify the origin of the disease - the first in Scotland in a decade - which was found after an animal died. What you need to know about BSE The case involving a five-year-old animal was identified before entering the human food chain. Four others from the herd were being destroyed as a precaution. There are understood to have been16 cases in the UK since 2011,external, with the last in 2015 whenfarming officials confirmed a case of BSE in Carmarthenshire, Wales. That was discovered following routine tests carried out when a farm animal dies. The monitoring of BSE has been an important function since the crisis of 1986 when 180,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million slaughtered in order to eradicate the disease in the UK. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a brain disorder in cattle that can be transmitted to humans who eat infected meat. Mad cow disease - as it is more commonly known, because of the animals' erratic behaviour and movements - destroys their brains by eating away the nerve tissue. The first recorded case in the UK was in 1986. About 180,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million slaughtered in order to eradicate the disease. There was nationwide alarm following the confirmation of the first deaths caused by transmission of BSE to humans in 1996. At the time there were fears that hundreds of thousands of people might die as a result of eating infected beef. As it turned out 178 people have died of the human form of mad cow disease, known as Variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD).  It is believed that these individuals were genetically more sensitive to succumbing to the disease than the wider population. Since then, cattle are closely monitored for signs of the disease and it seems that, in this instance, the surveillance system has worked well. The cause is not known at this stage. But if it is an isolated case there is very little if any risk to human health. According to Prof Matthew Baylis, Chair of Veterinary Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, ""BSE in cattle in the UK is largely over but there is still the odd detected case - one in 2014, two in 2015 and now one in 2018. It is too early to say if this case is significant"". On the Aberdeenshire case, Scotland's Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: ""I would urge any farmer who has concerns to seek veterinary advice."" She added: ""While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. ""We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question."" Andrew McCornick, president of NFU Scotland, said: ""It is disappointing to learn of this BSE case within the Aberdeenshire area."" He added: ""Whilst we lose ournegligible risk status, it is not unexpected to see a new case and demonstrates the efficacy of the surveillance measures in place. This simply brings us back in line with the rest of Great Britain, reverting back to where we were 18 months ago. ""When Scotland applied for BSE negligible risk status it was with the full knowledge that there was every possibility of a sporadic case of BSE emerging as has been the case in France and Ireland."" Ian McWatt, director of operations in Food Standards Scotland, said that there were strict rules in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed. Although the BSE case in Scotland is significant, the industry is genuinely not concerned about any immediate impact. Movement restrictions only apply to the farm identified. Unlike in the 1980s and 90s, the disease is more clearly understood.  There have long been cases of BSE and there will continue to be so. But the practice of feeding infected meat and bonemeal back to the cattle was what led to the rapid acceleration in numbers which became the crisis. Some of the most recent cases are a legacy of that - the offspring of older cattle. But the Aberdeenshire case is in a five-year-old animal and so it is likely that it was just predisposed to the condition. A lot has changed since the BSE crisis. Brain and spinal cord no longer enter the food chain and there's a more rigorous process for monitoring. So the risk to human health is virtually nil. And it is not a condition that can be passed from animal to animal, other than through birth. The biggest concern is in international confidence. BSE has long been a barrier to exporting beef as other countries did not want anything to do with nations where there had been cases. It has been a decade since the last case in Scotland.  A country is classed as 'negligible risk' 11 years after the birth of the last known case and that status was achieved in 2016.  This latest case takes them back a step but only to the same level as the rest of the UK. But with Brexit on the horizon - and wider trade deals being a big part of that - there are fears that this will be a barrier to entering new markets.

"Shocked mourners gathered at a makeshift shrine at the college The deadly gun and bomb attack on a college in Crimea ""appears to be a result of globalisation"", Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. ""On social media, on the internet, we see the creation of entire communities. Everything started with the tragic events in schools in the US,"" he said. Fifteen students and five teachers were killed in Wednesday's attack on the technical college in Kerch. Officials named the killer as Vladislav Roslyakov, 18, who took his own life. He was a fourth-year student at the college in the city in Crimea - the southern peninsula annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014. Crimea profile On Wednesday, a huge nail-bomb blast ripped through the college's cafeteria, before the killer stormed through the building, shooting people at close range with a pump-action hunting rifle.

It said doors and windows were shattered in the entrance hall and on the first floor, above the cafeteria. Some students leapt out of the building from a height of 5m (16ft 5in). Investigators later said they had found a second explosive device among the gunman's possessions and that it had been disarmed. He was also reported to have several packs of bullets and home-made petrol bombs. BBC Russian spoke to witnesses, including Igor Zakharevsky.

There have been five attacks in schools in Russia this year where a number of children were injured. In Kerch, questions are already being asked: how did Vladislav Roslyakov manage to obtain a licence for a hunting weapon? And how was he able to launch such a deadly attack on his college? His precise motives remain unclear. But there are suggestions the fourth-year student had developed a hostile attitude to the college. Russia's RBC TV interviewed a friend who said Roslyakov ""hated the technical school very much"" and had vowed ""revenge"" on his teachers. Russian soldiers were deployed outside the school It has emerged that he obtained a gun licence when he was 17. His parents are divorced. Classmates said Roslyakov was very reserved and had long ago stopped using social networks. College teacher Olga Mikhailichenko said he was ""a hard-working student, very quiet"".

"This video can not be played What is the 'Dutch reach'? Measures to help protect cyclists, including encouraging people to adopt the ""Dutch reach"", are expected to be included in the new Highway Code. The method of opening a car door using the hand furthest from the handle forces drivers to turn and look behind them for passing cyclists. The code will also give updated guidance on how to avoid the dangers of close overtaking of cyclists. Cycling UK said the move was a major step for cycle safety. In 2017 101 cyclists died in road traffic collisions. The announcement was welcomed by Jeff Boulton,whose son Sam died after being hit by the door of a taxi while cycling in Leicester in July 2016. He was knocked off his bike, and fell into the path of a moving van. His father said he was relieved the government was planning to update its guidance. ""If only one person is saved from Sam's tragic fate because the driver or passenger has adopted the Dutch reach... then that's a life worth saving,"" he said. Cyclist Sam Boulton died after being hit by the door of a taxi Duncan Dollimore, head of campaigns at Cycling UK, which has campaigned for changes to the Highway Code, said he was delighted by the announcement. ""Close overtakes and people opening car doors in front of cyclists are not only dangerous, they also put people off riding a bike,"" he said. Rule 163 of the Highway Code states that when passing cyclists, drivers should give ""as much room as you would when overtaking a car"". Cycling UK is calling for the code to include guidance on a minimum distance to give when overtaking, suggesting a minimum of 1.5m when travelling under 30mph and 2m over 30mph. The organisation also recommends the code should require vehicles to give way to pedestrians and cyclists when turning. It also wants rules advising cyclists to wear helmets and fluorescent clothing to be changed, arguing they currently promote ""victim-blaming"" and deflect responsibility from drivers in the case of collisions if the cyclist does not follow this advice. Cycling and walking minister Jesse Norman said that while Britain had ""some of the safest roads in the world"" there was still more to be done to protect cyclists, pedestrians and other vulnerable road users. ""Cycling and walking are increasingly being understood as crucial parts of an integrated approach to issues of health, obesity, air quality and town and city planning. ""But this will only happen if people feel safe on the roads,"" he said. Highways England has also announced a Â£3m contract with Sustrans to improve the National Cycle Network.

"A picture from the Ending the Harm campaign after a young boy is driven to an ""appointment"" In a packed Belfast hall, there is a silence as a set of new TV and radio adverts are given their first public airing. They are chilling. The screams of a young lad, lying on the floor, calling for his mother after being shot in the knees, are difficult to listen to. This is a radical step by authorities. The adverts have been commissioned by the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland. The decision to run this type of hard-hitting campaign - which is bidding to end so-called paramilitary-style attacks - was not taken lightly. Paramilitaries 'just organised criminals' Man shot four times in paramilitary style attack New film focuses on mother's impossible choice ""Paramilitary-style attacks are what we, in Northern Ireland, call vicious shootings and beatings given out to individuals by so-called paramilitaries,"" said Anthony Harbinson, chairman of the Tackling Paramilitarism Board. There have been 87 such attacks over the past year, he said, often on young people. ""These paramilitaries style themselves as protectors of communities. They would like to see themselves as a second police force, dealing with individuals within their communities, who have stepped outside the law,"" he added. The adverts show a reconstruction. A tearful mother drives her son to an appointment, in which he is to be shot in both legs by masked men. ""Again!"" comes the order, as you hear the second shot fired into the back of the crying man's knee. ""Paramilitaries don't protect you. They control you"" is the accompanying slogan. This video can not be played The ad tells the story from the points of view of those involved - the victim, his mother, the gunmen and a witness. The adverts will be given significant exposure, running on TV and radio across Northern Ireland and in cinemas - it is an unprecedented step. They will be deliberately aired straight after widely-watched programmes such as The Great British Bake Off on Channel 4. The scenes are played by actors, but for some in Northern Ireland living in fear of violence is a reality. One young man, who says he is under threat from paramilitaries, described his situation through youth workers who are supporting him. His identity has been protected. ""The paramilitaries put the word out that I needed sorted. I got kicked out of school because they said I was a risk to the other kids,"" he said. ""They said they were 'protecting the estate' from me. My family tried to speak to them but they didn't want to know. ""I'm trying to change and do better but I'm always on edge, always looking over my shoulder, waiting for it to happen. A survey found that 35% of people believe these attacks are justified. ""I want to live back at home with my ma, but I can't. I can't let her see me get beaten by hammers or shot."" In Northern Ireland this is not only a criminal justice issue, but a battle for hearts and minds. A survey carried out by the Tackling Paramilitarism Board found that 35% of people believe these attacks are justified. ""The 35% isn't who you might think it is,"" said community worker Paul Smyth. ""I've had youth workers, teachers, civil servants, tell me privately that actually they're OK with these attacks, that they sort out local problems. I also think our politicians have been pretty woeful at speaking out about this."" Authorities hope the campaign will help end ""tacit endorsement"" of these crimes. But in Northern Ireland, some attitudes are deeply ingrained. ""People don't care if these attacks work,"" explained Debbie Watters, who works with Alternatives, an organisation that helps those under threat. ""All people care about is that they've got revenge or vengeance. They don't care if it changes the person's behaviour."" ""The sole aim is instant, visible, vengeance and justice. Then they feel this has worked for them."" She wants to see criminal justice measures made more effective and visible. Paramilitaries were once involved in armed campaigns, but now say authorities, they are simply criminal gangs. Communities are still rebuilding following the 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles. ""What are authorities doing to help the young people who become the victims of these attacks?"" asks Stephen Hughes, a youth worker who has himself been subject to threats for speaking out. ""There is not enough support for these young people when it is needed."" He and some others are sceptical of the authorities' current approach. The police said the attacks were a ""throwback to another time"" Intimidation and threats mean victims and witnesses are unlikely to give evidence, so convictions for these so-called punishment attacks are rare. It is hoped that the campaign will help to change that. ""This is un-normal, and unnecessary in 2018,"" said Det Ch Supt Raymond Murray from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). He added: ""It is throwback to another time. We can't have people shooting and beating people in houses and streets, as some sort of pseudo police force."" ""We should not attach justice to this sort of activity. It is gratification."" Police have said they are clamping down on the gangs in other ways. Recently, explained Det Ch Supt Murray, there have been large drug seizures, and confiscation orders for cars, houses and cash - luxury items that the bosses of these organisations enjoy. But authorities believe the solution to this does not only rest with policing. ""Why do some people go to these gangsters and ask them to mete out justice?"" asked Mr Harbinson. Communities are still rebuilding following the 30-year conflict in Northern Ireland known as 'the Troubles' ""We have to get it through to the community that police will not solve this alone. We have to take a societal approach in changing what people perceive is right and wrong."" No-one is quite sure what the response to the emotive advert campaign will be. It may be a risky approach, but those behind the campaign believe it is justified. ""We want to ask people to ask themselves, why is this happening in my community? And is this being done in my name?"" said Mr Harbinson. If community support for paramilitaries ends, the theory is, so will the attacks.

"Shocked mourners gathered at a makeshift shrine at the college The deadly gun and bomb attack on a college in Crimea ""appears to be a result of globalisation"", Russian President Vladimir Putin has said. ""On social media, on the internet, we see the creation of entire communities. Everything started with the tragic events in schools in the US,"" he said. Fifteen students and five teachers were killed in Wednesday's attack on the technical college in Kerch. Officials named the killer as Vladislav Roslyakov, 18, who took his own life. He was a fourth-year student at the college in the city in Crimea - the southern peninsula annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014. Crimea profile On Wednesday, a huge nail-bomb blast ripped through the college's cafeteria, before the killer stormed through the building, shooting people at close range with a pump-action hunting rifle. Russian Health Minister Veronika Skvortsova said the explosion from a home-made device had showered people with shrapnel. ""Some victims' internal organs were ruptured, we're finding washers and ballbearings in their livers, intestines, blood vessels,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Members of Tenby sailing club enjoy a close look at a pod of dolphins A group of young sailors had the perfect climax to their summer with a rare close encounter with bottlenose dolphins. Junior members of Tenby Sailing Club were out enjoying their last club night of the season, off the west Wales coast, when they were joined by a small pod of playful dolphins. The mammals are often seen in these waters, but rarely so close. Instructor Max Richards said: ""None of us had seen anything like that before."" At first the sailors saw movement in the water and presumed it was seals - a common sight off the coast of Tenby. However they were treated to a display of aerial acrobatics by the dolphins that is rarely seen this close. ""The kids were ecstatic,"" said assistant instructor Max Richards, who caught the encounter on his phone. The dolphins brushed alongside the dinghies and stayed jumping and splashing around the boats for more than a quarter of an hour. It was an experience the children will never forget. ""It was our last junior sailing evening of the season, just an informal session thrown onto the end,"" said Mr Maxwell. ""There were a few people who didn't go, who really wished afterwards they had."" The young sailors stayed out in the water until it became too dark to safely carry on. Mr Richards added: ""It was an incredible experience for everyone involved, the sort of thing people pay a lot of money to see, and it just happened out of the blue for us.""

"Food sales saw their steepest drop in three years in September as consumers tightened their belts after the unusually hot summer, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has said. Sales of food were down 1.5% in the month, contributing to a 0.8% fall in total UK retail sales. The ONS said,externalsales continued to grow in the quarter to September, boosted by online shopping and sales of jewellery. But it said the slowdown in food sales had been ""stark"". It follows the joint hottest summer on record - also boosted by the World Cup in June and July - which saw consumers splash out on food, drink and barbecues. However, recent surveys from both the British Retail Consortium and Barclaycard indicated that households began to rein in their spending as temperatures cooled in September. The ONS said falls had been spread across supermarkets and smaller stores, although other areas of retail suffered too. Cheaper food drives UK inflation lower UK wage growth fastest for nearly 10 years Why the UK has such cheap food Spending was down at petrol stations in September and flat at non-food stores, it said. Annual growth in total retail sales also slowed to 3%, despite economists' predictions of an increase - although the ONS said this still marked ""strong growth"". Ian Gilmartin, from Barclays Corporate Banking, said: ""Although the dip in food sales from August is eye-catching, it was expected given the exceptional performance achieved over the summer and shouldn't cause undue concern. ""Any growth is significant given the plethora of challenges facing retailers - they are being hit from all sides, with business rates, the continued weakness of sterling and persisting uncertainty around Brexit combining to thwart investment and push up costs."" But Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, was more pessimistic. ""It looks like consumer spending - along with the weather - peaked in early summer and has been declining ever since. Where we go from here is highly uncertain."" The figures come a day after the ONS said that cheaper food prices had driven down inflation in September to 2.4% from a six-month high of 2.7% in August.

Last summer Bunton was a judge on the ABC talent show Boy Band. But she said moving to cover baking for US TV has meant a bit of translation of terminology.

"Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has riled some MPs after appearing to suggest Parliament might not get a so-called ""meaningful vote"" on any deal. Some MPs want the right to amend whatever Theresa May eventually comes back with, but Mr Raab hinted it may only be a ""take it or leave it"" choice. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg says it's a ""big fat row waiting to happen"". Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn accused Mr Raab of ""arrogance"" and said MPs must have the chance to amend the deal. The argument erupted as Theresa Maystruggled to make progress with the EU in Brussels on Wednesday. Dominic Grieve, the Tory MP who led the calls for a meaningful vote, demanded a ""very rapid assurance"" from the government that the Commons will be able to amend any potential Brexit deal. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom, who is in charge of scheduling debates, said ""anything other than a straightforward approval of the deal"" would create uncertainty for businesses and might mean the government can't ratify it. Theresa May brokered a deal with Tory rebels in June In June, the government's EU (Withdrawal) Bill was set to be defeated in the House of Commons by a group of Tory rebels. They demanded Parliament get the final say on any deal brokered with Brussels - and have the power to send the UK's Brexit negotiators back to the table to try again. Downing Street complained this would ""bind"" the prime minister's hands, and change the constitutional balance between government and Parliament in foreign policy and treaty matters. But leader of the rebels, former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, said the ""sovereignty of Parliament"" had to be acknowledged. A compromise was eventually reached - after assurances were accepted by would-be rebels that MPs would have a meaningful say. Both sides claimed victory. In response to a letter,externalfrom Tory MP Charles Walker, who chairs the Commons Procedure Committee, Mr Raab indicated the vote should be a simple Yes-or-No verdict on whatever deal was brought back. ""Anything other than a straightforward approval of the deal will bring with it huge uncertainty for business, consumers and citizens."" Is it deal or no-deal basically then? Well, No 10 sources have insisted the Commons motion on any final Brexit deal would be amendable, but the BBC's political editor says it's possible the government might ask MPs to approve or reject a deal before they have a chance to amend it. Leader of the Tory rebels Dominic Grieve has demanded a ""very rapid response"" from Downing Street Mr Grieve has demanded a ""very rapid"" clarification from Downing Street, saying the Brexit secretary's letter was ""completely incompatible"" with what the government had told him in the summer. Staunch Remainer Ken Clarke told BBC Newsnight the government ""won't get away"" with a ""take it or leave it vote"". ""Parliament is going to insist on using its proper authority,"" he added. Fellow Conservative Anna Soubry urged MPs to ""stand up to this outrage"". Labour MPs, too, are unhappy. Leader Jeremy Corbyn described Mr Raab's letter as ""a supreme piece of arrogance. ""He writes to Parliament - writes, rather than turns up - and says you can only have one vote on what we put forward. ""Sorry, we're all elected parliamentarians, there's 650 of us, we all have ideas. ""Surely, there should be a serious and proper debate and the opportunity to amend what the government has put forward."" Commons leader Andrea Leadsom insisted MPs would get the final say on whether the motion can be amended, but she urged them to ""consider the question that will, in reality, be before the United Kingdom and that is whether or not to accept the deal that the government has negotiated with the European Union"". Pressed to say whether or not MPs could amend the deal, Mrs Leadsom said: ""Anything other than a straightforward approval of the deal would lead to great uncertainty to businesses and citizens because any changes might mean that the government is not in a position to ratify the deal.""

"A case of BSE - so-called mad cow disease - has been confirmed at a farm in Aberdeenshire. BBC Scotland understands the ""isolated"" case involves a beef herd in the Huntly area. Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said a movement ban was now in place on the unnamed farm. Investigations are under way to identify the origin of the disease - the first in Scotland in a decade - which was found after an animal died. What you need to know about BSE The case involving a five-year-old animal was identified before entering the human food chain. Four others from the herd were being destroyed as a precaution. There are understood to have been16 cases in the UK since 2011,external, with the last in 2015 whenfarming officials confirmed a case of BSE in Carmarthenshire, Wales. That was discovered following routine tests carried out when a farm animal dies. The monitoring of BSE has been an important function since the crisis of 1986 when 180,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million slaughtered in order to eradicate the disease in the UK. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) is a brain disorder in cattle that can be transmitted to humans who eat infected meat. Mad cow disease - as it is more commonly known, because of the animals' erratic behaviour and movements - destroys their brains by eating away the nerve tissue. The first recorded case in the UK was in 1986. About 180,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million slaughtered in order to eradicate the disease. There was nationwide alarm following the confirmation of the first deaths caused by transmission of BSE to humans in 1996. At the time there were fears that hundreds of thousands of people might die as a result of eating infected beef. As it turned out 178 people have died of the human form of mad cow disease, known as Variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD).  It is believed that these individuals were genetically more sensitive to succumbing to the disease than the wider population. Since then, cattle are closely monitored for signs of the disease and it seems that, in this instance, the surveillance system has worked well. The cause is not known at this stage. But if it is an isolated case there is very little if any risk to human health. According to Prof Matthew Baylis, Chair of Veterinary Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, ""BSE in cattle in the UK is largely over but there is still the odd detected case - one in 2014, two in 2015 and now one in 2018. It is too early to say if this case is significant"". On the Aberdeenshire case, Scotland's Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said: ""I would urge any farmer who has concerns to seek veterinary advice."" She added: ""While it is too early to tell where the disease came from in this case, its detection is proof that our surveillance system is doing its job. ""We are working closely with the Animal and Plant Health Agency to answer this question."" Andrew McCornick, president of NFU Scotland, said: ""It is disappointing to learn of this BSE case within the Aberdeenshire area."" He added: ""Whilst we lose ournegligible risk status, it is not unexpected to see a new case and demonstrates the efficacy of the surveillance measures in place. This simply brings us back in line with the rest of Great Britain, reverting back to where we were 18 months ago. ""When Scotland applied for BSE negligible risk status it was with the full knowledge that there was every possibility of a sporadic case of BSE emerging as has been the case in France and Ireland."" Ian McWatt, director of operations in Food Standards Scotland, said that there were strict rules in place to protect consumers from the risk of BSE, including controls on animal feed. Although the BSE case in Scotland is significant, the industry is genuinely not concerned about any immediate impact. Movement restrictions only apply to the farm identified. Unlike in the 1980s and 90s, the disease is more clearly understood.  There have long been cases of BSE and there will continue to be so. But the practice of feeding infected meat and bonemeal back to the cattle was what led to the rapid acceleration in numbers which became the crisis. Some of the most recent cases are a legacy of that - the offspring of older cattle. But the Aberdeenshire case is in a five-year-old animal and so it is likely that it was just predisposed to the condition. A lot has changed since the BSE crisis. Brain and spinal cord no longer enter the food chain and there's a more rigorous process for monitoring. So the risk to human health is virtually nil. And it is not a condition that can be passed from animal to animal, other than through birth. The biggest concern is in international confidence. BSE has long been a barrier to exporting beef as other countries did not want anything to do with nations where there had been cases. It has been a decade since the last case in Scotland.  A country is classed as 'negligible risk' 11 years after the birth of the last known case and that status was achieved in 2016.  This latest case takes them back a step but only to the same level as the rest of the UK. But with Brexit on the horizon - and wider trade deals being a big part of that - there are fears that this will be a barrier to entering new markets.

"James Atherley was jailed for a minimum term of 26 years Anonymous crime reporting service Crimestoppers is busier than ever. Almost half of those who contact it are under 35, and one in five is from black or minority ethnic groups. Why is that? When 20-year-old Callum Lees died after being stabbed in the neck his killer went on the run. Detectives soon suspected that the man responsible for the murder - in Solihull in August 2017 - was 21-year-old James Atherley. They launched a manhunt and asked Crimestoppers for help. The 30-year-old charity - which enables people to pass on crime information without revealing their identity - posted an image of Atherley on the ""Most Wanted"" page of its website. Several weeks later, Crimestoppers was contacted by someone who thought they'd seen a man resembling him at a nightclub where he'd been in an argument. The club was 200 miles away in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. ""It was a key part of the jigsaw that led to the police arresting James Atherley,"" says Mark Hallas, Crimestoppers' chief executive. Twelve months later, Atherley was convicted of Callum's murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, with a 26-year minimum term. Callum Lees was found collapsed in a street It's rare for Crimestoppers to trumpet its successes because it can't risk compromising the guarantee of anonymity that it provides to everyone who gets in contact. Imagine a crime where a vital piece of information or the identify of a suspect is known by only a handful of people. If it emerged that the details had been passed to Crimestoppers the perpetrator could find out who'd ""grassed"" on them. Indeed, Crimestoppers goes to great lengths to ensure that no-one knows where the information it receives has come from. No records are kept of the personal details, phone numbers or computer IP addresses of anyone who makes contact.  It emphasises that it operates independently of, and in a different way from, the police. Mr Hallas says that partly explains why Crimestoppers is used by hundreds of thousands of young people and those from black and minority ethnic (BME) communities. Mark Hallas said some people find it difficult to talk to the police ""Surveys we've carried out indicate that there's a hardcore of about 20% of people who find it very difficult to talk to the police directly under any circumstances - but many of those people want to do the right thing and we provide the avenue to let them do that,"" says Mr Hallas, a former brigadier whose 30-year military career included a spell in charge of Army intelligence. And the attraction of Crimestoppers appears to be growing. Between July 2017 and June 2018, the organisation passed on 152,000 reports to police across the UK - up 6% on the previous year and 33% on 2015/16. The increase is thought to be partly due to more Crimestoppers awareness campaigns and a simpler online reporting service. But it also seems to reflect the overall rise in offences recorded by police in England and Wales - as well as problems people have reaching the police non-emergency number, 101. ""There is in some parts of the country an element of frustration with 101,"" says Mr Hallas. ""They know if they call us they will be answered pretty quickly."" Some 60% of the reports Crimestoppers sends to police forces - 92,000 cases - are drugs-related. Typically, they're sightings of dealers in cars or on street corners, details of cannabis factories, or intelligence about so-called county lines networks - the city-based gangs that supply drugs to rural areas and seaside towns. Last year, reports on drugs increased by 10%. ""People do see an awful lot of drug-dealing taking place, it's also drug manufacturing, and therefore it affects the fabric of their life and destroys their communities in many respects and so we get a disproportionately large amount of information in that area, and it's also linked to many other crimes as well,"" Mr Hallas says. About two-thirds of the calls and online messages Crimestoppers receives at its contact centre in Godstone, Surrey, don't contain useful information and aren't forwarded to police. Staff are aware of the pressures forces are under and don't want to waste their time. But the information contained in 144,000 reports passed on in 2016-17 led to 3,300 people being arrested and charged; 16,700 dealt with in other ways, such as informal warnings; Â£7.4m worth of drugs seized and property valued at Â£814,000 recovered. Nevertheless, the true impact of Crimestoppers is hard to measure because police don't always record what happens to the information they receive. But with forces facing rising demand at a time of stretched resources, it's difficult to imagine how they'd cope without the service, which runs on a budget of Â£5m and includes a network of 400 volunteers. Without Crimestoppers those seeking justice for the murder of Callum Lees might still be waiting.

"This video can not be played Members of Tenby sailing club enjoy a close look at a pod of dolphins A group of young sailors had the perfect climax to their summer with a rare close encounter with bottlenose dolphins. Junior members of Tenby Sailing Club were out enjoying their last club night of the season, off the west Wales coast, when they were joined by a small pod of playful dolphins. The mammals are often seen in these waters, but rarely so close. Instructor Max Richards said: ""None of us had seen anything like that before."" At first the sailors saw movement in the water and presumed it was seals - a common sight off the coast of Tenby. However they were treated to a display of aerial acrobatics by the dolphins that is rarely seen this close. ""The kids were ecstatic,"" said assistant instructor Max Richards, who caught the encounter on his phone. The dolphins brushed alongside the dinghies and stayed jumping and splashing around the boats for more than a quarter of an hour. It was an experience the children will never forget. ""It was our last junior sailing evening of the season, just an informal session thrown onto the end,"" said Mr Maxwell. ""There were a few people who didn't go, who really wished afterwards they had."" The young sailors stayed out in the water until it became too dark to safely carry on. Mr Richards added: ""It was an incredible experience for everyone involved, the sort of thing people pay a lot of money to see, and it just happened out of the blue for us.""

"Parents in Wales owed more than Â£400,000 in unpaid school dinner debts at the end of last year, figures have shown. In seven Welsh authorities, the debt has leapt by nearly 90% in the space of five years. Rowan Davies, of website Mumsnet, said schools should offer ""flexibility"" to avoid parents feeling ""embarrassed"". The Welsh Local Government Association has been asked to comment. Last month, Denbighshire Council defended its policy on dinner debts, after a single mother said she was threatened with referral to social services when she was late paying a Â£13 bill. Free school meal rules to change in Wales 'Pale and hungry' pupils stuff pockets with food Poverty stigma of free meals Damien Challenger has witnessed it from both sides of the table - as one the people behind the teaching network Nexus Education - and as parent. As a parent, he received a text over a Â£2 debt for a meal. ""I think sometimes the language used in these texts to parents can be quite abrasive and it puts a parent on the defensive rather than wanting to communicate with the school they might have issues,"" he said. Damien Challenger said schools and councils need to think about how they tackle the school dinner debt with families Councils have different policies on how long a child will be allowed to accrue debts before lunch is withheld, what alternative is offered and how debts are recovered. In many cases, the action taken is up to individual schools, with debts over a certain size transferred to their local authority to recover. In Wrexham's primary schools pupils are allowed a five-day overdraft facility before they are refused a meal, with debts over Â£25 referred to debt collectors. In Carmarthenshire, the limit is Â£30, with reminders being sent and it is Â£50 in Conwy. Blaenau Gwent: Â£5,771.94 Carmarthenshire: Â£61,011 Ceredigion: Â£38,190.46 Cardiff: Â£9,078 Conwy: Â£26,192.20 Denbighshire: Â£46,731.27 Gwynedd: Â£85,589.47 Merthyr Tydfil Â£46,575. 48 Monmouthshire: Â£11,052 Newport: Â£17,171 Powys: Â£46,164.55 Rhondda Cynon Taf: Â£770.56 Swansea: Â£18,600 Torfaen: Â£4,782.16 As of March 2017-18 Hot meals are ""stopped"" in Denbighshire after a debt reaches Â£20, with children offered a sandwich and a cold drink instead. In Pembrokeshire, there is no limit to the number of meals a child can receive while in arrears, although debts there will be passed on to collectors after a month without payment. The highest debts were recorded by Gwynedd  - with one school alone topping Â£18,000. The council said schools sent out two reminders in the month if parents provide no explanation for non-payment, then the debt is transferred to the council and the families are invoiced within 28 days. Rowan Davies, head of policy and campaigns at Mumsnet, said: ""I think flexibility around cash payments [would be helpful]. ""There might be times of the month where parents are able to pay for school dinners, there might be times where they need to switch to packed lunches. ""Something a lot of parents find difficult is going to the school secretary. You don't necessarily want to go and tell that person you're struggling with money."" Rowan Davies, Mumsnet's head of policy and campaigns, said there needs to be more flexibility around payments Online and banking payment systems are in place or being rolled out across most of Wales, eliminating the need for children to bring cash into school. The ParentPay system is used at Osbaston Church in Wales Primary School in Monmouth, means ""less chasing"" for debt head teacher Catherine Jones said. ""We would always be there to support; we would never at any point deny a child a school meal,"" she added.

"Baby boxes are being promoted as a safe alternative to standard cots, bassinets and Moses baskets despite a lack of evidence on their safety, experts warn. The cardboard boxes, which come with items like clothes and blankets and can be used as a bed, are offered to new mums in Scotland and parts of England. The Royal College of Midwives wants the scheme rolled out across the UK, saying it offers a ""more equal start to life"". But experts have raised concerns about how safe the boxes are to sleep in. Writing in a letter to the BMJ,external, Prof Peter Blair and colleagues say that, as the evidence stands, the boxes should only be used as a temporary bed if nothing else is available. Baby box scheme rolled out across Scotland Do baby boxes really save lives? The boxes, which come with a mattress, have routinely been given to every expectant mother in Finland since the 1930s. Scotland started offering the free boxes to new parents last year, while some NHS Trusts in England have had pilot and full schemes in place for up to two years. The boxes are not offered by health bodies in Wales or Northern Ireland. The Royal College of Midwives says the boxes can reduce the likelihood of babies sleeping unsafely, either on a surface like a sofa or with parents who smoke, drink alcohol, or take drugs, and would particularly benefit those born into deprived environments. However, Prof Blair and colleagues, including representatives of the cot death charity Lullaby Trust, said there was a lack of evidence into how safe the boxes are for sleeping in. Compared with cots, bassinets and Moses baskets, it is harder for parents to see their babies easily when they are sleeping in them, they warned. And some boxes, particularly those that are not laminated, may potentially be flammable or leave babies more vulnerable to pets and young siblings if they are kept on the floor. They are also too small for most babies older than three months and there is no evidence on how durable they are, particularly if they become wet or dirty. Prof Blair, from the University of Bristol, told the BBC: ""One of the things we've been encouraging in the last 25 years is just a bit more closer contact, closer observation. Forget this idea of having infants in a separate room early on. ""Always have the infant in a cot by the parental bed in that room. During day-time sleeps, if the infant wants a nap, try and have the parent in the same room as the infant while that's occurring. ""It's just this idea of observation just in case they get into difficulties. Sometimes you might not be able to do anything about it, sometimes you can, that's what we've encouraged."" Prof Blair said he thought baby boxes went ""slightly against that"" because they made it harder for parents to keep an eye on their sleeping babies. Moses baskets, cots and bassinets are preferable to baby boxes and also have to meet recognised UK safety standards, he said. This video can not be played What's inside Scotland's baby boxes? The experts also argue that there is no evidence the boxes have helped Finland achieve some of the lowest rates of cot death (sudden infant death syndrome or SIDS) in the world, as has sometimes been claimed. SIDS rates are equally low in neighbouring countries, such as Sweden and Denmark, where boxes are not provided, they say. Prof Blair and colleagues say there should be more high-quality studies ""to better understand how families use the cardboard baby box, and its safety implications"". Responding to the letter, the Royal College of Midwives pointed out that its position statement on baby boxes had acknowledged that there was limited evidence around them reducing SIDS. It said that baby boxes needed to be safe, of high quality and the box and mattress should meet at least the minimum UK safety standards. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said: ""Whilst the evidence around the effectiveness of baby boxes is still being debated, what we do know is that they provide all parents with the essentials needed to give their newborn baby the best start in life."" Experts recommend that babies sleep in the same room as parents for the first six months Place your baby on their back to sleep, in a cot in the same room as you, for the first six months Don't smoke during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and don't let anyone smoke in the same room as your baby Don't share a bed with your baby if you have been drinking alcohol, if you take drugs or you're a smoker Never sleep with your baby on a sofa or an armchair Don't let your baby get too hot or cold Keep your baby's head uncovered. Their blanket should be tucked in no higher than their shoulders Place your baby in the ""feet to foot"" position, with their feet at the end of the cot or Moses basket Source:NHS website,external ""We are getting ready to set up his cot but there is still room to grow in the box at the moment. ""He feels secure with it being high-walled and it's soothing for him as it's stimula free once he's put to bed. ""We place it on top of a very solid, safe Ottoman next to the bed and against the wall, and I look down into the box and can monitor his safety. ""I am so very pleased and grateful for the box."" ""We use it during the day downstairs but at night we have a Moses basket upstairs. ""We will probably only use it for a couple more weeks as my average-sized five-week-old is getting a bit long for it. ""I check it daily for signs of damage as my daughter has previously dribbled on the mattress whilst sleeping.

"Celebrations in Toronto Across the country, Canadians queued for the chance to buy recreational cannabis legally for the first time. The end of prohibition on Wednesday was marked by parties, park hangouts and non-stop media coverage. But some worried that legalisation would increase use, especially amongst youth, and create new safety problems. The shift in policy was a watershed moment for the country, which is now one of only two nations in the world where marijuana is legal. The first person in Canada to buy marijuana legally was Ian Power, who was first in line in the easternmost province of Newfoundland and Labrador when the clock struck midnight. ""It's been my dream to be the first person to buy the first legal gram of cannabis in Canada, and here I finally am,"" he said. Across the country, and hours later, Alex Smith was among the many leaving the BC Cannabis Store with a brown paper bag in hand. A legalisation party in Toronto The province-run retail store in Kamloops, located in an unassuming strip mall, is currently the only legal store in British Columbia. Provincial officials boasted about its clean ""west coast casual"" interior and range of products. Mr Smith called the experience of shopping there ""a little surreal"". ""For my entire adult life I've been a closet pot smoker, trying to hide it because I do tend to run in circles that don't consume cannabis that often,"" he told the BBC. ""Now that it's legal - and actually going into a storefront like this - I felt almost relieved but also justified in smoking pot. It's OK now, in the government's mind at least."" The queue outside a cannabis store in Canada Yet those expecting legalisation to turn the country into a scene out of a movie featuring '70s and '80s hippie comedy duo Cheech and Chong may be disappointed. The province of Ontario passed a law allowing cannabis in public places where smoking was permitted only 17 hours after legalisation, meaning that the streets of Toronto were largely drug-free throughout the day. Most of the partying took place on the premises of private businesses, like Hot Black Coffee in Downtown. The coffee shop turned its back patio into a ""chill"" lounge where people could listen to music, drink coffee and yes, smoke-up. Co-hosting the party was Robin Ellins, who owns the paraphernalia shop next door, The Friendly Stranger. Ellins, a long-time advocate for legalisation, said he was ""elated"" by today's news. ""It's kind of hard to think that it's actually happened, there were times we thought this would never happen,"" he said. ""This is monumental."" Legalisation is hardly a free-for-all for pot smokers - there are several aspects of cannabis consumption that are still illegal. Users must be 18 or 19 (depending on the province) to purchase, and there are strong penalties for those caught selling to minors. Canadians will be limited to the number of plants they can grow themselves, and can only hold 30 grams (one ounce) on their person in public at a time. The government also introduced new drug-impaired driving legislation that include stiff fines and possible jail time. Police will be able to demand suspected drivers take a roadside sobriety test or a provide a saliva sample to test for THC, the psychoactive compound in cannabis. The reliability of these saliva tests has raised concerns, and legal experts expect challenges to the law to make their way to court. A sign at a cannabis store in British Columbia warns to keep the product away from children Health officials have voiced their own concerns. The Canadian Medical Association Journal published an editorial calling legalisation ""a national, uncontrolled experiment in which the profits of cannabis producers and tax revenues are squarely pitched against the health of Canadians"". The Canadian Psychiatric Society on Wednesday cautioned Canadians under 25 about using cannabis, warning there is evidence ""early and regular use"" can affect things like memory attention and the ability to process thoughts and experience and could increase the risk of developing mental health issues like depression in people already vulnerable to them. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada warned there was a growing body of evidence that cannabis use during pregnancy could have a negative impact on the developing foetus. PM Justin Trudeau says he has ""no intention"" of smoking marijuana Today's news was heralded as a win for Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who promised to make marijuana legal back in 2014 when he was running for office. He has admitted to smoking cannabis five or six times in the past, even once as a sitting member of parliament. But he says he never really enjoyed the experience. Now known for his love of jogging and healthy eating, he told journalists in Ottawa on Wednesday that he does not even drink coffee and has ""no intention of using marijuana"". Trudeau has called criminal prohibition of cannabis in Canada, in place for nearly a century, a ""failure"". Canadians continued to use the drug, especially minors, and there was a robust black market. The government has chosen to replace prohibition with a system of ""strict regulatory control"" they hope will be more effective at keeping cannabis out of the hands of minors and at reducing health and social harms related to its use. On Wednesday, Canada also announced it would waive wait time and fees for those who have served their time for minor cannabis possession convictions and want to apply for a pardon. ""There is a disproportionate representation of young people from minorities who are saddled with criminal convictions,"" Mr Trudeau said. This video can not be played As Canada makes cannabis legal, what happens to those with past convictions for possession? ""This will make a real difference for people who have been unfairly impacted from the previous regime."" Some advocates for amnesty say it is a good first step but are calling on Canada to have those convictions expunged, which would completely erase the record. Of course, no coverage of marijuana legalisation would be complete without several terrible marijuana puns and jokes. Plenty of police departments used the day to poke fun at some standard stoner tropes in order to advocate for responsible consumption. ""If #cannabis is on your agenda for later, may we suggest buying some snacks BEFORE consumption so you don't need to track down a Designated Driver for a munchie run at 2am!"" suggested police from Newfoundland and Labrador.

"The missing 13-year-old has been described as a ""sweet girl"" by school officials An increasingly desperate search is under way in the US after a Wisconsin teenager went missing and her parents were found murdered. The couple, aged 56 and 46, were found shot dead in their family home at about 01:00 local (06:00 GMT) on Monday. Ever since police have been looking for 13-year-old Jayme Closs, who they believe is ""endangered"". They say a 911 call and evidence from the address suggests she was in the house when the disturbance took place. On Tuesday, Barron County Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald said emergency services received a call from a mobile phone and heard a disturbance in the background, but no-one spoke to them directly. But when police arrived four minutes later, no gun or suspects were found at the scene and there was no sign of Jayme. On Wednesday, the deaths of James and Denise Closs were officially ruled as homicide by a medical examiner. At a news conference, police said they had received about 400 tips from the public since the 13-year-old disappeared and an Amber Alert was issued for her. The alert stated that she was taken from her home early on Monday morning by ""unknown individual(s), likely with a gun"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Police in Miami suggested on Tuesday she ""may have been seen"" at a petrol station there on Monday, 1,700 miles (2,700km) away from her home. But that claim was later dismissed by Barron County Sherriff's Office as ""not credible"". ""If it does not come from this podium, it is not credible information,"" Sherriff Fitzgerald said. ""I cannot stress that enough."" The missing teenager has been described as being approximately 5ft (1.5m) tall and 100lb (45kg) with green eyes and strawberry blonde hair. Local authorities have said investigators do not believe she ran away and they don't consider her a suspect. ""Our number one goal is to bring Jayme home, and no amount of information will be given out unless we feel it's appropriate to help,"" Sherriff Fitzgerald said on Tuesday. Jayme and her mother attended a family birthday party together on Sunday afternoon while James Closs was at work, Jayme's grandfather told the Associated Press.

"EBay wants Amazon to stop trying to tempt sellers away from the auction site EBay has filed a lawsuit against Amazon, accusing the US retail giant of using illegal tactics to recruit sellers. It says Amazon representatives abused eBay's internal email system to contact sellers - a violation of the marketplace's policies. Amazon declined to comment on the case, which followsa letter from eBay demanding an end to the activity. It had previously said that it was investigating the claims. In the lawsuit filed in Santa Clara County, California, eBay says Amazon representatives created eBay accounts to solicit sellers, often sending messages within minutes of setting up their profiles. The activity dates back to at least 2015 and involved dozens of Amazon representatives, who each sent hundreds of emails, it says. EBay was alerted to the issue a few weeks ago by a seller and asked Amazon to stop. The lawsuit says the messages show Amazon was aware its practices violated eBay's use policies. It says Amazon's practices ""appear to be part of a larger pattern of aggressive, unscrupulous conduct"" by the Seattle company. EBay, which also owns the ticket resale site StubHub, is seeking monetary damages to be awarded at jury trial. The California company, which launched in 1995, was an online shopping pioneer, developing a platform to connect buyers to sellers. It now boasts more than 175 million active buyers, with sales of nearly $90bn via the platform last year, But its lustre has faded amid increased competition, especially as Amazon's dominance lures more merchants to its own platform. Last year, more than half of the items sold by Amazon came from third-party merchants. Amazon overall is estimated to account for about half of retail dollars spent online in the US.

"Angela Rayner and Jeremy Corbyn: What is Labour offering families with children in academies? The Labour Party has shifted to a more hard-line policy on schools, saying it would scrap the current academy system. But dozens of its own MPs are part of a group opening academies and planning to become one of England's biggest academy providers. There are 37 ""Labour and Co-operative"" MPs - but when it comes to schools policy, the Labour and Co-operative parts of their title seem to be pulling in completely different directions. The Co-op, part of the fibre of the Labour movement and a sponsor of MPs, is itself the sponsor of its own multi-academy trust - running academies. But Angela Rayner, Labour's shadow education secretary, has a policy to stop the creation of any academies. ""We'll start by immediately ending the Tories' academy and free schools programmes. They neither improve standards nor empower staff or parents,"" she told the party conference. The Co-op wants to expand to run 40 academies, which would make it one of the biggest providers The Co-op trust currently runs 13 schools, focused on improving standards in the north of England. And it wants to push ahead to take over 40 academies, which would make it among the biggest academy trusts in the country. But this ambition would have to be ditched under Labour's policy. The Co-op trust has beencommended for turning round underachieving schools, such as tackling truancy at its Co-op Academy Manchester. And as the Co-op is using its resources to support Labour MPs and also to back its academy expansion, which Labour now wants to stop - there is, to say the least, some confusion. Labour's Co-op MPs include: shadow education minister Tracy Brabin former Education Minister Stephen Twigg former Education Select Committee chairman Barry Sheerman former shadow education secretary Lucy Powell Meg Hillier, who chairs the Public Accounts Committee The Co-op Academy Manchester now has one of the best attendance rates in the country Speaking privately, there are Labour parliamentarians who admit they don't understand the party's plans for re-organising schools. The Co-op is also unimpressed to have the efforts of its academy trust written off. ""If we look at the work of strong, socially minded academy trusts - and there are quite a few - we find a burning desire to end social injustice,"" says the Co-op Academies Trust's chief executive, Frank Norris. ""There are some, and I would add our trust to the list, who have radically improved the lives of those it serves,"" he said. What does it mean to be an academy school? No new free schools or academies, says Rayner How the Co-op tackled a school with terrible truancy There are wider questions about what Labour really plans for academies. This was a type of state-funded school originally created by Labour, operating outside of local authority networks and increasingly grouped together in trusts. Angela Rayner promised Labour's conference an end to the academy programme Labour says there are no contradictions between the Co-op's plans and its proposed academy reforms - and that under a different structure it will be able to sponsor new schools. It says that multi-academy trusts - known as Mats - will no longer be able to expand - but under a new format, ""co-operative academy trusts"" - to be known as Cats - they will be able to take on schools. It will literally be a case of the Cat sitting on the Mat. But the new Cats will have a greater role for local authorities and all schools will have a ""common rulebook"", which a Labour spokesman says will ensure ""fairness and consistency"". What makes it complicated for Labour is that it isn't starting with a blank page. Already 66% of secondary schools are academies - and 29% of primaries - with more than 1,000 more academy conversions in the pipeline. Academies and trusts would be re-organised under Labour These are run by almost 2,700 separate academy trusts. It's a system that's been accused of being Byzantine and financially inefficient and there have been complaints about a lack of accountability. But it's not possible to turn back the clock - as many local education authorities no longer have the capacity to run all their local schools. Labour says it wants a ""common rulebook"" for all schools. But it's worth remembering that the last attempt to create a single, one-size-fits-all system turned out to be a political disaster. In 2016, the Conservative government announced all schools must become academies. But its own backbenchers, confused as to why outstanding local authority schools should be forcibly turned into academies, torpedoed the policy andforced an embarrassing U-turn. If Labour pushed to get rid of academy trusts, regardless of whether they were any good, it might face the same accusation of pursuing ideology over practical achievement. If the Conservatives have been accused of being blind to academies' weaknesses, Labour might be accused of being blind to their strengths. Labour in office promoted the expansion of academies Labour MP for Harrow West Gareth Thomas, who chairs the Co-op Party, said he welcomed Angela Rayner's commitment to co-operative values in schools. Her conference speech promised to replace free schools with a new name, ""co-operative schools"", backing the co-operative ethos. But there are still questions within Labour about what happens to existing academies. ""We want the Co-op school sector to expand - and we look forward to conversations with Labour to see how that can happen,"" said Mr Thomas.

"This video can not be played The Duchess of Sussex received a tiara from one little girl They say when in Rome, do as the Romans do. And the Duchess of Sussex did just that by trying her hand at Aussie Rules football in Melbourne. Meghan tossed the oval ball during a reception held for her and Prince Harry on the third day of their tour of Australia and New Zealand. It was part of a sporting demonstration for the This Girl Can campaign. Thousands of people turned out to see the couple, who recently announced they are expecting a baby. Prince Harry and Meghan abandoned their strict schedule and instead spent 25 minutes meeting royal fans. Some members of the crowd gave the parents-to-be presents for their unborn child, including 10-year-old Courtney Pistone. She gave Meghan a large Teddy bear. ""I gave it to her for the nursery,"" she said. ""I thought it would be suitable because we didn't know if it was a boy or a girl and both boys and girls like bears."" Some members of the crowd sang Stand By Me - a song the couple chose for their wedding service in May. The duke and duchess then went on to a reception at Government House. During a fitness display by 150 women, Meghan was convinced to throw an Australian Football League (AFL) game ball as part of the This Girl Can campaign, a Sport England initiative licensed to Vic Health in Australia. ""I'm not sure I will be good,"" she said, before giving it a go. ""I'm not sure I did it right!"" she added. Jerril Rechter, who showed the couple around, said: ""She did pass an AFL football. She did a handball. That's a pretty incredible thing for anybody to do."" During another demonstration, Meghan got a shock when a group of school children demonstrated a miniature F1 race track.

"This video can not be played Paddington station: Frustrated passengers amid rail chaos Rail passengers have faced further disruption on trains to and from London Paddington. The chaos was caused by damage to 500m of overhead power cables inflicted during a train test run on Tuesday. There were delays and cancellations to key routes on Wednesday but services returned to a ""near normal"" level on Thursday morning, Great Western Railway (GWR) said. But some disruption continued between London and Reading. Engineers worked overnight to repair the closed lines. A small number of trains have been cancelled this evening, with other services running more slowly or starting from different stations. A spokesman said of more than 400 trains which ran this morning, two services were cancelled, while seven did only part of their scheduled routes as a result of the disruption. Allow Twitter content?

The ""extent of the damage"" to the power cables meant the repairs could not be completed in one night.

"EBay wants Amazon to stop trying to tempt sellers away from the auction site EBay has filed a lawsuit against Amazon, accusing the US retail giant of using illegal tactics to recruit sellers. It says Amazon representatives abused eBay's internal email system to contact sellers - a violation of the marketplace's policies. Amazon declined to comment on the case, which followsa letter from eBay demanding an end to the activity. It had previously said that it was investigating the claims. In the lawsuit filed in Santa Clara County, California, eBay says Amazon representatives created eBay accounts to solicit sellers, often sending messages within minutes of setting up their profiles. The activity dates back to at least 2015 and involved dozens of Amazon representatives, who each sent hundreds of emails, it says. EBay was alerted to the issue a few weeks ago by a seller and asked Amazon to stop. The lawsuit says the messages show Amazon was aware its practices violated eBay's use policies. It says Amazon's practices ""appear to be part of a larger pattern of aggressive, unscrupulous conduct"" by the Seattle company. EBay, which also owns the ticket resale site StubHub, is seeking monetary damages to be awarded at jury trial. The California company, which launched in 1995, was an online shopping pioneer, developing a platform to connect buyers to sellers. It now boasts more than 175 million active buyers, with sales of nearly $90bn via the platform last year, But its lustre has faded amid increased competition, especially as Amazon's dominance lures more merchants to its own platform. Last year, more than half of the items sold by Amazon came from third-party merchants. Amazon overall is estimated to account for about half of retail dollars spent online in the US.

"EastEnders actor Danny Dyer is going from the Queen Vic to living like a king for a new BBC history series. After finding out he wasrelated to royaltyin Who Do You Think You Are, Dyer is to experience how his ancestors lived for the show. That will see him eating sheep's tongue - like Viking forebear Rollo - and learning to hunt, like William the Conqueror, his 30x great-grandfather, as he explores 800 years of history. Dyer said it was a ""nutty"" experience. He had his family tree traced two years ago for the ancestry show and found out he also had links to Edward III and Thomas Cromwell. The new two-part series, Danny Dyer's Right Royal Family, will see him eat, dress and live like his regal antecedents. It seems Danny is a fan of dressing up Luckily for viewers, that means we get to see him wear an Elizabeth ruff when he hosts a sugar banquet of sweet treats for his family - his living family, rather than his ancestors - who all dress up for the occasion. Dyer, whose daughter Dani won Love Island this summer, also gets to wear 14th Century armour to fight like his 19x great-grandfather Henry Hotspur Percy - the knight who inspired a Shakespeare character of the same name. ""I'm still in shock at the fact that I'm related to such important people,"" he said. ""I've had a ball getting to know them. It was a nutty experience."" Dyer with wife Joanne Mas, left, daughter Dani and her boyfriend Jack Fincham A BBC spokeswoman said ""his journey is a retelling of 800 years of British history - which is all there in his extraordinary bloodline"".

"Attendees gathered for the first Future Investment Initiative conference in 2017 Major companies, including Pepsi and EDF, still plan to attend a conference in Saudi Arabia next week despite pressure for a boycott. But more than 30 delegates have dropped out since Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi disappeared. Goldman Sachs has said none of its executives will be there. Earlier on Thursday, US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin andUK International Trade Secretary Liam Foxalso pulled out. The event was set to feature 150 speakers from 140 organisations. A critic of the government and a columnist for the Washington Post, Mr Khashoggi vanished on 2 October after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkish authorities say he was killed in the building by Saudi agents, but Saudi Arabia has dismissed the accusation as ""lies"". Jamal Khashoggi: Saudi journalist in his own words Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? Consultancy firms McKinsey, PWC, Ernst & Young, Deloitte, BCG, Oliver Wyman, and Bain & Company are all sponsors of the event, along with German conglomerate Siemens and research company SWFI. None responded to questions about whether or not they had plans to withdraw. Germany consultancy firm Roland Berger, which is also sponsoring the event, said it was reviewing its position. The BBC understands that Goldman will be sending a small number of attendees. However a page with a list of confirmed speakers has been removed from the conference's website. Dubbed the ""Davos of the Desert,"" the three-day event is organised by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund and is an opportunity for firms to build relationships and secure lucrative contracts in the Kingdom. Politicians and business executives from Europe, North America and Asia were on the attendance list. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo travelled to Riyadh on Tuesday for talks with Saudi Arabia's King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who he said ""strongly denied"" any involvement in the disappearance of Mr. Khashoggi. But dozens of firms have now shunned the Saudi business event in protest. At least 30 high-profile speakers have withdrawn so far from organisations including HSBC, Uber and the International Monetary Fund. Sir Richard Branson has also halted talks over a $1bn (Â£756m) Saudi investment in Virgin space firms. Angus MacNeil MP, Chair of the International Trade Select Committee expressed his support for further boycotts. ""The behaviour of Saudi Arabia is utterly beyond the pale,"" said Mr. MacNeil. ""They cannot operate with such savage impunity."" Human rights charity Amnesty International has also said businesses should ""think twice"" about attending. Businesses should consider that it might damage their brands to be associated with a country that ""bombs civilian targets in Yemen, imprisons human rights defenders and apparently disappears a journalist overseas"", said Amnesty's Economic Affairs Programme Director Peter Frankental. However a spokesperson for the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said it was up to individual companies to ""look at the situation carefully and make their own judgments"".

"The decision on whether MPs approve or reject any Brexit deal must be ""unequivocal"", ministers have said. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the outcome of the ""meaningful vote"" due to take place in Parliament must be ""clear to the British public"". In a letter to MPs, he suggests they will have to choose between whatever deal is on the table and no deal - and no other options will be offered. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said it was an attempt to ""fix the vote"". And pro-European Conservative MPs also reacted with dismay, former education secretary Nicky Morgan saying it ""appears to be an attempt by the executive to frustrate our sovereign Parliament"" while Anna Soubry urged MPs ""to stand up to this outrage"". UK 'may consider longer Brexit transition' Kuenssberg: The good, the bad and the ugly for PM The former chancellor Kenneth Clarke told the BBC's Newsnight it was a ""silly tactic"" and Parliament would ""insist on using its proper authority"" to keep a variety of options open. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said this was a ""big fat row waiting to happen"". No 10 sources, she said, were insisting the Commons motion on any final Brexit deal would be amendable but ""what is not clear is whether amendments will be voted on before after the vote on the deal"".

Opponents of Brexit have long warned of a ""take it or leave it"" situation, in which they have to either accept the deal on the table or risk the UK leaving without an agreement. They say MPs should have alternative options if they think the deal is inadequate, such as sending ministers back to the negotiating table or giving the public the final say in another referendum. Parliament has been promised a vote on the outcome of the current Brexit negotiations ahead of the UK's scheduled departure on 29 March 2019. It is increasingly unclear when the vote will be, amid signs that, due to the current deadlock over Northern Ireland, any agreement might not be reached until the middle of December. EU leaders are currently meeting in Brussels to gauge progress. In response to a letter from Tory MP Charles Walker, who chairs the Commons Procedure Committee, Mr Raab indicated the vote should be a simple Yes-or-No verdict on whatever deal was brought back by Theresa May. ""Once the deal is presented to Parliament, the procedure through which it is voted upon must allow for an unequivocal decision and one which is clear to the British public,"" he wrote. ""Anything other than a straightforward approval of the deal will bring with it huge uncertainty for business, consumers and citizens."" Mr Walker had asked for clarification on what would happen if any resolution was passed by MPs with different amendments attached. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said MPs must be able to scrutinise and, where appropriate, change the text of any vote presented to Parliament. ""That is not a meaningful vote. Ministers cannot silence Parliament."" The government has said any agreement reached with the EU on the terms of the UK's withdrawal will have to be enshrined in new legislation. Sky News reported on Wednesday that the traditional Commons recess in February could be cancelled to allow MPs to sit longer and ensure the legislation is passed before Brexit day.

"Tens of thousands of people on sickness benefits will receive backdated payments averaging Â£5,000 following government errors. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has revealed it is paying more than Â£1.5bn due to the mistakes. Some people have already received payouts of more than Â£10,000. The mistaken calculations were made when people were moved on to the main sickness benefit, the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). The errors werefirst revealed by BBC News in November, but the scale of the underpayments has now emerged. 'I have no idea how it was worked out' Philip Stanton, 58, got a letter earlier this year about the backdated payments, followed by a cheque for Â£2,250 in July. ""You feel brilliant at first because when you're living on Â£73 a week, that's a heck of a lot of money - though of course it won't last forever,"" he told BBC News. ""But then you think, 'what if they hadn't found out? What else is there?'. I have no idea how it was worked out or even if it's the right amount."" Mr Stanton, who has been receiving sickness benefits ""on and off for 10 years"", has anxiety and depression as well as problems with his back. He said he was told his payment went back to 2014. ""A couple of my friends are in the same situation and one of them got more than me, which is why I thought I would query it,"" said Mr Stanton, from Northampton. ""But someone else hasn't heard anything. ""I'm very grateful to get the money, but with my dealings with them, I tend not to trust them."" He said he has asked how the payment was calculated and is waiting for a response. Assessors wrongly calculated the income of thousands of people during the process that resulted in people moving from incapacity benefit and severe disability allowance onto ESA. Most of the errors occurred between 2011 and 2014. In anewly published document,external, the DWP said: ""We estimate that around 180,000 people could be owed arrears payments, with around 105,000 estimated to be repaid during 2018-19 and 75,000 during 2019-20."" The government had previously said that all the backdated payments would be completed by April 2019. The DWP said that the backdated payments totalled Â£970m. It now also faced a larger bill for ongoing ESA awards, costing the department more than Â£700m extra until 2024-25, bringing the total cost to Â£1.67bn. Frank Field, who chairs the Commons Work and Pensions Committee, said: ""It is welcome news that the government is finally making progress towards repaying people who have missed out on ESA. ""Its best estimate is that it owes claimants Â£970m - but the final bill could be even higher. The government must learn lessons from this appalling failure, as it faces the much bigger challenge of moving people onto Universal Credit."" The government has 400 people working on claims, with the priority on those who are terminally ill. Around 18,000 arrears payments have already been made totalling Â£120m. The average payment so far is about Â£7,000. Universal credit rollout delayed yet again ESA repayments: Terminally ill people are 'priority' The government's original decision to only backdate payments to 2014 was legally challenged by the Child Poverty Action Group. CPAG chief executive Alison Garnham said it was good news that 180,000 people would now receive backdated compensation, but said ""it should concern us all that [the DWP] so significantly underestimated the number of people affected"". She added: ""It should not have taken legal action to get vulnerable people the money they were entitled to from the outset to avoid hardship."" In a statement, the DWP said: ""Anyone affected by this historic error will receive all of the money they are entitled to. ""We have worked with charities and other disability organisations to make sure that we are providing the right support to all affected claimants and are hiring and allocating more staff to do that."" Labour introduced ESA in 2008, claiming the change would move a million people off sickness benefit and save the Treasury Â£7bn. The shift from incapacity benefits to ESA was then accelerated by the coalition government. The payments have come to light in a week when the government has faced severe criticism for its flagship welfare reform, Universal Credit. On Tuesday, BBC News revealed that ministers were further delaying the rollout of the system, which merges six benefits into one.
