"Koeman was Barcelona's match-winner in the 1992 European Cup final but has struggled as head coach Ronald Koeman has been sacked as head coach of Barcelona after 14 months in charge at the Nou Camp. Barca have picked up just 15 points from 10 games in La Liga and have already lost twice in the group stage of this season's Champions League. They are ninth in the table, six points adrift of the joint leaders afterlosing at Rayo Vallecanoon Wednesday. The loss was Barca's third in their past four games and it followeddefeat by Real Madrid in Sunday's Clasico. In a statement, the Spanish club said: ""The president of the club, Joan Laporta, informed him [Koeman] of the decision after the defeat against Rayo Vallecano. ""Ronald Koeman will say goodbye to the squad on Thursday."" The former Netherlands, Everton and Southampton boss, 58, could only guide the five-time European champions to third place in the league last season. The Dutchman has not been helped by the club's significant financial problems, which resulted inLionel Messi's exitand subsequent move to Paris St-Germain in August. Barcelona were unable to spend any money on new signings in the summer, with Memphis Depay, Sergio Aguero and Eric Garcia arriving as free transfers and striker Luuk de Jong joining on loan from Sevilla. Speaking after Wednesday's defeat, Koeman said: ""It [Barcelona's league position] says we're not well. ""The team has lost balance in the squad, lost very effective players, which shows. In recent years other clubs have strengthened every season and we haven't, which also shows."" Club legend Xavi, the former Barca midfielder who is now manager of Qatari side Al Sadd, is one of the favourites to replace Koeman. It is the first time since September 1987 that Barca have lost three away games in a row without scoring - a run that saw English manager Terry Venables sacked. Koeman won the Copa del Rey at the end of his first season but Barca finished behind Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid in La Liga with their lowest points tally since 2008. The former Netherlands centre-back played for the Spanish club between 1989 and 1995, helping them to four league titles and scoring the winning goal in the 1992 European Cup final. He was brought back to the club in August 2020 as head coach by former president Josep Maria Bartomeu. New chief Laporta, however, frequently made it clear the Dutchman was not his appointment. The duo had an uneasy relationship, and Koeman released a statement in September asking to be given time to rebuild after losing Messi and fellow forward Antoine Griezmann in the summer. Following the defeat by Madrid on Sunday, Koeman's car was surrounded by some Barcelona supporters, whom he later dismissed as ""uneducated people"". Speaking before the trip to Rayo Vallecano, he said: ""It is a social problem. Uneducated people that don't understand rules and values."" The toxic battle ripping apart a European giant This video can not be played Falcao scores and Depay misses penalty as Barcelona beaten One of Koeman's first tasks as coach was to make a40-second phone call to Luis Suarez,externalduring which he told the Uruguay striker his services were no longer required and that he was free to leave the club. The decision had been made by the board and it's now known the dire financial position forced them to get rid of a forward who scored 21 goals from 29 starts in the previous campaign. It began a weakening of the Barca squad from one that could compete with Europe's elite to one that is struggling to get into the Champions League places. Messi then handed in a transfer requestbut ended up staying for 2020-21 butSuarez joined Atletico Madridfor a nominal fee and fired them to the league title. Behind the scenes the club's costs had spiralled to an unsustainable level, creating the biggest wage bill in world football and leaving Barcelonaon the verge of bankruptcyand a stadium that requires renovation. With Messi out of contract, the Argentina superstaragreed a new deal in July of this yearuntil 2026 that included halving his wages, but La Liga stipulated Barca must reduce their wage bill further before he and any new players could be registered. They weren't able to do that, so in August the club announced thatMessi would be leaving""because of financial and structural obstacles"". He joined Paris St-Germain, then Koeman lost more talent when France forward Griezmann followed Suarez to Atletico Madrid - rejoining the club he had left in aÂ£107m dealtwo years before on a loan in a snapshot of where it has gone wrong for Barcelona. They managed to sign former Manchester United forward Depay and Aguero on free transfers but the former Manchester City striker has only just made his Barca debut after getting injured in pre-season. The transformation from a forward line of Messi, Suarez and Griezmann to Depay, De Jong and an ageing Aguero sums up the task Koeman faced and which will now greet his successor.

"The river was level with the pedestrian bridge in Cockermouth Rain has continued to fall overnight in Cumbria after about 40 properties were flooded and road and rail travel were hit on Thursday. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning, meaning some disruption is possible, and the Environment Agency has nine flood warnings in place. On Thursday Honister Pass saw over 30cm (12in) of rain in a 24-hour period. Motorists are warned that some roads are only passable with extreme care, and asked only to travel if necessary. Train operators are asking people to avoid travelling on the West Coast Main Line and Cumbria Coastal routes, and there is no service between Barrow and Carlisle until the line has been inspected. The flooding hit Waterhead at Ambleside On Thursday a number of roads, including the A591 between Rydal and Grasmere and the A592 Patterdale Road, were flooded. Karl Melville, the senior manager at the county council's highways team, said work had been going on all night to try to re-open as many roads as possible. He said: ""We have made some good progress [and] a lot of the roads that were closed are now passable with care. ""But obviously this does not take away the very clear advice of if you don't need to travel then don't travel."" The A592 was blocked by a number of vehicles at Windermere School on Thursday The Environment Agency said 1,200 properties had been protected from flooding by its officers shutting flood gates and removing debris and blockages from grilles and watercourses. But flood duty manager Ben Lukey urged people ""to remain vigilant"". ""Surface water and river flooding could still bring disruption to further communities,"" he warned. Mountain rescue volunteers brought two holidaymakers and their dog to safety Two holiday makers and their dog had to be rescued from their accommodation at Southwaite Mill by the Cockermouth Mountain Rescue Team. With water chest high in places, volunteers brought them to safety in a raft. Some streets in Cockermouth flooded Cockermouth and District Chamber of Trade chairman Andrew Marshall said huge insurance policy excesses introduced after the floods of 2009 and 2015 meant 90% of businesses would have to pay for any repairs themselves. ""Ever since then it's been nigh on impossible to get insurance,"" he said. ""If we get flooded this time we've got to pay for the rebuild and everything, which goes into hundreds of thousands."" Insurers have imposed excesses of up to Â£50,000 for business flooding claims in the area, Mr Marshall said. After previous floods caused widespread damage to properties the governmentintroduced a scheme,externalto help residents get insurance ""but it wasn't extended to business"", he said. Coniston Boating Centre is normally not in the lake Gillian Jackson owns holiday lets in Cockermouth, some of which have flooded. ""We've been through this before so it's just get up, get on with it,"" she said. ""Yes, it's upsetting but we've kind of got a bit hardened to it, got used to it, and we've just got to crack on and sort it out."" On Thursday afternoon, staff at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant were advised to speak to their bosses about returning home if possible, after checking road conditions. In a message to employees, the company warned detours would be needed around road closures on the A595 at Duddon Bridge, Santon Bridge and Holmrook and that Millom was reported to be unreachable by road. ""Shift co-ordinators will maintain minimum safety manning levels in plants but others should head home once clarified with their line managers,"" it said. The pitch at Keswick Rugby Club was swamped There was also flood damage to the clubhouse Nine flood warnings,external(where flooding is expected) and 15 flood alerts (where it is possible) were in place on Friday morning.

Hope Park in Keswick was hit, leaving the statue of Max the Miracle Dog stranded Richard Warren from the Lake District Search and Mountain Rescue Association warned people not to go fell walking during the current conditions. He said: ""It's half-term, Scafell Pike is a bit of a honey pot, there were a lot of walkers out on the road looking very, very wet, the car park had quite a few cars in, so people may have gone up Scafell Pike when the rivers were low.

Cars got stuck in floodwater near Keswick Alan Goodman, from the Met Office, said the rain was ""on the wane slowly as today unfolds"".

"Ten volunteers attended the Clarence House launch The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall have launched the centenary Royal British Legion poppy appeal. Prince Charles and Camilla met 10 volunteers for the charity - each born in one of the decades of its campaign - at Clarence House on Tuesday. It marked the start of the annual drive to raise funds for the Legion. The pandemic meant the collectors did not go out to sell red paper poppies in 2020, but the tradition is resuming ahead of Armistice Day on 11 November. The Royal British Legion supports serving and former personnel and their families. More than 40,000 volunteers across the country will be collecting donations for this year's appeal. Wearing a red poppy signifies respect and support for the armed forces community and their sacrifice in all conflicts. The flower was a common sight on the Western Front, where British soldiers fought during World War One, and became a symbol of remembrance for those killed. The Prince of Wales said: ""The significance of the poppy is as relevant today as it ever was while our Armed Forces continue to be engaged in operations overseas and often in the most demanding of circumstances. ""The simple act of wearing a poppy is only made possible because of volunteer Poppy Appeal collectors who share a common goal - to recognise the unique contribution of the Armed Forces community."" The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall spoke to Maisie Mead, 10, and Jill Gladwell, 95, the youngest and oldest of the volunteers The Prince of Wales and Camilla spoke to Jill Gladwell, 95, who is marking 80 years of collecting for the appeal, at the launch. Mrs Gladwell began volunteering as a schoolgirl during the Second World War after being inspired by her mother who collected in the 1920s. Five generations of her family are now involved. ""I'm so happy to be back out collecting to support the armed forces community and their families this year,"" she said.

Jugoslav Jovanovicpreviously admitted to conspiring to burglethe homes of Frank Lampard, F1 heiress Tamara Ecclestone and the family of the late Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, in 2019. Jovanovic was due to go on trial at Isleworth Crown Court over conspiracy to launder stolen goods out of the UK. He has now changed his plea to guilty. The Crown Prosecution Service said the Â£25m burglary alone on Ms Ecclestone's Kensington mansion was believed to be the biggest of its kind in English legal history. Andrew Hadik said the international gang of jewellery thieves took ""irreplaceable items of sentimental value that have never been seen again"". He added: ""Jovanovic used his spoils to go shopping at Harrods and had even opened a store loyalty card."" Frank and Christine Lampard had their west London home burgled on 1 December 2019 It was previously heard in court that on 30 November 2019, Jovanovic, along with an accomplice named Daniel Vukovic, travelled to London Stansted from Stockholm and then set up a hotel base in Orpington. The next day the pair burgled the west London home of Lampard and his wife Christine while the couple were out. the court was told. Prosecutors said an intruder alarm was triggered but more than Â£50,000 worth of items were stolen. Alessandro Maltese, Jugoslav Jovanovic and Alessandro Donati were all arrested in Italy and extradited to the UK Then on 10 December, a Knightsbridge property belonging to the late billionaire Leicester City owner Mr Srivaddhanaprabha was burgled, the court heard. Mr Srivaddhanaprabhadied in a helicopter crash outside the King Power Stadium in October 2018and his family said the home had been left untouched since his death. The court heard Jovanovic, Mr Vukovic, and two other Italians - Alessandro Donati and Alessandro Maltese - ransacked the home taking seven Patek Philippe watches, a Tag Heuer smart watch and around â¬400,000 in cash. The following day, the group dined at an expensive sushi restaurant near Harrods and had a Â£760 champagne and sashimi lunch, the court heard. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha bought Leicester City in 2010 and died in a helicopter crash in 2018 Finally, on 13 December, Mr Vukovic, Maltese and Donati carried out one of the biggest burglaries in English legal history, the prosecution said. Armed with screw drivers, they targeted the palatial home that F1 heiress Ms Ecclestone shares with her husband Jay Rutland - opposite Kensington Palace, the court was told. Kensington Palace Gardens is one of the most expensive streets in the world, has an armed guard presence and is home to the Russian, French and Israeli embassies. Stars lost Â£26m of property to 'burglary team' Man cleared over celebrity raids 'sleeping in car' Â£26m celebrity raids 'bound to be Hollywood film' Jovanovic remained the 'watch' at the bottom of the road, outside the nearby Stick & Bowl Chinese restaurant. He left the UK onboard an AirItalia flight from London City Airport to Milan Linate Airport on 18 December, the court heard. The 24-year-old, who was living in Milan, was extradited from Italy to the UK in April to face legal proceedings. Jay Rutland, Tamara Ecclestone and their daughter had left for Lapland on the morning of the burglary Italian nationals Donati, 44, and Maltese, 45, both previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to burgle. All three will be sentenced on 15 November and have been remanded into custody. Mr Vukovic 40, has never been located and is believed to be in the Serbian capital Belgrade. Det Con Andrew Payne said specialist police looked through 2,000 hours of video footage.

"Strike action which threatened to cripple rail services in Scotland during COP26 has been called off after the RMT accepted a pay deal. The union said the offer would provide them with a one year 2.5% pay rise, improved conditions and a Â£300 COP payment for all ScotRail staff. It also means an end to Sunday strikes which have been ongoing since March. ScotRail welcomed the agreement, which comes just four days before the start of the UN climate summit. The Scottish government said it was ""proud"" to have brokered and funded the deal. The announcement was made on Wednesday evening following talks between the trade union and transport bosses. RMT Scotland organiser Michael Hogg told the BBC: ""For the first time in eight and a half months, normality returns to Scotland's trains."" Speaking on theGood Morning Scotland programme, he said the new deal meant efficiency savings, which had been a sticking point, were off the agenda at least for a year. ""The [original] two-year deal included efficiency savings that were unacceptable to the RMT, so we are happy and delighted that we have been able to secure a one-year deal that allows us to actually focus on negotiations next year,"" he said. ScotRail is currently run by Abellio but it is being stripped of its contract amid concerns over its performance. The rail firm will be taken over by acompany owned and controlled by the Scottish governmentin March. Mr Hogg said the union would be able to return to the negotiating table with a new employer. ""Abellio ScotRail are not going to be there next year,"" he said. ""It is going to be the operator of last resort and I hope the main focus has to be getting our  industrial relations back on track in order to have a dialogue next year. ""We are hoping there is going to be a different approach. For the last 18 months negotiations have been protracted and industrial relations have been virtually been destroyed as a result of tactics taken by Abellio ScotRail and Transport Scotland."" Ian McConnell, ScotRail chief operating officer, said: ""We have reached a pay agreement with the RMT trade union that resolves strike action. ""We look forward to Scotland's railway playing its part in delivering a successful COP26 next week."" The union had been given until 17:00 on Wednesday to accept the same deal which had been agreed by three other unions. It then announced ScotRail had accepted a counter offer after the 17:00 deadline. The union confirmed that planned industrial action, scheduled to start on Monday, would be ""withdrawn immediately"" as members welcomed a recent agreement on a pay rise. In a letter sent to union members following talks on Wednesday evening, RMT general secretary Michael Lynch said: ""By accepting the offer all industrial action is now cancelled and I instruct you all to work normally on the days you had previously been instructed to take action on."" Mr Lynch said the union's offer was accepted ""unanimously"" by delegates. Up to 30,000 delegates are set to descend on Glasgow for COP26 Transport minister Graeme Dey said he was pleased the union reached out to restart discussions based on the offer that had been made to them on Sunday. He added: ""Now an agreement has been confirmed the strike action will thankfully come to an end. ""As well as getting the pay rise they deserve, railway workers can now go back to delivering rail services for people right across Scotland and as well as for those attending COP26."" Up to 30,000 delegates are set to descend on Glasgow for COP26, which runs from Sunday to 14 November. Another dispute could see thousands of council workers across Scotland including refuse, recycling, maintenance and school catering and janitorial stafftaking strike action during the second week of the climate talks. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

"Koeman was Barcelona's match-winner in the 1992 European Cup final but has struggled as head coach Ronald Koeman has been sacked as head coach of Barcelona after 14 months in charge at the Nou Camp. Barca have picked up just 15 points from 10 games in La Liga and have already lost twice in the group stage of this season's Champions League. They are ninth in the table, six points adrift of the joint leaders afterlosing at Rayo Vallecanoon Wednesday. The loss was Barca's third in their past four games and it followeddefeat by Real Madrid in Sunday's Clasico. In a statement, the Spanish club said: ""The president of the club, Joan Laporta, informed him [Koeman] of the decision after the defeat against Rayo Vallecano. ""Ronald Koeman will say goodbye to the squad on Thursday."" The former Netherlands, Everton and Southampton boss, 58, could only guide the five-time European champions to third place in the league last season. The Dutchman has not been helped by the club's significant financial problems, which resulted inLionel Messi's exitand subsequent move to Paris St-Germain in August. Barcelona were unable to spend any money on new signings in the summer, with Memphis Depay, Sergio Aguero and Eric Garcia arriving as free transfers and striker Luuk de Jong joining on loan from Sevilla. Speaking after Wednesday's defeat, Koeman said: ""It [Barcelona's league position] says we're not well. ""The team has lost balance in the squad, lost very effective players, which shows. In recent years other clubs have strengthened every season and we haven't, which also shows."" Club legend Xavi, the former Barca midfielder who is now manager of Qatari side Al Sadd, is one of the favourites to replace Koeman. It is the first time since September 1987 that Barca have lost three away games in a row without scoring - a run that saw English manager Terry Venables sacked. Koeman won the Copa del Rey at the end of his first season but Barca finished behind Atletico Madrid and Real Madrid in La Liga with their lowest points tally since 2008. The former Netherlands centre-back played for the Spanish club between 1989 and 1995, helping them to four league titles and scoring the winning goal in the 1992 European Cup final. He was brought back to the club in August 2020 as head coach by former president Josep Maria Bartomeu. New chief Laporta, however, frequently made it clear the Dutchman was not his appointment. The duo had an uneasy relationship, and Koeman released a statement in September asking to be given time to rebuild after losing Messi and fellow forward Antoine Griezmann in the summer. Following the defeat by Madrid on Sunday, Koeman's car was surrounded by some Barcelona supporters, whom he later dismissed as ""uneducated people"". Speaking before the trip to Rayo Vallecano, he said: ""It is a social problem. Uneducated people that don't understand rules and values."" The toxic battle ripping apart a European giant This video can not be played Falcao scores and Depay misses penalty as Barcelona beaten One of Koeman's first tasks as coach was to make a40-second phone call to Luis Suarez,externalduring which he told the Uruguay striker his services were no longer required and that he was free to leave the club. The decision had been made by the board and it's now known the dire financial position forced them to get rid of a forward who scored 21 goals from 29 starts in the previous campaign. It began a weakening of the Barca squad from one that could compete with Europe's elite to one that is struggling to get into the Champions League places. Messi then handed in a transfer requestbut ended up staying for 2020-21 butSuarez joined Atletico Madridfor a nominal fee and fired them to the league title. Behind the scenes the club's costs had spiralled to an unsustainable level, creating the biggest wage bill in world football and leaving Barcelonaon the verge of bankruptcyand a stadium that requires renovation. With Messi out of contract, the Argentina superstaragreed a new deal in July of this yearuntil 2026 that included halving his wages, but La Liga stipulated Barca must reduce their wage bill further before he and any new players could be registered. They weren't able to do that, so in August the club announced thatMessi would be leaving""because of financial and structural obstacles"". He joined Paris St-Germain, then Koeman lost more talent when France forward Griezmann followed Suarez to Atletico Madrid - rejoining the club he had left in aÂ£107m dealtwo years before on a loan in a snapshot of where it has gone wrong for Barcelona. They managed to sign former Manchester United forward Depay and Aguero on free transfers but the former Manchester City striker has only just made his Barca debut after getting injured in pre-season. The transformation from a forward line of Messi, Suarez and Griezmann to Depay, De Jong and an ageing Aguero sums up the task Koeman faced and which will now greet his successor.

"The row began after the UK and Jersey rejected dozens of licences for French boats to fish in their waters The UK has said threats to block British boats from French ports in a dispute over fishing rights are a breach of international law and trade agreements. France said if there is no agreement by 2 November it will also tighten checks on UK boats and trucks, and could target Channel Island energy supplies. Brexit Minister Lord Frost said the stance was ""disappointing"". He said the UK was seeking ""urgent clarification"" of France's plans. France was angered by a decision from the UK and Jersey last month to deny fishing licences to dozens of French boats, and argued that it breached the Brexit deal. French anger as UK rejects most fishing permits Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit deal mean for fishing? On Wednesday it issued its ultimatum, saying it would begin to impose ""targeted measures"" from Tuesday of next week, including: Preventing British fishing boats from disembarking at ports Increasing border and sanitary checks on UK goods Tightening security checks on British boats Increasing checks on trucks going to and from the UK France said it was also preparing further sanctions, which could include cutting electricity supplies to Jersey, as itpreviously threatened in May. ""The French state will continue to support its fisheries industry,"" the government said, adding that it expects answers from the UK ""in the next few days"". On Wednesday French maritime minister Annick Girardintweeted,externalthat two English ships had been fined during checks off Le Havre. She said the first did not comply ""spontaneously"" while the second, which did not have a licence to fish in French waters, was diverted to the quayside and ""handed over to the judicial authority"". Speaking before the news of the two vessels being stopped, Brexit minister Lord Frost said: ""It is very disappointing that France has felt it necessary to make threats late this evening against the UK fishing industry and seemingly traders more broadly. ""As we have had no formal communication from the French government on this matter we will be seeking urgent clarification of their plans. We will consider what further action is necessary in that light."" Downing Street said the ""disappointing and disproportionate"" threat of sanctions was ""not what we would expect from a close ally and partner"". ""The measures being threatened do not appear to be compatible with the Trade and Co-operation Agreement and wider international law, and, if carried through, will be met with an appropriate and calibrated response,"" a spokeswoman said. She said that the UK will raise concerns with both the EU and French government, arguing that it had granted 98% of licence applications from European boats. The UK maintains the rejected applications which sparked the row did not have enough supporting evidence to show they had a history of fishing in Britain's or Jersey's waters.

"Love Island's Gabby Allen has had an Instagram post banned because it was not clearly labelled as an advert which was paid for by Primark. The post, shared in August 2021, used the hashtag #iworkwithprimark in its caption. However the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that was ""ambiguous, and did not fully explain her relationship with Primark."" Gabby Allen said the post had been updated to include the label #ad. However, the ASA still upheld the complaint. It says #ad should have been put nearer the start of the caption, so it was ""immediately visible to consumers viewing the post in-feed on Instagram."" It holds Primark and Gabby Allen ""jointly responsible"" for making sure their posts follow the rules. Newsbeat has contacted Gabby Allen's representatives for comment. The ASA found the relationship between Gabby Allen and Primark was not fully explained The original post showed a picture of Gabby Allen with the caption: ""Feeling fab but chilled Wearing these jeans and top from one and only @primark #iworkwithprimark"". Primark said the #iworkwithprimark label was enough for followers to know that this was a sponsored post. But the ASA says it ""did not fully explain [Gaby Allen's] relationship with Primark."" It adds that the hashtag is ""long and unclear, and its content and meaning would not have been immediately obvious to consumers."" Gabby - who came fourth in the 2017 series of Love Island - has 1.1 million followers on Instagram. She's by no means the first influencer to have been been called out by the ASA for not labelling an ad correctly on social media. The ASA has looked at 122 UK-based influencers - and according to Ed Senior, ""overall compliance was disappointing"". He is a compliance executive at the ASA, and his job is to make sure advertising rules are being followed - he suggests that can be done in a few different ways. The rules say content has to ""be clear, obvious and identifiable as advertising"". Putting a hashtag #ad is one way, but he says they could also verbally say it's an advert at the start of a video. ""It needs to be clear and obviously up front, prior to engagement. So that's why, even when they added #ad at the end, it wouldn't be enough to comply with the rules."" Delivery text scams and how to deal with them Reality stars auditioned to 'promote' poison diet drink Lauren Goodger forex ad banned from Instagram If someone breaks the rules, there are different levels of sanctions. Ed says the ASA will get someone to amend the content so it follows the rules, or get them to remove it. If things escalate, people can be placed on a public list, with the ASA working with platforms to remove further content and eventually even referring them to legal authorities. This year, Love Island'sLuke Mabbott, Towie'sLauren Goodgerand TikTok collectiveThe Wave Househave all been made to take posts down because they weren't clearly labelled as adverts. In August, the ASA named and shamedfour celebritieswho it said repeatedly broke the rules: Chloe Khan, Jodie Marsh, Lucy Mecklenburgh and Chloe Ferry. Molly-Mae Hague was found to havebroken the rulesover a competition she tried to run on Instagram. ""Targeting someone like Molly-Mae sends a message to other influencers, who may have smaller followings, to remind them that they are under the same requirements as any other brand,"" Nick Breen from law firm Reed Smith told the BBC at the time.

"One opinion poll suggests most Poles think the government should either concede or compromise The EU's top court has told Poland to pay a daily fine of â¬1m (Â£850,000) in a row over judicial reforms. Earlier this year, Poland was ordered to suspend a controversial disciplinary chamber, but has not yet done so. It is the latest development in a bitter feud with the EU over changes that are seen as weakening the independence of Polish courts. The hefty penalty was immediately denounced as ""blackmail"" by Polish government spokesman Piotr Muller. Some fear the escalating situation could put Poland's membership in the EU at risk. Earlier this month, Poland's constitutional court ruled that Polish law supersedes EU law when there is a conflict between the two - angering European leaders by, in effect, rejecting the primacy of EU law. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it was a ""direct challenge to the unity of the European legal order"". The disciplinary chamber of Poland's Supreme Court was set up in 2018 to penalise top judges where necessary - the government said it was needed to fight corruption. But critics argue it is being used to punish independent judges because it has the power to sanction the content of their rulings. In July, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ordered it to be shut down as it was neither sufficiently independent nor impartial. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said Brussels was making demands with a ""gun to our head"" and insisted that EU institutions have no right to tell Poland how to organise its judiciary. He did agree to dismantle the chamber, however, but never gave a date. BBC Warsaw correspondent Adam Easton says the Supreme Court has stopped scheduling new cases for the chamber, but it has continued hearing cases that are already scheduled. Poland stokes fears of leaving EU in 'Polexit' One significant factor in the row is that the European Commission is yet to approve â¬57bn (Â£48bn; $66bn) of Covid-19 recovery funds earmarked for Poland, and may not do so until this dispute is settled. An opinion poll on Tuesday suggested that 40.8% of Poles believed their government should concede defeat and end the row, while another 32.5% said it should compromise. The ECJ's ruling on Wednesday stated that the fine of â¬1m a day would have to be paid until Poland either suspended the chamber or until the final ruling on its future. The vice-president said the fine was being imposed to deter Poland,externalfrom further delaying the shut down of the chamber and said it was necessary to ""avoid serious and irreparable harm to the legal order of the European Union"". Poland's Deputy Justice Minister Sebastian Kaleta said the ruling ""completely disregards and ignores the Polish constitution and the rulings of the Polish constitutional tribunal"". This video can not be played European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says she is ""deeply concerned"" about Poland's court ruling Poland's leader told the European Parliament this month it was ""unacceptable to talk about financial penalties"" and he accused the EU of overstepping its powers. His conservative-nationalist government has already been ordered by the ECJ to pay â¬500,000 a day for failing to shut down temporarily the enormous Turow coal mine and power plant close to the German and Czech borders. Poland has refused to pay that fine because it argues the plant heats and provides water to local homes.

"The impact of Brexit on the UK economy will be worse in the long run compared to the coronavirus pandemic, the chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility has said. Richard Hughes said leaving the EU would reduce the UK's potential GDP by about 4% in the long term. He said forecasts showed the pandemic would reduce GDP ""by a further 2%"". ""In the long term it is the case that Brexit has a bigger impact than the pandemic"", he told the BBC. His comments come after the OBR said the cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, with suggestions inflation could hit almost 5%. Speaking after Wednesday's Budget, Mr Hughes said recent data showed the impact of Brexit was ""broadly consistent"" with the OBR's assumption that the leaving the EU would ""reduce our long run GDP by around 4%"". ""We think that the effect of the pandemic will reduce that (GDP) output by a further 2%,"" he added. The Treasury has been contacted for comment. What is GDP and how is it measured? GDP or Gross Domestic Product is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It is a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy. In a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly higher than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer. If GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc on 31 January 2020, however, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, before a new trade deal was announced and implemented on 1 January this year. Both the pandemic and Brexit have played a part in current supply chain issues across the UK, and have further exposed the scarcity of lorry drivers, which has resulted in recent shortages of products for businesses and some empty shelves for customers. However, in the OBR's latest report, the independent body said ""supply bottlenecks had been exacerbated by changes in the migration and trading regimes following Brexit"". Supply chain issues has led to the government granting short-term visas to EU workers across certain sectors, including the haulage industry. The British Poultry Council has said turkey farmers will do their best to ensure Christmas ""is as normal as it can be"", but warned shortages are likely, due to ashortage of seasonal overseas workers. The government has assured consumers that turkeys will be available for the festive season and has also deployed temporary visas in a bid to bolster worker numbers.

"The money for this Government spending has to be found somewhere Rishi Sunak might liken himself to a reluctant taxman, but his strategic decision has been to spend at the same time as keeping borrowing down, so taxation has taken the hit. There are four big figures that tell the broad story here. The really good news is that unemployment is now forecast to peak at 5.2%. However, a significant spike in inflation to higher than 4%, set to last a year or so, partly reflects rising energy and fuel prices. Meanwhile, taxation as a proportion of the economy at 36.2% is at its highest level since the 1950s Labour Atlee government. And spending as a proportion of the economy, at nearly 42%, is at its highest sustained level since the 1970s. All that leaves the British state under a Conservative government permanently bigger as a legacy of the pandemic. But borrowing at the end of the new forecast is even lower than forecast before the pandemic. And so the big story is that the corporation tax rises from the March Budget, required to shore up public finances after bad forecasts, have been kept as they were, even as those bad forecasts have been reversed. There might have been some room to delay those tax rises or extend the corporation super deduction. But that extra taxation has been kept to be deployed mainly in terms of extra spending. That spending has been sprinkled towards some help with cost of living, and some surgery on the economy to improve skills and long term productivity. Unprotected areas of the public finances forecast for a continuing squeeze have all been topped up. All will now enjoy rising spending. Rishi Sunak has a better economic backdrop than he expected - but will keep business tax rises despite this To be clear, the slowing in the rise in unemployment would have been scarcely believable 18 months ago and is the best measure of the pandemic economic rescue plan's success. But before the Budget, I raised the question as to whether, after furlough, the public were becoming used to the idea that the government should solve problems such as rising living costs. Despite the chancellor's protestations of his love for low, tax free-market conservatism, his actions show an attachment to higher tax and spending. With new restraints on the ability to borrow, delivering on lowering this tax burden will require the economy to grow far more robustly than the disappointing rates forecast after 2023 of as low as 1.3%. Small wonder that the chancellor was proclaiming a ""new era of optimism"" for the economy. To deliver on his promises to reverse tax rises, that isn't just a hope, it's a necessity.

Your writers today were Jennifer Scott, Sinead Wilson, Richard Morris, Dearbail Jordon and Victoria Lindrea. Your editors were Hamish Mackay, Claire Heald, Kevin Ponniah and Emma Harrison. You can find more of our in-depth coverage onthe BBC News website, but here is a little round-up before we close the page for the night. Parliament's official photographer Jessica Taylor was in the Commons to capture the event Rishi Sunak in the moments before his Budget speech sitting next to Prime Minister Boris Johnson (and looking a little nervous...) The Commons was packed with MPs to hear what Sunak had to say In full flow, the chancellor even appeared to be enjoying himself... And the (largely unmasked) Tory backbenchers enjoyed his performance... But Labour's Rachel Reeves was ready with a list of criticisms Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent One of the biggest savings
for the chancellor is the change in policy on the state pension triple lock. The temporary removal of the
earnings linkwas announced in September. Now, the Office for Budget
Responsibility says that will save the Treasury Â£5.4bn in the next financial
year. There
will be a rise of 3.1% in the state pension in April. That will add Â£4.25 more
a week to Â£141.85 for those on the older state pension, and an increase of
Â£5.55 to Â£185.15 a week for the newer flat-rate state pension. It
does mean that pensioners will get a predicted real terms cut â as inflation is
forecast to be 4% next year. Had
the government stuck to the triple lock, the rise would have been 8.3% - which
it describes as an anomaly caused by the pandemic. The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the UK's fiscal watchdog has warned. The Office for Budget Responsibility's latest forecast says that inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% next year. But it adds that figures released since its report was compiled suggests inflation could hit almost 5%. Read more here about the cost of living and where it is heading. Reality Check The chancellor is
spending more than Â£2bn a year reducing the taper rate on universal credit from
63% to 55% and increasing the amount some workers can earn before they lose
benefits. The taper rate is
the rate at which universal credit claimants lose benefits if they earn more
money. For some workers,
the cut to the taper rate will more than make up for the loss of the Â£20 a week
uplift to universal credit. The chancellor
gave the example of a single mother of two, renting her home and working full-time on the national living wage, who would indeed be better off by more than
Â£20 a week. But not all
claimants will recoup the losses. The changes will only benefit universal
credit claimants who are in work, for example, so a household in which nobody
was working would still be worse off. Also, a person
without children working 20 hours a week at the national living wage would
probably not benefit by as much as Â£20 a week. You can read more about it here. Jonathan JosephsBBC business reporter The UKâs economic recovery appears to be stronger than that
of Germany, the EU's so-called engine room. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects the UK economy to return to pre-pandemic levels âaround the turn of the yearâ and lifted its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for 2021 to 6.5%. Meanwhile in Germany, it has just announced it will now take three months longer - to the end of March - for its economy to reach pre-Covid levels. And Germanyâs growth forecast for this year has been cut
from 3.5% to 2.6%. Germany's economy minister Peter Altmaier says thatâs because of supply chain problems, higher energy
prices and a lack of computer chips which means less cars are being made. Vaccine rollout,
inflation and global supply chain problems are all reasons that a huge amount
of uncertainty remains for economies everywhere - and in this environment, the outlook for different nations can change pretty quickly. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Rishi Sunak portrays himself as a light touch Tory who doesn't like heavy taxes and who doesn't like big government. But he's not using the fading of the pandemic emergency to call time on hefty spending. Nor is the chancellor seizing a moment to argue for a leaner state. Instead, his plans seem to increase spending everywhere, in a Budget that on first examination has something for everyone. Sunak even chose to emphasise how he's restoring spending in some areas to levels not seen since Labour was in charge - though he is less keen to remind you they were cut back by successive administrations made up of his Tory colleagues. Despite dangling the promise of tax cuts by 2024, the Budget seems to confirm the political conclusions of Sunak and Boris Johnson - vows to shrink the state are not going to win them the next election. But with the threat of inflation, higher taxes and puny, if better growth, the seeming largesse may not be toasted by the public in the months to come, even they could do so with cheaper cider or prosecco. In Scotland, many of the big decisions about tax and spending are made by the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh,  but Rishi Sunak has given an extraÂ£4.6bn per year to Holyroodto allocate to departments. In Wales, Welsh government budgets will increase by anaverage of Â£2.5bn a year, with a total of Â£120m also earmarked for ten Welsh levelling-up projects. And in Northern Ireland there will be anadditional Â£1.6bn a year for public serviceswith infrastructure spending increasing by an average of 2.5% a year up to 2025. If you missed Rishi Sunak's Budget statement earlier, here's a quick recap of some of the main points:  You can readour main story on the Budget here. For those short on time, you can readthe key points at-a-glance here. And for those of you even shorter on time you can watchthis video with the main announcements in 126 seconds. Sir Keir Starmer released a video from home saying he was fine, but the Budget wasn't... Just minutes before PMQs - and less than an hour before the chancellor delivered his Budget speech - the Labour Party leader tested positive for Covid. Sir Keir Starmer had been due to respond to both the prime minister and Rishi Sunak in the Commons. But instead he had to isolate at home, passing on the job to his shadow business secretary (and former leader) Ed Miliband and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves.

However, he says the Budget does âlittle to addressâ labour
shortages and adds it is also âworryingly short on action to tackle rising
inflationâ. âGiven the pressures they are facing, many manufacturers
will simply have no choice but continue to pass costs down the chain,â he says. Dennis asks our final question. Helen CattPolitical Correspondent That is a very good point. The Speaker of the House of Commons is really quite cross about this becayse what the government is supposed to do, by convention, is announce policies in Parliament first. That's so that MPs can pick them apart and hold ministers to account. There were still some surprises today though - the Universal Credit changes and the reform of alcohol duty. Helen CattPolitical Correspondent We found out about the new tax to raise money for social care earlier this year. In fact, there were not any nasty tax rises in this Budget. But that's because they had already done it with the upcoming rise in National Insurance, which will become the health and social care levy. That is a significant tax and it will raise raise Â£12bn for both the NHS and social care. We are still waiting for more detail on that, but it didn't come in the Budget. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent No. There are some changes that apply to all businesses, but there are some targeted ones too. Those ones -the 50% discount specifically- are aimed at those kind of sectors struggling to get back on their feet, such as hospitality and leisure. And no-one knows what is going to happen in the next few months, so there appears to be some caution from the Treasury in case those businesses get hit again. Kamala asks... Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent Not today, no. We have had some relief for businesses over the coming months but there wasn't very much in there for self-employed workers. We had that fiddling around last month with national insurance to finance the health and social care levy, but today, despite the length of the speech, nothing for the self-employed. A question from Stephen... Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent We do have some concrete details on that. As of next April, the National Living Wage - as it's now called - will go up by 6.6% if you're over 23. That takes it to Â£9.50 per hour. If you work full time, you might see an increase of around Â£1,000 per year. This announcement was actually made ahead of time,which we reported on here. A question from Alan... Helen CattPolitical Correspondent Some of the Budget is for the whole of the UK, some of it is just for England. There are some things that Westminster does for the whole of the UK, and some things the devolved administrations do for themselves. So, things like money for local councils will be England only - but then Scotland, Wales and NI will get a proportionate amount of money based on that announcement and they can decide what to do with it themselves. So the whole Budget is a bit of a mix and you have to look at polcies individually to see whether they are UK-wide or not. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent We've had a lot of questions on this theme. The answer is the bulk of it comes from us as taxpayers. We pay hundreds of billions of pounds in to the Treasury every year but they also need to top it up and they do. They can borrow from the financial markets and because they are the government they are much more reliable than the rest of us when it comes to paying back money so they can normally borrow at very low rates indeed.

Parliament's official photographer Jessica Taylor was in the Commons to capture the event Rishi Sunak in the moments before his Budget speech sitting next to Prime Minister Boris Johnson (and looking a little nervous...) The Commons was packed with MPs to hear what Sunak had to say In full flow, the chancellor even appeared to be enjoying himself... And the (largely unmasked) Tory backbenchers enjoyed his performance... But Labour's Rachel Reeves was ready with a list of criticisms Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent One of the biggest savings
for the chancellor is the change in policy on the state pension triple lock. The temporary removal of the
earnings linkwas announced in September. Now, the Office for Budget
Responsibility says that will save the Treasury Â£5.4bn in the next financial
year. There
will be a rise of 3.1% in the state pension in April. That will add Â£4.25 more
a week to Â£141.85 for those on the older state pension, and an increase of
Â£5.55 to Â£185.15 a week for the newer flat-rate state pension. It
does mean that pensioners will get a predicted real terms cut â as inflation is
forecast to be 4% next year. Had
the government stuck to the triple lock, the rise would have been 8.3% - which
it describes as an anomaly caused by the pandemic. The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the UK's fiscal watchdog has warned. The Office for Budget Responsibility's latest forecast says that inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% next year. But it adds that figures released since its report was compiled suggests inflation could hit almost 5%. Read more here about the cost of living and where it is heading. Reality Check The chancellor is
spending more than Â£2bn a year reducing the taper rate on universal credit from
63% to 55% and increasing the amount some workers can earn before they lose
benefits. The taper rate is
the rate at which universal credit claimants lose benefits if they earn more
money. For some workers,
the cut to the taper rate will more than make up for the loss of the Â£20 a week
uplift to universal credit. The chancellor
gave the example of a single mother of two, renting her home and working full-time on the national living wage, who would indeed be better off by more than
Â£20 a week. But not all
claimants will recoup the losses. The changes will only benefit universal
credit claimants who are in work, for example, so a household in which nobody
was working would still be worse off. Also, a person
without children working 20 hours a week at the national living wage would
probably not benefit by as much as Â£20 a week. You can read more about it here. Jonathan JosephsBBC business reporter The UKâs economic recovery appears to be stronger than that
of Germany, the EU's so-called engine room. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects the UK economy to return to pre-pandemic levels âaround the turn of the yearâ and lifted its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for 2021 to 6.5%. Meanwhile in Germany, it has just announced it will now take three months longer - to the end of March - for its economy to reach pre-Covid levels. And Germanyâs growth forecast for this year has been cut
from 3.5% to 2.6%. Germany's economy minister Peter Altmaier says thatâs because of supply chain problems, higher energy
prices and a lack of computer chips which means less cars are being made. Vaccine rollout,
inflation and global supply chain problems are all reasons that a huge amount
of uncertainty remains for economies everywhere - and in this environment, the outlook for different nations can change pretty quickly. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Rishi Sunak portrays himself as a light touch Tory who doesn't like heavy taxes and who doesn't like big government. But he's not using the fading of the pandemic emergency to call time on hefty spending. Nor is the chancellor seizing a moment to argue for a leaner state. Instead, his plans seem to increase spending everywhere, in a Budget that on first examination has something for everyone. Sunak even chose to emphasise how he's restoring spending in some areas to levels not seen since Labour was in charge - though he is less keen to remind you they were cut back by successive administrations made up of his Tory colleagues. Despite dangling the promise of tax cuts by 2024, the Budget seems to confirm the political conclusions of Sunak and Boris Johnson - vows to shrink the state are not going to win them the next election. But with the threat of inflation, higher taxes and puny, if better growth, the seeming largesse may not be toasted by the public in the months to come, even they could do so with cheaper cider or prosecco. In Scotland, many of the big decisions about tax and spending are made by the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh,  but Rishi Sunak has given an extraÂ£4.6bn per year to Holyroodto allocate to departments. In Wales, Welsh government budgets will increase by anaverage of Â£2.5bn a year, with a total of Â£120m also earmarked for ten Welsh levelling-up projects. And in Northern Ireland there will be anadditional Â£1.6bn a year for public serviceswith infrastructure spending increasing by an average of 2.5% a year up to 2025.

"The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the government's forecaster has warned. Its latest forecast says inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% in 2022. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says figures released since its report was compiled suggest inflation could hit almost 5%. The chancellor acknowledged that household budgets are strained. Rishi Sunak described the overall economic picture as ""strong"" in the short term, with the OBR now expecting the economy to return to its pre-pandemic level six months earlier than it had forecast previously. However, he acknowledged the inflation rate was ""likely to rise further"" from its 3.1% rate in September. He said it was due to increased demand for energy and supply chain issues as economies and factories reopening following coronavirus lockdowns. ""The pressures caused by supply chains and energy prices will take months to ease,"" Mr Sunak said. ""It would be irresponsible for anyone to pretend that we can solve this overnight."" The UK's exit from the European Union (EU) has exacerbated supply chain problems such at hold-ups at ports or with deliveries, the OBR saidin its latest report,external. The OBR also said the fact that the energy price cap has risen was a big factor behind the rising cost of living. The cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The independent forecaster suggested that had its figures been more up-to-date, its inflation forecasts would have painted a more bleak picture for consumers and businesses. It previously said,externalit had ended any updates to its forecast on 24 September, earlier than usual, and ""in response to a request from the chancellor"". Richard Hughes, chairman of the OBR, told BBC News that if inflation started feeding into wages, rather than just products in the shops, the problem could persist for longer. But the OBR lifted its prediction for economic growth in 2021 to 6.5%, up from its previous forecast of 4%. It has also reduced its estimate of the long-term ""scarring"" effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%. The effectiveness of Covid vaccines and the adaptability of consumers and businesses had sped up the recovery, the OBR said. But it forecast that economic growth would be lower next year than it previously thought, partly down to a better performance in 2021. In 2022, gross domestic product (GDP), which measures all the activity of companies, governments and people in an economy, will increase by 6%, the OBR said, rather than the 7.3% it predicted in March. Growth is forecast to be 2.1% in 2023, 1.3% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025. While the economy is in a stronger state than had been expected, whether in terms of growth, employment or the public finances - the official analysis makes clear the obstacle inflation poses to standards of living in the coming months.

And, it makes clear that leaving the EU has heightened the UK's experience of the bottlenecks that are bumping up business costs, that in turn will lead to higher prices. That higher cost of living, together with looming tax rises will dampen the effect of wage rises over the next couple of years. Strip out inflation and the OBR reckons that household income after tax will only recover to pre-pandemic levels in mid-2023. And those lost years of prosperity increases could weigh on growth - and sentiment in the run up to the next election. Higher inflation is also likely to put pressure on how much the chancellor is able to spend in the future. But Mr Sunak has been offered some room for manoeuvre, as the improving economic picture and higher tax incomes means the government will not have to borrow as much. Borrowing hit a record Â£319.9bn during the 2020 financial year as the government poured money into pandemic support schemes such as furlough. It is now forecast to fall every year between 2021 and 2026. Jane Mackay, head of tax at audit, tax, advisory and risk firm Crowe, said there was still a ""huge"" Covid bill to deal with, though. ""The Budget statement hasn't really given us clarity on who will pay that bill. ""The tax increases that were announced before the Budget, including corporation tax rising to 25%, and the NHS and social care levy additional NICs of 1.25%, might suggest the strategy will spread the burden as widely as possible, rather than to make the structural changes to our tax system that may be what is really needed.""

"The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the government's forecaster has warned. Its latest forecast says inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% in 2022. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says figures released since its report was compiled suggest inflation could hit almost 5%. The chancellor acknowledged that household budgets are strained. Rishi Sunak described the overall economic picture as ""strong"" in the short term, with the OBR now expecting the economy to return to its pre-pandemic level six months earlier than it had forecast previously. However, he acknowledged the inflation rate was ""likely to rise further"" from its 3.1% rate in September. He said it was due to increased demand for energy and supply chain issues as economies and factories reopening following coronavirus lockdowns. ""The pressures caused by supply chains and energy prices will take months to ease,"" Mr Sunak said. ""It would be irresponsible for anyone to pretend that we can solve this overnight."" The UK's exit from the European Union (EU) has exacerbated supply chain problems such at hold-ups at ports or with deliveries, the OBR saidin its latest report,external. The OBR also said the fact that the energy price cap has risen was a big factor behind the rising cost of living. The cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The independent forecaster suggested that had its figures been more up-to-date, its inflation forecasts would have painted a more bleak picture for consumers and businesses. It previously said,externalit had ended any updates to its forecast on 24 September, earlier than usual, and ""in response to a request from the chancellor"". Richard Hughes, chairman of the OBR, told BBC News that if inflation started feeding into wages, rather than just products in the shops, the problem could persist for longer. But the OBR lifted its prediction for economic growth in 2021 to 6.5%, up from its previous forecast of 4%. It has also reduced its estimate of the long-term ""scarring"" effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%. The effectiveness of Covid vaccines and the adaptability of consumers and businesses had sped up the recovery, the OBR said. But it forecast that economic growth would be lower next year than it previously thought, partly down to a better performance in 2021. In 2022, gross domestic product (GDP), which measures all the activity of companies, governments and people in an economy, will increase by 6%, the OBR said, rather than the 7.3% it predicted in March. Growth is forecast to be 2.1% in 2023, 1.3% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025. While the economy is in a stronger state than had been expected, whether in terms of growth, employment or the public finances - the official analysis makes clear the obstacle inflation poses to standards of living in the coming months.

"Shops, restaurants and bars and gyms in England which have been badly hit by the Covid-19 pandemic have been given a financial boost in the Budget. Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a temporary 50% cut in their business rates, up to a maximum of Â£110,000. In addition, he has scrapped 2022's planned annual increase in rates for all firms for the second year in a row. The hospitality industry welcomed the move, although it added ""the devil will be in the detail"". Business rates are charged on commercial premises based on the value of the property and the level is set by central government, rather than councils. They are devolved across the UK's nations. The Treasury only decides business rates in England, but the UK government also allocates funding to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland through a formula. This could allow the devolved nations to mirror the changes in England or, alternatively, keep their current business rates and spend the money elsewhere. Bricks and mortar firms have long complained that they are at an unfair disadvantage compared with online retailers, which do not have to pay business rates. They want to see an online sales tax being applied. In his Budget speech, Mr Sunak said that in the 2022-23 tax year, pubs, music venues, cinemas, restaurants, hotels, theatres and gyms would be able to claim a discount on their bills of 50%, up to a maximum of Â£110,000. He said that was a tax cut worth almost Â£1.7bn. In conjunction with the existing Small Business Rates Relief, the chancellor said the move meant more than 90% of all retail, hospitality and leisure businesses would see a discount of at least 50%. Business rates in the retail and leisure sectors have already been reduced during the present financial year following the rates holiday during the pandemic. Economy set to hit pre-Covid level at end of year Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money Taxes cut on sparkling wine and draught beer The Treasury has been carrying out a wider review of business rates. In his Budget speech, Mr Sunak confirmed they would be retained and reformed. ""We on this side of the House are clear that reckless, unfunded promises to abolish a tax which raises Â£25bn every year are completely irresponsible."" However, he said the system would be made ""fairer and timelier with more frequent revaluations every three years"". beginning in 2023. In addition, from 2023, all firms, not just in retail and hospitality, would be able to make improvements to their property without having to pay extra business rates for 12 months. The reforms also include a new relief for firms that invest in green technologies, such as solar panels and heat pumps. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls: ""We have been lobbying hard for significant reform of the outdated business rates system and therefore very much welcome the chancellor's move today to extend the 50% business rates relief for the hospitality and leisure sector for the next financial year. ""The devil will be in the detail, though, so we look forward to learning to what extent it will benefit businesses."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Nicholls also said announcements simplifying, and in some cases cutting, alcohol duties were ""great news"" for pubs, bars and restaurants and ""will benefit all"". However, she added: ""Positive as these announcements are, hospitality remains incredibly fragile, facing myriad critical issues. Rising utility bills, wage bills and food and drink prices have resulted in 13% inflationary costs that businesses are having to absorb at the same time as they navigate severe supply chain issues and chronic staff shortages. ""Given this toxic cocktail, it is imperative the government go further to support businesses in our sector."" She said the best way to do that would be to keep the current lower rate of 12.5% VAT on hospitality. ""The chancellor has been bold and radical withalcohol duty- we urge him to adopt the same approach when implementing root and branch reform of business rates, to ensure industries share the burden equally."" Elsewhere, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), Shevaun Haviland, said the chancellor had listened to the BCC's ""long-standing calls for changes to the business rates system and this will be good news for many firms"". ""It will provide much-needed relief for businesses across the country, giving many firms renewed confidence to invest and grow."" CBI director general Tony Danker said the chancellor had made ""real strides in making the system more palatable for businesses in the shorter term. More frequent valuations, wider reliefs and improving the incentives for firms to decarbonise their premises is what firms have been calling for"". However, he added that the ""hard truth"" was that ""the government missed the opportunity to truly reform a business rates system that diminishes Britain's high streets and factories"". Julian Bird, chief executive of Society of London Theatre and UK Theatre, welcomed the move, saying it would ""provide venue operators with the cushion of a lower cost base as they reopen and develop an audience post-pandemic. ""The 100% improvement relief for business rates, providing 12 months relief from higher bills for occupiers where eligible improvements to an existing property increase the rateable value, from 2023 will encourage innovation and enhancement of our theatre buildings,"" he added.

"Marmots at Twycross Zoo - one of the winners of the Levelling Up fund A zoo in Bosworth and a pool in Halifax are among the beneficiaries of the government's levelling up fund. The Â£4.8bn pot of money was launched last year and now the Treasuryhas said which areas,externalwere successful in their bids for the first tranche of cash. Local authorities, with the support of local MPs, could apply for money for regeneration and transport projects. Newly-appointed levelling-up secretary Michael Govehas said the policy,externalwould mean people would see a visible difference in their area. However, critics of this fund have questioned whether small pots of money for local projects across the UK will transform the economy and create jobs long-term without a country-wide strategy. Addressing the Conservative conference earlier this month, Mr Gove said ""levelling up"" was also about long-term economic transformation. Successful bids for the initial Â£1.4bn pot of money include: Â£19.9m for Twycross Zoo in Bosworth Â£19.5m for Rotherham town centre Â£20m for Bolton College of Medical Science Â£12.2m for Halifax swimming pool Â£20m for Aberdeen City Centre Â£9.3m  to upgrade Whitechapel Road in East London. Aberdeen will get Â£20m to improve its city centre Analysis by political correspondent Ione Wells The government has been under pressure to define what their much-touted policy - ""levelling up"" - actually means. We know it's usually used to describe tackling regional inequality - but has at times been a catch-all phrase to promote everything from more money for tennis courts to tackling crime. The government's new levelling up secretary, Michael Gove, has previously said the first part of it involves people seeing a visible difference in their areas being made more attractive - which the government hopes these pots of cash will start to do. But he's also said levelling up involves long-term economic transformation and job creation. Critics of this fund have questioned whether or not small pots for different local projects around the UK - bid for competitively by councils and local MPs - will strategically transform the economy or create jobs long-term. Though the government would argue other policies, like their cut to the universal credit taper rate and investment in transport links, are more targeting these things. The fund has also been criticised for not giving devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a role in handing out the cash, especially where bids involve funding things like infrastructure that might otherwise be a matter for governments there to make decisions on. We also don't know who the 'losers' were in this first round of bids, and which areas missed out on cash. In his Budget speech the chancellor appeared to deliberately address accusations of 'pork-barrel' politics - as bids had to be backed by local MPs and bypassed devolved governments. Pork barrel politics is term generally used to refer disapprovingly of politicians funnelling money to their own constituents, regardless of need. However, Mr Sunak specifically referred to the three successful bids in Conservative Stoke-on-Trent seats but also highlighted the successful bids in Ashton under Lyne, Doncaster, South Leicester, Sunderland and West Leeds - which include the seats of Angela Rayner, Ed Miliband, Jonathan Ashworth, Rachel Reeves and Bridget Philipson - all members of Labour's shadow cabinet. He said: ""We are so committed to levelling up that we are even levelling up the opposition front bench."" Moseley Road Baths is over 100 years old Responding to the Budget, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the chancellor ""gives with one hand but takes so much more with the other"". She accused Mr Sunak and Prime Minister Boris Johnson of operating a ""classic con game"". ""The prime minister is the front man - distracting people with his wild promises -all the while, his chancellor dips his hand in their pocket. ""It all seems like fun and games until you walk away and realise your purse has been lifted."" Analysis by Peter Barnes and Joseph Cassidy, BBC Political Research Unit The list of successful bids includes 76 in England, 11 in Northern Ireland, 10 in Wales and 8 in Scotland (105 total) with a total value of Â£1.7bn. In some instances more than one parliamentary constituency is set to benefit, and in some cases it's hard to judge how the effects will be shared between constituencies. But BBC analysis suggests the following breakdown by party: Conservative-only constituencies: Â£627m Labour-only constituencies: Â£507m SNP-only constituencies: Â£135m Other parties/local authority areas with more than one party: Â£424m Montgomery Canal will get Â£15.5m Over Twitter, Mr Sunak challenged Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, to celebrate the news that as part of the fund, Â£17.6m would go toward improving Leicester railway station. ""Let me know if you want me to retweet,"" he said. Mr Ashworth hit back tweeting: ""We're still waiting for you to properly compensate our Leicester businesses for forcing a local lockdown on us last year or reverse the increasing numbers of children in poverty across Leicester thanks to your cuts. ""Let me know when that's sorted so I can retweet,"" he replied.

"Assange pictured leaving court in January 2020 Lawyers for the US have told the High Court the judge who blocked Julian Assange's extradition was misled by his psychiatrist. The United States government is starting a legal appeal to try to get the Wikileaks founder extradited. In January, a court ruled Mr Assange could not be extradited to the US due to concerns over his mental health. Mr Assange is wanted over the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011. The documents revealed how the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents during the war in Afghanistan, while leaked Iraq war files showed the 66,000 civilians had been killed and prisoners tortured by Iraqi forces. The US says the leaks broke the law and endangered lives, but Mr Assange says the case is politically motivated. His lawyer told the court that the risk of suicide would be ""imminent the moment extradition becomes likely"". This video can not be played Watch: From 'teenage hacker' to fighting US extradition - the Julian Assange story UK judge blocks extradition of Wikileaks founder to US The Julian Assange story Wikileaks' document dumps that shook world In January, the district judge overseeing the US's extradition appeal, Vanessa Baraitser, said Mr Assange's publication of classified military and government documents arguably amounted to a crime. But he could not be transferred to the US because he was unwell and could take his own life. On Wednesday, James Lewis QC, representing the US, told the Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justice Holroyde that conclusion was wrong. He said Mr Assange's psychiatrist had misled the earlier judge and the US had not been given an opportunity to answer her concerns. Mr Assange, 50, is wanted in the US on allegations of a conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information following Wikileaks' publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. The publications include the release in April 2010 of footage showing US soldiers shooting and killing civilians from a helicopter in Iraq. Julian Assange's father made his way past a crowd of his son's supporters on his way into court Mr Assange has been in Belmarsh Prison since 2019, when he was carried out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London by police and arrested for breaching his bail conditions. He had been in the embassy since 2012, avoiding extradition to Sweden, where he faced sex offence allegations. He has always denied those and they were eventually dropped. On Wednesday morning, Mr Assange's legal team initially told judges he would not attend because he was not well. He later attended via a video link from prison. US lawyers said it had now given four binding assurances as to how Mr Assange would be treated: It would not impose a highly restrictive form of solitary confinement on Mr Assange before or after trial - although it could do so if he committed a further offence Mr Assange could apply to serve a sentence in Australia and the US would agree to that transfer Prison authorities would ensure Mr Assange would receive ""any clinical and psychological treatment"" that prison doctors recommended Mr Assange would also not be sent to ADX Florence, a US ""supermax"" prison, reserved for the worst offenders. Mr Lewis said the assurances were binding on the United States. He said the previous judge's approach ""carries with it the risk of rewarding fugitives for their flight, and of creating an anomaly between the approach of the courts in domestic criminal proceedings, and in extradition"". Mr Lewis said that Mr Assange's psychiatrist, Prof Michael Kopelman, had misled the court about Mr Assange's psychiatric state by concealing his relationship with his partner, Stella Moris, and that they had two children together. The lawyer for the US argued this meant the judge could not consider the true risks of Mr Assange taking his own life, because the need to protect children can be a factor that discourages people from suicide. He also said that during cross-examination, Prof Kopelman would not accept that Mr Assange could be safe in the US - even if he received a short sentence and reasonable time with other inmates. Mr Assange appeared by video link from Belmarsh Prison, where he has been held since 2019 Mr Lewis called psychiatrist Prof Seena Fazel from the University of Oxford, who said he did not share the defence's view that Mr Assange would certainly take his own life in the US. Mr Assange's lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald QC, said the risk of suicide is ""not something in the future - it is something imminent the moment that extradition becomes likely"". He said Parliament had given district judges the power to protect ""mentally disordered"" people from extradition to countries where the UK has no control over their treatment. He said that in January, the judge took the evidence fully into account and relied on the fact Mr Assange would be isolated and deprived of the protections he had in Belmarsh. The US assurances were ""caveated, vague or simply ineffective"", he said, calling the suggestion that he could be detained in Australia ""meaningless"", as the country has not said it would accept him. Supporters, family members and friends of Mr Assange outside court expressed their ""outrage"" after he did not attend his hearing in person. They said they were concerned he was thin, he was not there to instruct his lawyers or clarify what was going on in court. The High Court hearing is expected to end on Thursday with a decision at a later date. US bid to extradite Assange given legal boost The background to Julian Assange's extradition case.

"Boris Johnson has pledged to make the UK a science superpower The chancellor will increase science spending to Â£20bn a year by 2024 - Â£2bn less than he pledged in 2020. The boost was announced in the Budget by Rishi Sunak on Wednesday. There is some disappointment among many scientific leaders - but the commitment to sustained additional investment has been welcomed by some. The President of the UK's Royal Society, Prof Sir Adrian Smith, told BBC news that the settlement sent out a positive signal. ""It is not absolutely ideal. But we are grown-ups. There are real pressures on the economy, but the government is saying that it really does recognise that R&D [research and development] is absolutely vital,"" he said. Although the chancellor's increase is less many had hoped for, it is more than some had feared. Last week, those negotiating with the Treasury told BBC News they were getting clear signals that the commitment to increase spending to Â£22bn a year would be kicked into the long grass. UK research frozen because of Brexit delay Scientific and business leaders lobbied hard, arguing that a long deferral of scientific investment would mean that other countries, which are investing more in research, would overtake the UK. Those sources say that the Mr Sunak seems to have listened to those arguments. The chancellor said that the commitment of Â£22bn would be pushed back by two years to 2026. But that will be after the next General Election, when someone else might have Mr Sunak's job - and take a different view. But the Chancellor has promised to deliver what has been described as a sizeable increase of around Â£5bn before the end of this Parliament. That's a 33% increase on top of the current research budget of Â£15bn a year. What is notable is that the bulk of the increase will come in 2023, so a large amount of the additional funding for science is not that far away. Some Â£2bn of that increase is for membership of the EU's collaborative research programme, Horizon Europe.BBC News reported earlier this weekthat the UK's access to the programme was being used as a bargaining chip in wider negotiations with the EU over the status of Northern Ireland. Now that the money has been allocated to the science budget, research leaders have a clear choice between spending it on membership fees or on doing more science. The Treasury itself is understood to feel that spending money on Horizon Europe is an inefficient use of funds but will leave the decision to the scientific community. Sir Jeremy Farrar, who is director of the Wellcome Trust, believes that, given the financial pressures the chancellor faces, this is not a bad settlement. ""We welcome the government's ongoing commitment to making the UK a science superpower. But it will need to continue to increase investment in science to catch up with other leading science nations. The UK's investment in R&D as a proportion of GDP lags behind the OECD average, and it will take time to change that,"" he said. Scientific and business leaders say that the most important aspect of the science settlement is that they now have a firm timetable and an upward trajectory for science spending. According to the president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, Prof Sir Jim McDonald, that sends out a clear message to the private sector thinking of investing in research and to overseas scientists and businesses thinking of coming to Britain. ""The comprehensive package of investment for R&D announced today gives much needed confidence to businesses that the UK is a great place to invest. The measures outlined by the chancellor today will stimulate innovation for a better, faster and more resilient recovery."" Follow Pallabon Twitter,external.

"Cuts to foreign aid spending will stay in place until at least 2024-25, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said. Last year the government broke an election pledge when it cut spending to 0.5% of national income, blaming the economic pressures of Covid. During his Budget, Mr Sunak said forecasts suggested the cut could be reversed in three years. WaterAid said this would mean three more years of dirty water and infant mortalities in vulnerable communities. And Bond - a network of international development organisations - accused the government of ""accountancy trickery"" for using the aid budget to pay for excess vaccine doses, debt relief and Special Drawing Rights - a term for complex currency handouts from the International Monetary Fund. Last week, senior government climate change advisersexpressed concernover the Treasury's efforts to broaden the definition of what is included in overseas aid. Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? Government wins vote to lock in cuts to foreign aid Gates and others to partially cover UK aid cuts The promise to spend at least 0.7% of the country's income on international aid became a legal requirement in 2015. In the last general election, the Conservatives told voters it would continue to maintain the spending levels. However in 2020, the government announced it would cut the aid budget from 0.7% to 0.5% of GDP. Defending the reduction, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government had spent Â£407bn during the pandemic and that ""there must inevitably be consequences"". The Treasury said it would return to 0.7% levels, but only when its official figures forecast two things. Firstly, that the government wouldn't be borrowing money for day-to-day spending. And secondly, that underlying debt would be falling as a percentage of national income. Setting out his Budget, Mr Sunak said ""forecasts show that we are scheduled to return to 0.7% in 2024-25 - before the end of the Parliament"". He said the UK would ""remain a development superpower and one of the largest ODA [Overseas Development Assistance] donors in the G7"". The footnotes of the Budget tell the real story about overseas aid. The chancellor is not promising to increase the spending target to 0.7 percent of national income in 2024. He is merely saying it might be possible by then. The so-called 'fiscal tests' are flexible to say the least. The Budget paperwork makes very clear that ""should future forecasts deteriorate"", then any decisions about the aid target will be made at the time. The chancellor also fails to note that by 2024, there may well be a different government with different priorities. And in the intervening years, there is a growing debate not just about the size of the aid budget but also what it is spent on. The Budget documents seem to imply - without being explicit - that the Chancellor will start counting different spending streams towards the 0.5% of the foreign aid target. We await clarity from the Treasury but this could include the cost of overseas vaccine donations and special currency reserve handouts from the International Monetary Fund. Charities fear that this will mean that several billion pounds less will be spent on humanitarian and development aid. So the headline from the Budget is that the UK's billion pound aid cuts will continue for at least another three years and in the meantime much less may well be spent on development and humanitarian support than before. Responding to this announcement, Green MP Caroline Lucas tweeted: ""Is Rishi Sunak really expecting praise for returning to 0.7% GDP for development aid by 2024/5?  This is still utterly shameful.  The cut should be reversed now."" Labour's Sarah Champion - who chairs the International Development Committee - said it was ""good news"" but added: ""I'll celebrate when the poorest in the world start seeing the cash."" Children's charity World Vision UK said it was ""pleased to see"" the chancellor's intention but expressed concern levels would not rise for at least three years. Meanwhile WaterAid warned that: ""Ten million people will miss out every year until the budget is restored. ""The chancellor's delay on restoration means three more years of dirty water, further infant mortality and the wider spread of disease for millions in vulnerable communities."" Stephanie Draper, CEO of Bond, accused the government of ""once again balancing the books on the backs of the poorest and jeopardising trust in the UK around the world"". ""This makes the UK's standing in addressing global inequality even more questionable, whilst severely undermining crucial COP26 negotiations."" Save the Children said any decision to include other costs in the aid budget meant existing aid programmes faced cuts of around Â£3.6bn. Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts?

"Taxes on sparkling wine, draught beer and cider are to be cut, but will rise for stronger drinks such as red wine following a shake-up of alcohol duty. The new system, due to start in 2023, will mean higher duty for stronger alcohol, the chancellor said. The duty premium on sparkling wines will end and the duty on draught beer and cider served in pubs will be cut. Chancellor Rishi Sunak called it the ""most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years"". He also announced that the planned increase in duty on spirits, wine, cider and beer due to take effect from midnight on Wednesday has been cancelled. Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money Follow live coverage of the Budget Economy set to hit pre-Covid level at end of year ""To radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from 15 to just six,"" the chancellor said. ""Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate. This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines, or high-strength 'white ciders' will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed given their strength."" Mr Sunak said many lower alcohol drinks were ""currently overtaxed"", adding: ""Rose, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines - today's changes mean they will pay less."" In relation to sparkling wines, Mr Sunak said: ""I'm going to end the irrational duty premium of 28% that they currently pay. Sparkling wines - wherever they are produced - will now pay the same duty as still wines of equivalent strength."" The cut to sparkling wine duty was welcomed by Kate Goodman, owner of Cheshire drinks importer Reserve Wines, but she was disappointed that the change was not immediate. ""Christmas is our busiest period. It would have great to introduce this before that time. We need help to get back on our feet after a pretty crippling 18 months,"" she said. Reducing duty on lower alcohol drinks will encourage people to buy English wines, said Jonathan Piggins, chief executive of English wine merchant Corkk. ""The UK's vineyards are being taken increasingly seriously by the major overseas players and reducing the tax on lower alcohol drinks, will give the country an even more prominent position on the global wine map."" The changes were less welcomed by Liam Manton, co-founder of Didsbury Gin. ""Additional tax on high ABV drinks will present a real challenge to businesses like ours,"" he said, adding that on average 70% of the price of a bottle of gin is already tax. Draught beers and ciders will attract a new lower rate of duty In a move to help struggling pubs, Mr Sunak announced a new lower rate of duty for draught drinks, which he said would cut the cost of a pint by about three pence. He said the ""draught relief will cut duty by 5%"" and ""will apply to drinks served from draught containers over 40 litres"". The chancellor said this would particularly benefit community pubs ""who do 75% of their trade on draught"". He also announced proposals for a new ""small producer relief"" to include small cidermakers and other producers making alcoholic drinks of less than 8.5% alcohol by volume (ABV). Jez Lamb, founder of Wirral-based craft beer marketplace, Beers @ No.42, said the draught relief favoured the big players in the market, not the smaller, independent breweries who need support most. ""It's brilliant to see alcohol duty cut on draught beer but that's only for ""containers"" more than 40L. That is great for the big breweries but so many smaller craft brewers only supply in 30L containers,"" he said. Creating a draught rate and simplifying the duty system is positive news, said Nick Mackenzie, chief executive of Greene King, which has 2,700 pubs. ""It is a much needed vote of confidence in the great British pub as we face into an uncertain winter, labour disruption and rising costs."" William Robinson, managing director of Stockport brewery Robinsons, said the lower draught beer duty rate and the cancellation of the planned inflation-linked increase in beer duty showed that the chancellor ""recognises the contribution pubs make to the communities they support and serve.""

"Funding per pupil in England's schools is to be restored to 2010 levels over the next three years, the Chancellor has announced. This means an extra Â£4.7bn for schools in England by 2024-2025 and a cash increase for every child of Â£1,500, Rishi Sunak said. But it will not cover the 9% fall in funding since 2009 - the biggest cut in 40 years. The Chancellor also pledged an extra Â£2bn for education recovery from Covid. Chancellor to pledge funds for skills training Â£78bn wage hit from pandemic lost learning - study Ministers pledge Â£500m to support young families This brings spending on Covid catch-up since 2019 to nearly Â£5bn, Mr Sunak said in his Budget statement. The recovery fund falls far short of what education unions and the former catch-up tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, said was required - around Â£15bn. And the cash injection in basic school funding is unlikely to meet the hopes of teachers and head teachers in the biggest unions. The spending will also have to cover any rise in teachers' pay, which has been signalled with the announcement that the public sector pay freeze would be lifted. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""Even in the best-case analysis this still represents no growth in school funding for 15 years, and this commitment does not address the stark reality in 16-19 education where the learner rate is far too low. ""What we do know is that school and college budgets are very thinly stretched and the financial situation continues to be extremely difficult. ""The additional funding for education recovery following the Covid pandemic is nowhere near what is needed. ""Alongside other education organisations and school trusts, we submitted in August a proposal for an additional Â£5.8 billion of spending over the next three years focused in particular on supporting disadvantaged young people."" National Education Union joint general secretary, Kevin Courtney said:""Taking so long to restore the cuts made from 2010 onwards should not be a matter of pride for any Government, but one of embarrassment."" A recent snapshot survey of 1,500 heads for the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) found almost a third were already making budget cuts last year with 35% expecting to make cuts this academic year. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, said: ""Children and young people have been hugely affected by the pandemic. The government has made bold claims about 'levelling up' and 'no child left behind'. The investment announced today doesn't meet those goals or the futures needs of the country. ""The increase in per pupil spending announced by the government takes us back to 2010 levels. This is no proud boast, as it represents a failure to invest in children's futures for over a decade. ""Schools will do their best with what they are given, as they always do. It is important that schools are able to spend recovery money flexibly on the programmes they know work best for the children in most need in their schools."" There was a surprise additional Â£2 billion for education recovery in England in today's Budget, taking the total so far to around Â£5 billion.  This will be welcomed but it falls far short of the more substantial  Â£10 to Â£15 billion called for by education charities, unions and the government's former advisor Sir Kevan Collins. They have pointed to a disadvantage gap which has widened during the pandemic. Schools facing rising costs from heating bills, national insurance and teachers pay will be disappointed that overall spending per pupil is not being given a greater uplift.   Instead the Chancellor confirmed that by 2024-25 per pupil spending in England's schools will be restored, in real terms,  to the same level as 2010. There was also confirmation of funding to increase the number of places for children with special educational needs and disabilities. The Chancellor also announced an additional Â£170m by 2024-25 for the funding paid to nurseries and early years providers for state-backed nursery places. Neil Leitch, of the Early Years Alliance, welcomed the extra money but said: ""As always, however, the devil is in the detail and we await further confirmation on how exactly this funding will translate into rate increases for the sector over the coming years. ""While the annual level of investment our sector is set to receive over the next three years will result in a higher increase in early entitlement funding rates than we have seen over recent years, there is still an incredibly long way to go to make up the Â£2.60 per hour funding shortfall that the government's own cost calculations revealed. ""What's more, we know that for many nurseries, pre-schools and childminders, even remaining afloat until next April is set to be a real struggle. As such, we would urge the government to look at what short-term, emergency support can be given to those providers already on the brink of closure.

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: âTodayâs Budget delivers a stronger economy for British peopleâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out changes to universal credit he says will give low income families an extra Â£1,000 a year. In an upbeat Budget speech, he said the UK economy had not been hit as hard by the Covid pandemic as expected. He promised more money for schools, business rate cuts and took 3p off the price of a pint of beer. Labour said his universal credit measure would not make up for axing the Â£20-a-week top-up to the benefit. The chancellor painted a positive picture of the health of the UK economy as it emerges from the pandemic, in his autumn statement to a packed House of Commons. Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Economy set to hit pre-Covid level at end of year Zoos, parks and pools - who got levelling up cash? ""Employment is up. Investment is growing. Public services are improving. The public finances are stabilising. And wages are rising,"" he told MPs. ""Today's Budget delivers a stronger economy for the British people: stronger growth, with the UK recovering faster than our major competitors."" He said unemployment had not hit the levels feared at the height of the pandemic - but inflation was set to rise further, from 3.1% to 4% over the next year. Much of his Budget had been pre-announced, including an end to the public sector pay freeze and an increase to the National Living Wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50. But Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News the ""almost non-existent"" increase in living standards predicted over the next five years was a ""big blow"" to families. Household disposable income is set to rise by 0.8% per year, according to Office for Budget Responsibility figures. Economic growth is forecast to rise to 6.3% next year - higher than previously predicted - but it will then slow to 1.3% by 2023. New Budget measures included: A real-terms rise in spending for every government department A freeze on fuel duty Funding per pupil in England's schools isto be restored to 2010 levelsover the next three years A 5% cut to the extra corporation tax banks have to pay to ""maintain competitiveness"" An extra Â£2.2bn for courts, prisons and probation services, including Â£500m to reduce courts backlogs A cut in air passenger duty for internal UK flights - and a tax rise on ""ultra long haul"" flights More support for industrial research and development The teetotal chancellor also announced plans to""radically simplify"" alcohol tax, so that it was based purely on the strength of the drink. Taxes on sparkling wine, draught beer and cider are to be cut, but will rise for stronger drinks such as red wine and ""white ciders"", from 2023. He also announced that the planned increase in duty on spirits, wine, cider and beer due to take effect from midnight on Wednesday has been cancelled. And he scrapped next year's planned increase in business rates in England and promised more frequent revaluations, and tax breaks for firms that make improvements to their properties, from 2023. In further moves to boost the leisure industry as it emerges from the pandemic, he announced a 50% business rate discount for pubs, cinemas, restaurants, gyms and other venues. Rishi Sunak portrays himself as a light touch Tory - who doesn't like heavy taxes, who doesn't like big government. But he's not using the fading of the pandemic emergency to call time on hefty spending. Nor is the chancellor seizing a moment to argue for a leaner state. Instead, his plans increase spending everywhere, in a Budget that on first examination has something for everyone. Mr Sunak even chose to emphasise how he's restoring spending in some areas to levels not seen since Labour was in charge; less keen to remind you that they were cut back by successive administrations made up of his Tory colleagues. Despite dangling the promise of tax cuts by 2024, the Budget seems to confirm the political conclusions of Mr Sunak and Boris Johnson - vows to shrink the state are not going to win them the next election. But with the threat of inflation, higher taxes and puny, if better growth, the seeming largesse may not be toasted by the public in the months to come, even if they could so with cheaper cider or prosecco. The chancellor waited until the end of his 70 minute speech to announce changes to universal credit, which come after a widely condemned Â£20-a-week cut to the benefit earlier this month. The universal credit ""taper"" will be cut, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every Â£1 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p. The amount people can earn before starting to lose the benefit will also increase by Â£500 a year. The new rate will be introduced by 1 December, he told MPs. ""This is a tax cut next year worth over Â£2bn,"" said the chancellor. ""Nearly two million families will keep, on average, an extra Â£1,000 a year."" Universal credit: What is the taper rate? Price rises could hit highest level in 30 years Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour welcomed the move but it would not make up for the Â£6bn cut from universal credit earlier this month, which affected five million families. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says some families and businesses will not recognise the UK described by the chancellor in his Budget ""Even after this reduction, working people on universal credit still face a higher marginal tax rate than the prime minister. And those unable to work - through no fault of their own - still face losing over Â£1,000 a year,"" she said. The opposition leader normally responds to the chancellor's Budget speech, but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmeris self-isolating after testing positive for Covid. Ms Reeves, who was drafted in to replace him at the last minute, said Mr Sunak had ""no coherent plan"" to deal with cost of living crisis facing many families, with rising energy bills, food prices and tax increases. She told MPs Mr Sunak was a chancellor that ""gives with one hand but takes so much more with the other"". The SNP's leader at Westminster, Iain Blackford, branded the chancellor's planned cut to domestic air passenger duty a ""disgrace"", asking what kind of message it sent to the world on the eve of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. The Liberal Democrats said cutting bank taxes would cost the Treasury more than Â£3.8bn over the next four years, compared with Â£1.8bn extra to help school pupils catch up. ""He is offering a measly pound a day of extra catch up funding for each child, six times less than the tax cut being offered to the Conservatives' banker buddies,"" said leader Sir Ed Davey.

"Finance Minister Conor Murphy says the budget allocation will amount to Â£1.9bn over three years Finance minister Conor Murphy has disputed a claim by the chancellor that Northern Ireland will get an extra Â£1.6bn per year for public services. Rishi Sunak said his budget allocation represented the largest annual funding settlement for devolved governments since 1998. But Mr Murphy said it would create ""significant challenges"". He said it would amount to Â£1.9bn for day-to-day spending over three years - ""nowhere near"" what is required. Treasury figures show the budget allocation will mean day-to-day spending in Northern Ireland will increase by an average of 2.1% in real terms each year up to 2025. Infrastructure spending will increase by an average of 2.5% a year over the same period. The Treasury said this gave the Northern Ireland Executive ""sufficient funding certainty"" to plan in-year spending and to provide additional future investments in areas such as health, social care and education. A simple guide to Budget 2021 But Mr Murphy said when compared to the executive's 2021-22 budget, there will be an additional Â£450m, Â£670m and Â£866m over the next three years for day-to-day spending ""against growing demand for public services"". This, he added, represented a 0.9% real term increase to the executive's budget next year, turning to zero real terms change by 2024-25. ""This spending review was the opportunity to deliver a budget which would have enabled the executive to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery,"" Mr Murphy said. ""However it provides a marginal real terms increase in funding next year which will be far outweighed by increased demands on public services, particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic."" Mr Murphy said a multi-year budget enables the executive to better plan and prioritise its finances. He said his priority was supporting the health service and tackling waiting lists. Separately, there is an initial budget allocation of Â£50m from the government's levelling up fund. It is for 11 projects including redeveloping the Dundonald Ice Bowl and extending cycle routes across the Belfast City Region. Mr Sunak also said he will cut Air Passenger Duty (APD) by half on internal UK flights. A cut in APD is a long standing request of Northern Ireland politicians and business leaders. It will mean a new domestic band for APD set at Â£6.50. The rate will apply to all flights between airports in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (excluding private jets). The government has also announceda proposal to solve a NI Protocol related issue,externalconcerning the VAT paid on second cars coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Mr Murphy has previouslyalready played down expectations that the spending review would mean significant extra resources. Earlier this week, he said there was ""little indication"" the government would ""provide the investment needed to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery"". However, he said the ability to produce a multi-year budget would provide an opportunity to ""better plan and prioritise finances"". Stormont has not had a multi-year budget since 2011-2015. That has made it difficult for public sector managers to plan services, particularly in health. The finance minister is trying to build consensus among his executive colleagues that the bulk of any additional funds should go to health even if other departments lose out. He aims to publish a draft budget before Christmas which would then go out to consultation before being finalised early next year. The Institute of Directors Northern Ireland said the additional money will be a ""shot in the arm for the local administration"". ""It is incumbent now on ministers to deliver on the incredible potential it presents, with a focus, through targeted investment in key services and infrastructure, on ensuring this region is fit to capitalise on the green recovery as we continue to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic,"" said national director, Kirsty McManus. Retail NI said the chancellor's 50% rates discount for retailers in England was welcome. The organisation added it was ""absolutely vital"" that Conor Murphy ensures this also applies to small traders in Northern Ireland. Matthew Hall, George Best Belfast City Airport chief executive, said the airport had for many years been lobbying government for the abolition of APD. ""A 50% reduction in APD is a half-way house in terms of solving a problem which has placed the aviation sector in Northern Ireland at a competitive disadvantage with other regions in attracting new airlines and routes,"" he said. ""Today's announcement by the chancellor will not take effect until April 2023 and does little in the short term to alleviate a sector still decimated by Covid."" SDLP leader and MP Colum Eastwood said the budget was a ""grim spectacle"". ""Now we have some certainty on multi-year funding the onus is on Conor Murphy to actually take responsibility and deliver a multi-year plan to tackle our waiting list crisis and present a credible plan for our economy,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) assembly member Steve Aiken said the extra Â£1.6bn a year ""underlines the advantage of being part of the fifth largest economy in the world"". ""We still have a long way to go to emerge fully from the Covid pandemic but this budget, if properly used to support the needs of Northern Ireland, gives us a good chance,"" he said. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson said the multi year budget should help devolved finance ministers plan spending better. ""The last two years have been unprecedented, and the Treasury responded in an unprecedented manner to protect jobs and safeguard employers,"" he said.

The new system, due to start in 2023, will mean higher duty for stronger alcohol, the chancellor said. A Treasury fact sheet suggests a 75cl bottle of Buckfast will face additional tax of 81p. The fortified wine is popular in some areas of Northern Ireland and is sometimes called Lurgan Champagne. It has been made by Benedictine monks at Buckfast Abbey in Devon for almost 100 years. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was proposing the ""most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years"". ""To radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from 15 to just six,"" he said. ""Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate. 'This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines, or high-strength 'white ciders' will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed given their strength."" Mr Sunak said many lower alcohol drinks were ""currently overtaxed"", adding: ""Rose, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines - today's changes mean they will pay less.""

"The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the government's forecaster has warned. Its latest forecast says inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% in 2022. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says figures released since its report was compiled suggest inflation could hit almost 5%. The chancellor acknowledged that household budgets are strained. Rishi Sunak described the overall economic picture as ""strong"" in the short term, with the OBR now expecting the economy to return to its pre-pandemic level six months earlier than it had forecast previously. However, he acknowledged the inflation rate was ""likely to rise further"" from its 3.1% rate in September. He said it was due to increased demand for energy and supply chain issues as economies and factories reopening following coronavirus lockdowns. ""The pressures caused by supply chains and energy prices will take months to ease,"" Mr Sunak said. ""It would be irresponsible for anyone to pretend that we can solve this overnight."" The UK's exit from the European Union (EU) has exacerbated supply chain problems such at hold-ups at ports or with deliveries, the OBR saidin its latest report,external. The OBR also said the fact that the energy price cap has risen was a big factor behind the rising cost of living. The cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The independent forecaster suggested that had its figures been more up-to-date, its inflation forecasts would have painted a more bleak picture for consumers and businesses. It previously said,externalit had ended any updates to its forecast on 24 September, earlier than usual, and ""in response to a request from the chancellor"". Richard Hughes, chairman of the OBR, told BBC News that if inflation started feeding into wages, rather than just products in the shops, the problem could persist for longer. But the OBR lifted its prediction for economic growth in 2021 to 6.5%, up from its previous forecast of 4%. It has also reduced its estimate of the long-term ""scarring"" effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%. The effectiveness of Covid vaccines and the adaptability of consumers and businesses had sped up the recovery, the OBR said. But it forecast that economic growth would be lower next year than it previously thought, partly down to a better performance in 2021. In 2022, gross domestic product (GDP), which measures all the activity of companies, governments and people in an economy, will increase by 6%, the OBR said, rather than the 7.3% it predicted in March. Growth is forecast to be 2.1% in 2023, 1.3% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025. While the economy is in a stronger state than had been expected, whether in terms of growth, employment or the public finances - the official analysis makes clear the obstacle inflation poses to standards of living in the coming months. The OBR reckons inflation will hit 4.4.%; it warns it may go as high as 5%. And, it makes clear that leaving the EU has heightened the UK's experience of the bottlenecks that are bumping up business costs, that in turn will lead to higher prices. That higher cost of living, together with looming tax rises will dampen the effect of wage rises over the next couple of years. Strip out inflation and the OBR reckons that household income after tax will only recover to pre-pandemic levels in mid-2023. And those lost years of prosperity increases could weigh on growth - and sentiment in the run up to the next election. Higher inflation is also likely to put pressure on how much the chancellor is able to spend in the future. But Mr Sunak has been offered some room for manoeuvre, as the improving economic picture and higher tax incomes means the government will not have to borrow as much. Borrowing hit a record Â£319.9bn during the 2020 financial year as the government poured money into pandemic support schemes such as furlough. It is now forecast to fall every year between 2021 and 2026. Jane Mackay, head of tax at audit, tax, advisory and risk firm Crowe, said there was still a ""huge"" Covid bill to deal with, though. ""The Budget statement hasn't really given us clarity on who will pay that bill. ""The tax increases that were announced before the Budget, including corporation tax rising to 25%, and the NHS and social care levy additional NICs of 1.25%, might suggest the strategy will spread the burden as widely as possible, rather than to make the structural changes to our tax system that may be what is really needed."" Follow live coverage of the Budget A simple guide to Budget 2021 Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Why is the cost of living going up? A risk of rising inflation as well is that it will increase the amount of interest the government needs to pay back on what it has borrowed for pandemic spending. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned in September that it ""will have to act"" over rising inflation. The Bank has already said UK inflation is set to exceed 4%, before falling back as the economy recovers from Covid. The UK's central bank can raise interest rates in an attempt to tackle inflation if prices are rising quickly. In theory, when borrowing costs rise - which would make loans such as mortgages more expensive - people spend less and prices are driven down. Mr Sunak said on Wednesday that he had written to the Bank to ""reaffirm their remit to achieve low and stable inflation"". Investors are expecting interest rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022, in an effort to bring inflation back down to the Bank's 2% target. However, he gave no suggestion of when the Bank might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%. The governor said that rising energy bills could push inflation higher for longer than previously thought.

"Conor Murphy is calling on Stormont to prioritise spending on the health service NI's finance minister has played down expectations of significant extra money as a result of the UK spending review. The chancellor's announcement on Wednesdaywill set the executive's spending limits for three years. Conor Murphy said a multiyear budget ""provides an opportunity to better plan and prioritise finances."" He said there was ""little indication"" that the government would ""provide the investment needed to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery"". The amount of money available to Stormont and the other devolved administrations is set by the Barnett formula. It is a population-based share of additional funding announced for England. Budget day is Wednesday when Rishi Sunak will announce how much money he will take in taxes and what he will spend it on On Sunday Chancellor Rishi Sunak said ""strong investment in public services""would be at the heart of his plans for rebuilding the economy. He said: ""One of the elements of building a stronger economy is having strong public services, and you will see that next week - whether it's the NHS, which we've already taken steps to support significantly to recover from coronavirus, children, schools, skills, all of these things, policing and crime."" A simple guide to Budget 2021 Six things that could affect you in the Budget Budget about investing in public services - Sunak Asked if he would raise public sector wages in line with inflation, the chancellor said: ""That will be one of the things we talk about. ""Over the past year, we took a decision to have a more targeted approach to public sector pay,"" he continued, but added: ""Going forward we'll have to set a new pay policy and that'll be a topic for next week's spending review."" Conor Murphy says a small rise in domestic rates will make little difference to Stormont's finances Writing in the Irish News,external, Conor Murphy expressed scepticism about what the chancellor would deliver and again called on the executive to prioritise health spending on Stormont's budget. He said: ""While the indications are that the spending review outcome will not be good for the executive, a collective approach can produce a budget that finally brings down waiting lists on a sustainable basis."" Mr Murphy also said that increasing domestic rates, a locally controlled property tax, would not give Stormont much extra spending power. ""I would caution that a 1% increase in domestic rates generates less than Â£3m,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: âTodayâs Budget delivers a stronger economy for British peopleâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out changes to universal credit he says will give low income families an extra Â£1,000 a year. In an upbeat Budget speech, he said the UK economy had not been hit as hard by the Covid pandemic as expected. He promised more money for schools, business rate cuts and took 3p off the price of a pint of beer. Labour said his universal credit measure would not make up for axing the Â£20-a-week top-up to the benefit. The chancellor painted a positive picture of the health of the UK economy as it emerges from the pandemic, in his autumn statement to a packed House of Commons. Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Economy set to hit pre-Covid level at end of year Zoos, parks and pools - who got levelling up cash? ""Employment is up. Investment is growing. Public services are improving. The public finances are stabilising. And wages are rising,"" he told MPs. ""Today's Budget delivers a stronger economy for the British people: stronger growth, with the UK recovering faster than our major competitors."" He said unemployment had not hit the levels feared at the height of the pandemic - but inflation was set to rise further, from 3.1% to 4% over the next year. Much of his Budget had been pre-announced, including an end to the public sector pay freeze and an increase to the National Living Wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50. But Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News the ""almost non-existent"" increase in living standards predicted over the next five years was a ""big blow"" to families. Household disposable income is set to rise by 0.8% per year, according to Office for Budget Responsibility figures. Economic growth is forecast to rise to 6.3% next year - higher than previously predicted - but it will then slow to 1.3% by 2023. New Budget measures included: A real-terms rise in spending for every government department A freeze on fuel duty Funding per pupil in England's schools isto be restored to 2010 levelsover the next three years A 5% cut to the extra corporation tax banks have to pay to ""maintain competitiveness"" An extra Â£2.2bn for courts, prisons and probation services, including Â£500m to reduce courts backlogs A cut in air passenger duty for internal UK flights - and a tax rise on ""ultra long haul"" flights More support for industrial research and development The teetotal chancellor also announced plans to""radically simplify"" alcohol tax, so that it was based purely on the strength of the drink. Taxes on sparkling wine, draught beer and cider are to be cut, but will rise for stronger drinks such as red wine and ""white ciders"", from 2023. He also announced that the planned increase in duty on spirits, wine, cider and beer due to take effect from midnight on Wednesday has been cancelled. And he scrapped next year's planned increase in business rates in England and promised more frequent revaluations, and tax breaks for firms that make improvements to their properties, from 2023. In further moves to boost the leisure industry as it emerges from the pandemic, he announced a 50% business rate discount for pubs, cinemas, restaurants, gyms and other venues. Rishi Sunak portrays himself as a light touch Tory - who doesn't like heavy taxes, who doesn't like big government. But he's not using the fading of the pandemic emergency to call time on hefty spending. Nor is the chancellor seizing a moment to argue for a leaner state. Instead, his plans increase spending everywhere, in a Budget that on first examination has something for everyone. Mr Sunak even chose to emphasise how he's restoring spending in some areas to levels not seen since Labour was in charge; less keen to remind you that they were cut back by successive administrations made up of his Tory colleagues. Despite dangling the promise of tax cuts by 2024, the Budget seems to confirm the political conclusions of Mr Sunak and Boris Johnson - vows to shrink the state are not going to win them the next election. But with the threat of inflation, higher taxes and puny, if better growth, the seeming largesse may not be toasted by the public in the months to come, even if they could so with cheaper cider or prosecco. The chancellor waited until the end of his 70 minute speech to announce changes to universal credit, which come after a widely condemned Â£20-a-week cut to the benefit earlier this month. The universal credit ""taper"" will be cut, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every Â£1 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p. The amount people can earn before starting to lose the benefit will also increase by Â£500 a year. The new rate will be introduced by 1 December, he told MPs. ""This is a tax cut next year worth over Â£2bn,"" said the chancellor. ""Nearly two million families will keep, on average, an extra Â£1,000 a year."" Universal credit: What is the taper rate? Price rises could hit highest level in 30 years Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour welcomed the move but it would not make up for the Â£6bn cut from universal credit earlier this month, which affected five million families. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says some families and businesses will not recognise the UK described by the chancellor in his Budget ""Even after this reduction, working people on universal credit still face a higher marginal tax rate than the prime minister. And those unable to work - through no fault of their own - still face losing over Â£1,000 a year,"" she said. The opposition leader normally responds to the chancellor's Budget speech, but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmeris self-isolating after testing positive for Covid. Ms Reeves, who was drafted in to replace him at the last minute, said Mr Sunak had ""no coherent plan"" to deal with cost of living crisis facing many families, with rising energy bills, food prices and tax increases. She told MPs Mr Sunak was a chancellor that ""gives with one hand but takes so much more with the other"". The SNP's leader at Westminster, Iain Blackford, branded the chancellor's planned cut to domestic air passenger duty a ""disgrace"", asking what kind of message it sent to the world on the eve of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. The Liberal Democrats said cutting bank taxes would cost the Treasury more than Â£3.8bn over the next four years, compared with Â£1.8bn extra to help school pupils catch up. ""He is offering a measly pound a day of extra catch up funding for each child, six times less than the tax cut being offered to the Conservatives' banker buddies,"" said leader Sir Ed Davey.

"On Budget day the chancellor usually holds up a traditional red box full of financial documents On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Budget. He'll say how much of our money the government will take in taxes, and what they will spend it on. Each year, the chancellor of the exchequer - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement to MPs in the House of Commons. It outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. It also includes big decisions on what the government will spend money on - including health, schools, police and other public services. The Budget speech will be delivered onWednesday 27 October. It usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will give his response straight afterwards. This year's Autumn Budget is unusual for two reasons: It's the second of the year - there was a Budget in March too It comes on the same day asthe results of a spending review,external, which details how government will fund public services for the next three years After the speech, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors government spending - will publish a report on how the economy is doing. The Budget is likely to include help to support businesses and individuals recover from the economic effects of Covid. A number of measures have been announced in advance of the Budget, including a rise inthe minimum wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50and anend to the public sector pay freeze. The chancellor will likely set out some more details of the government's long term ambitions: Reducing the UK's net greenhouse emissions to zero by 2050 to combat climate change Levelling up - bringing jobs and investment to the poorer regions of the UK. Budget 2021: What has already been announced? Though many businesses are open again, the impact of the pandemic on government finances will last for years Measures such as thefurlough scheme- which finished at the end of September - were expensive, and government income is down because it collected less money in tax during the pandemic. To close the gap between higher spending and less money, the government has had to borrow more. In the year ending April 2021, the government borrowed Â£320bn - the highest figure seen outside wartime. Economists expect it to borrow around Â£180bn more this year, another enormous sum. During his Budget speech, the Chancellor will set out the latest borrowing forecasts for the years ahead. Where does the government borrow billions from? The government needs to cut the gap between what it spends and what it raises. One major tax rise was announced in September - the Â£12bnHealth and Social Care Levy. This broke a promise the Conservatives made at the last election, not to raise the three biggest taxes - income tax, national insurance and VAT. There has been speculation that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier. At the same time,the cost of living is rising. So the chancellor may want to cut some taxes, such as the amount of VAT pay on energy bills. He is also expected to announce major changes to the complicated alcohol tax system, which could see sparkling wine become cheaper. Six things that could affect you in the Budget Why is the cost of living going up? Overall government spending will rise next year, with big increases already announced for health and schools in England. The government has already said thatthe NHS in England will receive an extra Â£5.9bnto help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans. But other government departments, such as courts, prisons, local government and transport,are braced for cuts to their day-to-day budgetsnext year. They have already faced a decade of tight spending, and making further cuts will be painful. Could alcohol duty be reformed in the Budget? Some parts of the Budget, such as defence spending, affect the whole of the UK. Others, such as education, only affect England. This is because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions. Scotland has income tax-raising powers, which means its rates differ from the rest of the UK. The Scottish government will publish its Budget on 9 December. If the government announces extra spending on areas that only affect England, the other nations get an equivalent extra sum of money to spend as they choose, according to a rulecalled the Barnett formula.

"Rishi Sunak said his budget plans delivered for the whole of the UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged a ""new economy"" while increasing UK government spending by Â£150bn. But what does his Autumn Budget mean for Scotland? While many of the decisions about tax and spending in Scotland are made in Edinburgh, the UK Budget still has a big impact - well beyond the simple question of how much cash goes into Holyrood's coffers. Live: Follow reaction to Rishi Sunak's budget announcement Key budget points at-a-glance Mr Sunak has opted to turn on the spending taps across every government department, and this means Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes will have more cash to allocate when she sets out her own draft budget in December. This is because many of the eye-catching announcements in the UK budget relate to matters which are devolved to Holyrood - for example the Â£24bn earmarked for housing or the Â£21bn for roads. North of the border, Scottish ministers are in charge of housing and transport. So when the Chancellor pledges fresh funding to these areas, an extra chunk of cash is added to the Scottish budget to balance things up and ensure Scottish taxpayers don't end up subsidising giveaways in England. The windfall is calculated based on population levels using the Barnett Formula, and Scottish ministers can spend the cash on whatever they want - this is rather the point of devolution. Mr Sunak said his spending spree would send an average of Â£4.6bn per year extra to Holyrood, resulting in ""the largest block grants for the devolved administrations"" since they were established. However, Ms Forbes contends this is still not enough to deal with the ""significant challenges"" facing Scotland in the wake of the pandemic. She also says it is important to ""get behind the rhetoric and understand what the figures mean"" before she announces her own spending plans on 9 December. Kate Forbes will set out the Scottish government's budget plans in December Not all spending in devolved areas triggers Barnett consequentials. As of this year, some cash is actually going around Holyrood and directly to local projects. The UK government has established a Â£4.8bn ""levelling up"" fund, which allows local authorities to bid for cash for things like building roads and bridges, refurbishing museums and installing electric vehicle charging points. Mr Sunak told MPs that this year, Â£170m had been awarded to Scottish projects. These include the redevelopment of Inverness Castle, the renovation of the Westfield Roundabout in Falkirk, and a new marketplace in Aberdeen city centre - each of which is getting Â£20m of funding. A redevelopment of the Artizan shopping centre in Dumbarton is getting another Â£20m, while Â£38m will be spent improving travel links between Paisley anda local manufacturing innovation hub,external. Up to Â£3m is also being committed to the Burrell Collection in Glasgow in a bid to bring world-class art exhibitions to the city, while another Â£1m is being spent on local projects via the Community Ownership Fund. Inverness Castle is in line for a refit as part of the levelling up fund This is partly to do with the government's ""levelling up"" agenda, an attempt to rebalance an economy previously seen as being skewed towards London and the south-east of England - while helpfully winning over former Labour voters in ""red wall"" constituencies in the north of England. But it also plays into a longer-term Downing Street strategy to have a more visible presence in Scotland. UK ministers hope that by directly funding projects north of the border, they can write themselves into some local success stories and perhaps dampen enthusiasm for independence. Scottish ministers meanwhile do not like the idea of being cut out of the loop, saying this ""undermines devolution"". They instinctively contest the idea that officials in London are better placed to assess the merit of funding bids than those in Edinburgh. Funding for Scottish projects in Budget The political difficulty though is that these are positive projects backed by local councils - some of them SNP-run - and so extra cash for them cannot be opposed outright. Instead, the complaint tends to be more procedural, about the decision-making process and the complexity of the funding landscape. This may also become a more common occurrence going forward, with the UK Shared Prosperity Fund set to replace EU structural funds in 2022 - again sparkingcomplaints that Holyrood is being bypassed. A range of different taxes are devolved to Holyrood - but others are not, and the interplay between the two means changes announced at Westminster can still have far-reaching implications in Scotland. For example, income tax rates and bands are devolved, with Scotland operatingits own five-band systemwhich the government in Edinburgh argues is fairer. However, the tax-free allowance is still reserved, which as the starting point where taxes kick in clearly has a knock-on effect on the entire system. So what is actually changing, and what is not? The national living wage is set UK-wide, so the increase there - to Â£9.50 an hour for over-23s - will apply north of the border. And while an increasing range of welfare powers are being taken over by Social Security Scotland, Universal Credit is also reserved to Westminster - so thechanges to the ""taper rate"", allowing working claimants to keep more of the money they earn as their wages increase, will also apply in Scotland. Moving away from personal taxes, business rates are fully devolved to Holyrood as non-domestic rates - and the Scottish governmenthas already committed to rates relieffor the hospitality and retail sectors. The Scottish government dropped its own plans for an air passenger duty cut in 2019 The cut to air passenger duty on domestic flights will apply in Scotland - Aberdeen and Inverness were specifically cited by the Chancellor as beneficiaries, although Inverness is actually exempt from the levy. While there have long been plans to replace air passenger duty with a devolved Air Departure Tax, the move has been tied up in technical wrangles for years - chiefly because of that exemption for Highlands and Islands airports. Incidentally, Scottish ministers wanted to do away with the levy entirely - butditched this plan in 2019citing environmental concerns. This has freed them up to raise an eyebrow at Mr Sunak's plan coming on the eve of the COP26 climate conference. The overhaul of alcohol duties will have effect in Scotland too. While there is a system of minimum unit pricing in Scotland, this is not actually a tax, with retailers pocketing the proceeds of increased prices. The freeze on current alcohol duty is also good news for the Scottish whisky industry, which had been lobbying against a planned increase. Rishi Sunak seems determined that this is seen as a red, white and blue budget - a budget for the whole of the UK. As he chose to put it: ""We are, and always will be, one family - one United Kingdom"". That is obviously in dispute in Scotland where the SNP and others aspire to independence - so what did the Chancellor do to try and strengthen the Union? As well as extra cash for the Scottish government, there is the so-called ""levelling up"" money which involves the UK government spending more directly in Scotland. There's likely to be more of this after COP26 when UK ministers publish their Union connectivity review identifying cross-border transport investments. The budget also included a cut to air passenger duty for internal UK flights which Mr Sunak said was designed to ""bring people together across the UK"". There was even a UK-wide scheme to boost numeracy skills, although education is a Holyrood responsibility. What nationalists might see as Treasury overreach was also a signal to unionists that this Chancellor is committed to their cause. A tiny pub in the most inaccessible village in Scotland; a roundabout in Falkirk: a shopping centre in Dunbartonshire; the stable block in Glasgow's Pollok Park - the UK budget is going very local. Over 22 years of devolution, it had become increasingly a spending budget for England, with devolved bells and whistles, and taxes that mainly covered the whole of the UK. But that's changing. This budget marks a big shift towards the UK government planting its union flags on Scottish government turf. The Levelling Up Fund offers Â£170m to Scottish projects, this year, and Â£400m over three years - money that would previously have gone through the block grant at Holyrood, for ministers there to allocate. Community Ownership and Regeneration Funds also pick pet projects that show the difference some Whitehall money can make, backing some really small projects from Whithorn to Kinloch Rannoch. An extension of that will come with the Shared Prosperity Fund, which will ramp up as European Union structural funds are wound down. That, too, will bypass Holyrood, because Westminster wants its own direct links to projects on the ground.

"The chancellor pledges a major increase in public spending amid higher than expected economic growth Total departmental spending will increase by Â£150bn by 2024-25, which Rishi Sunak says is the largest increase this century Amid huge concern over the Â£20 cut to Universal Credit, changes will be made to let working claimants keep more of their benefits But Labour's Rachel Reeves - standing in for Keir Starmer, who has Covid - says struggling families will think Sunak is ""living in a parallel universe"" He also announces extra money for schools, tax cuts for businesses and a cut to air duties for flights within the UK A shake-up of alcohol duty will see cheaper sparkling wine and draught beer, while a planned rise in fuel duty has been cancelled Thanks for joining us for all the news, views and analysis of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget. Your writers today were Jennifer Scott, Sinead Wilson, Richard Morris, Dearbail Jordon and Victoria Lindrea. Your editors were Hamish Mackay, Claire Heald, Kevin Ponniah and Emma Harrison. You can find more of our in-depth coverage onthe BBC News website, but here is a little round-up before we close the page for the night. Parliament's official photographer Jessica Taylor was in the Commons to capture the event Rishi Sunak in the moments before his Budget speech sitting next to Prime Minister Boris Johnson (and looking a little nervous...) The Commons was packed with MPs to hear what Sunak had to say In full flow, the chancellor even appeared to be enjoying himself... And the (largely unmasked) Tory backbenchers enjoyed his performance... But Labour's Rachel Reeves was ready with a list of criticisms Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent One of the biggest savings
for the chancellor is the change in policy on the state pension triple lock. The temporary removal of the
earnings linkwas announced in September. Now, the Office for Budget
Responsibility says that will save the Treasury Â£5.4bn in the next financial
year. There
will be a rise of 3.1% in the state pension in April. That will add Â£4.25 more
a week to Â£141.85 for those on the older state pension, and an increase of
Â£5.55 to Â£185.15 a week for the newer flat-rate state pension. It
does mean that pensioners will get a predicted real terms cut â as inflation is
forecast to be 4% next year. Had
the government stuck to the triple lock, the rise would have been 8.3% - which
it describes as an anomaly caused by the pandemic. The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the UK's fiscal watchdog has warned. The Office for Budget Responsibility's latest forecast says that inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% next year. But it adds that figures released since its report was compiled suggests inflation could hit almost 5%. Read more here about the cost of living and where it is heading. Reality Check The chancellor is
spending more than Â£2bn a year reducing the taper rate on universal credit from
63% to 55% and increasing the amount some workers can earn before they lose
benefits. The taper rate is
the rate at which universal credit claimants lose benefits if they earn more
money. For some workers,
the cut to the taper rate will more than make up for the loss of the Â£20 a week
uplift to universal credit. The chancellor
gave the example of a single mother of two, renting her home and working full-time on the national living wage, who would indeed be better off by more than
Â£20 a week. But not all
claimants will recoup the losses. The changes will only benefit universal
credit claimants who are in work, for example, so a household in which nobody
was working would still be worse off. Also, a person
without children working 20 hours a week at the national living wage would
probably not benefit by as much as Â£20 a week. You can read more about it here. Jonathan JosephsBBC business reporter The UKâs economic recovery appears to be stronger than that
of Germany, the EU's so-called engine room. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects the UK economy to return to pre-pandemic levels âaround the turn of the yearâ and lifted its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for 2021 to 6.5%. Meanwhile in Germany, it has just announced it will now take three months longer - to the end of March - for its economy to reach pre-Covid levels. And Germanyâs growth forecast for this year has been cut
from 3.5% to 2.6%. Germany's economy minister Peter Altmaier says thatâs because of supply chain problems, higher energy
prices and a lack of computer chips which means less cars are being made. Vaccine rollout,
inflation and global supply chain problems are all reasons that a huge amount
of uncertainty remains for economies everywhere - and in this environment, the outlook for different nations can change pretty quickly. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Rishi Sunak portrays himself as a light touch Tory who doesn't like heavy taxes and who doesn't like big government. But he's not using the fading of the pandemic emergency to call time on hefty spending. Nor is the chancellor seizing a moment to argue for a leaner state. Instead, his plans seem to increase spending everywhere, in a Budget that on first examination has something for everyone. Sunak even chose to emphasise how he's restoring spending in some areas to levels not seen since Labour was in charge - though he is less keen to remind you they were cut back by successive administrations made up of his Tory colleagues. Despite dangling the promise of tax cuts by 2024, the Budget seems to confirm the political conclusions of Sunak and Boris Johnson - vows to shrink the state are not going to win them the next election. But with the threat of inflation, higher taxes and puny, if better growth, the seeming largesse may not be toasted by the public in the months to come, even they could do so with cheaper cider or prosecco. In Scotland, many of the big decisions about tax and spending are made by the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh,  but Rishi Sunak has given an extraÂ£4.6bn per year to Holyroodto allocate to departments. In Wales, Welsh government budgets will increase by anaverage of Â£2.5bn a year, with a total of Â£120m also earmarked for ten Welsh levelling-up projects. And in Northern Ireland there will be anadditional Â£1.6bn a year for public serviceswith infrastructure spending increasing by an average of 2.5% a year up to 2025. If you missed Rishi Sunak's Budget statement earlier, here's a quick recap of some of the main points:  You can readour main story on the Budget here. For those short on time, you can readthe key points at-a-glance here. And for those of you even shorter on time you can watchthis video with the main announcements in 126 seconds. Sir Keir Starmer released a video from home saying he was fine, but the Budget wasn't... Just minutes before PMQs - and less than an hour before the chancellor delivered his Budget speech - the Labour Party leader tested positive for Covid. Sir Keir Starmer had been due to respond to both the prime minister and Rishi Sunak in the Commons. But instead he had to isolate at home, passing on the job to his shadow business secretary (and former leader) Ed Miliband and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves. He has now released a video, saying he is ""absolutely gutted"" to miss the political moments, but it is right to follow the rules. And Sir Keir says he is feeling ""fine"" - well enough at least to criticise the Budget that ""does nothing for working people and nothing about the cost of living crisis"". The chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog, tells the BBC that Brexit will have a bigger impact on the UK economy in the long run than the pandemic. Speaking after todayâs Budget, Richard Hughes says âleaving the European Union is going to reduce our long run potential
output by 4%â, whereas he believes âthe pandemic is going to reduce that potential
output by a further 2%"". In the OBRâs overview of the UK's economic and fiscal outlook, it also states âsupply bottlenecks have
been exacerbated by changes in the migration and trading regimes following
Brexit"". A former Tory chancellor is welcoming the Budget
as ""fiscally responsible"", but warns it is also a ""gamble"" amid rising inflation and costs. Ex-MP Ken Clarke - now Lord Clarke - told BBC News the chancellor's speech was ""sound and sold very well"". He says Rishi Sunak has ""made the most of increases in
spending he's got... he's keeping the level of debt under control and he hopes to
reduce the level of annual deficit if - and it's a big if behind all this - the economy can maintain its recovery"". But Clarke says the economy is in ""a pretty sad state and faces a lot of dangers"",
adding: ""I hope it comes off because everything really depends on
inflation, costs, growth over the next year or two"". Rising inflation could result in rising prices for pubs, restaurants and consumers Now back to some more reaction to the Budget we've been hearing this afternoon. Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, says for many manufacturers and producers the 50% cut in business rates for hospitality announced in the Budget and the simplification of alcohol duty are âwelcome news"". However, he says the Budget does âlittle to addressâ labour
shortages and adds it is also âworryingly short on action to tackle rising
inflationâ. âGiven the pressures they are facing, many manufacturers
will simply have no choice but continue to pass costs down the chain,â he says. Dennis asks our final question. Helen CattPolitical Correspondent That is a very good point. The Speaker of the House of Commons is really quite cross about this becayse what the government is supposed to do, by convention, is announce policies in Parliament first. That's so that MPs can pick them apart and hold ministers to account. There were still some surprises today though - the Universal Credit changes and the reform of alcohol duty. Helen CattPolitical Correspondent We found out about the new tax to raise money for social care earlier this year. In fact, there were not any nasty tax rises in this Budget. But that's because they had already done it with the upcoming rise in National Insurance, which will become the health and social care levy. That is a significant tax and it will raise raise Â£12bn for both the NHS and social care. We are still waiting for more detail on that, but it didn't come in the Budget. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent No. There are some changes that apply to all businesses, but there are some targeted ones too. Those ones -the 50% discount specifically- are aimed at those kind of sectors struggling to get back on their feet, such as hospitality and leisure. And no-one knows what is going to happen in the next few months, so there appears to be some caution from the Treasury in case those businesses get hit again. Kamala asks... Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent Not today, no. We have had some relief for businesses over the coming months but there wasn't very much in there for self-employed workers. We had that fiddling around last month with national insurance to finance the health and social care levy, but today, despite the length of the speech, nothing for the self-employed. A question from Stephen... Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent We do have some concrete details on that. As of next April, the National Living Wage - as it's now called - will go up by 6.6% if you're over 23. That takes it to Â£9.50 per hour. If you work full time, you might see an increase of around Â£1,000 per year. This announcement was actually made ahead of time,which we reported on here. A question from Alan... Helen CattPolitical Correspondent Some of the Budget is for the whole of the UK, some of it is just for England. There are some things that Westminster does for the whole of the UK, and some things the devolved administrations do for themselves. So, things like money for local councils will be England only - but then Scotland, Wales and NI will get a proportionate amount of money based on that announcement and they can decide what to do with it themselves. So the whole Budget is a bit of a mix and you have to look at polcies individually to see whether they are UK-wide or not. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent We've had a lot of questions on this theme. The answer is the bulk of it comes from us as taxpayers. We pay hundreds of billions of pounds in to the Treasury every year but they also need to top it up and they do. They can borrow from the financial markets and because they are the government they are much more reliable than the rest of us when it comes to paying back money so they can normally borrow at very low rates indeed. That's why they have been able to finance all that extra spending on pandemic help. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: âTodayâs Budget delivers a stronger economy for British peopleâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out changes to universal credit he says will give low income families an extra Â£1,000 a year. In an upbeat Budget speech, he said the UK economy had not been hit as hard by the Covid pandemic as expected. He promised more money for schools, business rate cuts and took 3p off the price of a pint of beer. Labour said his universal credit measure would not make up for axing the Â£20-a-week top-up to the benefit. The chancellor painted a positive picture of the health of the UK economy as it emerges from the pandemic, in his autumn statement to a packed House of Commons. Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Economy set to hit pre-Covid level at end of year Zoos, parks and pools - who got levelling up cash? ""Employment is up. Investment is growing. Public services are improving. The public finances are stabilising. And wages are rising,"" he told MPs. ""Today's Budget delivers a stronger economy for the British people: stronger growth, with the UK recovering faster than our major competitors."" He said unemployment had not hit the levels feared at the height of the pandemic - but inflation was set to rise further, from 3.1% to 4% over the next year. Much of his Budget had been pre-announced, including an end to the public sector pay freeze and an increase to the National Living Wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50. But Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News the ""almost non-existent"" increase in living standards predicted over the next five years was a ""big blow"" to families. Household disposable income is set to rise by 0.8% per year, according to Office for Budget Responsibility figures. Economic growth is forecast to rise to 6.3% next year - higher than previously predicted - but it will then slow to 1.3% by 2023. New Budget measures included: A real-terms rise in spending for every government department A freeze on fuel duty Funding per pupil in England's schools isto be restored to 2010 levelsover the next three years A 5% cut to the extra corporation tax banks have to pay to ""maintain competitiveness"" An extra Â£2.2bn for courts, prisons and probation services, including Â£500m to reduce courts backlogs A cut in air passenger duty for internal UK flights - and a tax rise on ""ultra long haul"" flights More support for industrial research and development The teetotal chancellor also announced plans to""radically simplify"" alcohol tax, so that it was based purely on the strength of the drink. Taxes on sparkling wine, draught beer and cider are to be cut, but will rise for stronger drinks such as red wine and ""white ciders"", from 2023. He also announced that the planned increase in duty on spirits, wine, cider and beer due to take effect from midnight on Wednesday has been cancelled. And he scrapped next year's planned increase in business rates in England and promised more frequent revaluations, and tax breaks for firms that make improvements to their properties, from 2023. In further moves to boost the leisure industry as it emerges from the pandemic, he announced a 50% business rate discount for pubs, cinemas, restaurants, gyms and other venues. Rishi Sunak portrays himself as a light touch Tory - who doesn't like heavy taxes, who doesn't like big government. But he's not using the fading of the pandemic emergency to call time on hefty spending. Nor is the chancellor seizing a moment to argue for a leaner state. Instead, his plans increase spending everywhere, in a Budget that on first examination has something for everyone.

But with the threat of inflation, higher taxes and puny, if better growth, the seeming largesse may not be toasted by the public in the months to come, even if they could so with cheaper cider or prosecco. The chancellor waited until the end of his 70 minute speech to announce changes to universal credit, which come after a widely condemned Â£20-a-week cut to the benefit earlier this month. The universal credit ""taper"" will be cut, so that instead of losing 63p of benefit for every Â£1 earned above the work allowance, the amount will be reduced to 55p. The amount people can earn before starting to lose the benefit will also increase by Â£500 a year. The new rate will be introduced by 1 December, he told MPs. ""This is a tax cut next year worth over Â£2bn,"" said the chancellor. ""Nearly two million families will keep, on average, an extra Â£1,000 a year."" Universal credit: What is the taper rate? Price rises could hit highest level in 30 years Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour welcomed the move but it would not make up for the Â£6bn cut from universal credit earlier this month, which affected five million families. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says some families and businesses will not recognise the UK described by the chancellor in his Budget ""Even after this reduction, working people on universal credit still face a higher marginal tax rate than the prime minister. And those unable to work - through no fault of their own - still face losing over Â£1,000 a year,"" she said. The opposition leader normally responds to the chancellor's Budget speech, but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmeris self-isolating after testing positive for Covid. Ms Reeves, who was drafted in to replace him at the last minute, said Mr Sunak had ""no coherent plan"" to deal with cost of living crisis facing many families, with rising energy bills, food prices and tax increases. She told MPs Mr Sunak was a chancellor that ""gives with one hand but takes so much more with the other"". The SNP's leader at Westminster, Iain Blackford, branded the chancellor's planned cut to domestic air passenger duty a ""disgrace"", asking what kind of message it sent to the world on the eve of the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. The Liberal Democrats said cutting bank taxes would cost the Treasury more than Â£3.8bn over the next four years, compared with Â£1.8bn extra to help school pupils catch up. ""He is offering a measly pound a day of extra catch up funding for each child, six times less than the tax cut being offered to the Conservatives' banker buddies,"" said leader Sir Ed Davey.

"The river was level with the pedestrian bridge in Cockermouth Rain has continued to fall overnight in Cumbria after about 40 properties were flooded and road and rail travel were hit on Thursday. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning, meaning some disruption is possible, and the Environment Agency has nine flood warnings in place. On Thursday Honister Pass saw over 30cm (12in) of rain in a 24-hour period. Motorists are warned that some roads are only passable with extreme care, and asked only to travel if necessary. Train operators are asking people to avoid travelling on the West Coast Main Line and Cumbria Coastal routes, and there is no service between Barrow and Carlisle until the line has been inspected. The flooding hit Waterhead at Ambleside On Thursday a number of roads, including the A591 between Rydal and Grasmere and the A592 Patterdale Road, were flooded. Karl Melville, the senior manager at the county council's highways team, said work had been going on all night to try to re-open as many roads as possible. He said: ""We have made some good progress [and] a lot of the roads that were closed are now passable with care. ""But obviously this does not take away the very clear advice of if you don't need to travel then don't travel."" The A592 was blocked by a number of vehicles at Windermere School on Thursday The Environment Agency said 1,200 properties had been protected from flooding by its officers shutting flood gates and removing debris and blockages from grilles and watercourses. But flood duty manager Ben Lukey urged people ""to remain vigilant"". ""Surface water and river flooding could still bring disruption to further communities,"" he warned. Mountain rescue volunteers brought two holidaymakers and their dog to safety Two holiday makers and their dog had to be rescued from their accommodation at Southwaite Mill by the Cockermouth Mountain Rescue Team. With water chest high in places, volunteers brought them to safety in a raft. Some streets in Cockermouth flooded Cockermouth and District Chamber of Trade chairman Andrew Marshall said huge insurance policy excesses introduced after the floods of 2009 and 2015 meant 90% of businesses would have to pay for any repairs themselves. ""Ever since then it's been nigh on impossible to get insurance,"" he said. ""If we get flooded this time we've got to pay for the rebuild and everything, which goes into hundreds of thousands."" Insurers have imposed excesses of up to Â£50,000 for business flooding claims in the area, Mr Marshall said. After previous floods caused widespread damage to properties the governmentintroduced a scheme,externalto help residents get insurance ""but it wasn't extended to business"", he said. Coniston Boating Centre is normally not in the lake Gillian Jackson owns holiday lets in Cockermouth, some of which have flooded. ""We've been through this before so it's just get up, get on with it,"" she said. ""Yes, it's upsetting but we've kind of got a bit hardened to it, got used to it, and we've just got to crack on and sort it out."" On Thursday afternoon, staff at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant were advised to speak to their bosses about returning home if possible, after checking road conditions. In a message to employees, the company warned detours would be needed around road closures on the A595 at Duddon Bridge, Santon Bridge and Holmrook and that Millom was reported to be unreachable by road. ""Shift co-ordinators will maintain minimum safety manning levels in plants but others should head home once clarified with their line managers,"" it said. The pitch at Keswick Rugby Club was swamped There was also flood damage to the clubhouse Nine flood warnings,external(where flooding is expected) and 15 flood alerts (where it is possible) were in place on Friday morning. In the 24 hours to 03:00 on Thursday Honister Pass saw 307.4mm (1ft) of rain, according to the Environment Agency. The River Rothay was among those that burst their banks. Allow Twitter content?

"Assange pictured leaving court in January 2020 Lawyers for the US have told the High Court the judge who blocked Julian Assange's extradition was misled by his psychiatrist. The United States government is starting a legal appeal to try to get the Wikileaks founder extradited. In January, a court ruled Mr Assange could not be extradited to the US due to concerns over his mental health. Mr Assange is wanted over the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011. The documents revealed how the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents during the war in Afghanistan, while leaked Iraq war files showed the 66,000 civilians had been killed and prisoners tortured by Iraqi forces. The US says the leaks broke the law and endangered lives, but Mr Assange says the case is politically motivated. His lawyer told the court that the risk of suicide would be ""imminent the moment extradition becomes likely"".

But he could not be transferred to the US because he was unwell and could take his own life. On Wednesday, James Lewis QC, representing the US, told the Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justice Holroyde that conclusion was wrong. He said Mr Assange's psychiatrist had misled the earlier judge and the US had not been given an opportunity to answer her concerns. Mr Assange, 50, is wanted in the US on allegations of a conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information following Wikileaks' publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. The publications include the release in April 2010 of footage showing US soldiers shooting and killing civilians from a helicopter in Iraq. Julian Assange's father made his way past a crowd of his son's supporters on his way into court Mr Assange has been in Belmarsh Prison since 2019, when he was carried out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London by police and arrested for breaching his bail conditions. He had been in the embassy since 2012, avoiding extradition to Sweden, where he faced sex offence allegations. He has always denied those and they were eventually dropped. On Wednesday morning, Mr Assange's legal team initially told judges he would not attend because he was not well. He later attended via a video link from prison. US lawyers said it had now given four binding assurances as to how Mr Assange would be treated: It would not impose a highly restrictive form of solitary confinement on Mr Assange before or after trial - although it could do so if he committed a further offence Mr Assange could apply to serve a sentence in Australia and the US would agree to that transfer Prison authorities would ensure Mr Assange would receive ""any clinical and psychological treatment"" that prison doctors recommended Mr Assange would also not be sent to ADX Florence, a US ""supermax"" prison, reserved for the worst offenders. Mr Lewis said the assurances were binding on the United States. He said the previous judge's approach ""carries with it the risk of rewarding fugitives for their flight, and of creating an anomaly between the approach of the courts in domestic criminal proceedings, and in extradition"". Mr Lewis said that Mr Assange's psychiatrist, Prof Michael Kopelman, had misled the court about Mr Assange's psychiatric state by concealing his relationship with his partner, Stella Moris, and that they had two children together. The lawyer for the US argued this meant the judge could not consider the true risks of Mr Assange taking his own life, because the need to protect children can be a factor that discourages people from suicide. He also said that during cross-examination, Prof Kopelman would not accept that Mr Assange could be safe in the US - even if he received a short sentence and reasonable time with other inmates. Mr Assange appeared by video link from Belmarsh Prison, where he has been held since 2019 Mr Lewis called psychiatrist Prof Seena Fazel from the University of Oxford, who said he did not share the defence's view that Mr Assange would certainly take his own life in the US. Mr Assange's lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald QC, said the risk of suicide is ""not something in the future - it is something imminent the moment that extradition becomes likely"". He said Parliament had given district judges the power to protect ""mentally disordered"" people from extradition to countries where the UK has no control over their treatment. He said that in January, the judge took the evidence fully into account and relied on the fact Mr Assange would be isolated and deprived of the protections he had in Belmarsh. The US assurances were ""caveated, vague or simply ineffective"", he said, calling the suggestion that he could be detained in Australia ""meaningless"", as the country has not said it would accept him. Supporters, family members and friends of Mr Assange outside court expressed their ""outrage"" after he did not attend his hearing in person. They said they were concerned he was thin, he was not there to instruct his lawyers or clarify what was going on in court.

"This video can not be played Insulate Britain: Protesters blocking A40 have ink squirted on them Insulate Britain protesters have been squirted in the face with ink as they blocked major roads connecting to the M25, despite a new court injunction. Nearly 50 demonstrators from the environmental group have been arrested at three sites, including on the A40 in west London during rush hour. Protesters also blocked the A206 at Crossways Boulevard in Dartford. A man sprayed protesters on the A40 with what appeared to be blue ink, as motorists became frustrated. Insulate Britain blocks roads across east London Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? The protests come in response to government-owned National Highwayssecuring a court injunctionbanning activities that obstruct traffic on its 4,300-mile network of motorways and major A-roads in England. There are four court injunctions in place against the group, which the Department for Transport said covered the ""entire strategic road network"". Police arrested protesters at the DoubleTree Hilton at Dartford Crossing Insulate Britain said in a statement: ""We are not concerned with endless injunctions. We are not concerned with our fears. ""We are concerned with fulfilling our duties and responsibilities at this 'period of consequence'. ""Starting from 07.00 BST on the morning of Wednesday 27 October, the M25 will become a place of non-violent civil resistance to stop our government committing crimes against humanity."" The Met Police arrested 17 activists on the A40 in Acton, six of whom had locked themselves to the ground but ""specialist units are on scene to unglue them"", the force said. Thirty-two people have been arrested by Kent Police after traffic was obstructed at two locations in Dartford. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The group - an offshoot of Extinction Rebellion - wants the government to insulate all UK homes by 2030 to cut carbon emissions. Suzie, 47, a protester from Cambridge, who works in childcare, said: ""If going to prison and losing my home is what it takes to get the government to do the right thing and cut our carbon emissions, then it's a price worth paying. ""I can't be a bystander while this government betrays the public, our children and future generations by failing to defend our country from the climate crisis."" She said she had been arrested 11 times since 13 September. In a statement Insulate Britain said it is ""not concerned with endless injunctions"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has previously accused Insulate Britain of ""risking lives and ruining journeys"". He has said the ""long term solution lies in changes to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill"" to give ""additional powers against disruptive protests"". Jeremy Kite, leader of Dartford Borough Council, also called for greater powers for police to prevent protests happening. Mr Kite said: ""The law needs to be beefed up so when they're talking about action in a couple of days' time, or predicting it tomorrow, the police ought to be able to pay them a visit at six o'clock in the morning and make sure they don't go out. ""These are people who are just spoiled and entitled and they're narcissistic in their aims, regardless of what they want to achieve, and what they want to do. Allow Twitter content?

He added: ""Quite frankly, some of these people, rather than gluing themselves to a road, it's time they glued themselves to a job or glued themselves to something productive."" Those who break the injunctions could be found in contempt of court and face maximum penalty of two years in prison or an unlimited fine. But prosecutions for this offence usually take several months.

"Love Island's Gabby Allen has had an Instagram post banned because it was not clearly labelled as an advert which was paid for by Primark. The post, shared in August 2021, used the hashtag #iworkwithprimark in its caption. However the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that was ""ambiguous, and did not fully explain her relationship with Primark."" Gabby Allen said the post had been updated to include the label #ad. However, the ASA still upheld the complaint. It says #ad should have been put nearer the start of the caption, so it was ""immediately visible to consumers viewing the post in-feed on Instagram."" It holds Primark and Gabby Allen ""jointly responsible"" for making sure their posts follow the rules. Newsbeat has contacted Gabby Allen's representatives for comment. The ASA found the relationship between Gabby Allen and Primark was not fully explained The original post showed a picture of Gabby Allen with the caption: ""Feeling fab but chilled Wearing these jeans and top from one and only @primark #iworkwithprimark"". Primark said the #iworkwithprimark label was enough for followers to know that this was a sponsored post. But the ASA says it ""did not fully explain [Gaby Allen's] relationship with Primark."" It adds that the hashtag is ""long and unclear, and its content and meaning would not have been immediately obvious to consumers."" Gabby - who came fourth in the 2017 series of Love Island - has 1.1 million followers on Instagram. She's by no means the first influencer to have been been called out by the ASA for not labelling an ad correctly on social media. The ASA has looked at 122 UK-based influencers - and according to Ed Senior, ""overall compliance was disappointing"". He is a compliance executive at the ASA, and his job is to make sure advertising rules are being followed - he suggests that can be done in a few different ways. The rules say content has to ""be clear, obvious and identifiable as advertising"". Putting a hashtag #ad is one way, but he says they could also verbally say it's an advert at the start of a video. ""It needs to be clear and obviously up front, prior to engagement. So that's why, even when they added #ad at the end, it wouldn't be enough to comply with the rules."" Delivery text scams and how to deal with them Reality stars auditioned to 'promote' poison diet drink Lauren Goodger forex ad banned from Instagram If someone breaks the rules, there are different levels of sanctions. Ed says the ASA will get someone to amend the content so it follows the rules, or get them to remove it. If things escalate, people can be placed on a public list, with the ASA working with platforms to remove further content and eventually even referring them to legal authorities. This year, Love Island'sLuke Mabbott, Towie'sLauren Goodgerand TikTok collectiveThe Wave Househave all been made to take posts down because they weren't clearly labelled as adverts. In August, the ASA named and shamedfour celebritieswho it said repeatedly broke the rules: Chloe Khan, Jodie Marsh, Lucy Mecklenburgh and Chloe Ferry. Molly-Mae Hague was found to havebroken the rulesover a competition she tried to run on Instagram. ""Targeting someone like Molly-Mae sends a message to other influencers, who may have smaller followings, to remind them that they are under the same requirements as any other brand,"" Nick Breen from law firm Reed Smith told the BBC at the time.

"The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the government's forecaster has warned. Its latest forecast says inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% in 2022. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says figures released since its report was compiled suggest inflation could hit almost 5%. The chancellor acknowledged that household budgets are strained. Rishi Sunak described the overall economic picture as ""strong"" in the short term, with the OBR now expecting the economy to return to its pre-pandemic level six months earlier than it had forecast previously. However, he acknowledged the inflation rate was ""likely to rise further"" from its 3.1% rate in September. He said it was due to increased demand for energy and supply chain issues as economies and factories reopening following coronavirus lockdowns. ""The pressures caused by supply chains and energy prices will take months to ease,"" Mr Sunak said. ""It would be irresponsible for anyone to pretend that we can solve this overnight."" The UK's exit from the European Union (EU) has exacerbated supply chain problems such at hold-ups at ports or with deliveries, the OBR saidin its latest report,external. The OBR also said the fact that the energy price cap has risen was a big factor behind the rising cost of living. The cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The independent forecaster suggested that had its figures been more up-to-date, its inflation forecasts would have painted a more bleak picture for consumers and businesses. It previously said,externalit had ended any updates to its forecast on 24 September, earlier than usual, and ""in response to a request from the chancellor"". Richard Hughes, chairman of the OBR, told BBC News that if inflation started feeding into wages, rather than just products in the shops, the problem could persist for longer. But the OBR lifted its prediction for economic growth in 2021 to 6.5%, up from its previous forecast of 4%. It has also reduced its estimate of the long-term ""scarring"" effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%. The effectiveness of Covid vaccines and the adaptability of consumers and businesses had sped up the recovery, the OBR said. But it forecast that economic growth would be lower next year than it previously thought, partly down to a better performance in 2021. In 2022, gross domestic product (GDP), which measures all the activity of companies, governments and people in an economy, will increase by 6%, the OBR said, rather than the 7.3% it predicted in March. Growth is forecast to be 2.1% in 2023, 1.3% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025. While the economy is in a stronger state than had been expected, whether in terms of growth, employment or the public finances - the official analysis makes clear the obstacle inflation poses to standards of living in the coming months. The OBR reckons inflation will hit 4.4.%; it warns it may go as high as 5%. And, it makes clear that leaving the EU has heightened the UK's experience of the bottlenecks that are bumping up business costs, that in turn will lead to higher prices. That higher cost of living, together with looming tax rises will dampen the effect of wage rises over the next couple of years. Strip out inflation and the OBR reckons that household income after tax will only recover to pre-pandemic levels in mid-2023. And those lost years of prosperity increases could weigh on growth - and sentiment in the run up to the next election. Higher inflation is also likely to put pressure on how much the chancellor is able to spend in the future. But Mr Sunak has been offered some room for manoeuvre, as the improving economic picture and higher tax incomes means the government will not have to borrow as much. Borrowing hit a record Â£319.9bn during the 2020 financial year as the government poured money into pandemic support schemes such as furlough. It is now forecast to fall every year between 2021 and 2026. Jane Mackay, head of tax at audit, tax, advisory and risk firm Crowe, said there was still a ""huge"" Covid bill to deal with, though. ""The Budget statement hasn't really given us clarity on who will pay that bill. ""The tax increases that were announced before the Budget, including corporation tax rising to 25%, and the NHS and social care levy additional NICs of 1.25%, might suggest the strategy will spread the burden as widely as possible, rather than to make the structural changes to our tax system that may be what is really needed."" Follow live coverage of the Budget A simple guide to Budget 2021 Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Why is the cost of living going up? A risk of rising inflation as well is that it will increase the amount of interest the government needs to pay back on what it has borrowed for pandemic spending. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned in September that it ""will have to act"" over rising inflation. The Bank has already said UK inflation is set to exceed 4%, before falling back as the economy recovers from Covid. The UK's central bank can raise interest rates in an attempt to tackle inflation if prices are rising quickly. In theory, when borrowing costs rise - which would make loans such as mortgages more expensive - people spend less and prices are driven down. Mr Sunak said on Wednesday that he had written to the Bank to ""reaffirm their remit to achieve low and stable inflation"". Investors are expecting interest rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022, in an effort to bring inflation back down to the Bank's 2% target. However, he gave no suggestion of when the Bank might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%. The governor said that rising energy bills could push inflation higher for longer than previously thought.

"Moldova's Foreign Minister, Nicu Popescu, is trying to look on the bright side His country is immersed in a gas crisis. But Nicu Popescu is trying to remain positive. ""On Monday our country made history,"" Moldova's foreign minister tells me. ""For the first time Moldova bought gas from a source that was not Russia's Gazprom."" The gas shipment from Poland's PGNiG was one million cubic metres. Moldova will need much larger volumes if Gazprom does what it has threatened to do: turn off the gas taps. Up until now, 100% of Moldova's gas has come from Russia. But the contract to supply it expired at the end of September. Gazprom raised the price and Moldova balked at paying it. In the absence of a new deal, the Russian energy giant reduced supplies, prompting Moldova to declare a 30-day state of emergency. Gazprom accused Moldova of ""provoking a crisis"" and demanded repayment of a $709m (Â£514m) debt, which Moldova disputes. Negotiations continue. Moldovan officials say they would like to sign a new contract with Gazprom, but only if the terms are favourable. If there is no deal with Russia, could Moldova, one of Europe's poorest countries, buy enough gas elsewhere? Moldova's gas contract with Gazprom expired at the end of last month ""It's the worst time to have a gas crisis at home,"" Mr Popescu admits. ""The prices are higher than ever. We see this market crunch on a global scale. But we've had support. In recent years Romania built a new gas pipeline into Moldova which gives us a safety valve. We've also had some advice from the European Union on how to diversify a country's gas supply within a few days."" Like many enterprises in Moldova, the sugar factory in Drochia has been affected by the gas shortage. ""We're able to use just a quarter of the gas we need,"" manager Rostislav Magdei explains. ""We're topping that up with alternative sources of energy. We hope our government will compensate any losses arising from the high price of fuel."" This sugar factory is among many businesses hit by the gas shortage Once in Moscow's orbit, Moldova has been tilting from Russia towards the West more recently. The country's leadership is now pro-European and supports closer ties with the EU. Many here suspect that the gas crisis is the Kremlin's way of expressing its disapproval. ""This year we had parliamentary elections and the pro-Russia party lost,"" says Sergiu Tofilat, former energy adviser to the president of Moldova. ""We have a pro-Western party in power here. So, Russia changed its approach on the gas supply. The Kremlin wants to punish the Moldovan people for voting against a pro-Russia party. It's pure politics."" ""Vladimir Putin is trying to keep former Soviet countries within the area of influence of the Kremlin. We do not want to stay on our knees in front of Moscow. We must say no to Russian blackmail and we have the opportunity now to get rid of Russian influence in Moldova."" Sergiu Tofilat, former presidential adviser, says the Kremlin is trying to punish his country The Kremlin denies using energy as a weapon. President Putin recently dismissed the suggestion as ""utter nonsense, drivel and politically-motivated tittle-tattle."" EUROPEAN CRISIS:Is Russia squeezing Europe's gas supply? WHAT NEXT?Gas crisis leaves Europe searching for solutions For Moldova, though, reducing Russia's influence won't be easy. In energy terms, Moldova is closely tied to Moscow. Not only has the country been 100% dependent on Russian gas. But its own gas company, Moldovagaz, is majority-owned by Gazprom. And more than 80% of Moldova's electricity comes from a Russian-owned power plant in Trans-Dniester - a separatist region of Moldova, backed economically, politically and militarily by Moscow. If you think of gas negotiations as a game of poker, then Russia has a very strong hand. But Trans-Dniester could prove to be a weak point for Moscow. ""Gazprom needs a gas contract with Moldova so that it can supply the breakaway region, too, with gas,"" says Sergiu Tofilat. ""Gazprom is a public company, with shares listed on the stock exchange. It cannot allow itself to sign a contract with the Trans-Dniester supplier that is not officially recognised."" In the town of Balti, Moldovan motorists are feeling the effects of less gas. I see long lines at the propane station. Queuing up here are dozens of cars and disgruntled drivers. Drivers in Balti are fed up with having to queue for fuel ""We're in this situation, because we're looking towards Europe"", a taxi driver called Valera tells me. ""If we were with Russia everything would be different."" ""The problem is,"" says another driver Yura, ""that our leaders now want to be friends with Europe and America. For cheap gas they should go to Moscow, get an agreement. We need to bow down to Russia"". For a government that has set a pro-European course there is a danger: that a prolonged gas shortage and higher energy bills could make Moldovans question the direction in which their country is moving.

"This video can not be played Lindsay Hoyle says it is ânot acceptable"" for ministers to give briefings to the media before Parliament. The Treasury has released a deluge of funding announcements, days before the chancellor delivers his Budget on 27 October. Statements from the government setting out spending for transport, health and education have been put out in the past few days. Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is furious, telling MPs on Monday it was ""not acceptable"" to brief the media ahead of MPs and on Tuesday that the government was behaving in a ""discourteous manner"". He thundered that ministers used to ""walk"" if they briefed about a Budget. Indeed, in 1947, then-Chancellor Hugh Dalton resigned after he leaked details of his budget to a journalist. Defending pre-Budget announcements, Treasury Minister Simon Clarke said the government had not commented on the ""substantive tax measures"" that would appear in the Budget. So what do we know? Firstly, this isn't the complete story. Rishi Sunak's Budget won't all be about displays of generosity. The Treasury has asked departments to identify ""at least 5% of savings and efficiencies from their day-to-day budgets"" and we may hear more about those plans on Wednesday. The government has already committed to spending for health, schools, defence and overseas aid so other areas such as local government, justice and further education may face a squeeze on their budgets. And there may be more to some of the seemingly lavish spending pledges than meets the eye. A simple guide to Budget 2021 Analysis by political correspondent Damian Grammaticas Beware what you are reading! They sound good, all these announcements in the run up to Budget and Spending Review. But they need to be taken with caution. This is the PR blitz seeking good headlines. We don't yet know the detail of exactly what the government is planning. The raft of investments will make a difference. But there are questions. Are the transport links, treatment centres and other projects entirely new or have some parts been announced (with equal fanfare) before now? Crucially what is happening more broadly to the budgets of the departments getting cash? A shiny investment in something is great, but is that department's day-to-day spending being squeezed? And what of those areas that aren't getting the handouts? Best to wait until Wednesday to truly judge the chancellor's largesse. The government has announced that England's city regions will receive Â£6.9bn to spend on train, tram, bus and cycle projects. This includes Â£1.07bn for Greater Manchester, Â£1.05bn for the West Midlands and Â£830m for West Yorkshire. However, the figure of Â£6.9bn only includes Â£1.5bn of additional spending because the government is including the Â£4.2bn promisedin 2019alongside funding for buses announced by the prime minister last year. The chancellor has refused to be drawn on the future of the eastern leg of High Speed Two, which could be delayed or cancelled to save an estimated Â£40bn.  If built, the extension would cut journey times between London and the North East by 31 minutes. It would also shave 52 minutes off trips between London and Leeds. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding through the Barnett formula - a mechanism the UK government uses to allocate additional money to the devolved nations when it spends more in England. City regions to get Â£6.9bn for public transport Government urged to make a decision on HS2 route NHS England will get Â£5.9bn to tackle the backlog of people waiting for tests and scans. That covers Â£2.3bn for diagnostic tests including clinics in shopping centres for scans; Â£1.5bn on beds equipment and new ""surgical hubs""; and Â£2.1bn to improve IT. Health bodies welcomed the money but warned it would not solve the problem of staff shortages. According to data published by NHS digital, in June there were 93,806 full-time vacancies across the NHS in England. NHS in England to get Â£5.9bn to cut waiting lists Mr Sunak is set to announce a rise in the National Living Wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50, to come into effect from 1 April next year. This is a 6.6% increase in the minimum wage for all those aged 23 and over - more than twice the current 3.1% rise in the cost of living. Assuming a 40 hour week, the new minimum wage amounts to a salary of Â£1,646 per month or Â£19,760 a year. The increases to the wage rates follow recommendations made by the Low Pay Commission, an independent advisory board. The Treasury has also announced it will be lifting a pay freeze imposed on millions of public sector workers last year as a result of the pandemic. Independent pay review bodies will recommend how much extra money workers will get early next year. National Living Wage set to rise to Â£9.50 an hour Public sector workers set for pay rise - Sunak The government's major tax change has already been announced, as earlier this year the prime minister told MPs he would introduce a tax in England designed to tackle the NHS backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and later to pay for social care. However, we know a few other changes (or rather lack of changes) that will be announced on Wednesday. Campaigners for a freeze in fuel duty have been told to expect the levy to be frozen for a twelfth year in a row. And separately, the BBC has been told VAT on household energy would not be cut. No VAT cut to household energy bills in Budget The health department will get Â£5bn over the next three years for research and development. This includes Â£95m which will go towards researching methods for treating cancer, obesity and mental health. The money will also be spent on developing genome technology which could detect more than 200 conditions in newborn babies. Â£2.6bn will be spent on creating 30,000 new school places for children with special educational needs and disabilities. The money will also go towards improving school buildings' accessibility and funding new, special provision in free schools England. The Budget will also include Â£1.6bn over three years to roll out new T-levels for 16 to 19-year-olds plus Â£550m for adult skills in England. Currently there are over 6,000 on T-level courses, but the government hopes to ramp up those numbers. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, warned that the extra money was a ""gamble"" as it was unclear how many would want to take the qualification. The government will also spend a further Â£830m modernising colleges in England. Chancellor to pledge funds for skills training What will teenagers study for the new T-levels? The Treasury is allocating Â£1.8bn for building around 160,000 new homes on derelict or unused land - also known as brownfield sites - in England. An extra Â£9m will also go towards allowing councils to turn neglected urban spaces into ""pocket parks"" roughly the size of a tennis court. The chancellor is also expected to confirm Â£65m for digitising England's planning system. Budget: Â£2bn for new homes on derelict land Grants worth Â£1.4bn will be given to ""internationally mobile"" companies to invest in UK infrastructure. This includes Â£345m aimed at increasing resilience for future pandemics and Â£800m for the production of electric vehicles in north-east England and the Midlands. As part of the package, a talent network team will aim to attract high-skilled workers to the UK, through ""innovation hotspots"" initially based in San Francisco and Boston in the US and Bengaluru in India. The government has announced Â£500m to support parents and children in England. This includes Â£200m to support families with complex issues; Â£82m to fund centres in 75 different areas to provide advice for parents; Â£100m for mental health support for expectant parents; and Â£50m for breastfeeding support. Labour has argued that the government previously closed over 1,000 children's centres - known as Sure Start centres - and that this new announcement ""rings hollow"". Mr Sunak defended past cuts, arguing that the new funding would ""create a network of family hubs which are broader than the Sure Start centres"". Ministers pledge Â£500m to support young families Â£850m to restore museums and art galleries including the V&A in London and Tate Liverpool; Â£125m for a scientific research centre in Oxfordshire and Â£75m for regional museums Â£700m to protect UK borders including Â£74m for a new fleet of patrol boats Â£700m for football pitches, tennis courts and youth facilities Â£435m to prevent crime, protect communities and help victims in England and Wales Â£150m for the British Business Bank to encourage development of Dragons' Den-style regional investors outside of London and south east Â£5m for research grants to develop new surgery and treatment options for amputees and blast victims A tax change to encourage shipping companies to the UK Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

"Rishi Sunak said his budget plans delivered for the whole of the UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak has pledged a ""new economy"" while increasing UK government spending by Â£150bn. But what does his Autumn Budget mean for Scotland? While many of the decisions about tax and spending in Scotland are made in Edinburgh, the UK Budget still has a big impact - well beyond the simple question of how much cash goes into Holyrood's coffers. Live: Follow reaction to Rishi Sunak's budget announcement Key budget points at-a-glance Mr Sunak has opted to turn on the spending taps across every government department, and this means Scottish Finance Secretary Kate Forbes will have more cash to allocate when she sets out her own draft budget in December. This is because many of the eye-catching announcements in the UK budget relate to matters which are devolved to Holyrood - for example the Â£24bn earmarked for housing or the Â£21bn for roads. North of the border, Scottish ministers are in charge of housing and transport. So when the Chancellor pledges fresh funding to these areas, an extra chunk of cash is added to the Scottish budget to balance things up and ensure Scottish taxpayers don't end up subsidising giveaways in England. The windfall is calculated based on population levels using the Barnett Formula, and Scottish ministers can spend the cash on whatever they want - this is rather the point of devolution. Mr Sunak said his spending spree would send an average of Â£4.6bn per year extra to Holyrood, resulting in ""the largest block grants for the devolved administrations"" since they were established. However, Ms Forbes contends this is still not enough to deal with the ""significant challenges"" facing Scotland in the wake of the pandemic. She also says it is important to ""get behind the rhetoric and understand what the figures mean"" before she announces her own spending plans on 9 December. Kate Forbes will set out the Scottish government's budget plans in December Not all spending in devolved areas triggers Barnett consequentials. As of this year, some cash is actually going around Holyrood and directly to local projects. The UK government has established a Â£4.8bn ""levelling up"" fund, which allows local authorities to bid for cash for things like building roads and bridges, refurbishing museums and installing electric vehicle charging points. Mr Sunak told MPs that this year, Â£170m had been awarded to Scottish projects. These include the redevelopment of Inverness Castle, the renovation of the Westfield Roundabout in Falkirk, and a new marketplace in Aberdeen city centre - each of which is getting Â£20m of funding. A redevelopment of the Artizan shopping centre in Dumbarton is getting another Â£20m, while Â£38m will be spent improving travel links between Paisley anda local manufacturing innovation hub,external. Up to Â£3m is also being committed to the Burrell Collection in Glasgow in a bid to bring world-class art exhibitions to the city, while another Â£1m is being spent on local projects via the Community Ownership Fund. Inverness Castle is in line for a refit as part of the levelling up fund This is partly to do with the government's ""levelling up"" agenda, an attempt to rebalance an economy previously seen as being skewed towards London and the south-east of England - while helpfully winning over former Labour voters in ""red wall"" constituencies in the north of England. But it also plays into a longer-term Downing Street strategy to have a more visible presence in Scotland. UK ministers hope that by directly funding projects north of the border, they can write themselves into some local success stories and perhaps dampen enthusiasm for independence. Scottish ministers meanwhile do not like the idea of being cut out of the loop, saying this ""undermines devolution"". They instinctively contest the idea that officials in London are better placed to assess the merit of funding bids than those in Edinburgh. Funding for Scottish projects in Budget The political difficulty though is that these are positive projects backed by local councils - some of them SNP-run - and so extra cash for them cannot be opposed outright. Instead, the complaint tends to be more procedural, about the decision-making process and the complexity of the funding landscape. This may also become a more common occurrence going forward, with the UK Shared Prosperity Fund set to replace EU structural funds in 2022 - again sparkingcomplaints that Holyrood is being bypassed. A range of different taxes are devolved to Holyrood - but others are not, and the interplay between the two means changes announced at Westminster can still have far-reaching implications in Scotland. For example, income tax rates and bands are devolved, with Scotland operatingits own five-band systemwhich the government in Edinburgh argues is fairer. However, the tax-free allowance is still reserved, which as the starting point where taxes kick in clearly has a knock-on effect on the entire system. So what is actually changing, and what is not? The national living wage is set UK-wide, so the increase there - to Â£9.50 an hour for over-23s - will apply north of the border. And while an increasing range of welfare powers are being taken over by Social Security Scotland, Universal Credit is also reserved to Westminster - so thechanges to the ""taper rate"", allowing working claimants to keep more of the money they earn as their wages increase, will also apply in Scotland. Moving away from personal taxes, business rates are fully devolved to Holyrood as non-domestic rates - and the Scottish governmenthas already committed to rates relieffor the hospitality and retail sectors. The Scottish government dropped its own plans for an air passenger duty cut in 2019 The cut to air passenger duty on domestic flights will apply in Scotland - Aberdeen and Inverness were specifically cited by the Chancellor as beneficiaries, although Inverness is actually exempt from the levy. While there have long been plans to replace air passenger duty with a devolved Air Departure Tax, the move has been tied up in technical wrangles for years - chiefly because of that exemption for Highlands and Islands airports. Incidentally, Scottish ministers wanted to do away with the levy entirely - butditched this plan in 2019citing environmental concerns. This has freed them up to raise an eyebrow at Mr Sunak's plan coming on the eve of the COP26 climate conference. The overhaul of alcohol duties will have effect in Scotland too. While there is a system of minimum unit pricing in Scotland, this is not actually a tax, with retailers pocketing the proceeds of increased prices. The freeze on current alcohol duty is also good news for the Scottish whisky industry, which had been lobbying against a planned increase. Rishi Sunak seems determined that this is seen as a red, white and blue budget - a budget for the whole of the UK. As he chose to put it: ""We are, and always will be, one family - one United Kingdom"". That is obviously in dispute in Scotland where the SNP and others aspire to independence - so what did the Chancellor do to try and strengthen the Union? As well as extra cash for the Scottish government, there is the so-called ""levelling up"" money which involves the UK government spending more directly in Scotland. There's likely to be more of this after COP26 when UK ministers publish their Union connectivity review identifying cross-border transport investments. The budget also included a cut to air passenger duty for internal UK flights which Mr Sunak said was designed to ""bring people together across the UK"". There was even a UK-wide scheme to boost numeracy skills, although education is a Holyrood responsibility. What nationalists might see as Treasury overreach was also a signal to unionists that this Chancellor is committed to their cause. A tiny pub in the most inaccessible village in Scotland; a roundabout in Falkirk: a shopping centre in Dunbartonshire; the stable block in Glasgow's Pollok Park - the UK budget is going very local. Over 22 years of devolution, it had become increasingly a spending budget for England, with devolved bells and whistles, and taxes that mainly covered the whole of the UK. But that's changing. This budget marks a big shift towards the UK government planting its union flags on Scottish government turf. The Levelling Up Fund offers Â£170m to Scottish projects, this year, and Â£400m over three years - money that would previously have gone through the block grant at Holyrood, for ministers there to allocate. Community Ownership and Regeneration Funds also pick pet projects that show the difference some Whitehall money can make, backing some really small projects from Whithorn to Kinloch Rannoch. An extension of that will come with the Shared Prosperity Fund, which will ramp up as European Union structural funds are wound down. That, too, will bypass Holyrood, because Westminster wants its own direct links to projects on the ground.

"Taxes on sparkling wine, draught beer and cider are to be cut, but will rise for stronger drinks such as red wine following a shake-up of alcohol duty. The new system, due to start in 2023, will mean higher duty for stronger alcohol, the chancellor said. The duty premium on sparkling wines will end and the duty on draught beer and cider served in pubs will be cut. Chancellor Rishi Sunak called it the ""most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years"". He also announced that the planned increase in duty on spirits, wine, cider and beer due to take effect from midnight on Wednesday has been cancelled. Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money Follow live coverage of the Budget Economy set to hit pre-Covid level at end of year ""To radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from 15 to just six,"" the chancellor said. ""Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate. This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines, or high-strength 'white ciders' will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed given their strength."" Mr Sunak said many lower alcohol drinks were ""currently overtaxed"", adding: ""Rose, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines - today's changes mean they will pay less."" In relation to sparkling wines, Mr Sunak said: ""I'm going to end the irrational duty premium of 28% that they currently pay. Sparkling wines - wherever they are produced - will now pay the same duty as still wines of equivalent strength."" The cut to sparkling wine duty was welcomed by Kate Goodman, owner of Cheshire drinks importer Reserve Wines, but she was disappointed that the change was not immediate. ""Christmas is our busiest period. It would have great to introduce this before that time. We need help to get back on our feet after a pretty crippling 18 months,"" she said. Reducing duty on lower alcohol drinks will encourage people to buy English wines, said Jonathan Piggins, chief executive of English wine merchant Corkk. ""The UK's vineyards are being taken increasingly seriously by the major overseas players and reducing the tax on lower alcohol drinks, will give the country an even more prominent position on the global wine map."" The changes were less welcomed by Liam Manton, co-founder of Didsbury Gin. ""Additional tax on high ABV drinks will present a real challenge to businesses like ours,"" he said, adding that on average 70% of the price of a bottle of gin is already tax. Draught beers and ciders will attract a new lower rate of duty In a move to help struggling pubs, Mr Sunak announced a new lower rate of duty for draught drinks, which he said would cut the cost of a pint by about three pence. He said the ""draught relief will cut duty by 5%"" and ""will apply to drinks served from draught containers over 40 litres"". The chancellor said this would particularly benefit community pubs ""who do 75% of their trade on draught"". He also announced proposals for a new ""small producer relief"" to include small cidermakers and other producers making alcoholic drinks of less than 8.5% alcohol by volume (ABV). Jez Lamb, founder of Wirral-based craft beer marketplace, Beers @ No.42, said the draught relief favoured the big players in the market, not the smaller, independent breweries who need support most. ""It's brilliant to see alcohol duty cut on draught beer but that's only for ""containers"" more than 40L. That is great for the big breweries but so many smaller craft brewers only supply in 30L containers,"" he said. Creating a draught rate and simplifying the duty system is positive news, said Nick Mackenzie, chief executive of Greene King, which has 2,700 pubs. ""It is a much needed vote of confidence in the great British pub as we face into an uncertain winter, labour disruption and rising costs."" William Robinson, managing director of Stockport brewery Robinsons, said the lower draught beer duty rate and the cancellation of the planned inflation-linked increase in beer duty showed that the chancellor ""recognises the contribution pubs make to the communities they support and serve.""

The new system, due to start in 2023, will mean higher duty for stronger alcohol, the chancellor said. The duty premium on sparkling wines will end and the duty on draught beer and cider served in pubs will be cut. Chancellor Rishi Sunak called it the ""most radical simplification of alcohol duties for over 140 years"". He also announced that the planned increase in duty on spirits, wine, cider and beer due to take effect from midnight on Wednesday has been cancelled. Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money Follow live coverage of the Budget Economy set to hit pre-Covid level at end of year ""To radically simplify the system, we are slashing the number of main duty rates from 15 to just six,"" the chancellor said. ""Our new system will be designed around a common-sense principle: the stronger the drink, the higher the rate. This means that some drinks, like stronger red wines, fortified wines, or high-strength 'white ciders' will see a small increase in their rates because they are currently undertaxed given their strength."" Mr Sunak said many lower alcohol drinks were ""currently overtaxed"", adding: ""Rose, fruit ciders, liqueurs, lower strength beers and wines - today's changes mean they will pay less."" In relation to sparkling wines, Mr Sunak said: ""I'm going to end the irrational duty premium of 28% that they currently pay. Sparkling wines - wherever they are produced - will now pay the same duty as still wines of equivalent strength."" The cut to sparkling wine duty was welcomed by Kate Goodman, owner of Cheshire drinks importer Reserve Wines, but she was disappointed that the change was not immediate. ""Christmas is our busiest period. It would have great to introduce this before that time. We need help to get back on our feet after a pretty crippling 18 months,"" she said. Reducing duty on lower alcohol drinks will encourage people to buy English wines, said Jonathan Piggins, chief executive of English wine merchant Corkk. ""The UK's vineyards are being taken increasingly seriously by the major overseas players and reducing the tax on lower alcohol drinks, will give the country an even more prominent position on the global wine map."" The changes were less welcomed by Liam Manton, co-founder of Didsbury Gin. ""Additional tax on high ABV drinks will present a real challenge to businesses like ours,"" he said, adding that on average 70% of the price of a bottle of gin is already tax. Draught beers and ciders will attract a new lower rate of duty In a move to help struggling pubs, Mr Sunak announced a new lower rate of duty for draught drinks, which he said would cut the cost of a pint by about three pence. He said the ""draught relief will cut duty by 5%"" and ""will apply to drinks served from draught containers over 40 litres"". The chancellor said this would particularly benefit community pubs ""who do 75% of their trade on draught"". He also announced proposals for a new ""small producer relief"" to include small cidermakers and other producers making alcoholic drinks of less than 8.5% alcohol by volume (ABV). Jez Lamb, founder of Wirral-based craft beer marketplace, Beers @ No.42, said the draught relief favoured the big players in the market, not the smaller, independent breweries who need support most. ""It's brilliant to see alcohol duty cut on draught beer but that's only for ""containers"" more than 40L. That is great for the big breweries but so many smaller craft brewers only supply in 30L containers,"" he said. Creating a draught rate and simplifying the duty system is positive news, said Nick Mackenzie, chief executive of Greene King, which has 2,700 pubs. ""It is a much needed vote of confidence in the great British pub as we face into an uncertain winter, labour disruption and rising costs."" William Robinson, managing director of Stockport brewery Robinsons, said the lower draught beer duty rate and the cancellation of the planned inflation-linked increase in beer duty showed that the chancellor ""recognises the contribution pubs make to the communities they support and serve.""

"The river was level with the pedestrian bridge in Cockermouth Rain has continued to fall overnight in Cumbria after about 40 properties were flooded and road and rail travel were hit on Thursday. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning, meaning some disruption is possible, and the Environment Agency has nine flood warnings in place. On Thursday Honister Pass saw over 30cm (12in) of rain in a 24-hour period. Motorists are warned that some roads are only passable with extreme care, and asked only to travel if necessary. Train operators are asking people to avoid travelling on the West Coast Main Line and Cumbria Coastal routes, and there is no service between Barrow and Carlisle until the line has been inspected. The flooding hit Waterhead at Ambleside On Thursday a number of roads, including the A591 between Rydal and Grasmere and the A592 Patterdale Road, were flooded. Karl Melville, the senior manager at the county council's highways team, said work had been going on all night to try to re-open as many roads as possible. He said: ""We have made some good progress [and] a lot of the roads that were closed are now passable with care. ""But obviously this does not take away the very clear advice of if you don't need to travel then don't travel."" The A592 was blocked by a number of vehicles at Windermere School on Thursday The Environment Agency said 1,200 properties had been protected from flooding by its officers shutting flood gates and removing debris and blockages from grilles and watercourses. But flood duty manager Ben Lukey urged people ""to remain vigilant"". ""Surface water and river flooding could still bring disruption to further communities,"" he warned. Mountain rescue volunteers brought two holidaymakers and their dog to safety Two holiday makers and their dog had to be rescued from their accommodation at Southwaite Mill by the Cockermouth Mountain Rescue Team. With water chest high in places, volunteers brought them to safety in a raft. Some streets in Cockermouth flooded Cockermouth and District Chamber of Trade chairman Andrew Marshall said huge insurance policy excesses introduced after the floods of 2009 and 2015 meant 90% of businesses would have to pay for any repairs themselves. ""Ever since then it's been nigh on impossible to get insurance,"" he said. ""If we get flooded this time we've got to pay for the rebuild and everything, which goes into hundreds of thousands."" Insurers have imposed excesses of up to Â£50,000 for business flooding claims in the area, Mr Marshall said. After previous floods caused widespread damage to properties the governmentintroduced a scheme,externalto help residents get insurance ""but it wasn't extended to business"", he said. Coniston Boating Centre is normally not in the lake Gillian Jackson owns holiday lets in Cockermouth, some of which have flooded. ""We've been through this before so it's just get up, get on with it,"" she said. ""Yes, it's upsetting but we've kind of got a bit hardened to it, got used to it, and we've just got to crack on and sort it out."" On Thursday afternoon, staff at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant were advised to speak to their bosses about returning home if possible, after checking road conditions. In a message to employees, the company warned detours would be needed around road closures on the A595 at Duddon Bridge, Santon Bridge and Holmrook and that Millom was reported to be unreachable by road. ""Shift co-ordinators will maintain minimum safety manning levels in plants but others should head home once clarified with their line managers,"" it said. The pitch at Keswick Rugby Club was swamped There was also flood damage to the clubhouse Nine flood warnings,external(where flooding is expected) and 15 flood alerts (where it is possible) were in place on Friday morning. In the 24 hours to 03:00 on Thursday Honister Pass saw 307.4mm (1ft) of rain, according to the Environment Agency. The River Rothay was among those that burst their banks. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: âTodayâs Budget delivers a stronger economy for British peopleâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told MPs the Budget begins the work to prepare for a new economy post Covid, as he delivers his speech in the Commons. Spending plans for transport, health and education have been unveiled in the press. Mr Sunak is under pressure to help people with the cost of living. Sources say he will adjust the universal credit taper rate, meaning those working will be able to take home more of the money they earn. A Â£20 a week top up to the benefit was cut earlier this month, but details of any changes have yet to be announced. LIVE: Sunak set to unveil Budget Faisal Islam: Will Sunak's plans calm cost of living concerns? A simple guide to Budget 2021 Budget 2021: What has already been announced? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will not be responding to the Budget, as the leader of the opposition is normally expected to do, as he is isolating after testing positive for Covid. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out Labour's response instead. According to Downing Street, Mr Sunak told the cabinet on Wednesday morning that his Budget ""will deliver a stronger economy for the British people"" with the ""levelling-up"" agenda - spreading prosperity around the country - a ""golden thread"" running through it. The chancellor is under pressure to reveal more about the economic outlook, with government debt soaring to record peace time levels in the wake of the pandemic. And he will deliver a three-year spending review alongside his Budget. The Treasury has asked departments to find ""at least 5% of savings and efficiencies from their day-to-day budgets"" - so it is clear not every area will get the same treatment. Policies already unveiled from the chancellor's Budget include: Â£6.9bn for English city regions to spend on train, tram, bus and cycle projects - including the Â£4.2bn promised in 2019 alongside funding for buses announced by the PM in 2020 Â£5.9bn for NHS Englandto tackle the backlog of people waiting for tests and scans A rise in the National Living Wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50, to come into effect from 1 April Â£2.6bn to be spent on creating 30,000 new school places for children with special educational needs and disabilities Â£1.6bn over three years to roll out new T-levels for 16 to 19-year-olds and Â£550m for adult skills in England You can read more on the announcements the government has already made here. One of the pre-announced policies is theend to a pay freeze for public sector workers- such as teachers, nurses and police officers - but ministers have so far refused to say whether it will be a real-terms rise by being higher than inflation. Pay for most frontline workforces is set by independent pay review bodies and No 10 has said it could not ""prejudge that process"". Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle was furious about the number of spending plans that were given to the media before Mr Sunak's big speech - they are traditionally meant to be announced in Parliament so MPs can challenge and scrutinise them. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing echoed the reproof just before the Chancellor got to his feet. A No 10 spokesman said they ""recognised the importance of parliamentary scrutiny"" and they ""always listen very carefully to the Speaker"". This video can not be played Sir Lindsay Hoyle says it is ânot acceptable"" for ministers to give briefings to the media before Parliament. Whisper it. After the economy took an absolute hammering during the pandemic, might the chancellor tomorrow actually be in a much cheerier political mood than he could have predicted? During his Budget warm-up in the last few days, Rishi Sunak has already totted up promises of around an extra Â£20bn of spending, as well as announcing how some of the cash that was already promised is going to be carved up. Hold on for a second though. On the specifics, there is no guarantee that unfreezing the wages of 2.5 million workers in England will mean they get pay rises that aren't eroded by inflation. The same goes for increases for workers on low pay, and cuts to universal credit will pinch too. Having treated us all to cosy snaps of him and his Labrador, Nova, and him hard at work in his athleisure wear, Rishi Sunak wants to give the political impression that he's a chancellor we can all be comfortable with - careful with our money, but not afraid to spend it on things that matter, who has modern Tory instincts, but won't ditch the party's traditions. But remember Budget warm-ups are just that. However many announcements there have already been, however carefully the photographs of the prep have been thought through and selected, what matters is what he actually says at lunchtime on Wednesday. What matters are the numbers - what's in black and white - in the end. Read more from Laura here. Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""The Budget must take the pressure off working people. ""With costs growing and inflation rising, Labour would cut VAT on domestic energy bills immediately for six months. ""Unlike the Tories, we wouldn't hike taxes on working people and we'd ensure online giants pay their fair share."" Ex-Tory chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Newscast the government should not use higher wages as ""a bung"" to secure the support of low income voters. ""The instinct to send a message to business that we need to invest more capital rather than just relying on cheap labour, I think is the right instinct, I would support that,"" he said. Adam Scorer, chief executive of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, warned it was going to be a ""brutal and bitter winter for millions of householders"" who were unable to bear the costs of energy price rises. He called for the chancellor to find a way to put some of the extra tax receipts raised by the price increases back in the pockets of the most vulnerable.

"Rishi Sunak presented his budget in Westminster on Wednesday The chancellor's Budget has promised a cash boost for Welsh public services and more money for low-paid workers on universal credit. Rishi Sunak promised to increase Welsh government budgets by an average of Â£2.5bn a year. Just over Â£120m from the levelling-up fund was also earmarked for ten Welsh projects. The Labour-led Welsh government accused the Treasury of leaving ""clear gaps in funding"". It said its own calls for cash to tackle coal-tips or additional funding for rail infrastructure have gone unanswered. Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance UK economy to reach pre-Covid level at end of year Starmer misses Budget after positive Covid test In his announcement the chancellor promised a cut to the ""taper rate"" - the point on universal credit where the benefit is reduced because of the money someone earns. It will drop from 63% to 55%. Recent statistics suggest just under 100,000 people in Wales in low-wage jobs are on universal credit. It follows the decisionto end the Â£20-a-week upliftgiven during the pandemic. Mr Sunak said: ""An additional Â£2.5bn per year in Barnett funding means the Welsh government is well-funded to deliver all their devolved responsibilities, while the people in Wales will also benefit from this government's commitment to levelling-up opportunity and delivering for all parts of the UK."" The chancellor said all of the UK will benefit from the planned UK Shared Prosperity Fund, which is planned to replace EU aid. ""Over time"" it will match EU funding of around Â£1.5bn a year, he said. But the Welsh government suggested Wales would receive less than the Â£375m in European funds it had in the past, although it said arrangements for replacing EU cash remain unclear. Welsh finance minister Rebecca Evans said: ""While the spending review does give us some medium term financial certainty and some additional investment, it is more than offset by the inflationary and system pressures that we are facing. ""The budget fails to meet the scale of the challenge that families, public services and the wider economy are still facing as a result of the pandemic."" While many services in Wales like health and education are run from Cardiff, and Rishi Sunak cannot decide how money on them is spent, big decisions on benefit and tax are UK-wide. They include: A cut to the taper rate of universal credit no later than 1 December Increase to national minimum wage for those over 23 to Â£9.50 an hour Cuts to air passenger duty for domestic UK flights Planned rise in the duty on spirits, wine, cider and beer cancelled Planned rise in fuel duty cancelled Welsh government money funds services like health and schools, which are overseen by ministers in Wales rather than Westminster. The Treasury said it would provide an ""additional Â£2.5bn per year"" in funding for that purpose. Budget documents show the cash received by Welsh government will go up from Â£15.9bn this financial year to Â£17.7bn by 2023, to Â£18bn in 2024 and Â£18.2bn in 2025 - with an overall increase of Â£2.3bn by 2025. The Treasury said the figures in the budget document take into account money taken off the grant to the Welsh government because of devolved taxes. It explained the Â£2.5bn figure is an average of the extra cash earmarked for Wales, when compared to this year, for each of those three years - Â£2.2bn in 2022/23, Â£2.6bn in 2023/24 and Â£3.0bn in 2024/25. Ministers in Cardiff will decide how to spend their money over the next couple of months. The Treasury also promised Â£460,000 of the Community Ownership Fund for three projects. The UK government said it would fund a ""Veterans Commissioner for Wales"", and would bring forward Â£105m for the Cardiff City Region Deal projects. Welsh government funds are spent on the health service and other devolved services Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake accused the chancellor of failing to offer a ""transformative Budget that would put money in people's pockets in the short and long-term as well as ambitious policies to set a global example ahead of COP26"". ""Â£2.5bn for Wales is a good headline for the UK government. But let's put that into perspective. Wales is owed around Â£5bn in consequential funding from HS2, which the chancellor once again today decided to withhold from Wales."" Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said it is ""shocking to see the UK government is cutting air passenger duty on the eve of COP26"". ""What message does this send to the world about how seriously we take our climate goals?"" she said. Simon Hart, Conservative Welsh Secretary, told BBC Wales that he was ""mystified"" by the Welsh government's calls for support to clear up coal tips. ""Actually, courtesy of the Barnett formula and the money that we are able to provide Welsh government, they're getting at least Â£250m from UK government over the next six years for flood alleviation alone,"" he said. ""It completely dumbfounds me that they can possibly turn around and say that we're not providing sufficient funding."" Where are the levelling-up fund projects? The UK government has offered a total of Â£121m from its Â£4.8bn levelling-up fund to ten projects, including: Pontcysyllte Aqueduct and Canal World Heritage Site Redevelopment of the Theatr Brycheiniog Arts Centre in Brecon Montgomery Canal in North Powys 20km path from Carmarthen to Llandeilo Old College and Marina in Aberystwyth Muni Arts Centre in Pontypridd Haverfordwest Castle The Carmarthen Hwb The Porth Transport Hub Turning 1.3km of the A4119 road into a dual carriageway Since the UK government is chairing a global conference on combating climate change, starting in Glasgow in a few days, you might have expected the chancellor to have focused his budget on moving towards a green economy. There was no news for one of Wales' big employers, Tata Steel, which has called for a road map to help it decide how to move from using fossil fuels. The chancellor did announce a second issue of green bonds, but his focus was on general economic growth not on developing new green industries and ways of operating. In contrast, rather than encouraging us to fly less he reduced air passenger duty to lower the cost of flying between England, Scotland and Wales to ""bring people together"". The planned increase in fuel duty has been cancelled. Drivers struggling with higher prices at the pump may welcome this but those who want to encourage us out of cars to help the planet will be disappointed. Average wages in Wales are significantly below the average for the UK and many working families are dependent on extra money from Universal Credit. The Â£20-a-week top up that they had been getting has of course ended but now if they work extra hours they will lose less money from their UC payments. However prices are predicted to continue to rise and that along with increases in national insurance will continue to squeeze incomes. What would Sunak's pay freeze end mean in Wales?

"Finance Minister Conor Murphy says the budget allocation will amount to Â£1.9bn over three years Finance minister Conor Murphy has disputed a claim by the chancellor that Northern Ireland will get an extra Â£1.6bn per year for public services. Rishi Sunak said his budget allocation represented the largest annual funding settlement for devolved governments since 1998. But Mr Murphy said it would create ""significant challenges"". He said it would amount to Â£1.9bn for day-to-day spending over three years - ""nowhere near"" what is required. Treasury figures show the budget allocation will mean day-to-day spending in Northern Ireland will increase by an average of 2.1% in real terms each year up to 2025. Infrastructure spending will increase by an average of 2.5% a year over the same period. The Treasury said this gave the Northern Ireland Executive ""sufficient funding certainty"" to plan in-year spending and to provide additional future investments in areas such as health, social care and education. A simple guide to Budget 2021 But Mr Murphy said when compared to the executive's 2021-22 budget, there will be an additional Â£450m, Â£670m and Â£866m over the next three years for day-to-day spending ""against growing demand for public services"". This, he added, represented a 0.9% real term increase to the executive's budget next year, turning to zero real terms change by 2024-25. ""This spending review was the opportunity to deliver a budget which would have enabled the executive to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery,"" Mr Murphy said. ""However it provides a marginal real terms increase in funding next year which will be far outweighed by increased demands on public services, particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic."" Mr Murphy said a multi-year budget enables the executive to better plan and prioritise its finances. He said his priority was supporting the health service and tackling waiting lists. Separately, there is an initial budget allocation of Â£50m from the government's levelling up fund. It is for 11 projects including redeveloping the Dundonald Ice Bowl and extending cycle routes across the Belfast City Region. Mr Sunak also said he will cut Air Passenger Duty (APD) by half on internal UK flights. A cut in APD is a long standing request of Northern Ireland politicians and business leaders. It will mean a new domestic band for APD set at Â£6.50. The rate will apply to all flights between airports in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (excluding private jets). The government has also announceda proposal to solve a NI Protocol related issue,externalconcerning the VAT paid on second cars coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Mr Murphy has previouslyalready played down expectations that the spending review would mean significant extra resources. Earlier this week, he said there was ""little indication"" the government would ""provide the investment needed to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery"". However, he said the ability to produce a multi-year budget would provide an opportunity to ""better plan and prioritise finances"". Stormont has not had a multi-year budget since 2011-2015. That has made it difficult for public sector managers to plan services, particularly in health. The finance minister is trying to build consensus among his executive colleagues that the bulk of any additional funds should go to health even if other departments lose out. He aims to publish a draft budget before Christmas which would then go out to consultation before being finalised early next year. The Institute of Directors Northern Ireland said the additional money will be a ""shot in the arm for the local administration"". ""It is incumbent now on ministers to deliver on the incredible potential it presents, with a focus, through targeted investment in key services and infrastructure, on ensuring this region is fit to capitalise on the green recovery as we continue to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic,"" said national director, Kirsty McManus. Retail NI said the chancellor's 50% rates discount for retailers in England was welcome. The organisation added it was ""absolutely vital"" that Conor Murphy ensures this also applies to small traders in Northern Ireland. Matthew Hall, George Best Belfast City Airport chief executive, said the airport had for many years been lobbying government for the abolition of APD. ""A 50% reduction in APD is a half-way house in terms of solving a problem which has placed the aviation sector in Northern Ireland at a competitive disadvantage with other regions in attracting new airlines and routes,"" he said. ""Today's announcement by the chancellor will not take effect until April 2023 and does little in the short term to alleviate a sector still decimated by Covid."" SDLP leader and MP Colum Eastwood said the budget was a ""grim spectacle"". ""Now we have some certainty on multi-year funding the onus is on Conor Murphy to actually take responsibility and deliver a multi-year plan to tackle our waiting list crisis and present a credible plan for our economy,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) assembly member Steve Aiken said the extra Â£1.6bn a year ""underlines the advantage of being part of the fifth largest economy in the world"". ""We still have a long way to go to emerge fully from the Covid pandemic but this budget, if properly used to support the needs of Northern Ireland, gives us a good chance,"" he said. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson said the multi year budget should help devolved finance ministers plan spending better.

"Sahl would often carry a newspaper on stage Legendary US comedian and political satirist Mort Sahl - who skewered US presidents from Dwight Eisenhower to Donald Trump - has died. He passed away on Tuesday in Mill Valley, California, at the age of 94 of old age, a friend told AP News. Sahl's biting political commentary won him legions of fans starting in the 1950s and has been credited as the inspiration for modern stand-up comedy. His Cold War material is credited for setting the bar for political comedy. A host of comedians and comedy show producers have paid tribute, including Albert Brooks, Laraine Newman and Richard Lewis. This is Spinal Tap star and Simpsons stalwart Harry Shearer said Sahl had ""invented modern American political satire"". Born in Montreal, Sahl moved with his family to Los Angeles as a child and got his start as a comedian at San Francisco's beatnik hungry i club. He quickly went on to perform at comedy clubs around the US. He hosted the first-ever Grammy Awards in 1959 and co-hosted the Academy Awards that same year. He was featured on the cover of Time Magazine in 1960, starred in several films and was a frequent guest host on Johnny Carson's The Tonight Show on NBC. Known for his trademark sweater and loafers - at a time when performers often wore tuxedos - Sahl would come on to stage carrying a newspaper with notes for his act written on it. He favoured story-telling rather than lounge-style stand-up punchlines. A comedic blunderbuss, Sahl prided himself on poking fun at all sides, often asking at shows: ""Is there anyone here I haven't offended?"" ""A conservative is someone who believes in reform,"" he once said. ""But not now."" He also joked: ""Liberals are people who do the right things for the wrong reasons so they can feel good for 10 minutes."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sahl ridiculed President John F Kennedy before going on to write jokes for his campaign. After Kennedy was elected, he turned to mocking him again. Following the Democrat's assassination, Sahl's career took a downturn as he dedicated large portions of his shows to ridiculing the official account of Kennedy's death. But after the Watergate scandal in the early 1970s, which led to the resignation of Richard Nixon, his career picked up again. Sahl's opposition to the Vietnam War also brought him some new followers in the late 60s and early 70s. He continued to perform stand up into his 80s, even after suffering a stroke. At age 80 he began teaching a course in critical thinking at Claremont McKenna College in California. All four of his marriages ended in divorce, and his only son died in 1996. He has no immediate surviving family members.

"Funding per pupil in England's schools is to be restored to 2010 levels over the next three years, the Chancellor has announced. This means an extra Â£4.7bn for schools in England by 2024-2025 and a cash increase for every child of Â£1,500, Rishi Sunak said. But it will not cover the 9% fall in funding since 2009 - the biggest cut in 40 years. The Chancellor also pledged an extra Â£2bn for education recovery from Covid. Chancellor to pledge funds for skills training Â£78bn wage hit from pandemic lost learning - study Ministers pledge Â£500m to support young families This brings spending on Covid catch-up since 2019 to nearly Â£5bn, Mr Sunak said in his Budget statement. The recovery fund falls far short of what education unions and the former catch-up tsar, Sir Kevan Collins, said was required - around Â£15bn. And the cash injection in basic school funding is unlikely to meet the hopes of teachers and head teachers in the biggest unions. The spending will also have to cover any rise in teachers' pay, which has been signalled with the announcement that the public sector pay freeze would be lifted. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""Even in the best-case analysis this still represents no growth in school funding for 15 years, and this commitment does not address the stark reality in 16-19 education where the learner rate is far too low. ""What we do know is that school and college budgets are very thinly stretched and the financial situation continues to be extremely difficult. ""The additional funding for education recovery following the Covid pandemic is nowhere near what is needed. ""Alongside other education organisations and school trusts, we submitted in August a proposal for an additional Â£5.8 billion of spending over the next three years focused in particular on supporting disadvantaged young people."" National Education Union joint general secretary, Kevin Courtney said:""Taking so long to restore the cuts made from 2010 onwards should not be a matter of pride for any Government, but one of embarrassment."" A recent snapshot survey of 1,500 heads for the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) found almost a third were already making budget cuts last year with 35% expecting to make cuts this academic year. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, said: ""Children and young people have been hugely affected by the pandemic. The government has made bold claims about 'levelling up' and 'no child left behind'. The investment announced today doesn't meet those goals or the futures needs of the country. ""The increase in per pupil spending announced by the government takes us back to 2010 levels. This is no proud boast, as it represents a failure to invest in children's futures for over a decade. ""Schools will do their best with what they are given, as they always do. It is important that schools are able to spend recovery money flexibly on the programmes they know work best for the children in most need in their schools."" There was a surprise additional Â£2 billion for education recovery in England in today's Budget, taking the total so far to around Â£5 billion.  This will be welcomed but it falls far short of the more substantial  Â£10 to Â£15 billion called for by education charities, unions and the government's former advisor Sir Kevan Collins. They have pointed to a disadvantage gap which has widened during the pandemic. Schools facing rising costs from heating bills, national insurance and teachers pay will be disappointed that overall spending per pupil is not being given a greater uplift.   Instead the Chancellor confirmed that by 2024-25 per pupil spending in England's schools will be restored, in real terms,  to the same level as 2010. There was also confirmation of funding to increase the number of places for children with special educational needs and disabilities. The Chancellor also announced an additional Â£170m by 2024-25 for the funding paid to nurseries and early years providers for state-backed nursery places. Neil Leitch, of the Early Years Alliance, welcomed the extra money but said: ""As always, however, the devil is in the detail and we await further confirmation on how exactly this funding will translate into rate increases for the sector over the coming years. ""While the annual level of investment our sector is set to receive over the next three years will result in a higher increase in early entitlement funding rates than we have seen over recent years, there is still an incredibly long way to go to make up the Â£2.60 per hour funding shortfall that the government's own cost calculations revealed. ""What's more, we know that for many nurseries, pre-schools and childminders, even remaining afloat until next April is set to be a real struggle. As such, we would urge the government to look at what short-term, emergency support can be given to those providers already on the brink of closure.

"Finance Minister Conor Murphy says the budget allocation will amount to Â£1.9bn over three years Finance minister Conor Murphy has disputed a claim by the chancellor that Northern Ireland will get an extra Â£1.6bn per year for public services. Rishi Sunak said his budget allocation represented the largest annual funding settlement for devolved governments since 1998. But Mr Murphy said it would create ""significant challenges"". He said it would amount to Â£1.9bn for day-to-day spending over three years - ""nowhere near"" what is required. Treasury figures show the budget allocation will mean day-to-day spending in Northern Ireland will increase by an average of 2.1% in real terms each year up to 2025. Infrastructure spending will increase by an average of 2.5% a year over the same period. The Treasury said this gave the Northern Ireland Executive ""sufficient funding certainty"" to plan in-year spending and to provide additional future investments in areas such as health, social care and education. A simple guide to Budget 2021 But Mr Murphy said when compared to the executive's 2021-22 budget, there will be an additional Â£450m, Â£670m and Â£866m over the next three years for day-to-day spending ""against growing demand for public services"". This, he added, represented a 0.9% real term increase to the executive's budget next year, turning to zero real terms change by 2024-25. ""This spending review was the opportunity to deliver a budget which would have enabled the executive to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery,"" Mr Murphy said. ""However it provides a marginal real terms increase in funding next year which will be far outweighed by increased demands on public services, particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic."" Mr Murphy said a multi-year budget enables the executive to better plan and prioritise its finances. He said his priority was supporting the health service and tackling waiting lists. Separately, there is an initial budget allocation of Â£50m from the government's levelling up fund. It is for 11 projects including redeveloping the Dundonald Ice Bowl and extending cycle routes across the Belfast City Region. Mr Sunak also said he will cut Air Passenger Duty (APD) by half on internal UK flights. A cut in APD is a long standing request of Northern Ireland politicians and business leaders. It will mean a new domestic band for APD set at Â£6.50. The rate will apply to all flights between airports in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland (excluding private jets). The government has also announceda proposal to solve a NI Protocol related issue,externalconcerning the VAT paid on second cars coming into Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Mr Murphy has previouslyalready played down expectations that the spending review would mean significant extra resources. Earlier this week, he said there was ""little indication"" the government would ""provide the investment needed to rebuild public services and spur economic recovery"". However, he said the ability to produce a multi-year budget would provide an opportunity to ""better plan and prioritise finances"". Stormont has not had a multi-year budget since 2011-2015. That has made it difficult for public sector managers to plan services, particularly in health. The finance minister is trying to build consensus among his executive colleagues that the bulk of any additional funds should go to health even if other departments lose out. He aims to publish a draft budget before Christmas which would then go out to consultation before being finalised early next year. The Institute of Directors Northern Ireland said the additional money will be a ""shot in the arm for the local administration"". ""It is incumbent now on ministers to deliver on the incredible potential it presents, with a focus, through targeted investment in key services and infrastructure, on ensuring this region is fit to capitalise on the green recovery as we continue to emerge from the coronavirus pandemic,"" said national director, Kirsty McManus. Retail NI said the chancellor's 50% rates discount for retailers in England was welcome. The organisation added it was ""absolutely vital"" that Conor Murphy ensures this also applies to small traders in Northern Ireland. Matthew Hall, George Best Belfast City Airport chief executive, said the airport had for many years been lobbying government for the abolition of APD. ""A 50% reduction in APD is a half-way house in terms of solving a problem which has placed the aviation sector in Northern Ireland at a competitive disadvantage with other regions in attracting new airlines and routes,"" he said. ""Today's announcement by the chancellor will not take effect until April 2023 and does little in the short term to alleviate a sector still decimated by Covid."" SDLP leader and MP Colum Eastwood said the budget was a ""grim spectacle"". ""Now we have some certainty on multi-year funding the onus is on Conor Murphy to actually take responsibility and deliver a multi-year plan to tackle our waiting list crisis and present a credible plan for our economy,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) assembly member Steve Aiken said the extra Â£1.6bn a year ""underlines the advantage of being part of the fifth largest economy in the world"". ""We still have a long way to go to emerge fully from the Covid pandemic but this budget, if properly used to support the needs of Northern Ireland, gives us a good chance,"" he said. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson said the multi year budget should help devolved finance ministers plan spending better.

"The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the government's forecaster has warned. Its latest forecast says inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% in 2022. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says figures released since its report was compiled suggest inflation could hit almost 5%. The chancellor acknowledged that household budgets are strained. Rishi Sunak described the overall economic picture as ""strong"" in the short term, with the OBR now expecting the economy to return to its pre-pandemic level six months earlier than it had forecast previously. However, he acknowledged the inflation rate was ""likely to rise further"" from its 3.1% rate in September. He said it was due to increased demand for energy and supply chain issues as economies and factories reopening following coronavirus lockdowns. ""The pressures caused by supply chains and energy prices will take months to ease,"" Mr Sunak said. ""It would be irresponsible for anyone to pretend that we can solve this overnight."" The UK's exit from the European Union (EU) has exacerbated supply chain problems such at hold-ups at ports or with deliveries, the OBR saidin its latest report,external. The OBR also said the fact that the energy price cap has risen was a big factor behind the rising cost of living. The cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The independent forecaster suggested that had its figures been more up-to-date, its inflation forecasts would have painted a more bleak picture for consumers and businesses. It previously said,externalit had ended any updates to its forecast on 24 September, earlier than usual, and ""in response to a request from the chancellor"". Richard Hughes, chairman of the OBR, told BBC News that if inflation started feeding into wages, rather than just products in the shops, the problem could persist for longer. But the OBR lifted its prediction for economic growth in 2021 to 6.5%, up from its previous forecast of 4%. It has also reduced its estimate of the long-term ""scarring"" effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%. The effectiveness of Covid vaccines and the adaptability of consumers and businesses had sped up the recovery, the OBR said. But it forecast that economic growth would be lower next year than it previously thought, partly down to a better performance in 2021. In 2022, gross domestic product (GDP), which measures all the activity of companies, governments and people in an economy, will increase by 6%, the OBR said, rather than the 7.3% it predicted in March. Growth is forecast to be 2.1% in 2023, 1.3% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025. While the economy is in a stronger state than had been expected, whether in terms of growth, employment or the public finances - the official analysis makes clear the obstacle inflation poses to standards of living in the coming months. The OBR reckons inflation will hit 4.4.%; it warns it may go as high as 5%. And, it makes clear that leaving the EU has heightened the UK's experience of the bottlenecks that are bumping up business costs, that in turn will lead to higher prices. That higher cost of living, together with looming tax rises will dampen the effect of wage rises over the next couple of years. Strip out inflation and the OBR reckons that household income after tax will only recover to pre-pandemic levels in mid-2023. And those lost years of prosperity increases could weigh on growth - and sentiment in the run up to the next election. Higher inflation is also likely to put pressure on how much the chancellor is able to spend in the future. But Mr Sunak has been offered some room for manoeuvre, as the improving economic picture and higher tax incomes means the government will not have to borrow as much. Borrowing hit a record Â£319.9bn during the 2020 financial year as the government poured money into pandemic support schemes such as furlough. It is now forecast to fall every year between 2021 and 2026. Jane Mackay, head of tax at audit, tax, advisory and risk firm Crowe, said there was still a ""huge"" Covid bill to deal with, though. ""The Budget statement hasn't really given us clarity on who will pay that bill. ""The tax increases that were announced before the Budget, including corporation tax rising to 25%, and the NHS and social care levy additional NICs of 1.25%, might suggest the strategy will spread the burden as widely as possible, rather than to make the structural changes to our tax system that may be what is really needed."" Follow live coverage of the Budget A simple guide to Budget 2021 Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Why is the cost of living going up? A risk of rising inflation as well is that it will increase the amount of interest the government needs to pay back on what it has borrowed for pandemic spending. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned in September that it ""will have to act"" over rising inflation. The Bank has already said UK inflation is set to exceed 4%, before falling back as the economy recovers from Covid. The UK's central bank can raise interest rates in an attempt to tackle inflation if prices are rising quickly. In theory, when borrowing costs rise - which would make loans such as mortgages more expensive - people spend less and prices are driven down. Mr Sunak said on Wednesday that he had written to the Bank to ""reaffirm their remit to achieve low and stable inflation"". Investors are expecting interest rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022, in an effort to bring inflation back down to the Bank's 2% target. However, he gave no suggestion of when the Bank might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%. The governor said that rising energy bills could push inflation higher for longer than previously thought.

"This video can not be played Lindsay Hoyle says it is ânot acceptable"" for ministers to give briefings to the media before Parliament. The Treasury has released a deluge of funding announcements, days before the chancellor delivers his Budget on 27 October. Statements from the government setting out spending for transport, health and education have been put out in the past few days. Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is furious, telling MPs on Monday it was ""not acceptable"" to brief the media ahead of MPs and on Tuesday that the government was behaving in a ""discourteous manner"". He thundered that ministers used to ""walk"" if they briefed about a Budget. Indeed, in 1947, then-Chancellor Hugh Dalton resigned after he leaked details of his budget to a journalist. Defending pre-Budget announcements, Treasury Minister Simon Clarke said the government had not commented on the ""substantive tax measures"" that would appear in the Budget. So what do we know? Firstly, this isn't the complete story. Rishi Sunak's Budget won't all be about displays of generosity. The Treasury has asked departments to identify ""at least 5% of savings and efficiencies from their day-to-day budgets"" and we may hear more about those plans on Wednesday. The government has already committed to spending for health, schools, defence and overseas aid so other areas such as local government, justice and further education may face a squeeze on their budgets. And there may be more to some of the seemingly lavish spending pledges than meets the eye. A simple guide to Budget 2021 Analysis by political correspondent Damian Grammaticas Beware what you are reading! They sound good, all these announcements in the run up to Budget and Spending Review. But they need to be taken with caution. This is the PR blitz seeking good headlines. We don't yet know the detail of exactly what the government is planning. The raft of investments will make a difference. But there are questions. Are the transport links, treatment centres and other projects entirely new or have some parts been announced (with equal fanfare) before now? Crucially what is happening more broadly to the budgets of the departments getting cash? A shiny investment in something is great, but is that department's day-to-day spending being squeezed? And what of those areas that aren't getting the handouts? Best to wait until Wednesday to truly judge the chancellor's largesse. The government has announced that England's city regions will receive Â£6.9bn to spend on train, tram, bus and cycle projects. This includes Â£1.07bn for Greater Manchester, Â£1.05bn for the West Midlands and Â£830m for West Yorkshire. However, the figure of Â£6.9bn only includes Â£1.5bn of additional spending because the government is including the Â£4.2bn promisedin 2019alongside funding for buses announced by the prime minister last year. The chancellor has refused to be drawn on the future of the eastern leg of High Speed Two, which could be delayed or cancelled to save an estimated Â£40bn.  If built, the extension would cut journey times between London and the North East by 31 minutes. It would also shave 52 minutes off trips between London and Leeds. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding through the Barnett formula - a mechanism the UK government uses to allocate additional money to the devolved nations when it spends more in England. City regions to get Â£6.9bn for public transport Government urged to make a decision on HS2 route NHS England will get Â£5.9bn to tackle the backlog of people waiting for tests and scans. That covers Â£2.3bn for diagnostic tests including clinics in shopping centres for scans; Â£1.5bn on beds equipment and new ""surgical hubs""; and Â£2.1bn to improve IT. Health bodies welcomed the money but warned it would not solve the problem of staff shortages. According to data published by NHS digital, in June there were 93,806 full-time vacancies across the NHS in England. NHS in England to get Â£5.9bn to cut waiting lists Mr Sunak is set to announce a rise in the National Living Wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50, to come into effect from 1 April next year. This is a 6.6% increase in the minimum wage for all those aged 23 and over - more than twice the current 3.1% rise in the cost of living. Assuming a 40 hour week, the new minimum wage amounts to a salary of Â£1,646 per month or Â£19,760 a year. The increases to the wage rates follow recommendations made by the Low Pay Commission, an independent advisory board. The Treasury has also announced it will be lifting a pay freeze imposed on millions of public sector workers last year as a result of the pandemic. Independent pay review bodies will recommend how much extra money workers will get early next year. National Living Wage set to rise to Â£9.50 an hour Public sector workers set for pay rise - Sunak The government's major tax change has already been announced, as earlier this year the prime minister told MPs he would introduce a tax in England designed to tackle the NHS backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and later to pay for social care. However, we know a few other changes (or rather lack of changes) that will be announced on Wednesday. Campaigners for a freeze in fuel duty have been told to expect the levy to be frozen for a twelfth year in a row. And separately, the BBC has been told VAT on household energy would not be cut. No VAT cut to household energy bills in Budget The health department will get Â£5bn over the next three years for research and development. This includes Â£95m which will go towards researching methods for treating cancer, obesity and mental health. The money will also be spent on developing genome technology which could detect more than 200 conditions in newborn babies. Â£2.6bn will be spent on creating 30,000 new school places for children with special educational needs and disabilities. The money will also go towards improving school buildings' accessibility and funding new, special provision in free schools England. The Budget will also include Â£1.6bn over three years to roll out new T-levels for 16 to 19-year-olds plus Â£550m for adult skills in England. Currently there are over 6,000 on T-level courses, but the government hopes to ramp up those numbers. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, warned that the extra money was a ""gamble"" as it was unclear how many would want to take the qualification. The government will also spend a further Â£830m modernising colleges in England. Chancellor to pledge funds for skills training What will teenagers study for the new T-levels? The Treasury is allocating Â£1.8bn for building around 160,000 new homes on derelict or unused land - also known as brownfield sites - in England. An extra Â£9m will also go towards allowing councils to turn neglected urban spaces into ""pocket parks"" roughly the size of a tennis court. The chancellor is also expected to confirm Â£65m for digitising England's planning system. Budget: Â£2bn for new homes on derelict land Grants worth Â£1.4bn will be given to ""internationally mobile"" companies to invest in UK infrastructure. This includes Â£345m aimed at increasing resilience for future pandemics and Â£800m for the production of electric vehicles in north-east England and the Midlands. As part of the package, a talent network team will aim to attract high-skilled workers to the UK, through ""innovation hotspots"" initially based in San Francisco and Boston in the US and Bengaluru in India. The government has announced Â£500m to support parents and children in England. This includes Â£200m to support families with complex issues; Â£82m to fund centres in 75 different areas to provide advice for parents; Â£100m for mental health support for expectant parents; and Â£50m for breastfeeding support. Labour has argued that the government previously closed over 1,000 children's centres - known as Sure Start centres - and that this new announcement ""rings hollow"". Mr Sunak defended past cuts, arguing that the new funding would ""create a network of family hubs which are broader than the Sure Start centres"". Ministers pledge Â£500m to support young families Â£850m to restore museums and art galleries including the V&A in London and Tate Liverpool; Â£125m for a scientific research centre in Oxfordshire and Â£75m for regional museums Â£700m to protect UK borders including Â£74m for a new fleet of patrol boats Â£700m for football pitches, tennis courts and youth facilities Â£435m to prevent crime, protect communities and help victims in England and Wales Â£150m for the British Business Bank to encourage development of Dragons' Den-style regional investors outside of London and south east Â£5m for research grants to develop new surgery and treatment options for amputees and blast victims A tax change to encourage shipping companies to the UK Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

"The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the government's forecaster has warned. Its latest forecast says inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% in 2022. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) says figures released since its report was compiled suggest inflation could hit almost 5%. The chancellor acknowledged that household budgets are strained. Rishi Sunak described the overall economic picture as ""strong"" in the short term, with the OBR now expecting the economy to return to its pre-pandemic level six months earlier than it had forecast previously. However, he acknowledged the inflation rate was ""likely to rise further"" from its 3.1% rate in September. He said it was due to increased demand for energy and supply chain issues as economies and factories reopening following coronavirus lockdowns. ""The pressures caused by supply chains and energy prices will take months to ease,"" Mr Sunak said. ""It would be irresponsible for anyone to pretend that we can solve this overnight."" The UK's exit from the European Union (EU) has exacerbated supply chain problems such at hold-ups at ports or with deliveries, the OBR saidin its latest report,external. The OBR also said the fact that the energy price cap has risen was a big factor behind the rising cost of living. The cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge domestic customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The independent forecaster suggested that had its figures been more up-to-date, its inflation forecasts would have painted a more bleak picture for consumers and businesses. It previously said,externalit had ended any updates to its forecast on 24 September, earlier than usual, and ""in response to a request from the chancellor"". Richard Hughes, chairman of the OBR, told BBC News that if inflation started feeding into wages, rather than just products in the shops, the problem could persist for longer. But the OBR lifted its prediction for economic growth in 2021 to 6.5%, up from its previous forecast of 4%. It has also reduced its estimate of the long-term ""scarring"" effect of Covid-19 on the economy from 3% to 2%. The effectiveness of Covid vaccines and the adaptability of consumers and businesses had sped up the recovery, the OBR said. But it forecast that economic growth would be lower next year than it previously thought, partly down to a better performance in 2021. In 2022, gross domestic product (GDP), which measures all the activity of companies, governments and people in an economy, will increase by 6%, the OBR said, rather than the 7.3% it predicted in March. Growth is forecast to be 2.1% in 2023, 1.3% in 2024 and 1.6% in 2025. While the economy is in a stronger state than had been expected, whether in terms of growth, employment or the public finances - the official analysis makes clear the obstacle inflation poses to standards of living in the coming months. The OBR reckons inflation will hit 4.4.%; it warns it may go as high as 5%. And, it makes clear that leaving the EU has heightened the UK's experience of the bottlenecks that are bumping up business costs, that in turn will lead to higher prices. That higher cost of living, together with looming tax rises will dampen the effect of wage rises over the next couple of years. Strip out inflation and the OBR reckons that household income after tax will only recover to pre-pandemic levels in mid-2023. And those lost years of prosperity increases could weigh on growth - and sentiment in the run up to the next election. Higher inflation is also likely to put pressure on how much the chancellor is able to spend in the future. But Mr Sunak has been offered some room for manoeuvre, as the improving economic picture and higher tax incomes means the government will not have to borrow as much. Borrowing hit a record Â£319.9bn during the 2020 financial year as the government poured money into pandemic support schemes such as furlough. It is now forecast to fall every year between 2021 and 2026. Jane Mackay, head of tax at audit, tax, advisory and risk firm Crowe, said there was still a ""huge"" Covid bill to deal with, though. ""The Budget statement hasn't really given us clarity on who will pay that bill. ""The tax increases that were announced before the Budget, including corporation tax rising to 25%, and the NHS and social care levy additional NICs of 1.25%, might suggest the strategy will spread the burden as widely as possible, rather than to make the structural changes to our tax system that may be what is really needed."" Follow live coverage of the Budget A simple guide to Budget 2021 Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Why is the cost of living going up? A risk of rising inflation as well is that it will increase the amount of interest the government needs to pay back on what it has borrowed for pandemic spending. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned in September that it ""will have to act"" over rising inflation. The Bank has already said UK inflation is set to exceed 4%, before falling back as the economy recovers from Covid. The UK's central bank can raise interest rates in an attempt to tackle inflation if prices are rising quickly. In theory, when borrowing costs rise - which would make loans such as mortgages more expensive - people spend less and prices are driven down. Mr Sunak said on Wednesday that he had written to the Bank to ""reaffirm their remit to achieve low and stable inflation"". Investors are expecting interest rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022, in an effort to bring inflation back down to the Bank's 2% target. However, he gave no suggestion of when the Bank might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%. The governor said that rising energy bills could push inflation higher for longer than previously thought.

"Rishi Sunak has had a year-and-a-half as a high spending chancellor during a once-in-a-century crisis. Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil the government's tax and spending plans on Wednesday. Here are five things to look out for. The forecasts will reflect an economy that has rebounded faster than the 4% predicted for this year at the last Budget in March. That means significantly lower borrowing. The forecast peak for unemployment will again be further lowered, reflecting the success of the furlough scheme. However, much of this is already old news, and some of those who predicted a ""boom"" are now scaling back their estimates. What matters now is the immediate implications for the economy of supply chain problems, worker shortages, rising prices and interest rates. The chancellor's speech, along with accompanying forecasts from the Office for Budget Responsibility, should have some pointers. An immediate test of the Downing Street rhetoric on wage rises will take place with the announcements on public sector pay, largely frozen last year, and the National Living Wage (NLW). The NLW is earmarked for a 5% rise to Â£9.42 an hour from April, as part of a pathway to Â£10 an hour by 2024, which could be brought forward by a year. But could that, in fact, widen what has been significant wage rises in shortage sectors, such as haulage, to a more general and therefore inflationary economy-wide phenomenon? A simple guide to Budget 2021 Why is the cost of living going up? Rishi Sunak has had a year-and-a-half as a high spending emergency chancellor, racking up debts for a once-in-a-century crisis, expanding the state, and taking taxes to post war highs. This will be his chance to re-establish his fiscally conservative free market credentials. His method for doing so will be a set of new fiscal rules to bring both annual borrowing under control and the debt down. These rules have been routinely broken by previous chancellors. But how strictly he decides to set these restraints on his power to borrow, will determine room for manoeuvre for extra spending and possible tax cuts. Just how ambitious the government is on net zero will be seen in black and white in the numbers. The chancellor will tout this as the first full multi-year post austerity spending review. Spending will rise more than one of the Gordon Brown Spending Reviews. But two-thirds of the funding decisions - for health, schools, defence and aid, are already baked in the cake. What remains, are important areas of spending, such as courts, prisons, and, crucially, local Government, which are on course for another two-year spending squeeze, before spending goes up. Even more importantly, little cash has been so far allocated for permanent post pandemic legacy spending in health, care, and schools. If that happens, the immediate squeeze elsewhere will be even tighter. This will have consequences for services, and potentially council tax bills. Local council spending cuts will be difficult to reconcile with promises made to regions outside the big cities. But this spending review really is show time for Downing Street to reveal the substance behind their promise to ""level up"" Britain. The phrase originated in promises to equalise per-pupil spending across England. Transport spending is hugely skewed in the UK - with regions such as the North East of England missing out. Will this Spending Review fundamentally change that pattern, even if it would never seek to equalise such spending with, say, London? The answer to that question will start to be seen in the capital funding allocations in the review. Likewise, net zero: Tens of billions of investment will be required to rewire the economy away from burning carbon. Most of that will come from the private sector, but a huge amount will need to come from the public sector too. Again just how ambitious and serious the government is here will be seen in black and white in the numbers allocated in the review. A simple guide to Budget 2021 Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Ruby Torry wants the minimum wage to rise or national insurance to go down Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver his Budget and Spending Review to the House of Commons next week, setting out the government's spending and financial strategy. Changes to the national minimum wage could be announced, as those earners have been badly hit by the economic downturn. New climate measures and changes to company taxes are also expected. We asked six people across the UK what they want to see from this Budget. Ruby Torry, a 23-year-old waitress at Zizzi's restaurant in the Meadowhall shopping centre in Sheffield, lives in Rotherham with her mother and earns the minimum wage. ""I'm careful with my bills and don't go silly with shopping, but I want to see the minimum wage go up or national insurance tax come down,"" she told the BBC. Five things that could affect you in the Budget Why is the cost of living going up? Zizzi's had put Ms Torry on furlough, but she said she couldn't cover her bills, so she worked for Asos in the firm's Barnsley warehouse during the pandemic. She says she would also like to see more incentives for apprenticeships. ""I wanted to do an engineering apprenticeship, but wouldn't have been able to live on Â£800 a month wages - I couldn't even pay for my car on that,"" she explains. ""Minimum wage needs to go up, I don't know how the government thinks we can do anything on that little."" Michelle and her daughter Charlize Michelle Wilson is a single mother from Glenrothes in Scotland and has already felt challenges after the Â£20 weekly uplift in Universal Credit was ended on 6 October. ""It's a real worry because the uplift was almost Â£100 a month, which is my main shop gone now, so it's another big stress,"" she told the BBC. She added that she would like to see increases in Universal Credit and the minimum wage to reflect the rise in household costs from inflation. ""My kids have been eating healthier with that uplift and it's been a big drop when I'm worried about my gas and fuel bills,"" she says. Ms Wilson used to work as a support officer for Fife council, but one of the reasons she left the job was because she struggled with the cost of childcare as a lone parent. She said it would be ""helpful"" for the Budget to encourage more flexible hours for working and finding childcare, as she is limited to 09:00 to 15:00. Ms Wilson would support government measures to help with the sharp rise in energy bills, which she said she is ""struggling to keep up"" with, as rising costs are making life ""harder and harder"" for her. Nick Grey founded Gtech, which makes floor cleaning and garden products and has a turnover of Â£70m. The firm employs 200 people across the UK and sells more than 22 million products in 19 countries. Mr Grey says the Budget should not make it more difficult for firms to employ overseas workers, which he thinks would be a ""backwards step"" amid the labour shortages. Another of his requests is that a rise in corporation tax should be avoided, as he says it ""risks businesses setting up headquarters elsewhere and less bureaucracy would be better for attracting investment in the UK"". Raising tax on high earners also ""risks lowering the overall tax income for the country"", he adds. Jon Tolley runs independent record shop Banquet Records in Kingston, Surrey. He believes the fairest way to pay for the pandemic is through increased tax for people and businesses that earn the most, rather than a rise in everyone's National Insurance tax. ""I want customers and my employees to have disposable income and cash in their pockets, so they can spend it on the High Streets,"" he adds. Mr Tolley explains the business has had an ""OK"" year and received acash grant of Â£25,000,externaltwice from the government for having had to close the shop - action that he says was ""welcome and effective"". But he adds that he would like to ""see something changed about business rates"". ""We're in competition with online stores who don't have to pay the same rates and High Street rents, so that playing field needs to be levelled."" The business pays the standard 20% VAT on products and Mr Tolley doesn't want to see this increase. ""We haven't had 'just-in-time' stock control at all, because of delivery delays, but we're fortunate to have storage capacity and have ordered well ahead for Christmas."" Hollie Whittles, digital strategy specialist and HR director at Purple Frog Systems, says she wants to see a review of the business rates system. She says small businesses often ""lack the time to understand"" tax and rates. Ms Whittles says it is ""crucial"" to make sure taxes designed for large organisations are not avoided or passed ""further down the chain to their small business customers"". On climate measures, she commends grant schemes such as the Low Carbon Opportunities Programme (LOCOP) and the Business Energy Efficiency Programme (BEEP), which encourage businesses to adopt greener technologies. ""It is vital that the government supports small businesses' journey to net zero, especially with small businesses making up more than 99% of all private sector enterprises,"" she adds. Hollie Whittles On changes to apprenticeship schemes and student loans, Ms Whittles, who works with 14 staff, says she would welcome more support for small businesses wanting to train and upskill staff in new technologies that help benefit long-term careers and the local economy. Ms Whittles says there have been ""considerable challenges"" in accessing the government's Kickstart scheme, which creates new jobs for 16 to 24-year-olds on Universal Credit. The government should also support schemes and skills investment for older people wanting to change careers, in her view. Lynne Turner Lynne Turner is 71 years old and would like to see her basic government pension of Â£137.60 per week increased. ""It's absolutely not enough. I'm frugal, but couldn't survive with a decent lifestyle if I only had my pension,"" Ms Turner explains. Ms Turner says she could not afford to pay into a private pension in the past because of childcare costs. Without an inherited cottage in Wales, the rent from which supplements her pension, she ""wouldn't be able to manage"", she says. She adds that she would support a beer levy, which ""wouldn't bother her at all"", but says that because so many small businesses have struggled during the pandemic, she would be against making them pay more taxes.

"Moldova's Foreign Minister, Nicu Popescu, is trying to look on the bright side His country is immersed in a gas crisis. But Nicu Popescu is trying to remain positive. ""On Monday our country made history,"" Moldova's foreign minister tells me. ""For the first time Moldova bought gas from a source that was not Russia's Gazprom."" The gas shipment from Poland's PGNiG was one million cubic metres. Moldova will need much larger volumes if Gazprom does what it has threatened to do: turn off the gas taps. Up until now, 100% of Moldova's gas has come from Russia. But the contract to supply it expired at the end of September. Gazprom raised the price and Moldova balked at paying it. In the absence of a new deal, the Russian energy giant reduced supplies, prompting Moldova to declare a 30-day state of emergency. Gazprom accused Moldova of ""provoking a crisis"" and demanded repayment of a $709m (Â£514m) debt, which Moldova disputes. Negotiations continue. Moldovan officials say they would like to sign a new contract with Gazprom, but only if the terms are favourable. If there is no deal with Russia, could Moldova, one of Europe's poorest countries, buy enough gas elsewhere? Moldova's gas contract with Gazprom expired at the end of last month ""It's the worst time to have a gas crisis at home,"" Mr Popescu admits. ""The prices are higher than ever. We see this market crunch on a global scale. But we've had support. In recent years Romania built a new gas pipeline into Moldova which gives us a safety valve. We've also had some advice from the European Union on how to diversify a country's gas supply within a few days."" Like many enterprises in Moldova, the sugar factory in Drochia has been affected by the gas shortage. ""We're able to use just a quarter of the gas we need,"" manager Rostislav Magdei explains. ""We're topping that up with alternative sources of energy. We hope our government will compensate any losses arising from the high price of fuel."" This sugar factory is among many businesses hit by the gas shortage Once in Moscow's orbit, Moldova has been tilting from Russia towards the West more recently. The country's leadership is now pro-European and supports closer ties with the EU. Many here suspect that the gas crisis is the Kremlin's way of expressing its disapproval. ""This year we had parliamentary elections and the pro-Russia party lost,"" says Sergiu Tofilat, former energy adviser to the president of Moldova. ""We have a pro-Western party in power here. So, Russia changed its approach on the gas supply. The Kremlin wants to punish the Moldovan people for voting against a pro-Russia party. It's pure politics."" ""Vladimir Putin is trying to keep former Soviet countries within the area of influence of the Kremlin. We do not want to stay on our knees in front of Moscow. We must say no to Russian blackmail and we have the opportunity now to get rid of Russian influence in Moldova."" Sergiu Tofilat, former presidential adviser, says the Kremlin is trying to punish his country The Kremlin denies using energy as a weapon. President Putin recently dismissed the suggestion as ""utter nonsense, drivel and politically-motivated tittle-tattle."" EUROPEAN CRISIS:Is Russia squeezing Europe's gas supply? WHAT NEXT?Gas crisis leaves Europe searching for solutions For Moldova, though, reducing Russia's influence won't be easy. In energy terms, Moldova is closely tied to Moscow. Not only has the country been 100% dependent on Russian gas. But its own gas company, Moldovagaz, is majority-owned by Gazprom. And more than 80% of Moldova's electricity comes from a Russian-owned power plant in Trans-Dniester - a separatist region of Moldova, backed economically, politically and militarily by Moscow. If you think of gas negotiations as a game of poker, then Russia has a very strong hand. But Trans-Dniester could prove to be a weak point for Moscow. ""Gazprom needs a gas contract with Moldova so that it can supply the breakaway region, too, with gas,"" says Sergiu Tofilat. ""Gazprom is a public company, with shares listed on the stock exchange. It cannot allow itself to sign a contract with the Trans-Dniester supplier that is not officially recognised."" In the town of Balti, Moldovan motorists are feeling the effects of less gas. I see long lines at the propane station. Queuing up here are dozens of cars and disgruntled drivers. Drivers in Balti are fed up with having to queue for fuel ""We're in this situation, because we're looking towards Europe"", a taxi driver called Valera tells me. ""If we were with Russia everything would be different."" ""The problem is,"" says another driver Yura, ""that our leaders now want to be friends with Europe and America. For cheap gas they should go to Moscow, get an agreement. We need to bow down to Russia"". For a government that has set a pro-European course there is a danger: that a prolonged gas shortage and higher energy bills could make Moldovans question the direction in which their country is moving.

"The price of a pint of beer will have to rise by as much as 30p to help pay for higher wages and energy costs, one pub company has warned. As the government prepares to unveil its Budget, City Pub Group said price rises were ""the only way forward"". On Monday, the government saidthe National Living Wage would riseto Â£9.50 per hour in April for those over 23 years old. Clive Watson, the chain's boss, said this would cost it about Â£1m a year. Other pub owners echoed Mr Watson's warning, with industry bodies calling for help for the sector. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said that while increases to the minimum wage and the minimum living rate would be ""welcomed"" by many staff in pubs, it was a further cost increase for pubs who were ""still struggling to recover and face an uncertain future"". ""It makes beer duty, business rates and VAT cuts in the Budget on Wednesday all the more important for the viability of our sector,"" she added. Wetherspoons, however, has announced it will cut drink prices next month on a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Becks bottles and whisky measures will be sold for 99p at some branches. Wetherspoons said prices will be reduced at all of its almost 900 pubs but the discounts will vary. In October, JD Wetherspoon reported a record annual loss after Covid lockdowns saw its pubs shut for 19 weeks. The firm was also recently affected by a shortage of some beer brands, caused by driver shortages due to a combination of Covid and Brexit. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's latest Budget, to be delivered later, comes as the pub trade is still recovering from lockdown measures imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. City Pub Group weathered the financial storm thanks to government assistance, putting 99% of its staff on furlough during the pandemic. ""That's basically kept the industry on life support, but we're coming off life support now and we need to be able to have a road to recovery,"" Mr Watson told the BBC. Last month, the group, which owns 45 pubs, reported that sales had been above 90% of pre-pandemic levels since Covid restrictions were eased in May. But now it faces further challenges - not just minimum wage rises, but also higher energy and food costs, as well as employers' national insurance contributions going up next April. The price of beer ""would probably have to go up by 25 to 30p a pint"" to take account of all that, Mr Watson said. ""We want to do our bit - it's very important, but at the same time we don't want everything going up the whole time, because all that will do is stoke inflation,"" he added. UK inflation isexpected to rise above 4%by the end of this year. Minimum wage for 23 year-olds to rise to Â£9.50 Premier Inn owner warns of staff shortages No VAT cut to household energy bills in Budget Inflation likely to hit 5%, warns Bank economist While Mr Watson said increases to the minimum wage were a ""good idea"", he warned that those increases could be ""gobbled up by other inflationary pressures"". He said a more effective measure would be for the government to cut VAT as a way of reducing the cost of living. The hospitality industry currently benefits froma reduced VAT rate of 12.5%,external, but that is due to revert to 20% in April. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the trade group UK Hospitality, said the VAT tax rise would be ""unsustainable"" and mean that businesses would have ""no option"" but to pass the cost on to customers. ""We are facing into considerable headwinds with a bubble of inflationary pressures coming through the supply chain, as well as wage rate inflation,"" she added. Martin Greenhow said wage increases would cost his business thousands Costs 'inevitably' passed on. Martin Greenhow, managing director at Mojo, a chain of six pubs in the north of England, said supply chain costs were ""certainly putting pressure"" on the business. ""If costs go up, prices go up, it's fairly inevitable,"" he said. All of the 89 staff the firm employs are currently on or above the National Living Wage. ""The coming increase will of course affect everyone, as those above it will also expect to see a pro-rata increment which will cost the business thousands,"" he explained. Mr Greenhow said that these staffing and supply costs would ""inevitably be passed on to the consumer"". ""Furlough and grants helped us survive, but essentially our survival was achieved by huge borrowings, which represent another cost to the business and therefore another inflationary driver."" The Cock in Ringmer is one of Ian Ridley's pubs Ian Ridley runs three pubs and the majority of his 50 staff earn the National Living Wage. ""Something's got to give, we cannot absorb these cost pressures,"" he explained. Although he has not worked through the cost projections for next year yet, Mr Ridley estimates the price of a pint could rise by 20p. ""When we're trying to encourage customers to come back and we're compete with supermarkets on booze, higher prices are not going to help us,"" he told the BBC. The wage increases will mean an estimated Â£20,000 of extra costs, in addition to higher food, transport and brewery bills. Rising energy costs are causing concern and Mr Ridley said the VAT hike in April and business tax rates were another ""huge worry"".

"Assange pictured leaving court in January 2020 Lawyers for the US have told the High Court the judge who blocked Julian Assange's extradition was misled by his psychiatrist. The United States government is starting a legal appeal to try to get the Wikileaks founder extradited. In January, a court ruled Mr Assange could not be extradited to the US due to concerns over his mental health. Mr Assange is wanted over the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011. The documents revealed how the US military had killed hundreds of civilians in unreported incidents during the war in Afghanistan, while leaked Iraq war files showed the 66,000 civilians had been killed and prisoners tortured by Iraqi forces. The US says the leaks broke the law and endangered lives, but Mr Assange says the case is politically motivated. His lawyer told the court that the risk of suicide would be ""imminent the moment extradition becomes likely"". This video can not be played Watch: From 'teenage hacker' to fighting US extradition - the Julian Assange story UK judge blocks extradition of Wikileaks founder to US The Julian Assange story Wikileaks' document dumps that shook world In January, the district judge overseeing the US's extradition appeal, Vanessa Baraitser, said Mr Assange's publication of classified military and government documents arguably amounted to a crime. But he could not be transferred to the US because he was unwell and could take his own life. On Wednesday, James Lewis QC, representing the US, told the Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justice Holroyde that conclusion was wrong. He said Mr Assange's psychiatrist had misled the earlier judge and the US had not been given an opportunity to answer her concerns. Mr Assange, 50, is wanted in the US on allegations of a conspiracy to obtain and disclose national defence information following Wikileaks' publication of hundreds of thousands of leaked documents relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. The publications include the release in April 2010 of footage showing US soldiers shooting and killing civilians from a helicopter in Iraq. Julian Assange's father made his way past a crowd of his son's supporters on his way into court Mr Assange has been in Belmarsh Prison since 2019, when he was carried out of the Ecuadorian embassy in London by police and arrested for breaching his bail conditions. He had been in the embassy since 2012, avoiding extradition to Sweden, where he faced sex offence allegations. He has always denied those and they were eventually dropped. On Wednesday morning, Mr Assange's legal team initially told judges he would not attend because he was not well. He later attended via a video link from prison. US lawyers said it had now given four binding assurances as to how Mr Assange would be treated: It would not impose a highly restrictive form of solitary confinement on Mr Assange before or after trial - although it could do so if he committed a further offence Mr Assange could apply to serve a sentence in Australia and the US would agree to that transfer Prison authorities would ensure Mr Assange would receive ""any clinical and psychological treatment"" that prison doctors recommended Mr Assange would also not be sent to ADX Florence, a US ""supermax"" prison, reserved for the worst offenders. Mr Lewis said the assurances were binding on the United States. He said the previous judge's approach ""carries with it the risk of rewarding fugitives for their flight, and of creating an anomaly between the approach of the courts in domestic criminal proceedings, and in extradition"". Mr Lewis said that Mr Assange's psychiatrist, Prof Michael Kopelman, had misled the court about Mr Assange's psychiatric state by concealing his relationship with his partner, Stella Moris, and that they had two children together. The lawyer for the US argued this meant the judge could not consider the true risks of Mr Assange taking his own life, because the need to protect children can be a factor that discourages people from suicide. He also said that during cross-examination, Prof Kopelman would not accept that Mr Assange could be safe in the US - even if he received a short sentence and reasonable time with other inmates. Mr Assange appeared by video link from Belmarsh Prison, where he has been held since 2019 Mr Lewis called psychiatrist Prof Seena Fazel from the University of Oxford, who said he did not share the defence's view that Mr Assange would certainly take his own life in the US. Mr Assange's lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald QC, said the risk of suicide is ""not something in the future - it is something imminent the moment that extradition becomes likely"". He said Parliament had given district judges the power to protect ""mentally disordered"" people from extradition to countries where the UK has no control over their treatment. He said that in January, the judge took the evidence fully into account and relied on the fact Mr Assange would be isolated and deprived of the protections he had in Belmarsh. The US assurances were ""caveated, vague or simply ineffective"", he said, calling the suggestion that he could be detained in Australia ""meaningless"", as the country has not said it would accept him. Supporters, family members and friends of Mr Assange outside court expressed their ""outrage"" after he did not attend his hearing in person. They said they were concerned he was thin, he was not there to instruct his lawyers or clarify what was going on in court. The High Court hearing is expected to end on Thursday with a decision at a later date. US bid to extradite Assange given legal boost The background to Julian Assange's extradition case.

"This video can not be played Rugby League brain damage: Michael Edwards says he feels 'thrown away like an unwanted, broken toy' Ten former rugby league players, including ex-Great Britain scrum-half Bobbie Goulding, are claiming the sport has left them with brain damage. Lawyers say the players are all suffering from ""neurological complications"". And they are now planning a legal claim against the Rugby Football League for negligence. It follows similar action by rugby union playersincluding England's World Cup winner Steve Thompson. Goulding, who has recently been diagnosed with early-onset dementia, said there was not enough protection for players who had suffered head injuries. The 49-year-old, who won the Super League and Challenge Cup double in 1996 as St Helens captain, said he had played again within days of being knocked unconscious at least three times in his career. Former Wales international Michael Edwards, 48, and Scotland internationals Jason Roach, 50, and Ryan MacDonald, 43, are also part of a test group of 10 players, all under the age of 60, bringing the legal action. All three have also been diagnosed with early-onset dementia. Their lawyer, Richard Boardman, said he was representing a total of 50 former professional rugby league players in their 20s to 50s, all of whom are showing symptoms associated with neurological complications. He is also representing 175 former rugby union players, including Thompson, in a separate lawsuit. Boardman said the legal claim was not just about financial compensation, but making the game safer and getting tested and diagnosed to undertake urgent clinical support. He said there were potentially hundreds of former rugby league players who, as they reached their 40s and 50s, were developing various neurological issues, such as early-onset dementia, CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy), epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and motor neurone disease. ""The vast majority of the former players we represent love the game and don't want to see it harmed in any way,"" Boardman said. ""They just want to make it safer so current and future generations don't end up like them. We're asking the RFL to make a number of immediate, relatively low-cost changes to save the sport, such as limiting contact in training and extending the return to play following a concussion."" Given the significant risk of serious or permanent brain damage caused by concussions, the former players allege the RFL owed them - as individual professional players - a duty to take reasonable care for their safety. Boardman added the group also felt the RFL should have established and implemented rules on the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of actual or suspected concussive injuries. In a statement the RFL said: ""The Rugby Football League has recently been contacted by solicitors representing a number of former players. ""The RFL takes player safety and welfare extremely seriously and has been saddened to hear about some of the former players' difficulties. ""Rugby league is a contact sport and, while there is an element of risk to playing any sport, player welfare is always of paramount importance. ""As a result of scientific knowledge, the sport of rugby league continues to improve and develop its approach to concussion, head injury assessment, education, management and prevention across the whole game. We will continue to use medical evidence and research to reinforce and enhance our approach."" Goulding won the Super League and Challenge Cup double in 1996 as St Helens captain Goulding played for sides including Wigan, Leeds, Widnes and St Helens as well as earning 17 caps for Great Britain. He played for England five times, including the World Cup final in 1995, and the following year was named in the Super League team of the season. Since retiring, first in 2005 and then nine years later after a brief comeback with Barrow Raiders, he has spoken about his battles with alcohol and drug addiction. Talking about his dementia diagnosis, Goulding said: ""For something like this to come out of the blue, and hit me like a bus, is hard to take. ""I didn't think about dementia at all, I just thought it was the way life was. ""I played within days of serious knockouts on at least three occasions. I remember playing on a Sunday for Leigh at Huddersfield towards the end of my career [in 2002]. ""I was in Huddersfield Royal Infirmary on the Sunday night after being seriously knocked out and played the following Saturday against Batley. I didn't have one doctor check on me during that week."" Many of the former rugby league players who form part of the legal case have been diagnosed with early-onset dementia and probable CTE. CTE is the disease discovered by Dr Bennet Omalu in American football player Mike Webster, and the subject of the film Concussion starring Will Smith. In 2011, a group of former American footballers started a class action against the NFL andwon a settlementworth about $1bn (Â£700m). CTE can develop when the brain is subjected to numerous small blows or rapid movements - sometimes known as sub-concussions - and is associated with symptoms such as memory loss, depression and progressive dementia. The disease can only be diagnosed in a brain after death. It has been found in the brains of dozens of former NFL players, as well as a handful of deceased footballers, including former West Bromwich Albion and England strikerJeff Astle.A re-examination of his brain in 2014 found he had died from CTE. The issue of concussion in sport has been debated extensively over the past few years and the links between heading a football and degenerative brain disease have even forced rule changes at youth level. In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, children aged 11 and under are no longer allowed to head a ball in training, while there are also limits to heading frequency at higher age group levels. At senior level, former professionals have called for more research and better player welfare after the death of England World Cup winner Nobby Stiles a year ago, and news that his 1966 team-mate and Manchester United legend Sir Bobby Charlton is also suffering from the disease.

"Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, many countries have pledged to end or restrict their oil and gas imports to curtail Moscow's revenues and hinder its war effort. The Russian economy is highly dependent on its energy sector, and Europe is a major importer of Russian energy, making cutting back difficult. EU nations haveended imports of Russian oil brought in by sea, and a ban on refined oil products will come in from 5 February. The United States said last March it would stop importing Russian oil, and the UK said it was banning Russian crude oil and refined productswith effect from 5 December,external. European countries have sought to reduce their dependence on Russian gas An oil price capapproved by Western allies in Decemberalso aims to prevent Russia getting more than $60 (Â£48) for a barrel of crude oil. Russia's gas sector has also been targeted. The EU said in March it wouldcut gas imports from Russia by two-thirds within a year. The UK, which only imported small quantities of Russian gas, it has now ended this altogether. Urals oil is currently being exported from Russia's north western sea port of Primorsk for around $40 per barrel, from where it has largely gone to European destinations. The value of Russian oil from other ports and pipelines varies, but the Urals price has fallen across the board since the EU banned imports of Russian oil by sea. The price cap on Russian oil was agreed by the world's major economies at the same time. But energy analyst Ben McWilliams believes it is the EU oil embargo impacting the price, rather than the price cap. ""Russian oil is being traded at around $50 (Â£40) per barrel. That has been driven by the embargo because Russia now has to try to sell elsewhere."" Moscow is losing out on about $175m (Â£140m) a day from fossil fuel exports due to these measures, according toa study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).,external India is taking advantage of cheaper oil imported from Russia Major Russian banks have also been removed from the international financial messaging system Swift. Countries continuing to trade with Russia have sought ways around this. Both China and India are increasingly making their oil and gas purchases in their local currencies. India, China and Turkey all ramped up their purchases of Russian oil last year - and together they now make up 70% of all Russian crude flows by sea. And Russia was offering its oil at a significantly lower price than the global benchmark Brent crude. At the start of 2022, Russia supplied less than 2% of India's oil imports, but it is now on course to become its largest single supplier. China's imports of Russian oil have fluctuated, but have also risen over the past year. In 2021,more than half of all Russia's crude oil exports,externalwent to countries in Europe. But in 2022, UK imports of oil from Russia fell sharply and other European countries have cut back too. But some have remained heavily reliant, such as the Slovak Republic and Hungary. European countries have been looking to see if they can source supplies elsewhere. The International Energy Agency (IEA) club of oil importing countries agreed to release 120m barrels of crude from their stocks in 2022. The US also released some of its strategic reserves last year. But calls for oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Venezuela to increase production have not been successful. Opec and other major oil producerscut production in late 2022 to sustain prices. Reducing gas imports from Russia has been a major challenge for many European countries, as the continent has been getting most of its gas through pipelines linked to Russia. In 2021, Russia was supplying EU countries with 40% of their natural gas, with Germany the largest importer, followed by Italy and the Netherlands.

"This video can not be played Lindsay Hoyle says it is ânot acceptable"" for ministers to give briefings to the media before Parliament. The Treasury has released a deluge of funding announcements, days before the chancellor delivers his Budget on 27 October. Statements from the government setting out spending for transport, health and education have been put out in the past few days. Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle is furious, telling MPs on Monday it was ""not acceptable"" to brief the media ahead of MPs and on Tuesday that the government was behaving in a ""discourteous manner"". He thundered that ministers used to ""walk"" if they briefed about a Budget. Indeed, in 1947, then-Chancellor Hugh Dalton resigned after he leaked details of his budget to a journalist. Defending pre-Budget announcements, Treasury Minister Simon Clarke said the government had not commented on the ""substantive tax measures"" that would appear in the Budget. So what do we know? Firstly, this isn't the complete story. Rishi Sunak's Budget won't all be about displays of generosity. The Treasury has asked departments to identify ""at least 5% of savings and efficiencies from their day-to-day budgets"" and we may hear more about those plans on Wednesday. The government has already committed to spending for health, schools, defence and overseas aid so other areas such as local government, justice and further education may face a squeeze on their budgets. And there may be more to some of the seemingly lavish spending pledges than meets the eye. A simple guide to Budget 2021 Analysis by political correspondent Damian Grammaticas Beware what you are reading! They sound good, all these announcements in the run up to Budget and Spending Review. But they need to be taken with caution. This is the PR blitz seeking good headlines. We don't yet know the detail of exactly what the government is planning. The raft of investments will make a difference. But there are questions. Are the transport links, treatment centres and other projects entirely new or have some parts been announced (with equal fanfare) before now? Crucially what is happening more broadly to the budgets of the departments getting cash? A shiny investment in something is great, but is that department's day-to-day spending being squeezed? And what of those areas that aren't getting the handouts? Best to wait until Wednesday to truly judge the chancellor's largesse. The government has announced that England's city regions will receive Â£6.9bn to spend on train, tram, bus and cycle projects. This includes Â£1.07bn for Greater Manchester, Â£1.05bn for the West Midlands and Â£830m for West Yorkshire. However, the figure of Â£6.9bn only includes Â£1.5bn of additional spending because the government is including the Â£4.2bn promisedin 2019alongside funding for buses announced by the prime minister last year. The chancellor has refused to be drawn on the future of the eastern leg of High Speed Two, which could be delayed or cancelled to save an estimated Â£40bn.  If built, the extension would cut journey times between London and the North East by 31 minutes. It would also shave 52 minutes off trips between London and Leeds. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will also receive extra funding through the Barnett formula - a mechanism the UK government uses to allocate additional money to the devolved nations when it spends more in England. City regions to get Â£6.9bn for public transport Government urged to make a decision on HS2 route NHS England will get Â£5.9bn to tackle the backlog of people waiting for tests and scans. That covers Â£2.3bn for diagnostic tests including clinics in shopping centres for scans; Â£1.5bn on beds equipment and new ""surgical hubs""; and Â£2.1bn to improve IT. Health bodies welcomed the money but warned it would not solve the problem of staff shortages. According to data published by NHS digital, in June there were 93,806 full-time vacancies across the NHS in England. NHS in England to get Â£5.9bn to cut waiting lists Mr Sunak is set to announce a rise in the National Living Wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50, to come into effect from 1 April next year. This is a 6.6% increase in the minimum wage for all those aged 23 and over - more than twice the current 3.1% rise in the cost of living. Assuming a 40 hour week, the new minimum wage amounts to a salary of Â£1,646 per month or Â£19,760 a year. The increases to the wage rates follow recommendations made by the Low Pay Commission, an independent advisory board. The Treasury has also announced it will be lifting a pay freeze imposed on millions of public sector workers last year as a result of the pandemic. Independent pay review bodies will recommend how much extra money workers will get early next year. National Living Wage set to rise to Â£9.50 an hour Public sector workers set for pay rise - Sunak The government's major tax change has already been announced, as earlier this year the prime minister told MPs he would introduce a tax in England designed to tackle the NHS backlog caused by the Covid pandemic and later to pay for social care. However, we know a few other changes (or rather lack of changes) that will be announced on Wednesday. Campaigners for a freeze in fuel duty have been told to expect the levy to be frozen for a twelfth year in a row. And separately, the BBC has been told VAT on household energy would not be cut. No VAT cut to household energy bills in Budget The health department will get Â£5bn over the next three years for research and development. This includes Â£95m which will go towards researching methods for treating cancer, obesity and mental health. The money will also be spent on developing genome technology which could detect more than 200 conditions in newborn babies. Â£2.6bn will be spent on creating 30,000 new school places for children with special educational needs and disabilities. The money will also go towards improving school buildings' accessibility and funding new, special provision in free schools England. The Budget will also include Â£1.6bn over three years to roll out new T-levels for 16 to 19-year-olds plus Â£550m for adult skills in England. Currently there are over 6,000 on T-level courses, but the government hopes to ramp up those numbers. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, warned that the extra money was a ""gamble"" as it was unclear how many would want to take the qualification. The government will also spend a further Â£830m modernising colleges in England. Chancellor to pledge funds for skills training What will teenagers study for the new T-levels? The Treasury is allocating Â£1.8bn for building around 160,000 new homes on derelict or unused land - also known as brownfield sites - in England. An extra Â£9m will also go towards allowing councils to turn neglected urban spaces into ""pocket parks"" roughly the size of a tennis court. The chancellor is also expected to confirm Â£65m for digitising England's planning system. Budget: Â£2bn for new homes on derelict land Grants worth Â£1.4bn will be given to ""internationally mobile"" companies to invest in UK infrastructure. This includes Â£345m aimed at increasing resilience for future pandemics and Â£800m for the production of electric vehicles in north-east England and the Midlands. As part of the package, a talent network team will aim to attract high-skilled workers to the UK, through ""innovation hotspots"" initially based in San Francisco and Boston in the US and Bengaluru in India. The government has announced Â£500m to support parents and children in England. This includes Â£200m to support families with complex issues; Â£82m to fund centres in 75 different areas to provide advice for parents; Â£100m for mental health support for expectant parents; and Â£50m for breastfeeding support. Labour has argued that the government previously closed over 1,000 children's centres - known as Sure Start centres - and that this new announcement ""rings hollow"". Mr Sunak defended past cuts, arguing that the new funding would ""create a network of family hubs which are broader than the Sure Start centres"". Ministers pledge Â£500m to support young families Â£850m to restore museums and art galleries including the V&A in London and Tate Liverpool; Â£125m for a scientific research centre in Oxfordshire and Â£75m for regional museums Â£700m to protect UK borders including Â£74m for a new fleet of patrol boats Â£700m for football pitches, tennis courts and youth facilities Â£435m to prevent crime, protect communities and help victims in England and Wales Â£150m for the British Business Bank to encourage development of Dragons' Den-style regional investors outside of London and south east Â£5m for research grants to develop new surgery and treatment options for amputees and blast victims A tax change to encourage shipping companies to the UK Are you affected by issues covered in this story?

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: âTodayâs Budget delivers a stronger economy for British peopleâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told MPs the Budget begins the work to prepare for a new economy post Covid, as he delivers his speech in the Commons. Spending plans for transport, health and education have been unveiled in the press. Mr Sunak is under pressure to help people with the cost of living. Sources say he will adjust the universal credit taper rate, meaning those working will be able to take home more of the money they earn. A Â£20 a week top up to the benefit was cut earlier this month, but details of any changes have yet to be announced. LIVE: Sunak set to unveil Budget Faisal Islam: Will Sunak's plans calm cost of living concerns? A simple guide to Budget 2021 Budget 2021: What has already been announced? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will not be responding to the Budget, as the leader of the opposition is normally expected to do, as he is isolating after testing positive for Covid. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out Labour's response instead. According to Downing Street, Mr Sunak told the cabinet on Wednesday morning that his Budget ""will deliver a stronger economy for the British people"" with the ""levelling-up"" agenda - spreading prosperity around the country - a ""golden thread"" running through it. The chancellor is under pressure to reveal more about the economic outlook, with government debt soaring to record peace time levels in the wake of the pandemic. And he will deliver a three-year spending review alongside his Budget. The Treasury has asked departments to find ""at least 5% of savings and efficiencies from their day-to-day budgets"" - so it is clear not every area will get the same treatment. Policies already unveiled from the chancellor's Budget include: Â£6.9bn for English city regions to spend on train, tram, bus and cycle projects - including the Â£4.2bn promised in 2019 alongside funding for buses announced by the PM in 2020 Â£5.9bn for NHS Englandto tackle the backlog of people waiting for tests and scans A rise in the National Living Wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50, to come into effect from 1 April Â£2.6bn to be spent on creating 30,000 new school places for children with special educational needs and disabilities Â£1.6bn over three years to roll out new T-levels for 16 to 19-year-olds and Â£550m for adult skills in England You can read more on the announcements the government has already made here. One of the pre-announced policies is theend to a pay freeze for public sector workers- such as teachers, nurses and police officers - but ministers have so far refused to say whether it will be a real-terms rise by being higher than inflation. Pay for most frontline workforces is set by independent pay review bodies and No 10 has said it could not ""prejudge that process"". Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle was furious about the number of spending plans that were given to the media before Mr Sunak's big speech - they are traditionally meant to be announced in Parliament so MPs can challenge and scrutinise them. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing echoed the reproof just before the Chancellor got to his feet. A No 10 spokesman said they ""recognised the importance of parliamentary scrutiny"" and they ""always listen very carefully to the Speaker"". This video can not be played Sir Lindsay Hoyle says it is ânot acceptable"" for ministers to give briefings to the media before Parliament. Whisper it. After the economy took an absolute hammering during the pandemic, might the chancellor tomorrow actually be in a much cheerier political mood than he could have predicted? During his Budget warm-up in the last few days, Rishi Sunak has already totted up promises of around an extra Â£20bn of spending, as well as announcing how some of the cash that was already promised is going to be carved up. Hold on for a second though. On the specifics, there is no guarantee that unfreezing the wages of 2.5 million workers in England will mean they get pay rises that aren't eroded by inflation. The same goes for increases for workers on low pay, and cuts to universal credit will pinch too. Having treated us all to cosy snaps of him and his Labrador, Nova, and him hard at work in his athleisure wear, Rishi Sunak wants to give the political impression that he's a chancellor we can all be comfortable with - careful with our money, but not afraid to spend it on things that matter, who has modern Tory instincts, but won't ditch the party's traditions. But remember Budget warm-ups are just that. However many announcements there have already been, however carefully the photographs of the prep have been thought through and selected, what matters is what he actually says at lunchtime on Wednesday. What matters are the numbers - what's in black and white - in the end. Read more from Laura here. Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""The Budget must take the pressure off working people. ""With costs growing and inflation rising, Labour would cut VAT on domestic energy bills immediately for six months. ""Unlike the Tories, we wouldn't hike taxes on working people and we'd ensure online giants pay their fair share."" Ex-Tory chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Newscast the government should not use higher wages as ""a bung"" to secure the support of low income voters. ""The instinct to send a message to business that we need to invest more capital rather than just relying on cheap labour, I think is the right instinct, I would support that,"" he said. Adam Scorer, chief executive of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, warned it was going to be a ""brutal and bitter winter for millions of householders"" who were unable to bear the costs of energy price rises. He called for the chancellor to find a way to put some of the extra tax receipts raised by the price increases back in the pockets of the most vulnerable.

"The chancellor pledges a major increase in public spending amid higher than expected economic growth Total departmental spending will increase by Â£150bn by 2024-25, which Rishi Sunak says is the largest increase this century Amid huge concern over the Â£20 cut to Universal Credit, changes will be made to let working claimants keep more of their benefits But Labour's Rachel Reeves - standing in for Keir Starmer, who has Covid - says struggling families will think Sunak is ""living in a parallel universe"" He also announces extra money for schools, tax cuts for businesses and a cut to air duties for flights within the UK A shake-up of alcohol duty will see cheaper sparkling wine and draught beer, while a planned rise in fuel duty has been cancelled Thanks for joining us for all the news, views and analysis of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget. Your writers today were Jennifer Scott, Sinead Wilson, Richard Morris, Dearbail Jordon and Victoria Lindrea. Your editors were Hamish Mackay, Claire Heald, Kevin Ponniah and Emma Harrison. You can find more of our in-depth coverage onthe BBC News website, but here is a little round-up before we close the page for the night. Parliament's official photographer Jessica Taylor was in the Commons to capture the event Rishi Sunak in the moments before his Budget speech sitting next to Prime Minister Boris Johnson (and looking a little nervous...) The Commons was packed with MPs to hear what Sunak had to say In full flow, the chancellor even appeared to be enjoying himself... And the (largely unmasked) Tory backbenchers enjoyed his performance... But Labour's Rachel Reeves was ready with a list of criticisms Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent One of the biggest savings
for the chancellor is the change in policy on the state pension triple lock. The temporary removal of the
earnings linkwas announced in September. Now, the Office for Budget
Responsibility says that will save the Treasury Â£5.4bn in the next financial
year. There
will be a rise of 3.1% in the state pension in April. That will add Â£4.25 more
a week to Â£141.85 for those on the older state pension, and an increase of
Â£5.55 to Â£185.15 a week for the newer flat-rate state pension. It
does mean that pensioners will get a predicted real terms cut â as inflation is
forecast to be 4% next year. Had
the government stuck to the triple lock, the rise would have been 8.3% - which
it describes as an anomaly caused by the pandemic. The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the UK's fiscal watchdog has warned. The Office for Budget Responsibility's latest forecast says that inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% next year. But it adds that figures released since its report was compiled suggests inflation could hit almost 5%. Read more here about the cost of living and where it is heading. Reality Check The chancellor is
spending more than Â£2bn a year reducing the taper rate on universal credit from
63% to 55% and increasing the amount some workers can earn before they lose
benefits. The taper rate is
the rate at which universal credit claimants lose benefits if they earn more
money. For some workers,
the cut to the taper rate will more than make up for the loss of the Â£20 a week
uplift to universal credit. The chancellor
gave the example of a single mother of two, renting her home and working full-time on the national living wage, who would indeed be better off by more than
Â£20 a week. But not all
claimants will recoup the losses. The changes will only benefit universal
credit claimants who are in work, for example, so a household in which nobody
was working would still be worse off. Also, a person
without children working 20 hours a week at the national living wage would
probably not benefit by as much as Â£20 a week. You can read more about it here. Jonathan JosephsBBC business reporter The UKâs economic recovery appears to be stronger than that
of Germany, the EU's so-called engine room. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects the UK economy to return to pre-pandemic levels âaround the turn of the yearâ and lifted its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for 2021 to 6.5%. Meanwhile in Germany, it has just announced it will now take three months longer - to the end of March - for its economy to reach pre-Covid levels. And Germanyâs growth forecast for this year has been cut
from 3.5% to 2.6%. Germany's economy minister Peter Altmaier says thatâs because of supply chain problems, higher energy
prices and a lack of computer chips which means less cars are being made. Vaccine rollout,
inflation and global supply chain problems are all reasons that a huge amount
of uncertainty remains for economies everywhere - and in this environment, the outlook for different nations can change pretty quickly. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Rishi Sunak portrays himself as a light touch Tory who doesn't like heavy taxes and who doesn't like big government. But he's not using the fading of the pandemic emergency to call time on hefty spending. Nor is the chancellor seizing a moment to argue for a leaner state. Instead, his plans seem to increase spending everywhere, in a Budget that on first examination has something for everyone. Sunak even chose to emphasise how he's restoring spending in some areas to levels not seen since Labour was in charge - though he is less keen to remind you they were cut back by successive administrations made up of his Tory colleagues. Despite dangling the promise of tax cuts by 2024, the Budget seems to confirm the political conclusions of Sunak and Boris Johnson - vows to shrink the state are not going to win them the next election. But with the threat of inflation, higher taxes and puny, if better growth, the seeming largesse may not be toasted by the public in the months to come, even they could do so with cheaper cider or prosecco. In Scotland, many of the big decisions about tax and spending are made by the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh,  but Rishi Sunak has given an extraÂ£4.6bn per year to Holyroodto allocate to departments. In Wales, Welsh government budgets will increase by anaverage of Â£2.5bn a year, with a total of Â£120m also earmarked for ten Welsh levelling-up projects. And in Northern Ireland there will be anadditional Â£1.6bn a year for public serviceswith infrastructure spending increasing by an average of 2.5% a year up to 2025. If you missed Rishi Sunak's Budget statement earlier, here's a quick recap of some of the main points:  You can readour main story on the Budget here. For those short on time, you can readthe key points at-a-glance here. And for those of you even shorter on time you can watchthis video with the main announcements in 126 seconds. Sir Keir Starmer released a video from home saying he was fine, but the Budget wasn't... Just minutes before PMQs - and less than an hour before the chancellor delivered his Budget speech - the Labour Party leader tested positive for Covid. Sir Keir Starmer had been due to respond to both the prime minister and Rishi Sunak in the Commons. But instead he had to isolate at home, passing on the job to his shadow business secretary (and former leader) Ed Miliband and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves. He has now released a video, saying he is ""absolutely gutted"" to miss the political moments, but it is right to follow the rules. And Sir Keir says he is feeling ""fine"" - well enough at least to criticise the Budget that ""does nothing for working people and nothing about the cost of living crisis"". The chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog, tells the BBC that Brexit will have a bigger impact on the UK economy in the long run than the pandemic. Speaking after todayâs Budget, Richard Hughes says âleaving the European Union is going to reduce our long run potential
output by 4%â, whereas he believes âthe pandemic is going to reduce that potential
output by a further 2%"". In the OBRâs overview of the UK's economic and fiscal outlook, it also states âsupply bottlenecks have
been exacerbated by changes in the migration and trading regimes following
Brexit"". A former Tory chancellor is welcoming the Budget
as ""fiscally responsible"", but warns it is also a ""gamble"" amid rising inflation and costs. Ex-MP Ken Clarke - now Lord Clarke - told BBC News the chancellor's speech was ""sound and sold very well"". He says Rishi Sunak has ""made the most of increases in
spending he's got... he's keeping the level of debt under control and he hopes to
reduce the level of annual deficit if - and it's a big if behind all this - the economy can maintain its recovery"". But Clarke says the economy is in ""a pretty sad state and faces a lot of dangers"",
adding: ""I hope it comes off because everything really depends on
inflation, costs, growth over the next year or two"". Rising inflation could result in rising prices for pubs, restaurants and consumers Now back to some more reaction to the Budget we've been hearing this afternoon. Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, says for many manufacturers and producers the 50% cut in business rates for hospitality announced in the Budget and the simplification of alcohol duty are âwelcome news"". However, he says the Budget does âlittle to addressâ labour
shortages and adds it is also âworryingly short on action to tackle rising
inflationâ. âGiven the pressures they are facing, many manufacturers
will simply have no choice but continue to pass costs down the chain,â he says. Dennis asks our final question. Helen CattPolitical Correspondent That is a very good point. The Speaker of the House of Commons is really quite cross about this becayse what the government is supposed to do, by convention, is announce policies in Parliament first. That's so that MPs can pick them apart and hold ministers to account. There were still some surprises today though - the Universal Credit changes and the reform of alcohol duty. Helen CattPolitical Correspondent We found out about the new tax to raise money for social care earlier this year. In fact, there were not any nasty tax rises in this Budget. But that's because they had already done it with the upcoming rise in National Insurance, which will become the health and social care levy. That is a significant tax and it will raise raise Â£12bn for both the NHS and social care. We are still waiting for more detail on that, but it didn't come in the Budget. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent No. There are some changes that apply to all businesses, but there are some targeted ones too. Those ones -the 50% discount specifically- are aimed at those kind of sectors struggling to get back on their feet, such as hospitality and leisure. And no-one knows what is going to happen in the next few months, so there appears to be some caution from the Treasury in case those businesses get hit again. Kamala asks... Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent Not today, no. We have had some relief for businesses over the coming months but there wasn't very much in there for self-employed workers. We had that fiddling around last month with national insurance to finance the health and social care levy, but today, despite the length of the speech, nothing for the self-employed. A question from Stephen... Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent We do have some concrete details on that. As of next April, the National Living Wage - as it's now called - will go up by 6.6% if you're over 23. That takes it to Â£9.50 per hour. If you work full time, you might see an increase of around Â£1,000 per year. This announcement was actually made ahead of time,which we reported on here. A question from Alan... Helen CattPolitical Correspondent Some of the Budget is for the whole of the UK, some of it is just for England. There are some things that Westminster does for the whole of the UK, and some things the devolved administrations do for themselves. So, things like money for local councils will be England only - but then Scotland, Wales and NI will get a proportionate amount of money based on that announcement and they can decide what to do with it themselves. So the whole Budget is a bit of a mix and you have to look at polcies individually to see whether they are UK-wide or not. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent We've had a lot of questions on this theme. The answer is the bulk of it comes from us as taxpayers. We pay hundreds of billions of pounds in to the Treasury every year but they also need to top it up and they do. They can borrow from the financial markets and because they are the government they are much more reliable than the rest of us when it comes to paying back money so they can normally borrow at very low rates indeed. That's why they have been able to finance all that extra spending on pandemic help. Â© 2025 BBC.

Goulding, who has recently been diagnosed with early-onset dementia, said there was not enough protection for players who had suffered head injuries. The 49-year-old, who won the Super League and Challenge Cup double in 1996 as St Helens captain, said he had played again within days of being knocked unconscious at least three times in his career. Former Wales international Michael Edwards, 48, and Scotland internationals Jason Roach, 50, and Ryan MacDonald, 43, are also part of a test group of 10 players, all under the age of 60, bringing the legal action. All three have also been diagnosed with early-onset dementia. Their lawyer, Richard Boardman, said he was representing a total of 50 former professional rugby league players in their 20s to 50s, all of whom are showing symptoms associated with neurological complications. He is also representing 175 former rugby union players, including Thompson, in a separate lawsuit. Boardman said the legal claim was not just about financial compensation, but making the game safer and getting tested and diagnosed to undertake urgent clinical support. He said there were potentially hundreds of former rugby league players who, as they reached their 40s and 50s, were developing various neurological issues, such as early-onset dementia, CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy), epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and motor neurone disease. ""The vast majority of the former players we represent love the game and don't want to see it harmed in any way,"" Boardman said. ""They just want to make it safer so current and future generations don't end up like them. We're asking the RFL to make a number of immediate, relatively low-cost changes to save the sport, such as limiting contact in training and extending the return to play following a concussion."" Given the significant risk of serious or permanent brain damage caused by concussions, the former players allege the RFL owed them - as individual professional players - a duty to take reasonable care for their safety. Boardman added the group also felt the RFL should have established and implemented rules on the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of actual or suspected concussive injuries. In a statement the RFL said: ""The Rugby Football League has recently been contacted by solicitors representing a number of former players. ""The RFL takes player safety and welfare extremely seriously and has been saddened to hear about some of the former players' difficulties. ""Rugby league is a contact sport and, while there is an element of risk to playing any sport, player welfare is always of paramount importance. ""As a result of scientific knowledge, the sport of rugby league continues to improve and develop its approach to concussion, head injury assessment, education, management and prevention across the whole game. We will continue to use medical evidence and research to reinforce and enhance our approach."" Goulding won the Super League and Challenge Cup double in 1996 as St Helens captain Goulding played for sides including Wigan, Leeds, Widnes and St Helens as well as earning 17 caps for Great Britain. He played for England five times, including the World Cup final in 1995, and the following year was named in the Super League team of the season. Since retiring, first in 2005 and then nine years later after a brief comeback with Barrow Raiders, he has spoken about his battles with alcohol and drug addiction. Talking about his dementia diagnosis, Goulding said: ""For something like this to come out of the blue, and hit me like a bus, is hard to take. ""I didn't think about dementia at all, I just thought it was the way life was. ""I played within days of serious knockouts on at least three occasions. I remember playing on a Sunday for Leigh at Huddersfield towards the end of my career [in 2002]. ""I was in Huddersfield Royal Infirmary on the Sunday night after being seriously knocked out and played the following Saturday against Batley. I didn't have one doctor check on me during that week."" Many of the former rugby league players who form part of the legal case have been diagnosed with early-onset dementia and probable CTE. CTE is the disease discovered by Dr Bennet Omalu in American football player Mike Webster, and the subject of the film Concussion starring Will Smith. In 2011, a group of former American footballers started a class action against the NFL andwon a settlementworth about $1bn (Â£700m). CTE can develop when the brain is subjected to numerous small blows or rapid movements - sometimes known as sub-concussions - and is associated with symptoms such as memory loss, depression and progressive dementia. The disease can only be diagnosed in a brain after death. It has been found in the brains of dozens of former NFL players, as well as a handful of deceased footballers, including former West Bromwich Albion and England strikerJeff Astle.A re-examination of his brain in 2014 found he had died from CTE. The issue of concussion in sport has been debated extensively over the past few years and the links between heading a football and degenerative brain disease have even forced rule changes at youth level. In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, children aged 11 and under are no longer allowed to head a ball in training, while there are also limits to heading frequency at higher age group levels. At senior level, former professionals have called for more research and better player welfare after the death of England World Cup winner Nobby Stiles a year ago, and news that his 1966 team-mate and Manchester United legend Sir Bobby Charlton is also suffering from the disease.

Wrexham brought plenty of drama, fighting back to 2-2 after having a player sent off, but a final Maidenhead goal deprived them of a fairy tale ending. The actors completed their takeover of the club in February. Fans of all ages met the actors outside the stadium including Freya, eight, and Cyron, 11 Fans were eager for the stars to pose for selfies with them A film crew, photographers and fans followed the pair around This was Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds' first visit to Wrexham Speaking onBBC Radio Wales with Claire Summers, Mr Jones, who runs the Turf Hotel in Wrexham, next to the football club's Racecourse ground, said it was ""surreal"" to see pictures of the actors at the game. ""It's brilliant, the whole town is absolutely buzzing, if I'm honest. People keep phoning and asking if I've seen them,"" he said. ""I'm never sleeping again ever, ever,"" wrote Ryan Reynolds after the Wrexham game ""I'd love them to call in for a beer. My wife will probably faint, I would imagine, if Ryan Reynolds walks through the door."" Mr Jones said the actors would be coming to his pub to film the promotion for their access-all-areas documentary, Welcome to Wrexham, on Thursday. The Turf Hotel was where Wrexham AFC was first formed in 1864, he said. Shaun Roberts, Rachel Roberts and their son Anthony all support Wrexham AFC The Roberts family, who are Wrexham fans, said the club owners' visit had ""really brought the town to life"". ""Everyone seems to know about it,"" said Shaun Roberts. He said he was stopped in Torquay a few months ago and asked about the football club owners because he was wearing a Wrexham shirt. ""It's really given a bit of oomph to Wrexham,"" his wife Rachel added. ""It's something to perk us up a bit."" Daniel Sides said the club owners' visit would ""generate a lot of buzz"" Wrexham fan Daniel Sides was on his way to buy an away kit from the club store on Wednesday morning.

""It's going to generate a lot of buzz with a lot of the people around the town centre as well because obviously they're megastars."" Landlord Mr Jones said the game against Maidenhead had given the stars ""a crash course in what supporting Wrexham is all about"". ""It wouldn't have been the Wrexham way if we had turned up and walloped them 7-0 last night,"" he said. ""If they didn't know what to expect, they certainly do now."" Maidenhead United fans were the happier of the two sides But he added ""a lot of fans are a little bit disgruntled"" about the club's performance.

"The chancellor pledges a major increase in public spending amid higher than expected economic growth Total departmental spending will increase by Â£150bn by 2024-25, which Rishi Sunak says is the largest increase this century Amid huge concern over the Â£20 cut to Universal Credit, changes will be made to let working claimants keep more of their benefits But Labour's Rachel Reeves - standing in for Keir Starmer, who has Covid - says struggling families will think Sunak is ""living in a parallel universe"" He also announces extra money for schools, tax cuts for businesses and a cut to air duties for flights within the UK A shake-up of alcohol duty will see cheaper sparkling wine and draught beer, while a planned rise in fuel duty has been cancelled Thanks for joining us for all the news, views and analysis of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget. Your writers today were Jennifer Scott, Sinead Wilson, Richard Morris, Dearbail Jordon and Victoria Lindrea. Your editors were Hamish Mackay, Claire Heald, Kevin Ponniah and Emma Harrison. You can find more of our in-depth coverage onthe BBC News website, but here is a little round-up before we close the page for the night. Parliament's official photographer Jessica Taylor was in the Commons to capture the event Rishi Sunak in the moments before his Budget speech sitting next to Prime Minister Boris Johnson (and looking a little nervous...) The Commons was packed with MPs to hear what Sunak had to say In full flow, the chancellor even appeared to be enjoying himself... And the (largely unmasked) Tory backbenchers enjoyed his performance... But Labour's Rachel Reeves was ready with a list of criticisms Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent One of the biggest savings
for the chancellor is the change in policy on the state pension triple lock. The temporary removal of the
earnings linkwas announced in September. Now, the Office for Budget
Responsibility says that will save the Treasury Â£5.4bn in the next financial
year. There
will be a rise of 3.1% in the state pension in April. That will add Â£4.25 more
a week to Â£141.85 for those on the older state pension, and an increase of
Â£5.55 to Â£185.15 a week for the newer flat-rate state pension. It
does mean that pensioners will get a predicted real terms cut â as inflation is
forecast to be 4% next year. Had
the government stuck to the triple lock, the rise would have been 8.3% - which
it describes as an anomaly caused by the pandemic. The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the UK's fiscal watchdog has warned. The Office for Budget Responsibility's latest forecast says that inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% next year. But it adds that figures released since its report was compiled suggests inflation could hit almost 5%. Read more here about the cost of living and where it is heading. Reality Check The chancellor is
spending more than Â£2bn a year reducing the taper rate on universal credit from
63% to 55% and increasing the amount some workers can earn before they lose
benefits. The taper rate is
the rate at which universal credit claimants lose benefits if they earn more
money. For some workers,
the cut to the taper rate will more than make up for the loss of the Â£20 a week
uplift to universal credit. The chancellor
gave the example of a single mother of two, renting her home and working full-time on the national living wage, who would indeed be better off by more than
Â£20 a week. But not all
claimants will recoup the losses. The changes will only benefit universal
credit claimants who are in work, for example, so a household in which nobody
was working would still be worse off. Also, a person
without children working 20 hours a week at the national living wage would
probably not benefit by as much as Â£20 a week. You can read more about it here. Jonathan JosephsBBC business reporter The UKâs economic recovery appears to be stronger than that
of Germany, the EU's so-called engine room. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects the UK economy to return to pre-pandemic levels âaround the turn of the yearâ and lifted its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for 2021 to 6.5%. Meanwhile in Germany, it has just announced it will now take three months longer - to the end of March - for its economy to reach pre-Covid levels. And Germanyâs growth forecast for this year has been cut
from 3.5% to 2.6%. Germany's economy minister Peter Altmaier says thatâs because of supply chain problems, higher energy
prices and a lack of computer chips which means less cars are being made. Vaccine rollout,
inflation and global supply chain problems are all reasons that a huge amount
of uncertainty remains for economies everywhere - and in this environment, the outlook for different nations can change pretty quickly. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Rishi Sunak portrays himself as a light touch Tory who doesn't like heavy taxes and who doesn't like big government. But he's not using the fading of the pandemic emergency to call time on hefty spending. Nor is the chancellor seizing a moment to argue for a leaner state. Instead, his plans seem to increase spending everywhere, in a Budget that on first examination has something for everyone. Sunak even chose to emphasise how he's restoring spending in some areas to levels not seen since Labour was in charge - though he is less keen to remind you they were cut back by successive administrations made up of his Tory colleagues. Despite dangling the promise of tax cuts by 2024, the Budget seems to confirm the political conclusions of Sunak and Boris Johnson - vows to shrink the state are not going to win them the next election. But with the threat of inflation, higher taxes and puny, if better growth, the seeming largesse may not be toasted by the public in the months to come, even they could do so with cheaper cider or prosecco. In Scotland, many of the big decisions about tax and spending are made by the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh,  but Rishi Sunak has given an extraÂ£4.6bn per year to Holyroodto allocate to departments. In Wales, Welsh government budgets will increase by anaverage of Â£2.5bn a year, with a total of Â£120m also earmarked for ten Welsh levelling-up projects. And in Northern Ireland there will be anadditional Â£1.6bn a year for public serviceswith infrastructure spending increasing by an average of 2.5% a year up to 2025. If you missed Rishi Sunak's Budget statement earlier, here's a quick recap of some of the main points:  You can readour main story on the Budget here. For those short on time, you can readthe key points at-a-glance here. And for those of you even shorter on time you can watchthis video with the main announcements in 126 seconds. Sir Keir Starmer released a video from home saying he was fine, but the Budget wasn't... Just minutes before PMQs - and less than an hour before the chancellor delivered his Budget speech - the Labour Party leader tested positive for Covid. Sir Keir Starmer had been due to respond to both the prime minister and Rishi Sunak in the Commons. But instead he had to isolate at home, passing on the job to his shadow business secretary (and former leader) Ed Miliband and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves. He has now released a video, saying he is ""absolutely gutted"" to miss the political moments, but it is right to follow the rules. And Sir Keir says he is feeling ""fine"" - well enough at least to criticise the Budget that ""does nothing for working people and nothing about the cost of living crisis"". The chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog, tells the BBC that Brexit will have a bigger impact on the UK economy in the long run than the pandemic. Speaking after todayâs Budget, Richard Hughes says âleaving the European Union is going to reduce our long run potential
output by 4%â, whereas he believes âthe pandemic is going to reduce that potential
output by a further 2%"". In the OBRâs overview of the UK's economic and fiscal outlook, it also states âsupply bottlenecks have
been exacerbated by changes in the migration and trading regimes following
Brexit"". A former Tory chancellor is welcoming the Budget
as ""fiscally responsible"", but warns it is also a ""gamble"" amid rising inflation and costs. Ex-MP Ken Clarke - now Lord Clarke - told BBC News the chancellor's speech was ""sound and sold very well"". He says Rishi Sunak has ""made the most of increases in
spending he's got... he's keeping the level of debt under control and he hopes to
reduce the level of annual deficit if - and it's a big if behind all this - the economy can maintain its recovery"". But Clarke says the economy is in ""a pretty sad state and faces a lot of dangers"",
adding: ""I hope it comes off because everything really depends on
inflation, costs, growth over the next year or two"". Rising inflation could result in rising prices for pubs, restaurants and consumers Now back to some more reaction to the Budget we've been hearing this afternoon. Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, says for many manufacturers and producers the 50% cut in business rates for hospitality announced in the Budget and the simplification of alcohol duty are âwelcome news"". However, he says the Budget does âlittle to addressâ labour
shortages and adds it is also âworryingly short on action to tackle rising
inflationâ. âGiven the pressures they are facing, many manufacturers
will simply have no choice but continue to pass costs down the chain,â he says. Dennis asks our final question. Helen CattPolitical Correspondent That is a very good point. The Speaker of the House of Commons is really quite cross about this becayse what the government is supposed to do, by convention, is announce policies in Parliament first. That's so that MPs can pick them apart and hold ministers to account. There were still some surprises today though - the Universal Credit changes and the reform of alcohol duty. Helen CattPolitical Correspondent We found out about the new tax to raise money for social care earlier this year. In fact, there were not any nasty tax rises in this Budget. But that's because they had already done it with the upcoming rise in National Insurance, which will become the health and social care levy. That is a significant tax and it will raise raise Â£12bn for both the NHS and social care. We are still waiting for more detail on that, but it didn't come in the Budget. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent No. There are some changes that apply to all businesses, but there are some targeted ones too. Those ones -the 50% discount specifically- are aimed at those kind of sectors struggling to get back on their feet, such as hospitality and leisure. And no-one knows what is going to happen in the next few months, so there appears to be some caution from the Treasury in case those businesses get hit again. Kamala asks... Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent Not today, no. We have had some relief for businesses over the coming months but there wasn't very much in there for self-employed workers. We had that fiddling around last month with national insurance to finance the health and social care levy, but today, despite the length of the speech, nothing for the self-employed. A question from Stephen... Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent We do have some concrete details on that. As of next April, the National Living Wage - as it's now called - will go up by 6.6% if you're over 23. That takes it to Â£9.50 per hour. If you work full time, you might see an increase of around Â£1,000 per year. This announcement was actually made ahead of time,which we reported on here. A question from Alan... Helen CattPolitical Correspondent Some of the Budget is for the whole of the UK, some of it is just for England. There are some things that Westminster does for the whole of the UK, and some things the devolved administrations do for themselves. So, things like money for local councils will be England only - but then Scotland, Wales and NI will get a proportionate amount of money based on that announcement and they can decide what to do with it themselves. So the whole Budget is a bit of a mix and you have to look at polcies individually to see whether they are UK-wide or not. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent We've had a lot of questions on this theme. The answer is the bulk of it comes from us as taxpayers. We pay hundreds of billions of pounds in to the Treasury every year but they also need to top it up and they do. They can borrow from the financial markets and because they are the government they are much more reliable than the rest of us when it comes to paying back money so they can normally borrow at very low rates indeed. That's why they have been able to finance all that extra spending on pandemic help. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak: âTodayâs Budget delivers a stronger economy for British peopleâ Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told MPs the Budget begins the work to prepare for a new economy post Covid, as he delivers his speech in the Commons. Spending plans for transport, health and education have been unveiled in the press. Mr Sunak is under pressure to help people with the cost of living. Sources say he will adjust the universal credit taper rate, meaning those working will be able to take home more of the money they earn. A Â£20 a week top up to the benefit was cut earlier this month, but details of any changes have yet to be announced. LIVE: Sunak set to unveil Budget Faisal Islam: Will Sunak's plans calm cost of living concerns? A simple guide to Budget 2021 Budget 2021: What has already been announced? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will not be responding to the Budget, as the leader of the opposition is normally expected to do, as he is isolating after testing positive for Covid. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves will set out Labour's response instead. According to Downing Street, Mr Sunak told the cabinet on Wednesday morning that his Budget ""will deliver a stronger economy for the British people"" with the ""levelling-up"" agenda - spreading prosperity around the country - a ""golden thread"" running through it. The chancellor is under pressure to reveal more about the economic outlook, with government debt soaring to record peace time levels in the wake of the pandemic. And he will deliver a three-year spending review alongside his Budget. The Treasury has asked departments to find ""at least 5% of savings and efficiencies from their day-to-day budgets"" - so it is clear not every area will get the same treatment. Policies already unveiled from the chancellor's Budget include: Â£6.9bn for English city regions to spend on train, tram, bus and cycle projects - including the Â£4.2bn promised in 2019 alongside funding for buses announced by the PM in 2020 Â£5.9bn for NHS Englandto tackle the backlog of people waiting for tests and scans A rise in the National Living Wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50, to come into effect from 1 April Â£2.6bn to be spent on creating 30,000 new school places for children with special educational needs and disabilities Â£1.6bn over three years to roll out new T-levels for 16 to 19-year-olds and Â£550m for adult skills in England You can read more on the announcements the government has already made here. One of the pre-announced policies is theend to a pay freeze for public sector workers- such as teachers, nurses and police officers - but ministers have so far refused to say whether it will be a real-terms rise by being higher than inflation. Pay for most frontline workforces is set by independent pay review bodies and No 10 has said it could not ""prejudge that process"". Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle was furious about the number of spending plans that were given to the media before Mr Sunak's big speech - they are traditionally meant to be announced in Parliament so MPs can challenge and scrutinise them. Deputy Speaker Eleanor Laing echoed the reproof just before the Chancellor got to his feet. A No 10 spokesman said they ""recognised the importance of parliamentary scrutiny"" and they ""always listen very carefully to the Speaker"". This video can not be played Sir Lindsay Hoyle says it is ânot acceptable"" for ministers to give briefings to the media before Parliament. Whisper it. After the economy took an absolute hammering during the pandemic, might the chancellor tomorrow actually be in a much cheerier political mood than he could have predicted? During his Budget warm-up in the last few days, Rishi Sunak has already totted up promises of around an extra Â£20bn of spending, as well as announcing how some of the cash that was already promised is going to be carved up. Hold on for a second though. On the specifics, there is no guarantee that unfreezing the wages of 2.5 million workers in England will mean they get pay rises that aren't eroded by inflation. The same goes for increases for workers on low pay, and cuts to universal credit will pinch too. Having treated us all to cosy snaps of him and his Labrador, Nova, and him hard at work in his athleisure wear, Rishi Sunak wants to give the political impression that he's a chancellor we can all be comfortable with - careful with our money, but not afraid to spend it on things that matter, who has modern Tory instincts, but won't ditch the party's traditions. But remember Budget warm-ups are just that. However many announcements there have already been, however carefully the photographs of the prep have been thought through and selected, what matters is what he actually says at lunchtime on Wednesday. What matters are the numbers - what's in black and white - in the end. Read more from Laura here. Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""The Budget must take the pressure off working people. ""With costs growing and inflation rising, Labour would cut VAT on domestic energy bills immediately for six months. ""Unlike the Tories, we wouldn't hike taxes on working people and we'd ensure online giants pay their fair share."" Ex-Tory chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Newscast the government should not use higher wages as ""a bung"" to secure the support of low income voters. ""The instinct to send a message to business that we need to invest more capital rather than just relying on cheap labour, I think is the right instinct, I would support that,"" he said. Adam Scorer, chief executive of fuel poverty charity National Energy Action, warned it was going to be a ""brutal and bitter winter for millions of householders"" who were unable to bear the costs of energy price rises. He called for the chancellor to find a way to put some of the extra tax receipts raised by the price increases back in the pockets of the most vulnerable.

"This vigil was staged outside the Science Museum Climate activists who slept overnight in London's Science Museum will approach the attraction's visitors to tell them about its sponsorship deals. A new gallery funded by a subsidiary of the Adani Group, a multinational business involved in coal extraction, is due to open in 2023. About 30 members of the UK Student Climate Network (UKSCN) camped out in the lobby as a protest on behalf of ""victims"" of fossil fuel companies. No arrests have been made. The museum has also faced criticism for partnering with Shell to fund its Our Future Planet exhibition Demonstrator Izzy Warren, 17, said the group, which includes school pupils, university students and scientists, chose to occupy the museum because the owners had ignored their petitions, letters and boycotts. ""We would really like to greet people who come to the museum this morning so they are aware of what they are supporting, and what they are paying for. ""The Science Museum is blatantly taking money from some of the worst perpetrators of the climate crisis."" The demonstration comes after the Science Museum last week announced a new gallery, called Energy Revolution: The Adani Green Energy Gallery. The demonstration comes after the Science Museum last week announced a new gallery, called Energy Revolution: The Adani Green Energy Gallery Adani Green Energy is a solar power developer based in India and is a subsidiary of the Adani Group, which through another arm of its business is also involved in extracting coal. A spokesperson for the renewables company said: ""An environment where every child can grow up breathing pollution-free air - that is the environment we dream to create and have to a certain extent managed to enrich lives with our renewable energy plants. ""Adani Green Energy is pioneering in helping transition to renewable power generation. We develop, build, own, operate and maintain utility scale grid connected solar and wind projects."" Biologist Dr Alexander Penson, who took part in the sit-in, said it was ""appalling"" the museum was persisting in fossil fuel sponsorship and starting a new relationship with Adani. The activists said they negotiated with museum staff to be moved from the second floor of the building to the Energy Hall near the main entrance so that they would have access to toilets for the whole night. London's Science Museum The Science Museum is a major museum on Exhibition Road in South Kensington Founded in 1857, it is one of the city's major tourist attractions, attracting 3.3 million visitors every year It is free to enter, although special exhibitions may incur a fee The museum has also faced criticism for partnering with Shell to fund its Our Future Planet exhibition, which is about carbon capture and storage and nature-based solutions to the climate crisis. The agreement with the fossil fuel giant included a gagging clause, committing the museum not to say anything that could damage Shell's reputation. The students have staged the protest against sponsorship by fossil fuel companies The Science Museum has consistently defended its stance on working with fossil fuel partners. Chief executive Ian Blatchford said trustees ""are not convinced by the argument from some who say we should sever all ties with organisations that are 'tainted' by association, direct or indirect, with fossil fuels. ""We believe the right approach is to engage, debate and challenge companies, governments and individuals to do more to make the global economy less carbon intensive. ""Adani Green Energy is an example of an energy sector business bringing expertise and investment to renewables at the scale needed to deliver meaningful change."" A Met Police spokesperson said: ""Officers attended and engaged with the protesters and museum staff. ""The protesters stated their intention was to remain in the museum overnight. This was agreed to by museum staff. ""No further police action was required."" Science Museum begins Covid-19 collection.

"Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds arrive at Maidenhead's York Road ground Wrexham's Hollywood co-owner Ryan Reynolds described football as a ""soul-deadening"", ""evil"" and ""gorgeous"" game after watching his club in action for the first timeat Maidenhead. Reynolds and fellow actor Rob McElhenney completed their takeover of the club in February. The pair made their much-awaited first appearance at a Wrexham game at Maidenhead United's York Road. They watched on as 10-man Wrexham lost 3-2 after fighting back from 2-0. The actors were accompanied by a crew filming an access-all-areas documentary, Welcome to Wrexham. Despite the result Deadpool star Reynolds seemed to enjoy his first taste of British football as heshared pictures from the National league game on his Instagram,external. He wrote: ""Football is a staggering, heartbreaking, gorgeous, tommy-gun of soul-deadening, evil and beauty and I'm never sleeping again ever, ever."" Up until now Reynolds and McElhenney, both based in the US, had been restricted to watching Wrexham matches on streams due to filming commitments and the pandemic. But the actors attended a first game that had plenty of drama, with Wrexham falling behind to two goals after 22 minutes before having a player sent off. Wrexham fought back to level at 2-2 before Maidenhead's Josh Kelly scored a goal that ensured there would be no fairytale ending on this occasion, with the home side winning 3-2. Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson had been told beforehand that the club's co-owners would be present but neither he nor the players met with the pair ahead of the game. ""They flew in and they were trying to keep a low profile but I imagine it's fairly difficult to be low profile and they let us get on with it,"" Parkinson said. ""We look forward to meeting them later in the week. ""I'm really disappointed for them that we haven't been able to come away with at least a draw. But that's football. It can be a brutal industry."" Wrexham fan Andy Gilpin said he was ""gobsmacked"" to see the Hollywood owners in the stands and that their appearance had given the fans ""a boost"". ""There's media hype and then there's showing up at Maidenhead away which isn't the sort of Hollywood entrance really, it's a very low-key ground, and to see two Hollywood stars there in the middle of the home stand, we were just gobsmacked, you know,"" he said. ""It's quite a statement to come here to Maidenhead away and fair play to them for doing that."" Free Guy star Reynolds and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia creator McElhenney revealed their interest in buying the north Wales club, the third oldest professional club in the world, in September 2020. Wrexham Supporters' Trust members voted overwhelmingly to back the takeover two months later after the pair made an online presentation to fans. The club had been under fan ownership since 2011 following a difficult decade which saw them enter administration and lose their place in the Football League in 2008. Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson has said Reynolds and McElhenneyrecognise the ""huge potential""of the club. Reynolds and McElhenney invested an immediate Â£2m in Wrexham after completing their takeover, with their ambition reflected by a number of notable signings - plus the appointment of Parkinson - over the last few months. Reynolds stated in November 2020 that the aim was to turn Wrexham into a ""global force"". However, Wrexham have had a mixed start to the 2021-22 season and are 11th in the National League following the defeat at Maidenhead.

"The chancellor pledges a major increase in public spending amid higher than expected economic growth Total departmental spending will increase by Â£150bn by 2024-25, which Rishi Sunak says is the largest increase this century Amid huge concern over the Â£20 cut to Universal Credit, changes will be made to let working claimants keep more of their benefits But Labour's Rachel Reeves - standing in for Keir Starmer, who has Covid - says struggling families will think Sunak is ""living in a parallel universe"" He also announces extra money for schools, tax cuts for businesses and a cut to air duties for flights within the UK A shake-up of alcohol duty will see cheaper sparkling wine and draught beer, while a planned rise in fuel duty has been cancelled Thanks for joining us for all the news, views and analysis of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget. Your writers today were Jennifer Scott, Sinead Wilson, Richard Morris, Dearbail Jordon and Victoria Lindrea. Your editors were Hamish Mackay, Claire Heald, Kevin Ponniah and Emma Harrison. You can find more of our in-depth coverage onthe BBC News website, but here is a little round-up before we close the page for the night. Parliament's official photographer Jessica Taylor was in the Commons to capture the event Rishi Sunak in the moments before his Budget speech sitting next to Prime Minister Boris Johnson (and looking a little nervous...) The Commons was packed with MPs to hear what Sunak had to say In full flow, the chancellor even appeared to be enjoying himself... And the (largely unmasked) Tory backbenchers enjoyed his performance... But Labour's Rachel Reeves was ready with a list of criticisms Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent One of the biggest savings
for the chancellor is the change in policy on the state pension triple lock. The temporary removal of the
earnings linkwas announced in September. Now, the Office for Budget
Responsibility says that will save the Treasury Â£5.4bn in the next financial
year. There
will be a rise of 3.1% in the state pension in April. That will add Â£4.25 more
a week to Â£141.85 for those on the older state pension, and an increase of
Â£5.55 to Â£185.15 a week for the newer flat-rate state pension. It
does mean that pensioners will get a predicted real terms cut â as inflation is
forecast to be 4% next year. Had
the government stuck to the triple lock, the rise would have been 8.3% - which
it describes as an anomaly caused by the pandemic. The cost of living could rise at its fastest rate for 30 years, the UK's fiscal watchdog has warned. The Office for Budget Responsibility's latest forecast says that inflation, which measures the change in the cost of living over time, is set to jump from 3.1% to an average of 4% next year. But it adds that figures released since its report was compiled suggests inflation could hit almost 5%. Read more here about the cost of living and where it is heading. Reality Check The chancellor is
spending more than Â£2bn a year reducing the taper rate on universal credit from
63% to 55% and increasing the amount some workers can earn before they lose
benefits. The taper rate is
the rate at which universal credit claimants lose benefits if they earn more
money. For some workers,
the cut to the taper rate will more than make up for the loss of the Â£20 a week
uplift to universal credit. The chancellor
gave the example of a single mother of two, renting her home and working full-time on the national living wage, who would indeed be better off by more than
Â£20 a week. But not all
claimants will recoup the losses. The changes will only benefit universal
credit claimants who are in work, for example, so a household in which nobody
was working would still be worse off. Also, a person
without children working 20 hours a week at the national living wage would
probably not benefit by as much as Â£20 a week. You can read more about it here. Jonathan JosephsBBC business reporter The UKâs economic recovery appears to be stronger than that
of Germany, the EU's so-called engine room. The Office for Budget Responsibility expects the UK economy to return to pre-pandemic levels âaround the turn of the yearâ and lifted its gross domestic product (GDP) growth forecast for 2021 to 6.5%. Meanwhile in Germany, it has just announced it will now take three months longer - to the end of March - for its economy to reach pre-Covid levels. And Germanyâs growth forecast for this year has been cut
from 3.5% to 2.6%. Germany's economy minister Peter Altmaier says thatâs because of supply chain problems, higher energy
prices and a lack of computer chips which means less cars are being made. Vaccine rollout,
inflation and global supply chain problems are all reasons that a huge amount
of uncertainty remains for economies everywhere - and in this environment, the outlook for different nations can change pretty quickly. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Rishi Sunak portrays himself as a light touch Tory who doesn't like heavy taxes and who doesn't like big government. But he's not using the fading of the pandemic emergency to call time on hefty spending. Nor is the chancellor seizing a moment to argue for a leaner state. Instead, his plans seem to increase spending everywhere, in a Budget that on first examination has something for everyone. Sunak even chose to emphasise how he's restoring spending in some areas to levels not seen since Labour was in charge - though he is less keen to remind you they were cut back by successive administrations made up of his Tory colleagues. Despite dangling the promise of tax cuts by 2024, the Budget seems to confirm the political conclusions of Sunak and Boris Johnson - vows to shrink the state are not going to win them the next election. But with the threat of inflation, higher taxes and puny, if better growth, the seeming largesse may not be toasted by the public in the months to come, even they could do so with cheaper cider or prosecco. In Scotland, many of the big decisions about tax and spending are made by the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh,  but Rishi Sunak has given an extraÂ£4.6bn per year to Holyroodto allocate to departments. In Wales, Welsh government budgets will increase by anaverage of Â£2.5bn a year, with a total of Â£120m also earmarked for ten Welsh levelling-up projects. And in Northern Ireland there will be anadditional Â£1.6bn a year for public serviceswith infrastructure spending increasing by an average of 2.5% a year up to 2025. If you missed Rishi Sunak's Budget statement earlier, here's a quick recap of some of the main points:  You can readour main story on the Budget here. For those short on time, you can readthe key points at-a-glance here. And for those of you even shorter on time you can watchthis video with the main announcements in 126 seconds. Sir Keir Starmer released a video from home saying he was fine, but the Budget wasn't... Just minutes before PMQs - and less than an hour before the chancellor delivered his Budget speech - the Labour Party leader tested positive for Covid. Sir Keir Starmer had been due to respond to both the prime minister and Rishi Sunak in the Commons. But instead he had to isolate at home, passing on the job to his shadow business secretary (and former leader) Ed Miliband and shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves. He has now released a video, saying he is ""absolutely gutted"" to miss the political moments, but it is right to follow the rules. And Sir Keir says he is feeling ""fine"" - well enough at least to criticise the Budget that ""does nothing for working people and nothing about the cost of living crisis"". The chairman of the Office for Budget Responsibility, the fiscal watchdog, tells the BBC that Brexit will have a bigger impact on the UK economy in the long run than the pandemic. Speaking after todayâs Budget, Richard Hughes says âleaving the European Union is going to reduce our long run potential
output by 4%â, whereas he believes âthe pandemic is going to reduce that potential
output by a further 2%"". In the OBRâs overview of the UK's economic and fiscal outlook, it also states âsupply bottlenecks have
been exacerbated by changes in the migration and trading regimes following
Brexit"". A former Tory chancellor is welcoming the Budget
as ""fiscally responsible"", but warns it is also a ""gamble"" amid rising inflation and costs. Ex-MP Ken Clarke - now Lord Clarke - told BBC News the chancellor's speech was ""sound and sold very well"". He says Rishi Sunak has ""made the most of increases in
spending he's got... he's keeping the level of debt under control and he hopes to
reduce the level of annual deficit if - and it's a big if behind all this - the economy can maintain its recovery"". But Clarke says the economy is in ""a pretty sad state and faces a lot of dangers"",
adding: ""I hope it comes off because everything really depends on
inflation, costs, growth over the next year or two"". Rising inflation could result in rising prices for pubs, restaurants and consumers Now back to some more reaction to the Budget we've been hearing this afternoon. Ian Wright, chief executive of the Food and Drink Federation, says for many manufacturers and producers the 50% cut in business rates for hospitality announced in the Budget and the simplification of alcohol duty are âwelcome news"". However, he says the Budget does âlittle to addressâ labour
shortages and adds it is also âworryingly short on action to tackle rising
inflationâ. âGiven the pressures they are facing, many manufacturers
will simply have no choice but continue to pass costs down the chain,â he says. Dennis asks our final question. Helen CattPolitical Correspondent That is a very good point. The Speaker of the House of Commons is really quite cross about this becayse what the government is supposed to do, by convention, is announce policies in Parliament first. That's so that MPs can pick them apart and hold ministers to account. There were still some surprises today though - the Universal Credit changes and the reform of alcohol duty. Helen CattPolitical Correspondent We found out about the new tax to raise money for social care earlier this year. In fact, there were not any nasty tax rises in this Budget. But that's because they had already done it with the upcoming rise in National Insurance, which will become the health and social care levy. That is a significant tax and it will raise raise Â£12bn for both the NHS and social care. We are still waiting for more detail on that, but it didn't come in the Budget. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent No. There are some changes that apply to all businesses, but there are some targeted ones too. Those ones -the 50% discount specifically- are aimed at those kind of sectors struggling to get back on their feet, such as hospitality and leisure. And no-one knows what is going to happen in the next few months, so there appears to be some caution from the Treasury in case those businesses get hit again. Kamala asks... Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent Not today, no. We have had some relief for businesses over the coming months but there wasn't very much in there for self-employed workers. We had that fiddling around last month with national insurance to finance the health and social care levy, but today, despite the length of the speech, nothing for the self-employed. A question from Stephen... Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent We do have some concrete details on that. As of next April, the National Living Wage - as it's now called - will go up by 6.6% if you're over 23. That takes it to Â£9.50 per hour. If you work full time, you might see an increase of around Â£1,000 per year. This announcement was actually made ahead of time,which we reported on here. A question from Alan... Helen CattPolitical Correspondent Some of the Budget is for the whole of the UK, some of it is just for England. There are some things that Westminster does for the whole of the UK, and some things the devolved administrations do for themselves. So, things like money for local councils will be England only - but then Scotland, Wales and NI will get a proportionate amount of money based on that announcement and they can decide what to do with it themselves. So the whole Budget is a bit of a mix and you have to look at polcies individually to see whether they are UK-wide or not. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent We've had a lot of questions on this theme. The answer is the bulk of it comes from us as taxpayers. We pay hundreds of billions of pounds in to the Treasury every year but they also need to top it up and they do. They can borrow from the financial markets and because they are the government they are much more reliable than the rest of us when it comes to paying back money so they can normally borrow at very low rates indeed. That's why they have been able to finance all that extra spending on pandemic help. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The price of a pint of beer will have to rise by as much as 30p to help pay for higher wages and energy costs, one pub company has warned. As the government prepares to unveil its Budget, City Pub Group said price rises were ""the only way forward"". On Monday, the government saidthe National Living Wage would riseto Â£9.50 per hour in April for those over 23 years old. Clive Watson, the chain's boss, said this would cost it about Â£1m a year. Other pub owners echoed Mr Watson's warning, with industry bodies calling for help for the sector. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer & Pub Association, said that while increases to the minimum wage and the minimum living rate would be ""welcomed"" by many staff in pubs, it was a further cost increase for pubs who were ""still struggling to recover and face an uncertain future"". ""It makes beer duty, business rates and VAT cuts in the Budget on Wednesday all the more important for the viability of our sector,"" she added. Wetherspoons, however, has announced it will cut drink prices next month on a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks. Becks bottles and whisky measures will be sold for 99p at some branches. Wetherspoons said prices will be reduced at all of its almost 900 pubs but the discounts will vary. In October, JD Wetherspoon reported a record annual loss after Covid lockdowns saw its pubs shut for 19 weeks. The firm was also recently affected by a shortage of some beer brands, caused by driver shortages due to a combination of Covid and Brexit. Chancellor Rishi Sunak's latest Budget, to be delivered later, comes as the pub trade is still recovering from lockdown measures imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. City Pub Group weathered the financial storm thanks to government assistance, putting 99% of its staff on furlough during the pandemic. ""That's basically kept the industry on life support, but we're coming off life support now and we need to be able to have a road to recovery,"" Mr Watson told the BBC. Last month, the group, which owns 45 pubs, reported that sales had been above 90% of pre-pandemic levels since Covid restrictions were eased in May. But now it faces further challenges - not just minimum wage rises, but also higher energy and food costs, as well as employers' national insurance contributions going up next April. The price of beer ""would probably have to go up by 25 to 30p a pint"" to take account of all that, Mr Watson said. ""We want to do our bit - it's very important, but at the same time we don't want everything going up the whole time, because all that will do is stoke inflation,"" he added. UK inflation isexpected to rise above 4%by the end of this year. Minimum wage for 23 year-olds to rise to Â£9.50 Premier Inn owner warns of staff shortages No VAT cut to household energy bills in Budget Inflation likely to hit 5%, warns Bank economist While Mr Watson said increases to the minimum wage were a ""good idea"", he warned that those increases could be ""gobbled up by other inflationary pressures"". He said a more effective measure would be for the government to cut VAT as a way of reducing the cost of living. The hospitality industry currently benefits froma reduced VAT rate of 12.5%,external, but that is due to revert to 20% in April. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the trade group UK Hospitality, said the VAT tax rise would be ""unsustainable"" and mean that businesses would have ""no option"" but to pass the cost on to customers. ""We are facing into considerable headwinds with a bubble of inflationary pressures coming through the supply chain, as well as wage rate inflation,"" she added. Martin Greenhow said wage increases would cost his business thousands Costs 'inevitably' passed on. Martin Greenhow, managing director at Mojo, a chain of six pubs in the north of England, said supply chain costs were ""certainly putting pressure"" on the business. ""If costs go up, prices go up, it's fairly inevitable,"" he said. All of the 89 staff the firm employs are currently on or above the National Living Wage. ""The coming increase will of course affect everyone, as those above it will also expect to see a pro-rata increment which will cost the business thousands,"" he explained. Mr Greenhow said that these staffing and supply costs would ""inevitably be passed on to the consumer"". ""Furlough and grants helped us survive, but essentially our survival was achieved by huge borrowings, which represent another cost to the business and therefore another inflationary driver."" The Cock in Ringmer is one of Ian Ridley's pubs Ian Ridley runs three pubs and the majority of his 50 staff earn the National Living Wage. ""Something's got to give, we cannot absorb these cost pressures,"" he explained. Although he has not worked through the cost projections for next year yet, Mr Ridley estimates the price of a pint could rise by 20p. ""When we're trying to encourage customers to come back and we're compete with supermarkets on booze, higher prices are not going to help us,"" he told the BBC. The wage increases will mean an estimated Â£20,000 of extra costs, in addition to higher food, transport and brewery bills. Rising energy costs are causing concern and Mr Ridley said the VAT hike in April and business tax rates were another ""huge worry"".

Minimum wage for 23 year-olds to rise to Â£9.50 Premier Inn owner warns of staff shortages No VAT cut to household energy bills in Budget Inflation likely to hit 5%, warns Bank economist While Mr Watson said increases to the minimum wage were a ""good idea"", he warned that those increases could be ""gobbled up by other inflationary pressures"". He said a more effective measure would be for the government to cut VAT as a way of reducing the cost of living. The hospitality industry currently benefits froma reduced VAT rate of 12.5%,external, but that is due to revert to 20% in April. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the trade group UK Hospitality, said the VAT tax rise would be ""unsustainable"" and mean that businesses would have ""no option"" but to pass the cost on to customers. ""We are facing into considerable headwinds with a bubble of inflationary pressures coming through the supply chain, as well as wage rate inflation,"" she added. Martin Greenhow said wage increases would cost his business thousands Costs 'inevitably' passed on. Martin Greenhow, managing director at Mojo, a chain of six pubs in the north of England, said supply chain costs were ""certainly putting pressure"" on the business. ""If costs go up, prices go up, it's fairly inevitable,"" he said. All of the 89 staff the firm employs are currently on or above the National Living Wage. ""The coming increase will of course affect everyone, as those above it will also expect to see a pro-rata increment which will cost the business thousands,"" he explained. Mr Greenhow said that these staffing and supply costs would ""inevitably be passed on to the consumer"". ""Furlough and grants helped us survive, but essentially our survival was achieved by huge borrowings, which represent another cost to the business and therefore another inflationary driver."" The Cock in Ringmer is one of Ian Ridley's pubs Ian Ridley runs three pubs and the majority of his 50 staff earn the National Living Wage. ""Something's got to give, we cannot absorb these cost pressures,"" he explained. Although he has not worked through the cost projections for next year yet, Mr Ridley estimates the price of a pint could rise by 20p. ""When we're trying to encourage customers to come back and we're compete with supermarkets on booze, higher prices are not going to help us,"" he told the BBC. The wage increases will mean an estimated Â£20,000 of extra costs, in addition to higher food, transport and brewery bills. Rising energy costs are causing concern and Mr Ridley said the VAT hike in April and business tax rates were another ""huge worry"".

"This video can not be played Rising costs resulting in ""nerve-racking"" times for families on a budget Businesses in Wales have called for help from the chancellor to address rising costs and staff shortages. Chancellor Rishi Sunakwill deliver the UK government's autumn budgeton Wednesday. Bangor University economist Dr Edward Thomas Jones said Mr Sunak faced a ""difficult and interesting"" situation. Tregroes Waffles wants action to address rising energy costs, which is making ingredients more expensive. At the bakery in Llandysul, Ceredigion, the production line for Tregroes Waffles is delivering about 36,000 waffles a day. Families must choose food or fuel in benefits cut What is the Budget and how does it affect me? A simple guide to Budget 2021 The snack has been produced in the Teifi valley since 1983, originally at the founder's home in Tregroes and later at an industrial unit in Llandysul. Sales have increased by 50% compared with last year, when the pandemic badly affected orders. But interest in the product is also about 20% higher than pre-pandemic sales, with the snack's popularity among hamper providers contributing to its growth. Rhys Jones from Tregroes Waffles asked for rising ingredient costs to be subsidised Rhys Jones, Tregroes Waffles sales manager, said: ""There is a lot more appetite among customers in Wales and around the UK who are looking for snacking confectionary items, like our product. ""And the retailers, the larger supermarkets, are buying a lot of waffles compared to what they used to."" Meanwhile the rising cost of energy, already being felt by households, is also hitting businesses and driving up their costs. Eventually, those business costs must be absorbed or passed on to the customer. The situation has led Tregroes Waffles to ask the UK government to address the issue as part of its autumn Budget. Mr Jones said: ""Ingredient costs have been really, really high, so perhaps there is some way they could assist us in subsidising ingredient costs? The cost of ingredients has been rising at Tregroes Waffles ""We use ingredients such as cinnamon, such as glucose or sugar, and the prices have gone sky-high mainly due to the rising cost of energy which it is taking to produce that product. ""So if we are talking about the big difficulties that we could have help with, we are talking about the cost of ingredients and staffing. ""Some way that we could get help to get more reliable staffing in place and consistent pricing of ingredients - that would be a big help for us, and for us to trade competitively."" Lauren Morse said a lot of small businesses were ""teetering on the edge"" Mother-of-two Lauren Morse, from Cwmbran, opened her own shop - Zero Waste Torfaen - last month. But rising costs have made the self-confessed ""money worrier"" anxious. ""It's worrying because as a small business you can't absorb it all and I've already found that because I've been so busy there's already a few things I've been selling for less than I paid for them because I hadn't noticed they'd gone up on the invoices,"" she said. ""Prices are going up all the time and I can absorb some price increases but it gets to a point where you've got to change the prices on the labels and that's obviously affecting people's pockets long-term and it's affecting families. ""I'm really passionate about this being affordable for people which means it's small margins and at the end of the day things will get passed on to customers and all our pockets."" Some details have already been revealed, including the decisionto increase the national living wage to Â£9.50 an hour. It follows the independent recommendation of the Low Pay Commission, and will mean wage increases at hospitality businesses such as the Wynnstay, a 24-bed hotel and restaurant in Machynlleth, Powys. While the Wynnstay was already planning to increase wages, owner Charles Dark is cynical about the broader impact of increasing minimum pay across the board. ""This is the sort of classic cop-out by the government 'oh yeah, we will increase the minimum wage, we are helping people get more money'. ""Yes, butthey are taking it away in National Insuranceand prices are going to go up. ""The simple fact is that in hospitality, the wage bill is the biggest single cost that the business has. And business has to be sustainable. If you can't pay the wages you have to let people go, and the business will go under."" Mr Dark said his business would be able to absorb the cost of increasing the minimum wage, but added: ""I think in the wider term it is going to have a big impact on some businesses which are a little bit tighter - particularly those who may be renting from pub companies, where the costs are so very difficult."" Bangor University economist Dr Edward Thomas Jones said the benefit felt from increased wages may be lost by the increased cost of living. ""Unfortunately, what the chancellor wants to have is an economy with rising wages. However, what he is getting is an economy with rising prices,"" he said. ""So if wages aren't rising at the same rate as prices because of inflation, then people will feel that they are having a pay cut because they're not able to buy as much goods as they were before."" Dr Jones said the Budget came when the UK was in a ""difficult and interesting economic situation"", particularly as inflation continues to affect people and businesses. ""Costs are rising, so whatever money the chancellor thought he had to spend, that is now going to buy less.""

"The government says it will force water companies to make a ""progressive reduction"" in the sewage it dumps in rivers, amid pressure from the Lords. Peers proposed a change to the Environment Bill last week in an attempt to cut the pollution, but it did not win enough support from MPs. It led to a backlash on social media, and Lords promising to try again. But Environment Secretary George Eustice has now promised to bolster measures by making them a legal duty. He said the government already had plans in place to require water companies to act on sewage, but added: ""We've listened to the debate in Parliament [and] we will write what was already government policy into [law] to give people the reassurance they seek."" Tory MPs defend votes after uproar over sewage plan Sewage discharged into rivers 400,000 times What's in the government's new environment bill? The crossbench peer who put forward the Lords amendment, the Duke of Wellington, said he met Mr Eustice earlier on Tuesday ahead of a debate in Parliament on the Environment Bill. Speaking in the Lords, he said was ""grateful for the gesture"", but he had yet to form an opinion on the language of the government's proposal, so would be pushing ahead with his own plan to end the ""revolting practice"". The duke's amendment passed in the Lords by 213 votes to 60, and will now be debated by MPs at a later date. However, due to parliamentary rules, his amendment would have to be approved by the Lords anyway to allow the government to replace it with its own plan when the bill returns to the Commons. The environmental issue has come to a head days before the start ofthe COP26 climate summit, being hosted by the UK in Glasgow. The Environment Agency allows water utilities to release sewage into rivers and streams after extreme weather events, such as prolonged heavy rain. This protects properties from flooding and prevents sewage from backing up into streets and homes. But according to the public body's own figures, water companies discharged raw sewage into rivers in England more than 400,000 times last year, with untreated effluent - including human waste, wet wipes and condoms - released into waterways for more than three million hours in 2020. The Lords agreed an amendment to the Environment Bill that would put a legal duty on water companies and the government to demonstrate progressive reductions in discharges of untreated sewage and required them to ""take all reasonable steps"" to avoid using combined sewer overflows. But when the proposal was voted on by MPs last week, it lost by 265 votes to 202 - even with 22 Tories rebelling against the government to vote in favour of the plan. The government had said the amount of sewage discharged by water companies was ""not acceptable"" and that it had made it ""crystal clear"" to firms that significant reductions must be a priority. But a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the intentions of the Lords' amendment, which it said would involve an overhaul of the UK's Victorian sewerage system - would cost upwards of Â£150bn. ""That would mean that individuals - every one of us as taxpayers - paying potentially thousands of pounds each as a result,"" they added. Shortly before the issue was brought up again for debate in the Lords, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs proposed its own amendment for when the bill returns to the Commons. The new legal duty would be placed directly on water companies to make a ""progressive reduction"" in the sewage it dumps into rivers. It follows on from advice it gave the industry's financial regulator, Ofwat, earlier this year, saying water companies must take steps to significantly reduce storm overflows and that the regulator should ensure funding should be approved for them to do so. And the firms would need to produce ""comprehensive statutory Drainage and Sewerage Management Plans, setting out how they will manage and develop their drainage and sewerage system over a minimum 25-year planning horizon - including how storm overflows will be addressed"". A number of peers welcomed the move by the government, but some warned it still may not go far enough, with Labour's Baroness Quin saying she hoped the government would move even further now people across the country were ""waking up to the problem"". Labour's shadow environment secretary, Luke Pollard, also said the ""screeching u-turn"" on the issue due to the public backlash would ""do little to convince the public that the health of our rivers, rather than the health of Conservative polling, is at the forefront of ministers' minds"". He added: ""The government still has no clear plan and no grip on the issue of raw sewage being pumped into our seas and rivers.""

"Rob McElhenney and Ryan Reynolds arrive at Maidenhead's York Road ground Wrexham's Hollywood co-owner Ryan Reynolds described football as a ""soul-deadening"", ""evil"" and ""gorgeous"" game after watching his club in action for the first timeat Maidenhead. Reynolds and fellow actor Rob McElhenney completed their takeover of the club in February. The pair made their much-awaited first appearance at a Wrexham game at Maidenhead United's York Road. They watched on as 10-man Wrexham lost 3-2 after fighting back from 2-0. The actors were accompanied by a crew filming an access-all-areas documentary, Welcome to Wrexham. Despite the result Deadpool star Reynolds seemed to enjoy his first taste of British football as heshared pictures from the National league game on his Instagram,external. He wrote: ""Football is a staggering, heartbreaking, gorgeous, tommy-gun of soul-deadening, evil and beauty and I'm never sleeping again ever, ever."" Up until now Reynolds and McElhenney, both based in the US, had been restricted to watching Wrexham matches on streams due to filming commitments and the pandemic. But the actors attended a first game that had plenty of drama, with Wrexham falling behind to two goals after 22 minutes before having a player sent off. Wrexham fought back to level at 2-2 before Maidenhead's Josh Kelly scored a goal that ensured there would be no fairytale ending on this occasion, with the home side winning 3-2. Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson had been told beforehand that the club's co-owners would be present but neither he nor the players met with the pair ahead of the game. ""They flew in and they were trying to keep a low profile but I imagine it's fairly difficult to be low profile and they let us get on with it,"" Parkinson said. ""We look forward to meeting them later in the week. ""I'm really disappointed for them that we haven't been able to come away with at least a draw. But that's football. It can be a brutal industry."" Wrexham fan Andy Gilpin said he was ""gobsmacked"" to see the Hollywood owners in the stands and that their appearance had given the fans ""a boost"". ""There's media hype and then there's showing up at Maidenhead away which isn't the sort of Hollywood entrance really, it's a very low-key ground, and to see two Hollywood stars there in the middle of the home stand, we were just gobsmacked, you know,"" he said. ""It's quite a statement to come here to Maidenhead away and fair play to them for doing that."" Free Guy star Reynolds and It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia creator McElhenney revealed their interest in buying the north Wales club, the third oldest professional club in the world, in September 2020. Wrexham Supporters' Trust members voted overwhelmingly to back the takeover two months later after the pair made an online presentation to fans. The club had been under fan ownership since 2011 following a difficult decade which saw them enter administration and lose their place in the Football League in 2008. Wrexham manager Phil Parkinson has said Reynolds and McElhenneyrecognise the ""huge potential""of the club. Reynolds and McElhenney invested an immediate Â£2m in Wrexham after completing their takeover, with their ambition reflected by a number of notable signings - plus the appointment of Parkinson - over the last few months. Reynolds stated in November 2020 that the aim was to turn Wrexham into a ""global force"".

"Firefighters, pictured at a Grenfell anniversary event, say building owners must plan for evacuations There was an ""unjustified reliance"" on firefighters to evacuate Grenfell Tower on the night of the fatal fire, a union has told the inquiry into the disaster. The Fire Brigades Union said building owners and managers should draw up evacuation plans to prevent future catastrophes. Union lawyer Martin Seaward said there was a ""near total failure"" of fire safety measures at Grenfell Tower. The June 2017 disaster at the west London tower block killed 72 people. The comments came on the final day of closing statements in a section of the inquiry focusing on the fire safety measures in the building, its management, risk assessment and the communication with residents. Mr Seaward criticised the approach to fire safety taken by the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO). He told the inquiry on Tuesday the ""hazardous rainscreen cladding system"" should have been identified as a risk and removed by April 2016. ""Additionally, the near total failure of all the active and passive fire safety measures allowed the rapid deterioration of conditions inside the tower, which grossly impeded the firefighters' operations, including search and rescue,"" Mr Seaward said. The fire in Grenfell Tower broke out in June 2017, killing 72 people Mr Seaward added if the fire risk management system from the tenant management organisation had worked ""most, if not all"" of the people who died would have been saved. The lawyer argued to the inquiry the safety plans were characterised by an ""unjustified reliance"" on the London Fire Brigade to evacuate residents, ""including those especially at risk in the event of fire in Grenfell tower"". Mr Seaward said: ""Of course, the fire and rescue service will attend and do its best at any fire or other emergency, but fire safety depends on everyone doing their bit. ""That very much includes responsible persons developing and practising building-specific evacuation plans for residents, including personal emergency evacuation plans for those especially at risk, in the same way that employers do in office blocks or factories."" Anne Studd QC, representing London Mayor Sadiq Khan, told the inquiry the tenant management organisation did ""very little"" to see if Grenfell was suitable for the stay put strategy in its fire assessments and Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council (RBKC) had limited oversight of them. ""The evidence before you, Mr Chairman, has demonstrated a culture of failings in transparency and candour by the KCTMO, which, coupled with a lack of intrusion from RBKC, was a toxic combination,"" she said. James Maxwell-Scott QC, representing the council, told the inquiry it ""apologised unreservedly"" again for council failings before the disaster. The failings included the number of council officers devoted to monitoring the KCTMO being ""insufficient"" and its housing commissioning team not making enough use of the corporate health and safety team's expertise to ""prevent issues falling between the gaps,"" he said. The lawyer added the KCTMO was an independent, managing agent of Grenfell Tower which was at an ""arm's length"" from the council, which was the building's landlord. ""The council fully admits that it retained some control over the tower, and therefore continued to have some responsibilities for it under the Fire Safety Order. But those responsibilities are better described as residual ones than shared primary ones,"" he told the inquiry.
