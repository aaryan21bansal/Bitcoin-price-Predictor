"PC Keith Palmer was unarmed as he was attacked by Khalid Masood The family of PC Keith Palmer have raised concerns about the lack of armed protection at the gates of Parliament during last year's Westminster attack. His widow's lawyer told an inquest into the victims' deaths that he had just ""a spray and a baton"" to protect himself. Khalid Masood killed the unarmed officer after driving into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge on 22 March 2017. Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, were also killed. Masood was shot dead by armed officers during the attack. A police officer told the inquest that the procedure of having armed officers on the gate had been changed to having roving patrols around the area instead. This meant unarmed officers would be ""left as a matter of routine unprotected"", lawyer Dominic Adamson, representing PC Palmer's widow, Michelle, said. ""[This means that in] an attack such as the one that occurred an officer would be left with a spray and a baton against a large man with two knives. It is not an equal fight,"" he added. Westminster attack: What happened Victims of the Westminster terror attack Tears as partner watches bridge attack CCTV The inquest, taking place at the Old Bailey in London, was shown ""distressing"" and ""vivid"" footage of the moment PC Palmer was stabbed in New Palace Yard, as well as a ""chilling"" image of Masood with a carving knife in each hand. The footage showed the attacker being momentarily distracted by other officers, allowing PC Palmer time to run further into the yard. Masood followed, but within moments, plainclothes armed officers shot and killed him. The court was also shown mobile phone footage of people rushing to offer first aid. PC Doug Glaze, an unarmed officer posted on the gates, was asked whether a chance to save PC Palmer's life had been ""lost"" because no firearms officers were present at the gate. ""Certainly had firearms officers been there the threat maybe could have been neutralised quicker,"" PC Glaze said. A single red rose was placed in front of PC Palmer's helmet in Westminster ahead of his funeral Two of PC Palmer's sisters, Angela Clark and Michelle Palmer, also raised concerns that there had not been armed officers around to protect their brother on the day of the attack. Their lawyer, Susannah Stevens, said they were ""extremely distressed"" that nobody from the Metropolitan Police had spoken to them to let them know there was ""any issue"" around the absence of armed officers. She added that, if armed officers had been stationed at the gates, then PC Palmer and his colleagues would have been able ""to retreat"", instead of being left ""utterly helpless"". Nicholas Moss, counsel for the Parliamentary Authorities, said: ""PC Palmer's death resulted from Masood's evil actions, full stop."" He added that any questions of ""missed opportunities or steps that could have been taken"" would be properly explored. The inquest also heard from witnesses to the attack, including Carl Knight, who saw events unfold from the top deck of a bus. In his statement read to the court, Mr Knight said he heard a ""loud bang"" that sounded like a ""small explosion"" or a ""backfiring car"", as Masood's vehicle crashed into the railings outside Parliament. The witness saw a pedestrian approach him to ask what was happening, but Masood replied by swearing at him, revealing the knives, and saying: ""You don't want to mess with me."" Mr Knight said: ""As soon as the knives went up it went from car accident to attack."" By Helena Lee, BBC News correspondent A photograph of PC Palmer standing next to a smiling American tourist was put up on screens as the inquest began evidence relating to his death. It served as a reminder of the man described as the ""public face of Parliament"". The court was then taken back to that horrific day in March last year, as harrowing images and footage played out of PC Palmer being attacked. The frantic and desperate voices of those who tried to save him filled the hushed courtroom. They went on and on - the screaming, the panic, the horror. Witnesses came and went, telling their stories of what they remember from that day. For them reliving what they saw can't have been easy. Mr Knight said he saw pedestrians running away from Masood, including a woman hugging her child and saying: ""Don't kill me."" ""I could hear screaming coming from downstairs [on the bus] and women's voices shouting, 'Drive,' and, 'Let me off the bus,'"" he said in his statement. Antonia Kerridge, who was working in Portcullis House - where many MPs have their offices and which overlooks Parliament - told the court that she assumed there was some kind of demonstration when she heard a crash and the sound of cheering. But, after looking through the window, she said: ""I realised the cheering sound was people screaming."" Mr Knight saw Masood break into a run to the entrance to Parliament, saying: ""It was as if there were no guards on the gate."" He described a struggle between Masood and PC Palmer, saying: ""They were both grabbing each other and tumbling to the floor."" He said Masood ""seemed to get the better of the officer"". PC Doug Glaze said he thought at the time it was a ""Mumbai-style attack"" and shouted for ""firearms"". He told the court: ""I saw who I now know to be Masood inside the grounds. ""I noticed two extremely large knives, one in each hand. He was walking like a robot with his arms going up and down."" Asked about his reaction, PC Glaze added: ""I remember thinking 'We're going to die.'""

"West Sussex County Council said it was trying to find alternative accommodation for residents Patients at a care home were told to ""leave immediately"" after a health watchdog took urgent enforcement action, the BBC has learned. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said it had made the decision to shut Horncastle House, near East Grinstead, after three separate inspections. But relatives said they were not given a reason for the sudden closure. A spokesman for the home said it ""does not accept the allegations that led to the closure"". All residents were found replacement accommodation, West Sussex County Council said. One relative described the situation as ""total chaos"" and ""an unbelievable situation"". Tim Leader, whose father-in-law is cared for at the private home, said: ""There are loved ones there now crying not knowing what to do."" ""How can the Care Quality Commission make this decision without first ensuring adequate provision has been made for the current residents? ""It's just so sad that vulnerable people like this are being treated so badly."" He added: ""You'd expect a care home to be just that, a caring environment for those that need it. It seems that in this case at least, we are a long way from achieving that goal."" Residents' families said patients were not told why the care home was closing The spokesman for Horncastle House, which can take up to 43 patients, confirmed it was being closed by the CQC. He said: ""We do not accept the allegations that have led to the closure and believe that the additional measures our senior management team swiftly put in place would have enabled us to continue to provide high quality care to our residents. ""We have been working constructively with the local authority and CCG throughout the day and have secured alternative accommodation for all our residents, ensuring they continue to receive the support they deserve."" In a statement Debbie Ivanova, CQC deputy chief inspector of adult social care, said the home had been inspected in March and August of this year and again on 13 September. ""Following this recent inspection, CQC has taken urgent enforcement action to protect people living in the service and to ensure significant and immediate improvements take place,"" she added. A West Sussex County Council spokesperson said it was working with families, CQC and other agencies to find alternative accommodation for residents. The CQC said a full report would be published in due course.

"Matteo Salvini, right, said he supported the proposal by Herbert Kickl The right-wing interior ministers of Austria and Italy have called on the EU to hold rescued migrants at sea until their asylum claims are processed. Austria's Herbert Kickl put forward the idea at an EU migration conference in Vienna and his Italian counterpart, Matteo Salvini, supported it. Hundreds of thousands of migrants try to reach the EU in risky sea crossings. Mr Kickl said ships would use a ""quick way"" to clarify who was entitled to asylum but he did not give details. Mr Salvini is under investigation in Italy for refusing to let rescued migrants disembark in Italy last month. Prosecutors in Sicily have opened an inquiry into possible illegal confinement, illegal arrest and abuse of power. Rice ball protest in Italian migrant boat row Matteo Salvini: Can Italy trust this man? Who is responsible for helping out at sea? Outlining his plan at a joint news conference with Mr Salvini on Friday Mr Kickl said that after ""appropriate checks"" on board ship, those migrants entitled to asylum could be brought to the EU while the rest would be taken to ""safe ports"" in third countries. ""You are well looked after on a ship,"" Mr Kickl said, adding that the system would help solve the ""problem of repatriation"". ""Once people have set foot on the continent, you can only remove them with great difficulty and much expense,"" he told reporters. He said EU asylum policy should aim to make it ""impossible to claim asylum except from outside the EU, and that claims be decided outside the EU"". Thousands of migrants rescued at sea are brought to Italian ports Mr Salvini said he was absolutely in favour of the plan. Italy is one of the main entry points for migrants making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean with the hope of a new life in the EU. However, the Austrian office of the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) condemned the idea. ""This proposal is simply another attempt to distract attention from the real issue, namely the inability of Europe and of Austria's EU presidency to find a sustainable solution to the humanitarian crisis in the central Mediterranean and Libya,"" the group said in a statement. Migration to Europe in charts Migration to the EU can be ""managed"" It urged EU leaders to ""put the protection of human life at the centre of their efforts"". Since 2014, more than 640,000 migrants have landed on Italy's shores. Although many have since left for other countries, some remain. The UN says that more than 1,600 people have lost their lives trying to cross into Europe in 2018, despite overall numbers being down. In July, 450 migrants were allowed to disembark in Sicily once France, Germany, Malta, Portugal and Spain had agreed to take 50 migrants each. Can Italy's populist leader return to power?

"A court sketch showed Paul Manafort, seated, with his attorney Richard Westling Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has agreed to co-operate with an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the US election as part of a plea deal. In court on Friday, he pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in the deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The agreement avoids a second trial on money laundering and other charges. The White House insists the guilty plea has absolutely nothing to do with President Donald Trump. Manafort was convicted last monthon eight counts of fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose bank accounts. That was the first criminal trial arising from the justice department's investigation into alleged interference by Russia in the 2016 election. Winners and losers from Manafort's plea deal Who is Trump's former campaign chair? However, the charges only relate to Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign. In an appearance at a federal court in Washington DC, Manafort - who is being held in custody - pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice. Correspondents say he faces up to 10 years in prison under the deal and will also forfeit four of his properties and the contents of several bank accounts. Deadlocked charges from the previous trial will be dismissed if there is ""successful co-operation"" with the special counsel. A lawyer for Manafort, Kevin Downing, told reporters outside the court that his client ""wanted to make sure that his family was able to remain safe and live a good life"". A bystander made his point as defence lawyer Kevin Downing addressed the media Manafort, 69, worked for Mr Trump's presidential campaign for five months in 2016 and was in charge when Mr Trump clinched the Republican party nomination. In a statement, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Friday: ""This had absolutely nothing to do with the president or his victorious 2016 presidential campaign. It is totally unrelated."" What did we learn from Manafort trial? Manafort: The man who helped Trump win President Trump has branded the Mueller investigation a ""witch hunt"" and insisted there was no collusion between his team and Russia. The Kremlin has also repeatedly denied any meddling. The charges in the planned second trial were to include money laundering, conspiring to defraud the US, witness tampering and failing to register as a foreign agent. Jury selection had been due to start on Monday. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington In a year filled with blockbuster Friday news stories, the announcement that Paul Manafort is co-operating with Robert Mueller's investigation is one of the biggest. Although the White House downplays his importance to the campaign, Mr Manafort had top perch in the Trump team for key months in 2016. For instance, he was in the June Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and Russian nationals that was originally billed as a chance to obtain damaging information Russia had on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. He took cryptic notes about that meeting that he now might be willing to discuss. After his August conviction on financial and tax fraud charges in Virginia, the prospect of Mr Manafort's walking away from his legal headaches a free man had been eliminated. It appears that the reality of additional legal expenses and possibly more prison time finally pushed the long-time Washington lobbyist to make a deal. This is probably exactly what the special counsel team had hoped for. Now the president, who tweeted last month that Mr Manafort was a ""brave man"" who ""refused to break and make up stories in order to get a deal"", is left to wonder what comes next. Manafort was charged by Mr Mueller last October. At trial, he was accused of using 31 foreign bank accounts in three different countries to evade taxes on millions of dollars. Prosecutors presented evidence of Manafort's luxurious lifestyle, saying it was only possible because of his bank and tax fraud. Following last month's conviction, President Trump praised his former campaign chairman for refusing to ""break"" under legal pressure. He tweeted he felt ""very badly"" for Manafort and lauded him for declining to ""make up stories"" to get a deal.

"The g-force pushed blood into Tyler's head which caused him to pass out, his mum said An 11-year-old boy could have died while attempting to recreate a ""stupid"" YouTube stunt, his mum has said. Tyler Broome passed out while being spun at high speed on a park roundabout using the back wheel of a moped. His mother Dawn Hollingworth said doctors told her his injuries were usually seen in fighter pilots suffering the effects of g-force. She warned others not to copy the ""silly prank"", which could have had ""life-changing consequences"" for Tyler. The schoolboy was with a group of older children at the park in Tuxford, Nottinghamshire, when he suggested they imitate the stunt, which features in hundreds of videos shared online. A video released by Ms Hollingworth, 51, shows him spread-eagled across the top of the roundabout as it spins around. At the end of the recording, he appears to fall down, his head flopping forward as the equipment comes to a stop. Blood rushed to the youngster's head, causing swelling and bruising to his face, Ms Hollingworth said. ""The clips I have seen, everybody gets chucked off,"" she said. ""In Tyler's case he passed out from the g-force. ""His vision is all blurred and his eyes are red, filled with blood,"" she said. ""He got off, he was sick and dropped to his knees and passed out again on the field."" The teenagers Tyler was with left him alone in the park when he became unwell. But he was helped by another boy who was passing by, his mum said. ""The doctors said if he was not fit and healthy he could have quite easily had a stroke and died."" Ms Hollingworth said she wanted to raise awareness of the dangers of the stunt . ""Tyler is aware he has done wrong and his injuries are caused by his own stupidity. ""But once he was unconscious he was unable to consent but they carried on and left him."" Tyler was left with facial bruising but the consequences could have been far worse, doctors said Doctors likened Tyler's injuries to those sustained by fighter pilots when they are not wearing an oxygen mask, Ms Hollingworth said. Medics asked for her consent to write a medical paper, as they had never seen a case like it, she said. Nottinghamshire Police has appealed for witnesses, or anyone else with video of Wednesday's incident, to come forward. The force said Tyler sustained serious head injuries and remained in hospital in a serious but stable condition.

"British law enforcement officers fighting money laundering are being frustrated by a lack of co-operation by the authorities in the Cayman Islands. The National Crime Agency said it was ""asking for information we don't get"". It says it has also significantly stepped up efforts to seize dirty Russian money coming into the UK. It has also launched investigations into British-based lawyers and accountants suspected of facilitating money laundering. The NCA leads the UK fight against money laundering and criminal money, which it estimates could be worth up to Â£1bn a day. Cayman Islands profile What are Britain's overseas territories? Oligarchs in UK told to explain wealth Ministers back down on tax haven registers A number of its investigations have led it to offshore firms registered in the Cayman Islands, which is a British Overseas Territory in the Caribbean and one of the world's largest financial centres. Donald Toon, director of the NCA, revealed the Cayman Islands authorities had not co-operated when he had asked for information on who owned these firms. He said that usually when his officers asked British Overseas Territories for help ""we can generally get from them clear, unambiguous beneficial ownership information but we are having a difficulty with Cayman"". ""The Cayman government is entirely aware of the UK concerns,"" he said. In recent years the spotlight has been on tax havens linked to the UK following a series of global investigations involving nearly 100 media organisations, including the BBC. The Paradise Papersexposed how wealthy and corrupt individuals used complex offshore structures to cover their tracks. The NCA said there were now signs that criminals were finding new tax havens where they could exploit lax regulation and hide their links to corrupt assets. These were jurisdictions ""well beyond the British Overseas Territories"". Mr Toon called them ""small island nations"" where ""people are able to register companies but are much more difficult to penetrate in terms of getting access to the information"" on beneficial owners. He did not say where. This video can not be played London is home to corrupt individuals buying assets to hide their illicit wealth. Mr Toon also said the NCA had significantly stepped up its work to identify and seize corrupt Russian assets in the UK - but it was yet to use new powers, known asUnexplained Wealth Orders,against them. Unexplained Wealth Orders, which came into force on 31 January, force wealthy people to explain the source of their assets if there is reason to suspect corruption. ""This is not quick work,"" Mr Toon explained, because rich criminals are experts at hiding their ownership of corrupt assets. He revealed there were ""a couple of dozen"" active investigations into lawyers and accountants suspected of facilitating the flow of dirty money into the UK which he described as the ""lifeblood of nearly all organised crime"". Asked if he was concerned that dirty money was being used to fund the private education of the children of corrupt oligarchs, Mr Toon said those private schools with charitable status have to carry out due diligence. However, he said they rarely issue alerts to law enforcement. What can be done about London's dirty money? Video, 00:03:31What can be done about London's dirty money?

"This video can not be played Super typhoon reaches the Philippines The world's strongest storm this year, Super Typhoon Mangkhut, is blasting the northern coast of the Philippines with strong winds and heavy rain. Reports say it broke windows and downed power lines on the island of Luzon before dawn. More than four million people are directly in the path of the storm, which has winds of 200km/h (125 mph) and gusts reaching up to 330km/h. Thousands have been evacuated amid warnings of 6m (20ft) storm surges. Officials have warned of there may be ""very heavy damage"" to vulnerable structures. They have raised alert levels to the second-highest - signal four - in Cagayan, northern Isabela, Apayao and Abra provinces. The deadliest storm on record in the Philippines was Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, which also sparked category four alerts. In pictures: Philippines braces for super typhoon How to survive a monster storm Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? It killed more than 7,000 people and affected millions.

Hong Kong authorities have warned urged residents to stay indoors when the storm approaches. The typhoon is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by Tuesday. Warnings have been issued in dozens of provinces, and sea and air travel has been restricted. Flights have been cancelled, schools shut and the army is on standby.

A guide to the world's deadliest storms How windy is a hurricane? Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? ""We are really frightened,"" Delaila Pasion, who had fled her home, told AFP news agency. ""They say it is so strong, we were too scared to remain."" ""During previous monsoon rains, half of our house was destroyed so I wanted to take my grandchildren to safety,"" she told journalists. The Philippines is routinely hit during the typhoon season. In China, where the storm is predicted to hit late on Sunday or early on Monday, the authorities have raised storm alerts to ""yellow"", which is the second level on the four-tier warning system. High-speed rail services have been cancelled in parts of the south, local media report. The relationship between climate change and tropical storms is a complex one. Officials are preparing food and supplies for affected residents Typhoons and hurricanes form when air, heated by warm sea water, rises quickly. As the air cools down again it is pushed aside by more warm air rising below it - causing strong winds and whipping up waves. So as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future. A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas. But there are so many factors that contribute to these events, it has been difficult to tease out clear trends from the data. Howard Johnson, BBC News, Arparri, Luzon Thousands of people are being evacuated and placed inside shelters like these Residents of this small, low-rise town say they've been through this before, they've seen other storms. Farmers are working around the clock to harvest their rice paddies. They say the rice is still not ripe, but want to salvage what they can before this storm potentially devastates their fields. Authorities have told people to move on. Some cars are leaving the area, bedding on the roof - but some people say they want to stay inside their homes to prevent thieves entering. People seem to be very relaxed with the idea that a super typhoon is coming their way.

"Anton Brugger stands in his cactus nursery in Almeria, southern Spain The iconic cactus plant is veering into trouble say researchers. The most serious problem is illegal smuggling. Despite the international ban on uncontrolled trade in cacti, policing the smuggling faces many problems and semi-professional hunters continue to uproot plants to order, stealing from National Parks, Indian Reservations, but more significantly from the wild. In southern Spain, the plants are being devastated by the cochineal beetle. But the picture there is mirrored across other regions of the world. As Anton Brugger strides purposefully around his plantation set on the side of a steep hill in Almeria, southern Spain, he casts his gaze over the more than 10,000 cacti artfully arranged in terraces over two hectares. ""When visitors come here and see the really huge cacti such as Madagascar'sAlluaudia procera, which grows to about 10m (33 feet), they are inspired to buy small versions in the nursery,"" explains the Austrian cactus afficionado. ""We tell them about the plight of the cactus in many parts of the world and they are astonished."" Their astonishment stems from the perceived hardy nature of the cactus able to withstand heat, drought and poor soil. But the Iberian peninsula's emblematic prickly pear is absent from Brugger's nursery. The cochineal beetle has devastated cacti in southern Spain The plant that typifies the traditional Spanish landscape is nowhere to be seen in Andalucia, devastated, Anton Brugger says, by a pest - the cochineal beetle. Although cacti are native to the Americas (apart from one species that also grows in Sri Lanka, and parts of Africa from the Ivory Coast to Ethiopia) new plants can be grown from off-shoots. So while the localised loss of this species doesn't spell the end of this iconic cactus species, it is part of a more worrying trend, according to South African-born Paul Rees, who is in charge of the tropical nursery at the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew. Cacti come in a wide variety of forms He says that many of the approximately 2,000 identified Cactaceae species have a very restricted range which make them vulnerable. ""Cactaceae are considered one of the most threatened plant groups in the world,"" he explains. ""Over 30% are considered critically endangered or vulnerable,"" he adds. To put this in perspective approximately 25% of mammals are endangered.  But with rising temperatures cacti are forced to withstand ever longer periods of drought. ""Cacti are being subjected to ever hotter weather. Some species can handle longer periods of drought and higher temperatures better than others,"" he continues. ""And the drier habitats become and the less water there is available, the harder it becomes for plants, which are already surviving in extreme conditions, to survive."" The IUCN, International Union for the Conservation of Nature, has categorised Cacti as belonging to two groups. These are listed in the two Appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES), with the most threatened appearing in Appendix I. However hunters continue to seek them out, especially in wild settings. Peyote plants are feeding the market for psychotropic drugs According to wildlife conservationists in the United States, cacti are being dug up at an ever accelerating rate for zealous collectors looking for niche species. Additionally narco-tourists are mining desert regions for small, psychotropic peyote plants and so feeding the market for mind-altering drugs. Cacti now rank just below drugs and guns as the most popular goods smuggled out of Mexico, according to conservationists. Alex Monro, who is research leader in the America's team at Kew, says that with teams working with the Royal Botanic Garden in remote areas and identifying new cactus species are very cautious not to reveal the the geographic location of newly identified cacti species. ""If we have material only known from a particular locality we know that there will be interest in that species from collectors,"" he says. ""If you look on our website you'll see that for those cacti you won't get any geographical information as to where those specimens have come from."" Back in Almeria, the backdrop to the spaghetti Westerns, Anton is pleased with the steady growth of the semi circle ofAlluaudia procera. With just a hint of irony he says:  ""I hope they will make people feel like dwarfs.""

"Michael Nascimento spent some of the proceeds on a trip to Thorpe Park A ""boiler room"" fraud ringleader has been sentenced to a total of 13 years in jail after being found guilty of conspiring with five others to con 170 investors out of Â£2.8m. Michael Nascimento ran a call centre where investors were told their money would go into shares in businesses such as a property development in Madeira. Instead he spent it on Arsenal tickets, school fees and a trip to Thorpe Park. One victim was conned while coping with depression while her mother had cancer. How to scam millions from 170 people Nascimento, a former boxer, was convicted of this boiler fraud along with five others: Charanjit Sandhu, Hugh Edwards, Stuart Rea and Jeannine Lewis, who last week received sentences of between two-and-a-half and five-and-a-half years. Another, Ryan Parker, was given a two-year suspended sentence. According to investigators at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the victim whose mother was struggling with cancer was befriended by the ""salesman"" of this boiler room fraud, Charanjit Sandhu. She was conned into parting with Â£16,000, her life savings. Then she felt ""bullied"" into taking out an overdraft to hand over a further Â£2,500. CCTV footage of the group's activities - and part of its cash pile - was seen by the FCA Another, a sophisticated financial services professional, invested Â£922,795. He had been asked to fly to Madeira to see the land owned by the companies and was shown around by the ringleader of the fraud, Michael Nascimento. Nascimento had arranged to be called by friends frequently during the visit in order to appear to be a well-known business man in Madeira. What he didn't let on was that the beautiful coastal land he was showing was far from the rough hillside plot with no planning permission that his companies had actually purchased. On an unannounced visit in March 2014, FCA investigators discovered the boiler room companies occupied more than one office. They later discovered CCTV footage that suggested that, while they were there, Nascimento's personal assistant, Jeannine Lewis, was trying to hide a company computer in a ceiling panel. She told investigators it was part of a ""clear-desk policy"". Compared to the relative ease with which such scams can be set up, bringing them to justice is hard. The FCA says it is the second-biggest criminal prosecution it has undertaken, involving four million documents, 142 witnesses, analysis of 65 UK bank accounts and five years of investigators' time. It cost Â£1.2m - compared with a fraud worth Â£2.8m. Even with such stark and plentiful evidence, it has taken five years to get this relatively minor fraud investigated and successfully prosecuted through the courts.

"Matteo Salvini, right, said he supported the proposal by Herbert Kickl The right-wing interior ministers of Austria and Italy have called on the EU to hold rescued migrants at sea until their asylum claims are processed. Austria's Herbert Kickl put forward the idea at an EU migration conference in Vienna and his Italian counterpart, Matteo Salvini, supported it. Hundreds of thousands of migrants try to reach the EU in risky sea crossings. Mr Kickl said ships would use a ""quick way"" to clarify who was entitled to asylum but he did not give details. Mr Salvini is under investigation in Italy for refusing to let rescued migrants disembark in Italy last month. Prosecutors in Sicily have opened an inquiry into possible illegal confinement, illegal arrest and abuse of power. Rice ball protest in Italian migrant boat row Matteo Salvini: Can Italy trust this man? Who is responsible for helping out at sea? Outlining his plan at a joint news conference with Mr Salvini on Friday Mr Kickl said that after ""appropriate checks"" on board ship, those migrants entitled to asylum could be brought to the EU while the rest would be taken to ""safe ports"" in third countries. ""You are well looked after on a ship,"" Mr Kickl said, adding that the system would help solve the ""problem of repatriation"". ""Once people have set foot on the continent, you can only remove them with great difficulty and much expense,"" he told reporters. He said EU asylum policy should aim to make it ""impossible to claim asylum except from outside the EU, and that claims be decided outside the EU"". Thousands of migrants rescued at sea are brought to Italian ports Mr Salvini said he was absolutely in favour of the plan. Italy is one of the main entry points for migrants making the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean with the hope of a new life in the EU. However, the Austrian office of the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) condemned the idea. ""This proposal is simply another attempt to distract attention from the real issue, namely the inability of Europe and of Austria's EU presidency to find a sustainable solution to the humanitarian crisis in the central Mediterranean and Libya,"" the group said in a statement. Migration to Europe in charts Migration to the EU can be ""managed"" It urged EU leaders to ""put the protection of human life at the centre of their efforts"". Since 2014, more than 640,000 migrants have landed on Italy's shores. Although many have since left for other countries, some remain. The UN says that more than 1,600 people have lost their lives trying to cross into Europe in 2018, despite overall numbers being down. In July, 450 migrants were allowed to disembark in Sicily once France, Germany, Malta, Portugal and Spain had agreed to take 50 migrants each. Can Italy's populist leader return to power?

"Sir Vince Cable has urged opponents of Brexit in other parties to join the Lib Dems to create a ""more powerful force"" in the centre ground of politics. Ahead of the party's conference, which starts on Saturday, its leader said it offered a home to ""liberals, social democrats, progressive and centrists"". He has proposed an internal shake-up to build a ""movement for moderates"". But he has also sparked leadership speculation by saying he will quit once Brexit is resolved or stopped. The 75-year old former cabinet minister, who only took over last year, has not set a firm date for his departure but signalled that he is unlikely to stay in place beyond next year, if there is no snap general election. Cable to quit 'once Brexit resolved' Cable proposes new hurdle to independence On the first day of their four-day conference in Brighton, the Lib Dems will discuss the Windrush scandal, animal welfare and decentralisation among other issues. But the event is likely to be dominated by questions over the party's future direction, after Sir Vince - who will make his keynote speech on Tuesday - called for a major overhaul of its membership and election rules to counter claims it lacked popular appeal and was struggling to be heard. His proposals, which are likely to be debated but not voted on at this year's event, could allow people to join the party for free and non-members to vote in future leadership elections. Most controversially, he has floated the idea of future leadership contests being opened up to people who are not MPs. The party currently has 12 MPs and Sir Vince was elected unopposed last year. He told the Press Association that his party - which backs a referendum on the final Brexit deal - could provide a home to those ""fed up with the extremes of the current Conservative and Labour parties"". ""Whether you see yourself as a liberal, social democrat, progressive, or centrist there is a home for you here, particularly as we fight Brexit together,"" he said. ""I have made proposals to open up our movement to become an even more powerful force at the centre of British politics, standing up to power and privilege to bring fairness and opportunity for everyone."" The party said 10,000 people had pre-registered their interest to become party members since Sir Vince announced the proposals earlier this month.

"The Spiez laboratory tests chemical, biological and nuclear threats Two Russian men were arrested earlier this year on suspicion of spying on a Swiss laboratory investigating the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a newspaper investigation has claimed. Swiss publication Tages Anzeiger and Dutch paper NRC said they were arrested in the Netherlands earlier this year. The Swiss lab analysed samples from the poisoning of the former Russian double agent in the UK. It has also dealt with suspected chemical weapons from the war in Syria. The two men were expelled from The Netherlands shortly after their arrest, which had not been reported until now. A spokeswoman for Swiss intelligence told the BBC that the agency had been actively involved in ""the case of the Russian spies"", without mentioning the laboratory at Spiez, near Bern. But Tages Anzeiger said the Swiss intelligence agency had confirmed the findings of its joint investigation with NRC. The report says the two men had equipment that could have been used to break into the laboratory's computer systems, and also alleged that they worked for Russian intelligence. Britain has said that two Russian intelligence officers carried out the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March. Both survived, but local residentDawn Sturgess died after exposure to the same nerve agent months later. Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov say they were tourists visiting the English town of Salisbury NRC said the two alleged spies targeting the Swiss lab were not the same men accused of the poisoning. It is not clear exactly when the arrests were made. But British intelligence are said to have been involved in the intelligence operation, suggesting it occurred after the Salisbury poisonings. Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? Isabelle Graber, head of communications at the Swiss Federal Intelligence Service (FIS) said the agency had ""participated actively in this operation together with its Dutch and British partners"". The BBC understands that the British police investigation into the Salisbury poisonings was not involved. The intended target of the alleged espionage is a designated lab for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). In addition to research on dangerous infections, it deals with biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons research. In that capacity, it has examined samples from the Syrian conflict, where the Damascus government - Russia's ally - has been accused of using chemical weapons against civilians. Russia, meanwhile, has dismissed the reports as false. The Russian embassy in Bern, near the Spiez laboratory, told Reuters: ""We consider such false statements simply absurd and nothing other than another attempt to stoke an anti-Russian atmosphere.""

"This video can not be played Lord Adonis: ""On the face of it, it seems to have been extremely incompetent."" The Electoral Commission misinterpreted EU referendum spending laws allowing Vote Leave to break them, the High Court has ruled. Vote Leave paid Â£625,000 to clear bills allegedly run up by university student Darren Grimes. The watchdog initially said it had no grounds to suspect this was a scheme to get round spending limits. It later changed its mind and fined Vote Leave and Mr Grimes - and also referred him to the police. The High Court agreed with the Electoral Commission finding in July that Vote Leave had broken the law, but said the watchdog had misinterpreted the rules, in the run-up to the June 2016 referendum, in advice it gave to the Leave campaign. Brexit campaigner Grimes to challenge fine Vote Leave campaign broke electoral law Vote Leave's former chief executive Matthew Elliott said that if the Electoral Commission did not launch an appeal against the ruling it would be admitting it had given incorrect advice and should drop its fines. Anti-Brexit campaigner and Labour peer Lord Adonis said: ""It sounds to me as if the Electoral Commission has not been doing its job properly. On the face of it, it seems to have been extremely incompetent."" He told the BBC's Politics Live that if there was another EU referendum, which he wants to see, ""we need a rather more fit and proper body to be in charge of it"". The Electoral Commission said the High Court ""arrived at the same conclusion as the Commission did in its investigation - that Vote Leave should have accounted for the expenditure on the digital services firm, AggregateIQ - although it found an additional reason for reaching that conclusion"". Darren Grimes ran the BeLeave campaign The Commission's chief executive Claire Bassett said: ""The High Court has not ruled on the advice we gave to Vote Leave. Our advice was generic and covered hypothetical scenarios. ""At no point did we give any advice or discuss payments to Aggregate IQ. ""Suggestions made otherwise today on social media are categorically untrue. ""Put simply, today's ruling states that donations from one campaign group to another are lawful, but that those donations must be declared as expenditure by the person or campaign group making the donation, if it is for a specific purpose. This is something that Vote Leave did not do."" In his judgement, Lord Justice Leggatt said the Electoral Commission had ""misinterpreted the definition of 'referendum expenses'"" as defined by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendum Act. He added: ""The source of its error is a mistaken assumption that an individual or body which makes a donation to a permitted participant cannot thereby incur referendum expenses. ""As a result of this error, the Electoral Commission has interpreted the definition in a way that is inconsistent with both the language and the purpose of the legislation."" Vote Leave's donation to Mr Grimes, which went straight to its Canadian digital agency AggregateIQ, should have counted as part of Vote Leave's campaign expenses, added the judge. ""The position would have been different if the money had been given to Mr Grimes for him to use however he chose in promoting a 'leave' outcome of the referendum,"" he added. But the judge said there was no ""rational basis"" for the watchdog's actions, which he described a ""recipe for abuse"" of the law. Matthew Elliott: ""Commission should reconsider unfair fines"" Jolyon Maugham QC of the Good Law Project, which brought the High Court challenge, said the ruling proved the watchdog ""unlawfully tilted the playing field in favour of Leave"" in the 2016 referendum. ""Stronger In (the official Remain campaign) was also up against its spending limits. ""But because it didn't get the advice from the Electoral Commission it had to stop spending. And the High Court decided that advice was wrong."" He said ""heads should roll"" at the Electoral Commission over the error. Matthew Elliott, former chief executive of Vote Leave, said the High Court ruling had ""thrown electoral law for future elections and referendums into total chaos"". ""Either the Electoral Commission is wrong or the High Court is wrong. ""Should the Electoral Commission choose not to appeal this judgment, they will be admitting that they gave Vote Leave incorrect advice and they should immediately reconsider the unfair fines they are seeking to impose on us,"" he added. ""Vote Leave would not have made the donations that it did, had it not been for the Commission's clear advice.

"West Sussex County Council said it was trying to find alternative accommodation for residents Patients at a care home were told to ""leave immediately"" after a health watchdog took urgent enforcement action, the BBC has learned. The Care Quality Commission (CQC) said it had made the decision to shut Horncastle House, near East Grinstead, after three separate inspections. But relatives said they were not given a reason for the sudden closure. A spokesman for the home said it ""does not accept the allegations that led to the closure"". All residents were found replacement accommodation, West Sussex County Council said. One relative described the situation as ""total chaos"" and ""an unbelievable situation"". Tim Leader, whose father-in-law is cared for at the private home, said: ""There are loved ones there now crying not knowing what to do."" ""How can the Care Quality Commission make this decision without first ensuring adequate provision has been made for the current residents? ""It's just so sad that vulnerable people like this are being treated so badly."" He added: ""You'd expect a care home to be just that, a caring environment for those that need it. It seems that in this case at least, we are a long way from achieving that goal."" Residents' families said patients were not told why the care home was closing The spokesman for Horncastle House, which can take up to 43 patients, confirmed it was being closed by the CQC. He said: ""We do not accept the allegations that have led to the closure and believe that the additional measures our senior management team swiftly put in place would have enabled us to continue to provide high quality care to our residents. ""We have been working constructively with the local authority and CCG throughout the day and have secured alternative accommodation for all our residents, ensuring they continue to receive the support they deserve."" In a statement Debbie Ivanova, CQC deputy chief inspector of adult social care, said the home had been inspected in March and August of this year and again on 13 September. ""Following this recent inspection, CQC has taken urgent enforcement action to protect people living in the service and to ensure significant and immediate improvements take place,"" she added. A West Sussex County Council spokesperson said it was working with families, CQC and other agencies to find alternative accommodation for residents. The CQC said a full report would be published in due course.

"Kate Moss has distanced herself from her controversial ""nothing tastes as good as skinny feels"" mantra. Almost ten years after she was heavily criticised for the quote, the British model has been speaking about her now infamous phrase. When it was published in women's fashion website WWD in 2009, the quote immediately caused an uproar. At the time, she was accused of encouraging eating disorders. Speaking to NBC's Megyn Kelly, she appeared visibly uncomfortable as the quote was mentioned and said it was just a ""jingle"". ""My friend used to say it,"" she said. ""Because you know, we were all living together, and we'd go for the biscuits and go, 'Oh, nothing tastes as gâ.â.â.â' It's a little jingle."" Kate Moss modelling in the 90s In the 2009 interview, Kate was asked if she had any mantras and said: ""There are loads of mottos. There's 'nothing tastes as good as skinny feels'. That's one of them."" She added: ""You try and remember, but it never works."" The quote was immediately criticised, especially after it was adopted by a number of pro-anorexia websites. Today, Kate says she believes the modelling industry has changed for the better. ""There's so much more diversity now, I think it's right. ""There's so many different sizes and colours and heights.

"Adam Howells was charged more than Â£10 to have his lost wallet and money returned A rail firm is changing its policy following a backlash after a passenger was charged 10% of the cash found in his lost wallet for its return. Adam Howells had to pay Â£8.60 commission - as well as a Â£2 administration fee - to have his wallet returned after he left it on a train. Arriva Trains Wales said it would return the commission to him and change its policy immediately. It comes after the fee was described as ""outrageous"" on social media. The rail operator initially said itslost property charges,externalwere in line with other rail operators but a further statement issued on Friday said it was taking action following ""feedback"". Mr Howells, 28, who left his wallet on a journey from Cardiff to Lydney in August, said: ""I received a letter stating they had found my wallet and there would be a Â£2 release fee. Lost property prices 'inconsistent' Ironing board and 'shark' left on trains ""It was only when I picked it up that they told me the money had been removed, put in their till and they would take 10%.

""I think people are shocked by their [train operators'] policy."" Arriva Trains Wales said: ""Our customers' feedback is really important to us and, following recent feedback on this issue, we will now be changing our policy with immediate effect. Arriva Trains Wales say tens of thousands of items are lost on the rail network every year ""In this instance we are happy to refund the percentage that was charged to the customer who brought this to our attention. ""We are happy to begin the process of reviewing the Lost Property policy with customer groups and rail industry regulatory bodies.

"Michael Nascimento spent some of the proceeds on a trip to Thorpe Park A ""boiler room"" fraud ringleader has been sentenced to a total of 13 years in jail after being found guilty of conspiring with five others to con 170 investors out of Â£2.8m. Michael Nascimento ran a call centre where investors were told their money would go into shares in businesses such as a property development in Madeira. Instead he spent it on Arsenal tickets, school fees and a trip to Thorpe Park. One victim was conned while coping with depression while her mother had cancer. How to scam millions from 170 people Nascimento, a former boxer, was convicted of this boiler fraud along with five others: Charanjit Sandhu, Hugh Edwards, Stuart Rea and Jeannine Lewis, who last week received sentences of between two-and-a-half and five-and-a-half years. Another, Ryan Parker, was given a two-year suspended sentence. According to investigators at the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the victim whose mother was struggling with cancer was befriended by the ""salesman"" of this boiler room fraud, Charanjit Sandhu. She was conned into parting with Â£16,000, her life savings. Then she felt ""bullied"" into taking out an overdraft to hand over a further Â£2,500. CCTV footage of the group's activities - and part of its cash pile - was seen by the FCA Another, a sophisticated financial services professional, invested Â£922,795. He had been asked to fly to Madeira to see the land owned by the companies and was shown around by the ringleader of the fraud, Michael Nascimento. Nascimento had arranged to be called by friends frequently during the visit in order to appear to be a well-known business man in Madeira. What he didn't let on was that the beautiful coastal land he was showing was far from the rough hillside plot with no planning permission that his companies had actually purchased. On an unannounced visit in March 2014, FCA investigators discovered the boiler room companies occupied more than one office. They later discovered CCTV footage that suggested that, while they were there, Nascimento's personal assistant, Jeannine Lewis, was trying to hide a company computer in a ceiling panel. She told investigators it was part of a ""clear-desk policy"". Compared to the relative ease with which such scams can be set up, bringing them to justice is hard. The FCA says it is the second-biggest criminal prosecution it has undertaken, involving four million documents, 142 witnesses, analysis of 65 UK bank accounts and five years of investigators' time. It cost Â£1.2m - compared with a fraud worth Â£2.8m. Even with such stark and plentiful evidence, it has taken five years to get this relatively minor fraud investigated and successfully prosecuted through the courts.

"This video can not be played Super typhoon reaches the Philippines The world's strongest storm this year, Super Typhoon Mangkhut, is blasting the northern coast of the Philippines with strong winds and heavy rain. Reports say it broke windows and downed power lines on the island of Luzon before dawn. More than four million people are directly in the path of the storm, which has winds of 200km/h (125 mph) and gusts reaching up to 330km/h. Thousands have been evacuated amid warnings of 6m (20ft) storm surges. Officials have warned of there may be ""very heavy damage"" to vulnerable structures. They have raised alert levels to the second-highest - signal four - in Cagayan, northern Isabela, Apayao and Abra provinces. The deadliest storm on record in the Philippines was Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, which also sparked category four alerts. In pictures: Philippines braces for super typhoon How to survive a monster storm Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? It killed more than 7,000 people and affected millions. The typhoon made landfall at Baggao, in the north-east of the country, at about 01:40 local time on Saturday (17:40 GMT on Friday). Families are taking shelter from the storm in classrooms in the city of Tuguegarao The storm - known locally as Ompong - is travelling north-west at about 35km/h (20 mph). ""In terms of strength,Typhoon Mangkhut is the strongest tropical cyclone of the year,external,"" the World Meteorological Organization said. The typhoon is forecast to keep heading west, passing through Hong Kong on Sunday afternoon. Hong Kong authorities have warned urged residents to stay indoors when the storm approaches, and weather experts say it may be the strongest tropical storm to hit the territory in decades.

Hong Kong authorities have warned urged residents to stay indoors when the storm approaches. The typhoon is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by Tuesday. Warnings have been issued in dozens of provinces, and sea and air travel has been restricted. Flights have been cancelled, schools shut and the army is on standby. This video can not be played People in Aparri are tying down their roofs ahead of Typhoon Mangkhut The authorities have also warned that heavy rains could trigger landslides and flash floods. A guide to the world's deadliest storms How windy is a hurricane? Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? ""We are really frightened,"" Delaila Pasion, who had fled her home, told AFP news agency. ""They say it is so strong, we were too scared to remain."" ""During previous monsoon rains, half of our house was destroyed so I wanted to take my grandchildren to safety,"" she told journalists. The Philippines is routinely hit during the typhoon season. In China, where the storm is predicted to hit late on Sunday or early on Monday, the authorities have raised storm alerts to ""yellow"", which is the second level on the four-tier warning system. High-speed rail services have been cancelled in parts of the south, local media report. The relationship between climate change and tropical storms is a complex one. Officials are preparing food and supplies for affected residents Typhoons and hurricanes form when air, heated by warm sea water, rises quickly. As the air cools down again it is pushed aside by more warm air rising below it - causing strong winds and whipping up waves. So as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future. A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas. But there are so many factors that contribute to these events, it has been difficult to tease out clear trends from the data. Howard Johnson, BBC News, Arparri, Luzon Thousands of people are being evacuated and placed inside shelters like these Residents of this small, low-rise town say they've been through this before, they've seen other storms. Farmers are working around the clock to harvest their rice paddies. They say the rice is still not ripe, but want to salvage what they can before this storm potentially devastates their fields. Authorities have told people to move on. Some cars are leaving the area, bedding on the roof - but some people say they want to stay inside their homes to prevent thieves entering. People seem to be very relaxed with the idea that a super typhoon is coming their way.

"Fiona Jayne Scourfield was an animal lover who volunteered with a charity A boy who killed his stepmother with an axe and samurai sword was ""obsessed"" with watching extreme violence. Rueben Brathwaite, 17, admitted murdering Fiona Scourfield, 54, at Broadmoor Farm in Laugharne, Carmarthenshire, on 6 March. Brathwaite was sentenced to life in prison at Swansea Crown Court, with a minimum of 15 years. Judge Mr Justice Simon Picken said it was a ""savage attack against a defenceless woman"". Brathwaite killed dog rescuer Ms Scourfield before trying to upload pictures of her body to the internet. The court heard the teenager developed an interest in watching online videos of beheading, suicide and mass murder in the run up to the murder. Rueben Brathwaite had returned from school before murdering his stepmother Prosecutor Paul Hipkin said: ""The images demonstrated murder, death and mutilation."" The court heard Brathwaite arrived home from a ""normal school day"" and later in the afternoon, he lured Ms Scourfield outside and repeatedly struck her over the head with an axe. He then cut her throat with a samurai sword taken from underneath his father's bed. Following the attack the teenager called the police, confessing to the murder. Mr Hipkin said when officers asked why he had murdered Ms Scourfield, he said he was ""fed up of life"" and saw killing his stepmother as a ""way out"". Brathwaite considered attacking his father but thought he would be ""too powerful"" and would fight back. In the 999 call to police, he said: ""I've just killed someone. The person is Fiona Scourfield. ""I know she's dead. Her pulse has stopped. There's no signs of life. I hit her so many times in the head, about eight to nine times with the axe."" He later told police his stepmother took good care of him and he was ""sure she loves me and my father"". Paul Hobson, defending, said the violent content Brathwaite regularly watched in the months leading to the killing meant ""after time, a natural revulsion to pain and crime became deadened to him"". Rueben Brathwaite confessed to the murder after calling police After the attack, Brathwaite took two photos of the victim's body which he tried to upload to a website, but failed. Mr Hobson said his client had ""committed a dreadful crime"" and Ms Scourfield's death was ""brutal and served no purpose"". Brathwaite told the court: ""I believe without the right level of help I believe I will remain a danger to myself."" Teen admits axe and sword murder Axe murder victim 'kind and loving' In a letter to the court, Brathwaite said his stepmother was a ""great believer in me"" and wanted him to go to university, adding she had ""so much love for me"". Ms Scourfield was described as ""loving and caring"" by family and volunteered with the German Shepherd Rescue UK charity. Fiona Scourfield was killed at Broadmoor Farm, between Laugharne and St Clears Mr Justice Picken said Brathwaite complained of loneliness, unhappiness and depression but had not been suffering from any mental health condition. He added: ""No doubt inspired by the graphic images seen on the internet in the months before the attack, you attempted to upload images of the attack to the internet. ""Your obsession went to watching material including mass murders and massacres."" A victim impact statement read on behalf of Ms Scourfield's mother Charlotte said: ""Fiona made Rueben warmly welcome and made sure he was properly dressed and equipped for school. ""I believe there was a loving bond between them. My life is destroyed."" After the hearing, Det Supt Gary Phillips from Dyfed-Powys Police said Ms Scourfield ""lost her life in a savage and unprovoked attack"".

Brathwaite was sentenced to life in prison at Swansea Crown Court, with a minimum of 15 years. Judge Mr Justice Simon Picken said it was a ""savage attack against a defenceless woman"". Brathwaite killed dog rescuer Ms Scourfield before trying to upload pictures of her body to the internet. The court heard the teenager developed an interest in watching online videos of beheading, suicide and mass murder in the run up to the murder. Rueben Brathwaite had returned from school before murdering his stepmother Prosecutor Paul Hipkin said: ""The images demonstrated murder, death and mutilation."" The court heard Brathwaite arrived home from a ""normal school day"" and later in the afternoon, he lured Ms Scourfield outside and repeatedly struck her over the head with an axe. He then cut her throat with a samurai sword taken from underneath his father's bed. Following the attack the teenager called the police, confessing to the murder. Mr Hipkin said when officers asked why he had murdered Ms Scourfield, he said he was ""fed up of life"" and saw killing his stepmother as a ""way out"". Brathwaite considered attacking his father but thought he would be ""too powerful"" and would fight back. In the 999 call to police, he said: ""I've just killed someone. The person is Fiona Scourfield. ""I know she's dead. Her pulse has stopped. There's no signs of life. I hit her so many times in the head, about eight to nine times with the axe."" He later told police his stepmother took good care of him and he was ""sure she loves me and my father"". Paul Hobson, defending, said the violent content Brathwaite regularly watched in the months leading to the killing meant ""after time, a natural revulsion to pain and crime became deadened to him"". Rueben Brathwaite confessed to the murder after calling police After the attack, Brathwaite took two photos of the victim's body which he tried to upload to a website, but failed. Mr Hobson said his client had ""committed a dreadful crime"" and Ms Scourfield's death was ""brutal and served no purpose"". Brathwaite told the court: ""I believe without the right level of help I believe I will remain a danger to myself."" Teen admits axe and sword murder Axe murder victim 'kind and loving' In a letter to the court, Brathwaite said his stepmother was a ""great believer in me"" and wanted him to go to university, adding she had ""so much love for me"". Ms Scourfield was described as ""loving and caring"" by family and volunteered with the German Shepherd Rescue UK charity. Fiona Scourfield was killed at Broadmoor Farm, between Laugharne and St Clears Mr Justice Picken said Brathwaite complained of loneliness, unhappiness and depression but had not been suffering from any mental health condition. He added: ""No doubt inspired by the graphic images seen on the internet in the months before the attack, you attempted to upload images of the attack to the internet. ""Your obsession went to watching material including mass murders and massacres."" A victim impact statement read on behalf of Ms Scourfield's mother Charlotte said: ""Fiona made Rueben warmly welcome and made sure he was properly dressed and equipped for school. ""I believe there was a loving bond between them. My life is destroyed."" After the hearing, Det Supt Gary Phillips from Dyfed-Powys Police said Ms Scourfield ""lost her life in a savage and unprovoked attack"".

"The crash caused huge damage to the house A woman was killed and three people were injured when a stolen lorry ploughed into the side of a house. Police were called to Park View, in Brierley, Barnsley, at about 13:40 BST, after the HGV crashed into the house. A senior officer confirmed to the BBC the woman who died was a pedestrian. No details have been released about the injured people, who have been taken to hospital. Four men had been arrested in connection with the crash, police said. A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said an officer in a marked patrol car was following the stolen lorry when it hit the woman, aged in her 50s, before crashing into two cars and the house. Video footage has emerged which appears to show two young men getting out of the lorry before running away.

"Protests have been held at a number of prisons, including Leicester Prison staff in England and Wales have taken part in widespread protests over ""unprecedented violence"" in jails. Staff complained about safety within prisons, saying they had been attacked by gangs of inmates, been spat at and had urine thrown at them while on duty. The union said there were protests outside ""a majority"" of jails, which ended after six hours when the government agreed to talks on Monday. Prisons Minister Rory Stewart said the action was illegal. When it announced the suspension of the protest, the Prison Officers' Association said the prison service had withdrawn the threat of court action against the union. General Secretary Steve Gillan said he was ""confident a deal is a deal"", adding that he hoped ""for meaningful, constructive dialogue"" next week. The protests caused delays in courts because prisoners were unable to be transferred for hearings. This video can not be played Rory Stewart condemned the protests, saying there were other ways to solve prison issues The action came afteran inspection report on Thursdayfound inmates had effectively taken control at Bedford Prison. Brian Cooper, branch chairman of the Prison Officers' Association, said conditions at the jail were unsafe ""every day"". ""This year so far we've had an officer who's had his head stamped on and needed emergency surgery for a bleed on the brain. ""We've had an officer have his arm broken with a pool cue when he was attacked by a prisoner. ""Another officer has a fractured eye socket with part of the bone detached and might lose the ability to move his eye properly, permanently."" A female prison officer who was demonstrating outside Bedford Prison said she had a bucket of urine thrown over her from an above landing. ""They're not bothered if you're female or male; they have no respect regardless if you're female,"" she told BBC Radio 5 live. ""We have some issues of being hit. I've been spat at several times. The other week I was spat at twice within five minutes in the face."" On that occasion she said she had to be tested for hepatitis B. Julia Killick, who was a prison governor for 18 years, said the walkout would have made it ""horrendous"" for prisoners, as well as the remaining staff who would only have been able to do the ""absolute minimum"". She told Radio 4's World at One that tasks such as serving food would have been difficult to carry out, while prisoners could get ""very angry or distressed"" having to stay locked up. POA members protested outside Bedford Prison By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Prison staff are banned from taking industrial action, so holding ""protest"" meetings in car parks or outside the gates on the grounds that health and safety is being compromised is the union's way of trying to circumvent the rules. The POA did it before, most recently in November 2016 when 10,000 officers stopped work, before the High Court ordered them to return. This time, the threat of legal action - together with a government pledge to address staff concerns - was enough to bring the walkout to an end. Nevertheless, it has highlighted the very real problems POA members are facing. There is particular frustration officers haven't been equipped with PAVA incapacitant spray - similar to pepper spray - to deter and respond to attacks. A trial has been taking place in four jails but union officials believe the government is stalling on rolling the equipment out to other prisons. Before an agreement with the union was reached, the Ministry of Justice said ""contingency plans"" were in place and it was seeking an injunction to stop the protests. Labour said the action was a ""wake-up call"" for the government, adding that extra funding to end understaffing and overcrowding was ""desperately needed"". Images posted on social media showed walkouts at many prisons. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The POA said members were instructed to ensure there were enough staff on duty inside prisons to deliver medication to prisoners and deal with any disorder. It accused the government of overseeing ""the demise of the prison service over the last eight years"". Mr Gillan said ministers had been ""paying lip service"" to the safety and human rights of prison staff. ""We will now be demanding that the government provide safe prisons, meet our demands to improve personal protective equipment, reduce levels of violence and overcrowding,"" he added. Between 50-60 officers protested outside Manchester Prison Protests were also held at Berwyn prison, in Wrexham The union said the decision to call for a protest followed a letter from the chief inspector of prisons, issuing an urgent notification notice at Bedford Prison, published on Thursday. Inspectors said they found Bedford prisoners regularly ignored rules, that there was a smell of drugs ""pervading"" some wings and an infestation of rats. Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, sent a letter to the Ministry of Justice, which means the government has to publish a response and plan of action for the jail within 28 days. It is the fourth jail to be subject to the ""urgent notification"" process after Nottingham, Exeter and Birmingham. Inmates 'effectively control' prison Minister 'disappointed' at prison protests.

"House of Fraser customers have been told that they'll get no refunds for goods ordered online but undelivered before the chain was bought last month. New owner Sports Direct said people must ""contact the administrators"" to chase their cash. They will join a long queue of other creditors - meaning there'll be little chance of getting their money back. One customer told the BBC: ""I am fuming about this whole situation and just want my money back"". House of Fraser rescue details emerge House of Fraser owes big brands millions Ashley makes House of Fraser store promise Mike Ashley's Sports Direct agreed to buy the department store for Â£90m on 10 August hours after the 169-year-old chain went into administration when talks with its creditors failed to reach an agreement. But on 15 August they took down the website, leaving online customers in the dark about their goods orders or their cash. After an outcry from customers,House of Fraser on 16 August saidit would refund customers and also cancel all online orders. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But this week a spokesperson for House of Fraser told the BBC: ""The comment made on social media on August 16 can by definition only relate to orders received by the current company. ""Any issues relating to purchases made prior to August 10 must be referred to, and dealt with, by the administrators at EY. We have spoken to EY, who accept that orders taken prior to August 10th must be dealt with by them."" In other words, anyone who made an order before the takeover and owed money will be in a long line of creditors owed money. That means it's likely they will only get a small part of the money they are owed back. EY said in a statement: ""Customers can submit a claim against theHF Stores Realisations Limited,external(formerly House of Fraser (Stores) Limited) for the refund.  However, this will be treated as an unsecured creditor claim and unfortunately they will only receive a very modest recovery against the amount claimed."" The indications are that the administrators could take around a year to sort things out and that unsecured creditors could be offered a paltry amount, around a penny in the pound. That would mean anyone who ordered, for example, Â£300-worth of goods could only expect to get Â£3 back, if anything. If you spent more than Â£100 and paid by credit card, you may be able to claim the cash back from your credit card provider. Section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act can make credit card providers jointly liable for breaches of contract with a trader when people buy on plastic. It means shoppers should not be left out of pocket if an item is faulty, the retailer goes out of business or it does not deliver what it has promised. Consumers are potentially protected for the total value of their purchase - provided the total cost of the item is between Â£100 and Â£30,000 - even if they only used a credit card for part of the payment. If you want to make a claim, you simply need to contact your credit card issuer and tell it you're making a claim under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act. It should send you a claim form. Consumer websiteWhich?,externalhas a template which could help. If your credit provider won't play ball, then you can contact theFinancial Ombudsman,externalto make a complaint. People who ordered and paid for goods online after 10 August but before the website was taken down can't make a claim on the credit card and should still be dealing with House of Fraser about their cash and goods, the company said. But that hasn't prove easy, as angry customer Simon Harrington, pictured, told the BBC. ""On 13th August my wife ordered and paid for two shirts from House of Fraser for Â£77 and the money was taken from our account that day. ""We had a confirmation email but that was the last correspondence we had from House of Fraser. We have emailed, phoned, and tweeted to ask what was going on, but in each case we have heard nothing."" In desperation last weekend the couple went into their local store, Jolly's in Bath, where staff were unable to help. He added: ""I used to buy all my suits, shirts etc from House of Fraser and won't be shopping there ever again. Nor will I ever be going to Sports Direct either. ""It's absolutely outrageous. It's been a month. I am fuming about this whole situation and just want my money back."" House of Fraser refused to discuss individual cases.

"This video can not be played Pipers and drummers led the funeral cortege Four children killed in a firebombing attack on their home were described as ""angels in the sky"" at their funeral. Demi Pearson, 15, her brother Brandon, eight, and sisters Lacie, seven, and Lia, three, were killed in the blaze in Walkden, Greater Manchester, last year. Their mother Michelle Pearson, 36, was unable to attend the service as she recovers from injuries suffered in the blaze. However, mourners heard an emotional speech that was read out on her behalf. The children were described as: ""The twinkle in her eye, now they're angels in the sky. ""One day we will be united forever,"" added the tribute from the mother-of-six, who has been in hospital since the attack in December. Grandmother Sandra Lever said Mrs Pearson could not attend the service at St Paul's Church due to ""unforeseen medical circumstances"". Lia, Demi, Brandon, Lacie and Michelle Pearson The service also heard Ariana Grande's version of Somewhere Over the Rainbow being played. The starting point of the procession was on Jackson Street, where they lived, and paused outside Bridgewater Primary School, where the two middle children attended. It included bagpipes and drummers, and 200 members of the family and friends following four white horse-drawn carriages. The carriages arrived in age order, with Demi first, and the coffins were each themed with the children's interests - music, the Avengers, My Little Pony and Peppa Pig. Men jailed for murdering children in fire Coma mum told of children's fire deaths Children âmurdered in feud arson attack' A private burial, for family members only, will take place after the service. Mrs Pearson's family said she had wanted to attend the funeral despite still being ill after suffering a series of infections. She learned that four of her children were dead after coming out of a four-month coma. The siblings were murdered as they slept in their beds after Zak Bolland, 23, and David Worrall, 26, smashed a kitchen window and threw petrol bombs inside following a feud which prompted a series of tit-for-tat attacks. Mourners gathered outside the church ahead of the service Firefighters formed a guard of honour before the cortege arrived for the funeral service Bolland and Worrall were both given four life sentences for murder after a trial in May.

"US officials are warning Hurricane Florence could kill ""a lot of people"" with risks of ""catastrophic"" flooding as the storm begins to lash the country's East Coast. Florence, although now downgraded to a category one storm, is slow-moving and could linger for days,bringing ""copious amounts of rain"". Florence made landfall on Friday, with the centre of the storm striking Wrightsville Beach in North Carolina, with gales of up to 90mph (150 km/h). The National Hurricane Center says that despite the gradual lowering in wind strength, the storm remains extremely dangerous because of the high volume of rainfall and storm surges predicted. Some 10 million people are now under some form of storm watch. Georgia, North and South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland have declared a state of emergency as forecasts showed Florence dumping historic amounts of rain on the area. Tens of thousands of homes are already without power and rains and surging seas have inundated coastal areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) said people living near rivers, streams and lowland areas in the region were most at risk. ""Inland flooding kills a lot of people, unfortunately, and that's what we're about to see,"" said Brock Long, head of Fema. Evacuation warnings are in place for 1.7 million people. Latest updates Is climate change making hurricanes worse? The world's deadliest storms More than 1,400 flights have been cancelled, according to FlightAware.com, with most of the coastal region's airports closed. The weather system that became Hurricane Florence has been travelling west from Africa toward the US since 29 August. Its wind speeds reached hurricane levels in the mid-Atlantic. The biggest danger to life could be from storm surges, which are still predicted to be as high as 13ft (4m) between Cape Fear and Cape Lookout in North Carolina. Meteorologists have warned some rivers may see their flows ""reversed"". Storm surges are caused when huge volumes of water are pushed by hurricane-force winds. When they meet land, the water surges inshore at levels far exceeding normal tides. Florence is forecast to dump up to 40in (one metre) of rain in some areas after it makes landfall. By Friday morning, the North Carolina coastal town of Atlantic Beach had already received 30in (76cm) of rain, the US Geological Service said. The torrential rainfall could last for significant periods and cause catastrophic flooding, including in inland areas such as Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia. National Weather Service forecaster Brandon Locklear said North Carolina is likely to see eight months' worth of rain in two to three days. The hurricane's wind speeds have fallen from a category two level of 96-110mph to a category one level of 74-95mph. There will be hurricane-force winds up to 80 miles from the centre of the storm, meteorologists say. Florence was being followed in the Atlantic by two other storms - Hurricane Helene and Tropical Storm Isaac. But Helene is now moving north east towards the UK and Isaac is moving west across the Caribbean. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye.

"On opposite sides of the world, two major storms have forced people to flee their homes and are threatening to bulldoze infrastructure and buildings. In the US, officials warn that Hurricane Florence could cause ""catastrophic"" flooding which could kill ""a lot of people"" on the country's east coast. Meanwhile, a super typhoon has arrived in the Philippines and officials say more than five million people are in its path. The looming disasters have prompted people to prepare their homes and stock up on supplies. But what is best practice? And how can you cope once a storm has hit? Here's what officials from both countries advise... Images of people in the US boarding up the windows of their homes and businesses are commonplace when a hurricane is nearing land. But the government's advice, posted as part ofthe Ready Campaign,,externalsuggests that installing permanent storm shutters in advance is the safest option. If there is no time then it advises using ""exterior grade or marine plywood"" to board up your windows. ""There could be a lot of debris and loose items that become projectiles,"" James Joseph, from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), tells the BBC. ""The heavy winds will pick items up and they could smash through windows."" Four reasons to fear Hurricane Florence Where is being hit by the storm? A guide to the world's deadliest storms When a hurricane hits, then, it's best to shelter in a windowless room or hallway on the lowest floor of a building, providing that it's not at risk of flooding. ""If you get trapped in a flooded building, go to the highest floor but do NOT enter a closed attic,"" FEMA tweeted as Hurricane Florence approached landfall on Friday. In the Philippines, people in the path of Super Typhoon Mangkhut have been readying their homes by tying down their roofs with rope. Residents of vulnerable makeshift houses near the coast have had to improvise ways to secure their properties. Some have weighed down their roofs with tyres and shuttered their windows with any materials they can find. ""Examine your house and repair its unstable parts,"" advice from the Philippine Red Cross (PRC) says. It suggests securing pets in a safe place, storing your most important belongings on high ground, and turning off the main power switch. Once a home is secured and prepared then people may either bed down to ride the storm out, or - if they're subject to an evacuation warning - move to a safer place. ""The biggest mistake people make is not heeding the warnings,"" Mr Joseph says. ""They find themselves in very dangerous situations."" More than a million people have been ordered to leave the coasts of the Carolinas and Virginia, with more than 20,000 taking refuge in emergency shelters. Similarly in the Philippines, thousands of people are being evacuated from their homes and placed in temporary shelters. But what should people bring with them when leaving? According to official advice in the US, an emergency preparedness kit should include: Three days' worth of food and water Medicine A torch Batteries Money First aid kit The PRC advice adds that candles and battery-powered radios should be easily accessible. Once the worst of a storm has subsided and people are able to return home, there are still a number of dangers, officials say. ""Avoid wading in floodwater, which can contain dangerous debris. Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water,"" the Ready Campaign warns. It also advises wearing protective clothing when cleaning up, and working with someone else. ""You don't want to get injured in a situation when you're alone,"" Mr Joseph says. ""Cell phone services might not be working so you definitely want to at least be in a pair so if anything occurs the other person can seek assistance for you."" He adds that people should not enter their home if the area has been closed off by the police or fire department. ""First responders need to ensure that the power has been turned off and any open gas lines have been turned off,"" he says. ""We don't want there to be another emergency or disaster within the already existing disaster."" Officials say floodwater can pose a number of different dangers In the Philippines there are some more unique risks. ""Beware of poisonous animals like snakes that may have entered your house,"" safety tips issued by the National Police in 2014 say. The PRC also says to avoid letting floodwater accumulate in cans or pots to avoid ""creating a favourable condition for mosquito breeding."" It adds that any damaged electrical cables and posts should be reported to the authorities.

"This video can not be played Super typhoon reaches the Philippines The world's strongest storm this year, Super Typhoon Mangkhut, is blasting the northern coast of the Philippines with strong winds and heavy rain. Reports say it broke windows and downed power lines on the island of Luzon before dawn. More than four million people are directly in the path of the storm, which has winds of 200km/h (125 mph) and gusts reaching up to 330km/h. Thousands have been evacuated amid warnings of 6m (20ft) storm surges. Officials have warned of there may be ""very heavy damage"" to vulnerable structures. They have raised alert levels to the second-highest - signal four - in Cagayan, northern Isabela, Apayao and Abra provinces. The deadliest storm on record in the Philippines was Super Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, which also sparked category four alerts. In pictures: Philippines braces for super typhoon How to survive a monster storm Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? It killed more than 7,000 people and affected millions. The typhoon made landfall at Baggao, in the north-east of the country, at about 01:40 local time on Saturday (17:40 GMT on Friday). Families are taking shelter from the storm in classrooms in the city of Tuguegarao The storm - known locally as Ompong - is travelling north-west at about 35km/h (20 mph). ""In terms of strength,Typhoon Mangkhut is the strongest tropical cyclone of the year,external,"" the World Meteorological Organization said. The typhoon is forecast to keep heading west, passing through Hong Kong on Sunday afternoon. Hong Kong authorities have warned urged residents to stay indoors when the storm approaches, and weather experts say it may be the strongest tropical storm to hit the territory in decades.

Hong Kong authorities have warned urged residents to stay indoors when the storm approaches. The typhoon is expected to weaken into a tropical depression by Tuesday. Warnings have been issued in dozens of provinces, and sea and air travel has been restricted. Flights have been cancelled, schools shut and the army is on standby.

A guide to the world's deadliest storms How windy is a hurricane? Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? ""We are really frightened,"" Delaila Pasion, who had fled her home, told AFP news agency. ""They say it is so strong, we were too scared to remain."" ""During previous monsoon rains, half of our house was destroyed so I wanted to take my grandchildren to safety,"" she told journalists. The Philippines is routinely hit during the typhoon season. In China, where the storm is predicted to hit late on Sunday or early on Monday, the authorities have raised storm alerts to ""yellow"", which is the second level on the four-tier warning system. High-speed rail services have been cancelled in parts of the south, local media report. The relationship between climate change and tropical storms is a complex one. Officials are preparing food and supplies for affected residents Typhoons and hurricanes form when air, heated by warm sea water, rises quickly. As the air cools down again it is pushed aside by more warm air rising below it - causing strong winds and whipping up waves. So as the temperature of ocean water goes up, we might expect the intensity of hurricanes to increase in future. A hotter atmosphere can also hold more water, so this should allow hurricanes to dump more water on affected areas. But there are so many factors that contribute to these events, it has been difficult to tease out clear trends from the data. Howard Johnson, BBC News, Arparri, Luzon Thousands of people are being evacuated and placed inside shelters like these Residents of this small, low-rise town say they've been through this before, they've seen other storms. Farmers are working around the clock to harvest their rice paddies. They say the rice is still not ripe, but want to salvage what they can before this storm potentially devastates their fields. Authorities have told people to move on. Some cars are leaving the area, bedding on the roof - but some people say they want to stay inside their homes to prevent thieves entering. People seem to be very relaxed with the idea that a super typhoon is coming their way.

"The incident happened at the family home in Claude Road, Cardiff A seven-year-old girl died after being strangled when her hooded top became caught on a door handle at her Cardiff home, an inquest has heard. Kimora Zondo was found after her mother awoke from a nap to be told by her nine-year-old son that the little girl was ""pretending to be sleepy"". Assistant coroner Nadim Bashir said there was ""no evidence"" of how Kimora became caught on the handle. He recorded a conclusion of accidental death at the hearing in Pontypridd. The inquest heard that Kimora had returned home from her school in the Roath area of the city on 7 March and changed from her school uniform into a pink hoodie. Her mother Vonnie Dube had fallen asleep and when she woke, she asked Kimora's brother where his sister was. In a statement read out to the court Ms Dube said her son stood up and said ""Kimora, mummy's awake"" and walked to the heavy passage door, which he tried to push. After finding the girl, they could get no response from her and the ambulance was called. She died later in hospital. An investigation into the death was launched by police, who interviewed her older brother twice about how he found his sister. He said: ""When I opened the door I found her head was hanging off the handle and took her to mum who checked her and started tickling her but there was nothing."" In the second police interview, he said: ""My mum asked me to call Kimora and I found her lying there and she was hanging from her hoodie. ""I took the hoodie off and put her on the carpet where mum tickled her. "" A post-mortem examination found that Kimora died from pressure to the neck caused by a ligature. The police and forensic pathologists carried out a number of recreations of how the incident had been described, with a dummy the same height and weight of Kimora, and used with replicas of her hoodie. Pathologist Dr Richard Jones told the inquest he was satisfied the mark on Kimora's neck had been caused by the hoodie, which had a hole in the top of the hood. He added: ""If you asked the question 'Is it possible for a child wearing a hooded top to actually be suspended from that handle in the manner which is suggested by her brother?' then yes it's possible but quite how she got into that position I can't say."" Coroner Mr Bashir said: ""In the circumstances the only possible explanation that can be given in this case was a hole in the hoodie and Kimora was in the hallway with her head close to the the handle to allow her to get caught on the handle, was unable to extricate herself in the second it would take to lose consciousness, and death quickly thereafter.""

"A court sketch showed Paul Manafort, seated, with his attorney Richard Westling Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has agreed to co-operate with an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the US election as part of a plea deal. In court on Friday, he pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in the deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The agreement avoids a second trial on money laundering and other charges. The White House insists the guilty plea has absolutely nothing to do with President Donald Trump. Manafort was convicted last monthon eight counts of fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose bank accounts. That was the first criminal trial arising from the justice department's investigation into alleged interference by Russia in the 2016 election. Winners and losers from Manafort's plea deal Who is Trump's former campaign chair? However, the charges only relate to Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign. In an appearance at a federal court in Washington DC, Manafort - who is being held in custody - pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice. Correspondents say he faces up to 10 years in prison under the deal and will also forfeit four of his properties and the contents of several bank accounts. Deadlocked charges from the previous trial will be dismissed if there is ""successful co-operation"" with the special counsel. A lawyer for Manafort, Kevin Downing, told reporters outside the court that his client ""wanted to make sure that his family was able to remain safe and live a good life"". A bystander made his point as defence lawyer Kevin Downing addressed the media Manafort, 69, worked for Mr Trump's presidential campaign for five months in 2016 and was in charge when Mr Trump clinched the Republican party nomination. In a statement, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Friday: ""This had absolutely nothing to do with the president or his victorious 2016 presidential campaign. It is totally unrelated."" What did we learn from Manafort trial? Manafort: The man who helped Trump win President Trump has branded the Mueller investigation a ""witch hunt"" and insisted there was no collusion between his team and Russia. The Kremlin has also repeatedly denied any meddling. The charges in the planned second trial were to include money laundering, conspiring to defraud the US, witness tampering and failing to register as a foreign agent. Jury selection had been due to start on Monday. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington In a year filled with blockbuster Friday news stories, the announcement that Paul Manafort is co-operating with Robert Mueller's investigation is one of the biggest. Although the White House downplays his importance to the campaign, Mr Manafort had top perch in the Trump team for key months in 2016. For instance, he was in the June Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr, Jared Kushner and Russian nationals that was originally billed as a chance to obtain damaging information Russia had on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. He took cryptic notes about that meeting that he now might be willing to discuss. After his August conviction on financial and tax fraud charges in Virginia, the prospect of Mr Manafort's walking away from his legal headaches a free man had been eliminated. It appears that the reality of additional legal expenses and possibly more prison time finally pushed the long-time Washington lobbyist to make a deal. This is probably exactly what the special counsel team had hoped for. Now the president, who tweeted last month that Mr Manafort was a ""brave man"" who ""refused to break and make up stories in order to get a deal"", is left to wonder what comes next. Manafort was charged by Mr Mueller last October. At trial, he was accused of using 31 foreign bank accounts in three different countries to evade taxes on millions of dollars. Prosecutors presented evidence of Manafort's luxurious lifestyle, saying it was only possible because of his bank and tax fraud. Following last month's conviction, President Trump praised his former campaign chairman for refusing to ""break"" under legal pressure. He tweeted he felt ""very badly"" for Manafort and lauded him for declining to ""make up stories"" to get a deal.

"This video can not be played Lord Adonis: ""On the face of it, it seems to have been extremely incompetent."" The Electoral Commission misinterpreted EU referendum spending laws allowing Vote Leave to break them, the High Court has ruled. Vote Leave paid Â£625,000 to clear bills allegedly run up by university student Darren Grimes. The watchdog initially said it had no grounds to suspect this was a scheme to get round spending limits. It later changed its mind and fined Vote Leave and Mr Grimes - and also referred him to the police. The High Court agreed with the Electoral Commission finding in July that Vote Leave had broken the law, but said the watchdog had misinterpreted the rules, in the run-up to the June 2016 referendum, in advice it gave to the Leave campaign. Brexit campaigner Grimes to challenge fine Vote Leave campaign broke electoral law Vote Leave's former chief executive Matthew Elliott said that if the Electoral Commission did not launch an appeal against the ruling it would be admitting it had given incorrect advice and should drop its fines. Anti-Brexit campaigner and Labour peer Lord Adonis said: ""It sounds to me as if the Electoral Commission has not been doing its job properly. On the face of it, it seems to have been extremely incompetent."" He told the BBC's Politics Live that if there was another EU referendum, which he wants to see, ""we need a rather more fit and proper body to be in charge of it"". The Electoral Commission said the High Court ""arrived at the same conclusion as the Commission did in its investigation - that Vote Leave should have accounted for the expenditure on the digital services firm, AggregateIQ - although it found an additional reason for reaching that conclusion"". Darren Grimes ran the BeLeave campaign The Commission's chief executive Claire Bassett said: ""The High Court has not ruled on the advice we gave to Vote Leave. Our advice was generic and covered hypothetical scenarios. ""At no point did we give any advice or discuss payments to Aggregate IQ. ""Suggestions made otherwise today on social media are categorically untrue. ""Put simply, today's ruling states that donations from one campaign group to another are lawful, but that those donations must be declared as expenditure by the person or campaign group making the donation, if it is for a specific purpose. This is something that Vote Leave did not do."" In his judgement, Lord Justice Leggatt said the Electoral Commission had ""misinterpreted the definition of 'referendum expenses'"" as defined by the Political Parties, Elections and Referendum Act. He added: ""The source of its error is a mistaken assumption that an individual or body which makes a donation to a permitted participant cannot thereby incur referendum expenses. ""As a result of this error, the Electoral Commission has interpreted the definition in a way that is inconsistent with both the language and the purpose of the legislation."" Vote Leave's donation to Mr Grimes, which went straight to its Canadian digital agency AggregateIQ, should have counted as part of Vote Leave's campaign expenses, added the judge. ""The position would have been different if the money had been given to Mr Grimes for him to use however he chose in promoting a 'leave' outcome of the referendum,"" he added. But the judge said there was no ""rational basis"" for the watchdog's actions, which he described a ""recipe for abuse"" of the law. Matthew Elliott: ""Commission should reconsider unfair fines"" Jolyon Maugham QC of the Good Law Project, which brought the High Court challenge, said the ruling proved the watchdog ""unlawfully tilted the playing field in favour of Leave"" in the 2016 referendum. ""Stronger In (the official Remain campaign) was also up against its spending limits. ""But because it didn't get the advice from the Electoral Commission it had to stop spending. And the High Court decided that advice was wrong."" He said ""heads should roll"" at the Electoral Commission over the error. Matthew Elliott, former chief executive of Vote Leave, said the High Court ruling had ""thrown electoral law for future elections and referendums into total chaos"". ""Either the Electoral Commission is wrong or the High Court is wrong. ""Should the Electoral Commission choose not to appeal this judgment, they will be admitting that they gave Vote Leave incorrect advice and they should immediately reconsider the unfair fines they are seeking to impose on us,"" he added. ""Vote Leave would not have made the donations that it did, had it not been for the Commission's clear advice. ""This whole situation is a mess of the Electoral Commission's own making, and their defeat in the High Court today must force a rethink. ""They now have a chance to rectify their errors. They should do the right thing.""

"PC Keith Palmer was unarmed as he was attacked by Khalid Masood The family of PC Keith Palmer have raised concerns about the lack of armed protection at the gates of Parliament during last year's Westminster attack. His widow's lawyer told an inquest into the victims' deaths that he had just ""a spray and a baton"" to protect himself. Khalid Masood killed the unarmed officer after driving into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge on 22 March 2017. Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, were also killed. Masood was shot dead by armed officers during the attack. A police officer told the inquest that the procedure of having armed officers on the gate had been changed to having roving patrols around the area instead. This meant unarmed officers would be ""left as a matter of routine unprotected"", lawyer Dominic Adamson, representing PC Palmer's widow, Michelle, said. ""[This means that in] an attack such as the one that occurred an officer would be left with a spray and a baton against a large man with two knives. It is not an equal fight,"" he added. Westminster attack: What happened Victims of the Westminster terror attack Tears as partner watches bridge attack CCTV The inquest, taking place at the Old Bailey in London, was shown ""distressing"" and ""vivid"" footage of the moment PC Palmer was stabbed in New Palace Yard, as well as a ""chilling"" image of Masood with a carving knife in each hand. The footage showed the attacker being momentarily distracted by other officers, allowing PC Palmer time to run further into the yard. Masood followed, but within moments, plainclothes armed officers shot and killed him. The court was also shown mobile phone footage of people rushing to offer first aid. PC Doug Glaze, an unarmed officer posted on the gates, was asked whether a chance to save PC Palmer's life had been ""lost"" because no firearms officers were present at the gate. ""Certainly had firearms officers been there the threat maybe could have been neutralised quicker,"" PC Glaze said. A single red rose was placed in front of PC Palmer's helmet in Westminster ahead of his funeral Two of PC Palmer's sisters, Angela Clark and Michelle Palmer, also raised concerns that there had not been armed officers around to protect their brother on the day of the attack. Their lawyer, Susannah Stevens, said they were ""extremely distressed"" that nobody from the Metropolitan Police had spoken to them to let them know there was ""any issue"" around the absence of armed officers. She added that, if armed officers had been stationed at the gates, then PC Palmer and his colleagues would have been able ""to retreat"", instead of being left ""utterly helpless"". Nicholas Moss, counsel for the Parliamentary Authorities, said: ""PC Palmer's death resulted from Masood's evil actions, full stop."" He added that any questions of ""missed opportunities or steps that could have been taken"" would be properly explored. The inquest also heard from witnesses to the attack, including Carl Knight, who saw events unfold from the top deck of a bus. In his statement read to the court, Mr Knight said he heard a ""loud bang"" that sounded like a ""small explosion"" or a ""backfiring car"", as Masood's vehicle crashed into the railings outside Parliament. The witness saw a pedestrian approach him to ask what was happening, but Masood replied by swearing at him, revealing the knives, and saying: ""You don't want to mess with me."" Mr Knight said: ""As soon as the knives went up it went from car accident to attack."" By Helena Lee, BBC News correspondent A photograph of PC Palmer standing next to a smiling American tourist was put up on screens as the inquest began evidence relating to his death. It served as a reminder of the man described as the ""public face of Parliament"". The court was then taken back to that horrific day in March last year, as harrowing images and footage played out of PC Palmer being attacked. The frantic and desperate voices of those who tried to save him filled the hushed courtroom. They went on and on - the screaming, the panic, the horror. Witnesses came and went, telling their stories of what they remember from that day. For them reliving what they saw can't have been easy. Mr Knight said he saw pedestrians running away from Masood, including a woman hugging her child and saying: ""Don't kill me."" ""I could hear screaming coming from downstairs [on the bus] and women's voices shouting, 'Drive,' and, 'Let me off the bus,'"" he said in his statement. Antonia Kerridge, who was working in Portcullis House - where many MPs have their offices and which overlooks Parliament - told the court that she assumed there was some kind of demonstration when she heard a crash and the sound of cheering. But, after looking through the window, she said: ""I realised the cheering sound was people screaming."" Mr Knight saw Masood break into a run to the entrance to Parliament, saying: ""It was as if there were no guards on the gate."" He described a struggle between Masood and PC Palmer, saying: ""They were both grabbing each other and tumbling to the floor."" He said Masood ""seemed to get the better of the officer"". PC Doug Glaze said he thought at the time it was a ""Mumbai-style attack"" and shouted for ""firearms"". He told the court: ""I saw who I now know to be Masood inside the grounds. ""I noticed two extremely large knives, one in each hand. He was walking like a robot with his arms going up and down."" Asked about his reaction, PC Glaze added: ""I remember thinking 'We're going to die.'""

He took cryptic notes about that meeting that he now might be willing to discuss. After his August conviction on financial and tax fraud charges in Virginia, the prospect of Mr Manafort's walking away from his legal headaches a free man had been eliminated.

"A court sketch showed Paul Manafort, seated, with his attorney Richard Westling Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has agreed to co-operate with an investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the US election as part of a plea deal. In court on Friday, he pleaded guilty to two criminal charges in the deal with Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The agreement avoids a second trial on money laundering and other charges. The White House insists the guilty plea has absolutely nothing to do with President Donald Trump. Manafort was convicted last monthon eight counts of fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose bank accounts. That was the first criminal trial arising from the justice department's investigation into alleged interference by Russia in the 2016 election. Winners and losers from Manafort's plea deal Who is Trump's former campaign chair? However, the charges only relate to Manafort's political consulting with pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine, largely pre-dating his role with the Trump campaign. In an appearance at a federal court in Washington DC, Manafort - who is being held in custody - pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy against the US and one charge of conspiracy to obstruct justice. Correspondents say he faces up to 10 years in prison under the deal and will also forfeit four of his properties and the contents of several bank accounts. Deadlocked charges from the previous trial will be dismissed if there is ""successful co-operation"" with the special counsel. A lawyer for Manafort, Kevin Downing, told reporters outside the court that his client ""wanted to make sure that his family was able to remain safe and live a good life"". A bystander made his point as defence lawyer Kevin Downing addressed the media Manafort, 69, worked for Mr Trump's presidential campaign for five months in 2016 and was in charge when Mr Trump clinched the Republican party nomination.

"The incident happened at the family home in Claude Road, Cardiff A seven-year-old girl died after being strangled when her hooded top became caught on a door handle at her Cardiff home, an inquest has heard. Kimora Zondo was found after her mother awoke from a nap to be told by her nine-year-old son that the little girl was ""pretending to be sleepy"". Assistant coroner Nadim Bashir said there was ""no evidence"" of how Kimora became caught on the handle. He recorded a conclusion of accidental death at the hearing in Pontypridd. The inquest heard that Kimora had returned home from her school in the Roath area of the city on 7 March and changed from her school uniform into a pink hoodie. Her mother Vonnie Dube had fallen asleep and when she woke, she asked Kimora's brother where his sister was. In a statement read out to the court Ms Dube said her son stood up and said ""Kimora, mummy's awake"" and walked to the heavy passage door, which he tried to push. After finding the girl, they could get no response from her and the ambulance was called. She died later in hospital. An investigation into the death was launched by police, who interviewed her older brother twice about how he found his sister. He said: ""When I opened the door I found her head was hanging off the handle and took her to mum who checked her and started tickling her but there was nothing."" In the second police interview, he said: ""My mum asked me to call Kimora and I found her lying there and she was hanging from her hoodie. ""I took the hoodie off and put her on the carpet where mum tickled her. "" A post-mortem examination found that Kimora died from pressure to the neck caused by a ligature. The police and forensic pathologists carried out a number of recreations of how the incident had been described, with a dummy the same height and weight of Kimora, and used with replicas of her hoodie. Pathologist Dr Richard Jones told the inquest he was satisfied the mark on Kimora's neck had been caused by the hoodie, which had a hole in the top of the hood. He added: ""If you asked the question 'Is it possible for a child wearing a hooded top to actually be suspended from that handle in the manner which is suggested by her brother?' then yes it's possible but quite how she got into that position I can't say."" Coroner Mr Bashir said: ""In the circumstances the only possible explanation that can be given in this case was a hole in the hoodie and Kimora was in the hallway with her head close to the the handle to allow her to get caught on the handle, was unable to extricate herself in the second it would take to lose consciousness, and death quickly thereafter.""

"The Spiez laboratory tests chemical, biological and nuclear threats Two Russian men were arrested earlier this year on suspicion of spying on a Swiss laboratory investigating the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, a newspaper investigation has claimed. Swiss publication Tages Anzeiger and Dutch paper NRC said they were arrested in the Netherlands earlier this year. The Swiss lab analysed samples from the poisoning of the former Russian double agent in the UK. It has also dealt with suspected chemical weapons from the war in Syria. The two men were expelled from The Netherlands shortly after their arrest, which had not been reported until now. A spokeswoman for Swiss intelligence told the BBC that the agency had been actively involved in ""the case of the Russian spies"", without mentioning the laboratory at Spiez, near Bern. But Tages Anzeiger said the Swiss intelligence agency had confirmed the findings of its joint investigation with NRC. The report says the two men had equipment that could have been used to break into the laboratory's computer systems, and also alleged that they worked for Russian intelligence. Britain has said that two Russian intelligence officers carried out the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March. Both survived, but local residentDawn Sturgess died after exposure to the same nerve agent months later. Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov say they were tourists visiting the English town of Salisbury NRC said the two alleged spies targeting the Swiss lab were not the same men accused of the poisoning. It is not clear exactly when the arrests were made. But British intelligence are said to have been involved in the intelligence operation, suggesting it occurred after the Salisbury poisonings. Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Russian spy: What happened to the Skripals? Isabelle Graber, head of communications at the Swiss Federal Intelligence Service (FIS) said the agency had ""participated actively in this operation together with its Dutch and British partners"". The BBC understands that the British police investigation into the Salisbury poisonings was not involved. The intended target of the alleged espionage is a designated lab for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). In addition to research on dangerous infections, it deals with biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons research. In that capacity, it has examined samples from the Syrian conflict, where the Damascus government - Russia's ally - has been accused of using chemical weapons against civilians. Russia, meanwhile, has dismissed the reports as false. The Russian embassy in Bern, near the Spiez laboratory, told Reuters: ""We consider such false statements simply absurd and nothing other than another attempt to stoke an anti-Russian atmosphere.""

"Gary Gardner was accused of using some of the money raised to release a ""flop"" charity song A fundraiser has been jailed for two and a half years after pocketing cash collected for the young son of murdered soldier Lee Rigby. Gary Gardner, 56, of Medbourne, raised about Â£24,000 but only Â£4,000 made its way to any charity, a court heard. Leicester Crown Court was told Gardner put on three truck-pull events attended by thousands, including Fusilier Rigby's widow Rebecca and son Jack. He was convicted of two counts of fraud at Leicester Crown Court on Thursday. Live updates from the East Midlands The court was told Gardner, a lorry driver, put on the truck-pull events in 2013, 2014 and 2015 in the Leicestershire villages of Medbourne and Market Harborough, and at Stroud in Gloucestershire, which Mrs Rigby and Jack attended. He also spent Â£5,000 on producing and promoting a music single which only raised Â£200 and he knew would ""flop"". Gardner, who has previous convictions for theft and fraud dating back to 1980 and 1995, said it failed because of ""atrocious weather"" at the launch event in London's Trafalgar Square in February 2014. The jury were told he used some of the charity funds to ""prop up"" his overdrawn bank account. Lee Rigby was killed outside Woolwich Barracks in south-east London in May 2013 He claimed he wanted to raise money for Jack and causes linked to Medbourne village shortly after Fusilier Rigby was killed outside Woolwich Barracks in south-east London five years ago. However, Mrs Rigby told the court she and her son had ""never received a penny from him."" In a victim impact statement, Mrs Rigby added she was ""disgusted"" at Gardner's actions. She said the proceedings had placed her in a ""daunting"" emotional place and forced her to relive her attendance at the trial of her husband's killers. ""I feel that this matter with Mr Gardner will draw the eyes of the world upon us again,"" she said. ""I feel disgusted about Mr Gardner not making good his promises with regard to my son and abusing my family name."" Sentencing Gardner, Recorder Helen Malcolm QC said: ""There has been an impact on every one of those who volunteered to assist you."" She added: ""Not one penny of the sums that you collected have been paid to Jack Rigby. ""I accept all the evidence that you worked very hard. In your favour I accept that you did not set out with the intention to defraud. ""The fact remains that what you did was undoubtedly dishonest. I would say it was indeed despicable."" The jury found him guilty on two counts of fraud. He was cleared of one count which alleged he failed to keep a record of the amounts raised from fundraisers.

"Wetherspoons chairman Tim Martin says its prices may have to rise Wetherspoons has reported record annual sales and profits, but warned that prices and costs are likely to rise in the coming months. The pub chain led by Tim Martin said like-for-like sales, which exclude new pubs, rose 5% in the year to 29 July. Pre-tax profits jumped 4.3% to Â£107.2m. Although sales were up 5.5% in the first six weeks of the company's new financial year, it said taxes, labour and interest costs were expected to be higher than last year. That meant the price of its food and drinks ""may have to go up a bit"", Mr Martin told the BBC. Wetherspoons is famous for its rock-bottom prices and no-frills pubs, which do not play music and only show a limited amount of televised sports to keep overheads as low as possible. Failing to show the World Cup over the summer meant the chain missed out on a sales boost enjoyed by rival chains such as Greene King, said Neil Wilson at Markets.com. ""Growth cooled off over the hot summer - full year sales growth came in at 5% on a like-for-like basis, slower than the 5.2% registered in the nine months to the start of July,"" he added. ""There was clearly an impact from the hot weather as Wetherspoons pubs tend to lack the outdoor spaces customers seek when it's sunny."" However, Mr Wilson added: ""Underlying sales growth is very strong and investors should not be distracted by the short-term seasonal effects."" Shares fell 1.3% to Â£12.63 on Friday - lower than the 2018 peak of Â£13.25 and valuing the company at about Â£1.3bn. Mr Martin said Wetherspoons would be opening fewer pubs and admitted it may have added too many second or third outlets in some towns in recent years. The chain has about 900 pubs in the UK. The prominent Brexit supporter said he hoped Britain left the European Union without an agreement: ""A deal is a bad thing - if we don't have a deal and embrace free trade, prices will go down in the shops. ""We will be in a much stronger position on a free trade basis that some people call a 'no deal',"" Mr Martin added. In June, the chain said it wouldstop selling champagne and proseccoand replace them with non-European Union sparkling wines. The Wetherspoons founder also believed the UK would need a ""considerable level of immigration"" in the coming decades. ""Although I believe in Brexit, I think the UK's got quite a low birth rate and that we need a gradually rising population, and that we will need a considerable level of immigration over the next 10, 20, 30 years to be a successful economy,"" Mr Martin said. ""Having said that, I think that uncontrolled immigration EU-style is not a good thing.""

"Fiona Jayne Scourfield was an animal lover who volunteered with a charity A boy who killed his stepmother with an axe and samurai sword was ""obsessed"" with watching extreme violence. Rueben Brathwaite, 17, admitted murdering Fiona Scourfield, 54, at Broadmoor Farm in Laugharne, Carmarthenshire, on 6 March. Brathwaite was sentenced to life in prison at Swansea Crown Court, with a minimum of 15 years. Judge Mr Justice Simon Picken said it was a ""savage attack against a defenceless woman"". Brathwaite killed dog rescuer Ms Scourfield before trying to upload pictures of her body to the internet. The court heard the teenager developed an interest in watching online videos of beheading, suicide and mass murder in the run up to the murder. Rueben Brathwaite had returned from school before murdering his stepmother Prosecutor Paul Hipkin said: ""The images demonstrated murder, death and mutilation."" The court heard Brathwaite arrived home from a ""normal school day"" and later in the afternoon, he lured Ms Scourfield outside and repeatedly struck her over the head with an axe. He then cut her throat with a samurai sword taken from underneath his father's bed. Following the attack the teenager called the police, confessing to the murder. Mr Hipkin said when officers asked why he had murdered Ms Scourfield, he said he was ""fed up of life"" and saw killing his stepmother as a ""way out"". Brathwaite considered attacking his father but thought he would be ""too powerful"" and would fight back. In the 999 call to police, he said: ""I've just killed someone. The person is Fiona Scourfield. ""I know she's dead. Her pulse has stopped. There's no signs of life. I hit her so many times in the head, about eight to nine times with the axe."" He later told police his stepmother took good care of him and he was ""sure she loves me and my father"". Paul Hobson, defending, said the violent content Brathwaite regularly watched in the months leading to the killing meant ""after time, a natural revulsion to pain and crime became deadened to him"". Rueben Brathwaite confessed to the murder after calling police After the attack, Brathwaite took two photos of the victim's body which he tried to upload to a website, but failed. Mr Hobson said his client had ""committed a dreadful crime"" and Ms Scourfield's death was ""brutal and served no purpose"". Brathwaite told the court: ""I believe without the right level of help I believe I will remain a danger to myself."" Teen admits axe and sword murder Axe murder victim 'kind and loving' In a letter to the court, Brathwaite said his stepmother was a ""great believer in me"" and wanted him to go to university, adding she had ""so much love for me"". Ms Scourfield was described as ""loving and caring"" by family and volunteered with the German Shepherd Rescue UK charity. Fiona Scourfield was killed at Broadmoor Farm, between Laugharne and St Clears Mr Justice Picken said Brathwaite complained of loneliness, unhappiness and depression but had not been suffering from any mental health condition. He added: ""No doubt inspired by the graphic images seen on the internet in the months before the attack, you attempted to upload images of the attack to the internet. ""Your obsession went to watching material including mass murders and massacres."" A victim impact statement read on behalf of Ms Scourfield's mother Charlotte said: ""Fiona made Rueben warmly welcome and made sure he was properly dressed and equipped for school. ""I believe there was a loving bond between them. My life is destroyed."" After the hearing, Det Supt Gary Phillips from Dyfed-Powys Police said Ms Scourfield ""lost her life in a savage and unprovoked attack"".

"It was a Sunday last August and Kirstie Walkden's nine-month-old daughter, Amy, had been out of sorts for a few days. Worried, she decided to take her to the local accident and emergency unit, where Amy was diagnosed with an ear infection and sent home with some medicine. Two days later, her condition had worsened. She had a sky-high temperature, was no longer eating or drinking and had gone floppy. Her mother took her back to the hospital. ""All hell broke loose,"" says Mrs Walkden, 29. ""Within an hour, she was placed in an induced coma. She was diagnosed with sepsis and then later peneumococcal meningitis."" It was 18 days before she was ready to be discharged. Amy is now doing well - although the family will not know for a few years whether there are any long-term effects. ""It could have been so different,"" her mother says. ""If we had got her to hospital any later, she might not have survived."" Mrs Walkden, from the north-west of England, is now backing a plea by the Meningitis Research Foundation calling for more urgency and monitoring to ensure that parents receive the right advice about potential bacterial meningitis and sepsis cases among babies and young children. ""We felt reassured when the hospital told us it was an ear infection,"" she says. ""We were not told to look out for anything else. ""If we had, we might have brought her in sooner."" Guidance issued by the NHS advisory body the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) states the NHS should provide parents with ""safety netting"" advice if they bring in children with symptoms that could be a sign of meningitis and sepsis. The conditions can be difficult to spot at first because the symptoms, including a high temperature and vomiting, are similar to those of many less serious ailments. But a report published by the Meningitis Research Foundation has suggested this safety netting does not always happen. It cites research from last year that suggests nearly a third of young babies with meningitis receive inappropriate early treatment that delays parents seeking help. The report includes personal accounts of more than 100 parents, many of whom were sent home with little advice following their first visit to a health professional. Charity chief executive Vinny Smith says without safety netting advice advice parents can be put off seeking medical attention soon after being seen at hospital or by a GP - but these non-specific symptoms can turn lethal in just a few hours. ""When a child is ill and getting rapidly worse, parents should not be afraid to seek urgent medical help - even if they've already been seen by a doctor that same day,"" she says. Meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. It can affect anyone, but is most common in babies, young children, teenagers and young adults. Meningitis can be very serious if not treated quickly. It can cause life-threatening blood poisoning - sepsis - and can result in permanent damage to the brain or nerves. The symptoms include: a temperature of 38C or above being sick a headache a blotchy rash that doesn't fade when a glass is rolled over it a stiff neck a dislike of bright lights drowsiness or unresponsiveness seizures These symptoms can appear in any order and some may not appear. The illnesses are sometimes known as meningococcal disease. In the past decade, there have been between 700 and 1,300 reported cases of meningococcal disease each year in the UK. Between 5% and 10% of cases result in death. Of those who survive, 10% to 15% can be left with severe and disabling after-effects such as loss of hearing and sight, brain injury and damage to major organs or loss of limbs. The government in England says it has already taken action. A working group established by ministers has made a number of recommendations to improve care, including that it should be documented in patient's notes when safety netting information has been provided. The NHS is still in the process of rolling out the recommendations. The Royal College of GPs also says it has made the issue a top priority in recent years. It has produced a toolkit to help GPs manage and identify cases. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, who chairs the Royal College of GPs, says: ""GPs know all too well that meningitis and indeed any form of sepsis can lead to serious complications and in some cases can be fatal, if not recognised and treated in a timely manner. ""But the challenge for all clinicians is that initial symptoms often present in exactly the same way as common viral illnesses such as flu, making both conditions very hard to spot in the early stages of disease. ""GPs are on permanent alert for signs of meningitis in their patients and we do speak to the parents of babies and young children about what they need to look out for which may indicate that an illness could be developing into something much more serious.""

"Kate Moss has distanced herself from her controversial ""nothing tastes as good as skinny feels"" mantra. Almost ten years after she was heavily criticised for the quote, the British model has been speaking about her now infamous phrase. When it was published in women's fashion website WWD in 2009, the quote immediately caused an uproar. At the time, she was accused of encouraging eating disorders. Speaking to NBC's Megyn Kelly, she appeared visibly uncomfortable as the quote was mentioned and said it was just a ""jingle"". ""My friend used to say it,"" she said. ""Because you know, we were all living together, and we'd go for the biscuits and go, 'Oh, nothing tastes as gâ.â.â.â' It's a little jingle."" Kate Moss modelling in the 90s In the 2009 interview, Kate was asked if she had any mantras and said: ""There are loads of mottos. There's 'nothing tastes as good as skinny feels'. That's one of them."" She added: ""You try and remember, but it never works."" The quote was immediately criticised, especially after it was adopted by a number of pro-anorexia websites. Today, Kate says she believes the modelling industry has changed for the better. ""There's so much more diversity now, I think it's right. ""There's so many different sizes and colours and heights. Why would you just be a one-size model and being represented for all of these people?"" Rihanna's lingerie show praised for diversity Allow Twitter content?

Kate Moss says she wouldn't let her daughter pose topless like she did In the early days of her career, Kate was dubbed the face of ""heroin chic"".

"Adam Howells was charged more than Â£10 to have his lost wallet and money returned A rail firm is changing its policy following a backlash after a passenger was charged 10% of the cash found in his lost wallet for its return. Adam Howells had to pay Â£8.60 commission - as well as a Â£2 administration fee - to have his wallet returned after he left it on a train. Arriva Trains Wales said it would return the commission to him and change its policy immediately. It comes after the fee was described as ""outrageous"" on social media.

"The Bank of England's governor has warned the cabinet that a chaotic no-deal Brexit could crash house prices and send another financial shock through the economy. Mark Carney met senior ministers on Thursday to discuss the risks of a disorderly exit from the EU. His worst-case scenario was that house prices could fall as much as 35% over three years, a source told the BBC. The warning echoes some of the Bank's previous comments. The Bank of England routinely carries out ""stress tests"" to check whether the banking system can withstand extreme financial shocks. Its latest one was conducted in November, when it said a 33% fall in house prices could occur in a worst-case scenario. Several reports said that the Bank governor also told the Downing Street meeting that mortgage rates could spiral, the pound could fall and inflation would rise, and countless homeowners could be left in negative equity. Speaking on Friday in Dublin, Mr Carney said the stress test was aimed at making sure the the largest UK banks could continue to meet the needs of the country through ""even through a disorderly Brexit, however unlikely that may be"". ""Our job, after all, is not to hope for the best but to plan for the worst,"" he added. Preparing for two 'no deal' scenarios Brexit papers: What no deal could mean Ahmed: Carney and the ""no deal"" Brexit threat Brexit could 're-ignite conflict' in Northern Ireland Bank holds rates amid Brexit uncertainty May says Â£39bn bill linked to Brexit deal Mr Carney, who has just agreed to stay on as governor of the central bank until 2020, has faced strong criticism in the past, with Brexiteers accusing him of being part of the Remain camp. Kamal Ahmed, economics editor It appears that the Governor wasn't providing the Cabinet with a forecast of what the Bank believes would happen in the event of a no deal Brexit. He was briefing the Cabinet on what preparations the Bank was making if that does happen, including last November's stress test. It was not a forecast. It was an apocalyptic test where the Bank deliberately sets the parameters beyond what might reasonably be expected to occur. The major banks all passed the test, giving reassurance that the financial system can cope with whatever happens next year. The Governor believes that a ""no deal"" scenario would be bad for the economy. But not as bad as the headlines today which are based on a doomsday scenario that is not actually forecast to happen. Read more from Kamal here In August,Mr Carney told the BBC that the risk of a no-deal Brexit was ""uncomfortably high"". That comment prompted leading Tory eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg to call Mr Carney ""the high priest of Project Fear"", while former minister Iain Duncan Smith said ""there is no such thing as a no-deal"" and the Bank ""struggled to understand how this would work"". Independent property expert Henry Pryor told the BBC that Mr Carney was ""not predicting Armageddon, he was not predicting house prices would fall by a third, they are just making sure that if, for some extraordinary reason anything was to go horribly wrong, the bank is prepared."" But he warned house prices were likely to fall in the first half of the 2019 as people put off buying amid the Brexit uncertainty, while the number of sellers, ""driven by death, debt and divorce"" would remain about the same. Mark Wahlberg reveals gruelling regimen Dead rat in soup costs restaurant $190m Apple unveils iPhone XS and new Watch Following the Downing Street meeting, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said ministers remained confident of a Brexit deal, but had agreed to ""ramp up"" their no-deal planning. ""As a responsible government, we need to plan for every eventuality. The Cabinet agreed that no-deal remains an unlikely but possible scenario in six months' time,"" the spokesman said. The Bank of England declined to comment. The cabinet meeting was part of a series of no-deal planning sessions designed to discuss the ""unlikely"" scenario that the UK leaves the EU without an agreement in place. After each meeting, planning papers are published on various subjects. On Thursday, the papers disclosedthat UK car drivers may have to get an international driving permit if they want to drive in some European countries after a no-deal Brexit. The government said that after March 2019 ""your driving licence may no longer be valid by itself"" in the EU, in its latest no-deal planning papers. The papers also warned that Britons travelling to the EU may need to make sure their passports have six months left to run.

"This video can not be played Was 2008 the worst time to graduate? In 2008, I was one of the 1.5 million students who graduated from university in the US. And, like everyone else, I was caught off guard. Whatever we expected then, the reality today is that as a generation, we have more debt, fewer children and quite a few scars. A decade on, there has been quite a bit of handwringing about what's changed since the financial crisis. And I'm convinced that the biggest fallout isn't the increased regulation, or the jailed bankers (or lack thereof), but the impact it had on those of us who were just entering the workforce in 2008. To find out more, I've travelled around the country asking experts and fellow 2008 graduates - what happened to us? In the decade since the recession, American women had 4.8 million fewer babies thandemographers were expecting,external. No, that isn't a typo. ""Every year when I look at the fertility data I expect the number of births to go up and it hasn't,"" says University of New Hampshire Professor Kenneth Johnson. Prof Johnson says part of the fertility decline is attributable to women in their early and late 20s having fewer children than expected - in other words, my classmates and those who came after us. And it's not getting better. The gap is getting wider - which is why he brings up a historical parallel. ""There were a group of women who were in their early 20s at the beginning of the Great Depression who never made up for the births that they didn't have. ""More of them are childless than any group of American women before or since."" The question, says Prof Johnson, is if we too will simply forego births like the women of the Depression or if we're simply just waiting longer. Nora Carroll graduated from the University of Nevada Las Vegas in 2008 and says she delayed starting a family due to the crash. ""I spent the last decade really concentrating on getting a stable career, saving enough money so I can purchase a house,"" she says. ""All of that just takes time [especially because] being in a lower paying job [it] takes a little bit longer."" She is now expecting her first child. In the UK, research commissioned by the BBC found that people who are 30-39 years old now were worst affected by the financial crisis - losing on average 7.2% in real terms, or Â£2,057 ($2,684) a year between 2008 and 2017. That's pretty similar to what happened in the US. Americans born in the mid-1980s have accumulated 34% less wealth than predicted based on previous generations, theSt Louis Federal Reserve,externalfound. One reason? We started out with less. The average salary of a newly-minted college graduate in 2008 was $46,000, according to theBureau of Labor Statistics,external. That was 8% less, adjusted for inflation, than college graduates aged 25 to 34 earned in 2002. Just two out of five millennials are invested in the stock market. And even those of us who do invest have ventured only about $7,000, according to the Federal Reserve. That's not simply because we're money-strapped. ""Investors' willingness to bear financial risk depends on personal experiences of macroeconomic history"", economists at the University of California-Berkeley havefound,external. In other words, if you are a young person who, say, watchedthe Dow Jones plummet over 500 points in one day,external- your appetite for risk is slim. So even though the S&P 500 officiallyentered the longest bull marketin history this summer - rising over 325% since the depths of the financial crisis - well, we haven't really benefited from all those stock market gains. The homeownership rate of millennials between the ages of 25 and 34 was 37% in 2015 - 8% lower than that of prior generations, according to theUrban Institute,external. In the UK, the home-ownership rate for millennials hasnearly halved. There are plenty of explanations - not least fewer children, less wealth and coming of age after the housing market imploded. When we do manage to buy property, it's worth a lot less than the average first-homes of prior generations. The average median home value for someone aged 18-33 in 2013was $133,000,externalcompared to $197,000 for the same age group in 2007. Trust in institutions was on the decline well before the financial crisis, but as a generation, our faith is especially low. Just 19% of millennials agree with the statement that ""generally speaking, most people can be trusted"" - compared to 31% for the generation before us, and 40% for our parents' generation,according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.,external And, no surprise here, when it comes to institutions,we trust Wall Street least of all,external. ""Wall Street certainly took a hit,"" says Eric Fraser, who graduated from the University of Central Florida in 2008 and took what he thought was an innocuous job in the financial services industry. ""At that time it didn't seem villainous until these names and faces started hitting the news."" That caused him to re-think what it was like to work in the industry. ""I had a bit of hesitation to explain, 'yes I do work in financial services but no I'm not a subprime mortgage lender or anything like that.'"" Today, he says there is one silver lining to having had a front row seat to that dissolution in trust. ""I think entering the workforce around that time really gave me a sense of humility and I don't know if I would have had that same mindset if I had graduated earlier.""

"PC Keith Palmer was unarmed as he was attacked by Khalid Masood The family of PC Keith Palmer have raised concerns about the lack of armed protection at the gates of Parliament during last year's Westminster attack. His widow's lawyer told an inquest into the victims' deaths that he had just ""a spray and a baton"" to protect himself. Khalid Masood killed the unarmed officer after driving into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge on 22 March 2017. Kurt Cochran, 54, Leslie Rhodes, 75, Aysha Frade, 44, and Andreea Cristea, 31, were also killed. Masood was shot dead by armed officers during the attack. A police officer told the inquest that the procedure of having armed officers on the gate had been changed to having roving patrols around the area instead. This meant unarmed officers would be ""left as a matter of routine unprotected"", lawyer Dominic Adamson, representing PC Palmer's widow, Michelle, said. ""[This means that in] an attack such as the one that occurred an officer would be left with a spray and a baton against a large man with two knives. It is not an equal fight,"" he added. Westminster attack: What happened Victims of the Westminster terror attack Tears as partner watches bridge attack CCTV The inquest, taking place at the Old Bailey in London, was shown ""distressing"" and ""vivid"" footage of the moment PC Palmer was stabbed in New Palace Yard, as well as a ""chilling"" image of Masood with a carving knife in each hand. The footage showed the attacker being momentarily distracted by other officers, allowing PC Palmer time to run further into the yard. Masood followed, but within moments, plainclothes armed officers shot and killed him. The court was also shown mobile phone footage of people rushing to offer first aid. PC Doug Glaze, an unarmed officer posted on the gates, was asked whether a chance to save PC Palmer's life had been ""lost"" because no firearms officers were present at the gate. ""Certainly had firearms officers been there the threat maybe could have been neutralised quicker,"" PC Glaze said. A single red rose was placed in front of PC Palmer's helmet in Westminster ahead of his funeral Two of PC Palmer's sisters, Angela Clark and Michelle Palmer, also raised concerns that there had not been armed officers around to protect their brother on the day of the attack. Their lawyer, Susannah Stevens, said they were ""extremely distressed"" that nobody from the Metropolitan Police had spoken to them to let them know there was ""any issue"" around the absence of armed officers. She added that, if armed officers had been stationed at the gates, then PC Palmer and his colleagues would have been able ""to retreat"", instead of being left ""utterly helpless"". Nicholas Moss, counsel for the Parliamentary Authorities, said: ""PC Palmer's death resulted from Masood's evil actions, full stop."" He added that any questions of ""missed opportunities or steps that could have been taken"" would be properly explored. The inquest also heard from witnesses to the attack, including Carl Knight, who saw events unfold from the top deck of a bus. In his statement read to the court, Mr Knight said he heard a ""loud bang"" that sounded like a ""small explosion"" or a ""backfiring car"", as Masood's vehicle crashed into the railings outside Parliament. The witness saw a pedestrian approach him to ask what was happening, but Masood replied by swearing at him, revealing the knives, and saying: ""You don't want to mess with me."" Mr Knight said: ""As soon as the knives went up it went from car accident to attack."" By Helena Lee, BBC News correspondent A photograph of PC Palmer standing next to a smiling American tourist was put up on screens as the inquest began evidence relating to his death. It served as a reminder of the man described as the ""public face of Parliament"". The court was then taken back to that horrific day in March last year, as harrowing images and footage played out of PC Palmer being attacked. The frantic and desperate voices of those who tried to save him filled the hushed courtroom. They went on and on - the screaming, the panic, the horror. Witnesses came and went, telling their stories of what they remember from that day. For them reliving what they saw can't have been easy. Mr Knight said he saw pedestrians running away from Masood, including a woman hugging her child and saying: ""Don't kill me."" ""I could hear screaming coming from downstairs [on the bus] and women's voices shouting, 'Drive,' and, 'Let me off the bus,'"" he said in his statement. Antonia Kerridge, who was working in Portcullis House - where many MPs have their offices and which overlooks Parliament - told the court that she assumed there was some kind of demonstration when she heard a crash and the sound of cheering. But, after looking through the window, she said: ""I realised the cheering sound was people screaming."" Mr Knight saw Masood break into a run to the entrance to Parliament, saying: ""It was as if there were no guards on the gate."" He described a struggle between Masood and PC Palmer, saying: ""They were both grabbing each other and tumbling to the floor."" He said Masood ""seemed to get the better of the officer"". PC Doug Glaze said he thought at the time it was a ""Mumbai-style attack"" and shouted for ""firearms"". He told the court: ""I saw who I now know to be Masood inside the grounds. ""I noticed two extremely large knives, one in each hand. He was walking like a robot with his arms going up and down."" Asked about his reaction, PC Glaze added: ""I remember thinking 'We're going to die.'""

"Mr Freeman is an ex-science minister and MP for Mid Norfolk MP George Freeman has said he will put his name forward to be the next Tory leader if ""asked to"" amid continuing speculation over Theresa May's future. It comes after the ex-minister, who once chaired Mrs May's policy board, said there should be leadership contest next summer after Brexit was settled. He said he was ""no Michael Heseltine"" and would ""stand back"" if top figures from the ""next generation"" emerged. Mrs May has said she will serve as long as her party wants her to. Michael, now Lord, Heseltine launched a Conservative leadership challenge to Margaret Thatcher in 1990, triggering a contest won by John Major, after Lady Thatcher resigned as PM. Kuenssberg: What Tory MPs privately assume Brexiteers discuss leadership challenge Davidson: PM critics must 'quit the noise' Earlier this week, pro-Brexit MPs unhappy with Theresa May's Chequers blueprint for future co-operation with the EU openly discussed her future. This video can not be played Conservative MP George Freeman calls for a ""new generation leader"" after Brexit This led to a backlash from senior figures such as Michael Gove and Iain Duncan Smith, who described leadership speculation as ""loose talk"" that should be stamped upon. Downing Street has insisted there is no vacancy and the PM is focused on delivering the best outcome for the UK as it prepares to leave the EU this Spring. Negotiations on the terms of the UK's exit are entering their final stages, with both sides hoping for an agreement by the start of November at the latest. The UK and EU want to agree an outline statement on their future relations at the same time. By BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake If you're thinking ""should I know who this guy is?"", don't worry, the answer - unless you're a keen Westminster watcher - is no. As George Freeman himself said - ""If I was still advising Theresa May..."" - which of course he isn't, having resigned as the chair of her policy board in November last year. But should the prime minister be worried? It's hard to ignore the fact that an MP has pointedly said in public that it is time for their leader to set a date for their departure. And this week others were slapped down by senior colleagues for expressing their frustration with Theresa May's leadership over Brexit. But if George Freeman has an organised campaign of supporters in Parliament, which he would need to be a serious contender, he is keeping it very well hidden. He also qualified his own leadership intention with the use of that key two letter word 'if' - ""If people want me to in Parliament, I will,"" he said. As one MP put it; ""I can't imagine who would ask him."" Ouch. But Tories who back a Canada-style trade deal with the EU have threatened to block the PM's Chequers plan, which proposes a much closer relationship, when the issue is voted on in Parliament in the autumn. Mr Freeman, who voted Remain in the 2016 referendum and was seen as ally of former leader David Cameron, quit as Mrs May's policy adviser in November last year over concerns about the direction of the party. He told BBC Radio Norfolk it should be up to a new leader to decide the UK's future relationship with the EU. The Mid-Norfolk MP said there should be a leadership contest next summer, lasting no more than three months, to determine the party's future direction, and he was prepared to throw his hat into the ring. ""If the question is 'will I stand, the answer is if people want me to in Parliament, I will."" The next leader, he said, should come from the new crop of Tory politicians elected since 2010 - ""not the old faces"" as he described them - at least 10 of whom he suggested could do the job. ""I would like to see the whole range of candidates stand. I would like a democratic Conservative Party choose the right leader. I'd like to see the nation see the breadth of talent we have"". But Mr Freeman indicated that he would not challenge Mrs May and would ""stand back and champion"" another candidate if they represented the ""right package of ideas"". ""I did not sit down with a plan 20 years ago to become prime minister,"" he added. Mr Freeman said the advantage of having a contest next summer was that the issue of whether Brexit would happen would be settled by then and the party would, instead ""be debating where we take it"". And he said the Conservatives needed to focus on other issues, apart from Brexit and deficit, if they were to persuade young people that they were not ""technocratic, burnt-out and energy less"". Fellow Tory MP Tom Tugendhat has also called for ""a generational shift"" in the leadership of the party if and when Mrs May stands down. He told the Spectator,external: ""The vast majority of my generation wants to stop banging on about Europe. We want to talk about the optimism we feel in this country.'

"The incident happened at the family home in Claude Road, Cardiff A seven-year-old girl died after being strangled when her hooded top became caught on a door handle at her Cardiff home, an inquest has heard. Kimora Zondo was found after her mother awoke from a nap to be told by her nine-year-old son that the little girl was ""pretending to be sleepy"". Assistant coroner Nadim Bashir said there was ""no evidence"" of how Kimora became caught on the handle. He recorded a conclusion of accidental death at the hearing in Pontypridd. The inquest heard that Kimora had returned home from her school in the Roath area of the city on 7 March and changed from her school uniform into a pink hoodie. Her mother Vonnie Dube had fallen asleep and when she woke, she asked Kimora's brother where his sister was. In a statement read out to the court Ms Dube said her son stood up and said ""Kimora, mummy's awake"" and walked to the heavy passage door, which he tried to push. After finding the girl, they could get no response from her and the ambulance was called. She died later in hospital. An investigation into the death was launched by police, who interviewed her older brother twice about how he found his sister. He said: ""When I opened the door I found her head was hanging off the handle and took her to mum who checked her and started tickling her but there was nothing."" In the second police interview, he said: ""My mum asked me to call Kimora and I found her lying there and she was hanging from her hoodie. ""I took the hoodie off and put her on the carpet where mum tickled her. "" A post-mortem examination found that Kimora died from pressure to the neck caused by a ligature. The police and forensic pathologists carried out a number of recreations of how the incident had been described, with a dummy the same height and weight of Kimora, and used with replicas of her hoodie. Pathologist Dr Richard Jones told the inquest he was satisfied the mark on Kimora's neck had been caused by the hoodie, which had a hole in the top of the hood. He added: ""If you asked the question 'Is it possible for a child wearing a hooded top to actually be suspended from that handle in the manner which is suggested by her brother?' then yes it's possible but quite how she got into that position I can't say."" Coroner Mr Bashir said: ""In the circumstances the only possible explanation that can be given in this case was a hole in the hoodie and Kimora was in the hallway with her head close to the the handle to allow her to get caught on the handle, was unable to extricate herself in the second it would take to lose consciousness, and death quickly thereafter.""

"A security analysis of cyber-attacks against universities and colleges in the UK has discovered staff or students could often be responsible, rather than organised crime or hacking groups. A government-funded agency that provides cyber-security has examined the timing of 850 attacks in 2017-18. Jisc found a ""clear pattern"" of attacks being concentrated during term times and during the working day. When the holidays begin, ""the number of attacks decreases dramatically"". The analysis of cyber-attacks on the research and academic network concludes there are ""suspicions that staff or students could be in the frame"". Rather than criminal gangs or agents of foreign powers, the findings suggest many of the attacks on universities and colleges are more likely to have been caused by disgruntled staff or students wanting to provoke ""chaos"". ""It's notoriously difficult to identify individual cyber-criminals,"" says Dr John Chapman, head of security operations for Jisc, (formerly the Joint Information Systems Committee). But the agency, which provides internet and computer services across the higher and further education sectors, has produced a report showing that the peaks and troughs of attacks mirror when students and staff were most likely to be present. They increased from 08:00 or 09:00 and then tailed off in the early afternoon. There was a very sharp decline in attacks in the Christmas, Easter and summer breaks and during half-terms - with attacks rising again sharply when terms resumed. The incidence varied from more than 60 a week in some parts of the autumn term, down to one a week in mid-summer. There were more than 850 attacks across the academic year, aimed at almost 190 universities and colleges. This was up from fewer than 600 attacks on about 140 institutions in the previous year. These were sustained attempts at disrupting networks and did not include incidents such as phishing frauds or attempts to use ""malware"" or ""ransomware"". UK universities targeted by cyber-thieves Newcastle University students targeted by cyber-scam Top university under 'ransomware' cyber-attack Dr Chapman says the attempts could include sophisticated state-sponsored cyber-attacks from other countries and ""serious criminal players"", targeting research or trying to steal sensitive information. But the analysis suggests many of the attacks on networks seem to be closer to home. These include so-called ""denial of service"" or ""distributed denial of service"" (DDoS) attacks where hackers try to stop or overload networks, crashing computer systems. In one case, the security team monitored a pattern of attacks on an institution and saw they began at 09:00, finished at 12:00, began again at 13:00 and then finished about 15:00 to 16:00. This raised the question whether this was caused by a student or member of staff, who took a break at lunchtime. Another investigation located the source of what seemed to be a four-day cyber-attack on a university. It was found to be coming from a university hall of residence and had been the result of an online gamer who had been ""attacking another gamer to try and secure an advantage"". Other reasons could be a misplaced sense of ""fun"" at disrupting networks, ""kudos among peers"" for causing chaos or because of a grudge over poor grades or ""failure to secure a pay rise"". The Jisc analysis says another factor in the summer dip could have been an international effort to take down so-called ""stresser"" sites. These websites provide the means for carrying out ""denial of service"" attacks, which Jisc says can be sold ""under the pretence"" that the buyer wants to carry out a test to see how well their own network would withstand such an attack. ""So, there is evidence... to suggest that students and staff may well be responsible for many of the DDoS attacks we see,"" says Dr Chapman. ""If connectivity to the network is lost for any length of time, it can be catastrophic for any organisation, both financially and reputationally.""

"Mark Serwotka rejoined the Labour Party in 2016, after 25 years A trade union leader has been recorded suggesting that Israel ""created"" the anti-Semitism row in the Labour Party. In a recording published by the Independent, PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka suggested the country had created the story to hide what he called its own ""atrocities"". Labour Against Anti-Semitismsaid,externalMr Serwotka had brought the entire TUC into disrepute and he should resign. The PCS said he had made the point that anti-Semitism must be opposed. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims What is the anti-Semitism row doing to Labour? Can Labour de-toxify the anti-Semitism row? Labour adopts full anti-Semitism definition Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ""By trading in conspiracy theories and stock anti-Semitic tropes, Mark Serwotka has demeaned his office. ""The only reason Labour's anti-Semitism crisis remains in the media is Labour's failure to deal with it. ""Mr Serwotka should apologise or face disciplinary action from the TUC and the Public and Commercial Services Union."" And Matt Zarb-Cousin, Jeremy Corbyn's former spokesman, said the comments were wrong and ""very unhelpful"". TheIndependent reported,externalthat Mr Serwokta had told an event organised by the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign at the TUC this week that there was no place for anti-Semitism in the Labour movement. ""I think it's unfortunate that the Labour Party allowed a lot of this to drag on, in a way that actually didn't help anybody,"" he said. But he cited the controversial decision by US President Donald Trump to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and the unspecified killing by Israeli troops of ""dozens of Palestiniansâ¦ unarmed, innocent civilians"" as among the real issues being distracted from by ""a summer of asking ourselves whether leading Labour movement people are in any way anti-Semitic?"". ""Now I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I'll tell you what - one of the best forms of trying to hide from the atrocities that you are committing is to go on the offensive and to actually create a story that does not exist for people on this platform, the trade union movement or, I have to say, for the leader of the Labour Party,"" he said. Mr Serwotka is general secretary of the largest civil service trade union, the Public and Commercial Services Union, a post he has held since December 2000. He was re-elected in 2005, 2009 and 2014. In 2015 he was among people banned from voting in Labour's leadership election on the grounds they did not share the party's ""aims and values"" - new rules had allowed non-members to vote as ""registered supporters"". In 2016, he rejoined the Labour Party after 25 years, saying Jeremy Corbyn's leadership offered a ""genuine break from the past"". Labour has been riven by accusations of growing anti-Semitism for more than two years On Wednesday it was announced that had been elected TUC president for the coming year. Labour has been dealing with a row about the extent of anti-Semitism within the party for more than two years. A 2016 inquiry, carried out by Shami Chakrabarti, concluded that while the Labour Party was not overrun by anti-Semitism, there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". But the row over the way the leadership has handled anti-Semitism allegations continued and dominated media coverage of the party over the summer. There was much controversy over a new code of conduct the party adopted on anti-Semitism, amid criticism it did not go as far as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's guidelines. Veteran MP Frank Field quit the party's parliamentary group in August, saying the leadership was becoming a ""force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". Earlier this month the party's ruling body agreed to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn has apologised for hurt caused by anti-Semitism in the party and pledged to stamp it out. He has stressed that people who hold anti-Semitic views ""have no place in the Labour Party"" and said people who use ""anti-Semitic poison"" are not his supporters, nor do they speak for him or the party. A spokesperson for the Public and Commercial Services Union said: ""Mark spoke at a Palestine Solidarity Campaign fringe event at the TUC - an organisation PCS is affiliated to. ""He made the point at the start of the meeting, that we need to oppose anti-Semitism in society and within the Labour movement. ""But we should not allow the issue of anti-Semitism to be used by people who are attempting to silence Palestinian voices as they legitimately struggle for their rights and a sovereign state.""

"Thrills, spills and kidney stone removal: Everything you could wish for from a roller-coaster ride Riding on some types of roller-coaster is an effective way of removing kidney stones. This is the conclusion of research that has won this year'sIg Nobel Prize,externalfor Medicine. The US researchers who carried out the work recommend that those afflicted with the condition should regularly use the theme park attractions. The Ig Nobels are spoof prizes that are published in the Annals of Improbable Research. Many of the topics recognised in the awards actually have a serious point to them. The inspiration behind the roller-coaster research began several years ago when one of Prof David Wartinger's patients at Michigan State University's College of Osteopathic Medicine returned from a holiday trip to Walt Disney World in Florida. The patient reported that one of his kidney stones became dislodged after a ride on the Big Thunder Mountain ride. Rides that constantly rattle passengers are more effective in dislodging stones than ones that involve big drops Wondering whether it was caused by the ride or a coincidence, the patient went on the ride several more times and each time a stone popped out. Intrigued by the story, Prof Wartinger built a silicone model of his patient's renal system, including artificial kidney stones, and took it with him on numerous rides. He discovered that Big Thunder Mountain was indeed effective - more so than the scarier rides such as Space Mountain or Rock 'n' Roller Coaster which involve prolonged drops. Prof Wartinger concluded that this was because Big Thunder Mountain involves more up and down and side to side movements that ""rattle"" the rider. The Medicine Prize is one of 10 Ig Nobels awarded each year for amusing and mind-bending science. They are all genuine studies and nearly all have been published in peer-reviewed journals. At the awards ceremony, held at Harvard University in Cambridge, US, each winner has 60 seconds to deliver an acceptance speech. The time limit is strictly enforced by an eight-year-girl who says ""please stop I'm bored"" several times until the speaker finishes. Medical Education:Scientists are sometimes rudely described as being ""up their own backsides"" if they are thought to be too obsessed with their research. However, this is literally the case with a Japanese researcher, Dr Akira Horiuchi, who won the Medical Education Prize for devising a ""self-colonoscopy"" technique using a small endoscope From the '""Anals"" of Improbable Research. Dr Akira Horiuchi demonstrating the ease of use of his self-colonoscopy device. ""This trial may be funny, but I inserted an endoscope into my colon for a serious purpose,"" he told BBC News. ""People, especially in Japan, are afraid of colonoscopy and they do not want to undergo colonoscopy. So the number of people who die from colorectal cancer is increasing. I do this research to make colonoscopy easier and more comfortable, so fewer people will die"". Literature:This year's Literature Prize was for an investigation into instruction manuals that come with consumer products. The Investigation was called, Life Is Too Short to RTFM: How Users Relate to Documentation and Excess Features. ""RTFM"" is an acronym for ""read the field manual"", though, according to the researchers, it has gained a new meaning by consumers who are often frustrated by the complexity of operation of their product. Nutrition:A British researcher won the Nutrition Prize for calculating that pound per pound, it is not worth eating human flesh compared with other types of meat. This was to analyse the eating practices of early humans, rather than to inform present-day dietary choices. Economics:For economics, the winner was research investigating whether it is effective for employees to use voodoo dolls to retaliate against bullying bosses. This study showed that taking it out on dolls does alleviate negative feelings, but suggested in the long run that it was better to deal with the underlying issue. Chemistry:The winner of the Ig Nobel Chemistry Prize went to research that settled the issue of whether human saliva is a good cleaning agent for dirty surfaces. It is - especially for fragile, painted areas on ceramics, and on gold leaf. Biology:A Swedish team won the biology Ig Nobel for demonstrating that wine experts can reliably identify, by smell, the presence of a fly in a glass of wine - possibly sparking a new genre of jokes involving sommeliers. Peace:Last but not least, the Ig Nobel Peace Prize went to a Spanish group that aimed to find ways of reducing road rage, in a paper titled, Shouting and Cursing While Driving: Frequency, Reasons, Perceived Risk and Punishment. The team's solution is to try to reduce stress on the road - a task as sizable as reducing conflict in the Middle East.

"Hurricane Florence is one of the biggest storms to make landfall along the US eastern seaboard in decades. The Carolinas haven't experienced anything like this since the 1980s. Here's why this storm threatens not only the coast but millions of people inland. The coastal area of South Carolina features hundreds of inlets while North Carolina has barrier islands miles away from the mainland. As the storm moves inland it will find a relatively flat area for hundreds of miles. South Carolina's state capital Columbia is at only 89m (292ft). After landfall, the storm is expected to linger over the area for a few days, which would result in rising river levels and lakes. Most of the damage during Hurricane Matthew in 2016 in North Carolina came from inland flooding - 31 people died and nearly 100,000 homes were destroyed. The eye of that hurricane merely grazed the coast. The path of Hurricane Florence goes over some of the poorest areas on the eastern seaboard. In some counties, nearly one person in three lives below the poverty line. Poor people are less likely to evacuate since they can't afford to travel and stay in other regions. Residents are still recovering from Hurricane Matthew, and communities with financial struggles are slow to rebuild after a major disaster. Flood insurance is common for home and business owners living on the coast, but communities further inland are not as willing or able to afford it. Hurricane Florence's path is hitting many counties where fewer than 5% of people have flood insurance. Along the coast, fewer homes have flood insurance than five years ago. No area in the US would be able to deal easily with Hurricane Florence, but the communities in its path are more vulnerable than in the past. As the recovery from past storms continues in many rural towns, the next storm is striking them. . Â© 2025 BBC.

"US officials are warning Hurricane Florence could kill ""a lot of people"" with risks of ""catastrophic"" flooding as the storm begins to lash the country's East Coast. Florence, although now downgraded to a category one storm, is slow-moving and could linger for days,bringing ""copious amounts of rain"". Florence made landfall on Friday, with the centre of the storm striking Wrightsville Beach in North Carolina, with gales of up to 90mph (150 km/h). The National Hurricane Center says that despite the gradual lowering in wind strength, the storm remains extremely dangerous because of the high volume of rainfall and storm surges predicted. Some 10 million people are now under some form of storm watch. Georgia, North and South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland have declared a state of emergency as forecasts showed Florence dumping historic amounts of rain on the area. Tens of thousands of homes are already without power and rains and surging seas have inundated coastal areas. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) said people living near rivers, streams and lowland areas in the region were most at risk. ""Inland flooding kills a lot of people, unfortunately, and that's what we're about to see,"" said Brock Long, head of Fema. Evacuation warnings are in place for 1.7 million people. Latest updates Is climate change making hurricanes worse? The world's deadliest storms More than 1,400 flights have been cancelled, according to FlightAware.com, with most of the coastal region's airports closed. The weather system that became Hurricane Florence has been travelling west from Africa toward the US since 29 August. Its wind speeds reached hurricane levels in the mid-Atlantic. The biggest danger to life could be from storm surges, which are still predicted to be as high as 13ft (4m) between Cape Fear and Cape Lookout in North Carolina. Meteorologists have warned some rivers may see their flows ""reversed"". Storm surges are caused when huge volumes of water are pushed by hurricane-force winds. When they meet land, the water surges inshore at levels far exceeding normal tides. Florence is forecast to dump up to 40in (one metre) of rain in some areas after it makes landfall. By Friday morning, the North Carolina coastal town of Atlantic Beach had already received 30in (76cm) of rain, the US Geological Service said. The torrential rainfall could last for significant periods and cause catastrophic flooding, including in inland areas such as Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and West Virginia. National Weather Service forecaster Brandon Locklear said North Carolina is likely to see eight months' worth of rain in two to three days. The hurricane's wind speeds have fallen from a category two level of 96-110mph to a category one level of 74-95mph. There will be hurricane-force winds up to 80 miles from the centre of the storm, meteorologists say. Florence was being followed in the Atlantic by two other storms - Hurricane Helene and Tropical Storm Isaac. But Helene is now moving north east towards the UK and Isaac is moving west across the Caribbean. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye.

"Protests have been held at a number of prisons, including Leicester Prison staff in England and Wales have taken part in widespread protests over ""unprecedented violence"" in jails. Staff complained about safety within prisons, saying they had been attacked by gangs of inmates, been spat at and had urine thrown at them while on duty. The union said there were protests outside ""a majority"" of jails, which ended after six hours when the government agreed to talks on Monday. Prisons Minister Rory Stewart said the action was illegal. When it announced the suspension of the protest, the Prison Officers' Association said the prison service had withdrawn the threat of court action against the union. General Secretary Steve Gillan said he was ""confident a deal is a deal"", adding that he hoped ""for meaningful, constructive dialogue"" next week. The protests caused delays in courts because prisoners were unable to be transferred for hearings. This video can not be played Rory Stewart condemned the protests, saying there were other ways to solve prison issues The action came afteran inspection report on Thursdayfound inmates had effectively taken control at Bedford Prison. Brian Cooper, branch chairman of the Prison Officers' Association, said conditions at the jail were unsafe ""every day"". ""This year so far we've had an officer who's had his head stamped on and needed emergency surgery for a bleed on the brain. ""We've had an officer have his arm broken with a pool cue when he was attacked by a prisoner. ""Another officer has a fractured eye socket with part of the bone detached and might lose the ability to move his eye properly, permanently."" A female prison officer who was demonstrating outside Bedford Prison said she had a bucket of urine thrown over her from an above landing. ""They're not bothered if you're female or male; they have no respect regardless if you're female,"" she told BBC Radio 5 live. ""We have some issues of being hit. I've been spat at several times. The other week I was spat at twice within five minutes in the face."" On that occasion she said she had to be tested for hepatitis B. Julia Killick, who was a prison governor for 18 years, said the walkout would have made it ""horrendous"" for prisoners, as well as the remaining staff who would only have been able to do the ""absolute minimum"". She told Radio 4's World at One that tasks such as serving food would have been difficult to carry out, while prisoners could get ""very angry or distressed"" having to stay locked up. POA members protested outside Bedford Prison By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Prison staff are banned from taking industrial action, so holding ""protest"" meetings in car parks or outside the gates on the grounds that health and safety is being compromised is the union's way of trying to circumvent the rules. The POA did it before, most recently in November 2016 when 10,000 officers stopped work, before the High Court ordered them to return. This time, the threat of legal action - together with a government pledge to address staff concerns - was enough to bring the walkout to an end. Nevertheless, it has highlighted the very real problems POA members are facing. There is particular frustration officers haven't been equipped with PAVA incapacitant spray - similar to pepper spray - to deter and respond to attacks. A trial has been taking place in four jails but union officials believe the government is stalling on rolling the equipment out to other prisons. Before an agreement with the union was reached, the Ministry of Justice said ""contingency plans"" were in place and it was seeking an injunction to stop the protests. Labour said the action was a ""wake-up call"" for the government, adding that extra funding to end understaffing and overcrowding was ""desperately needed"".

The POA said members were instructed to ensure there were enough staff on duty inside prisons to deliver medication to prisoners and deal with any disorder. It accused the government of overseeing ""the demise of the prison service over the last eight years"". Mr Gillan said ministers had been ""paying lip service"" to the safety and human rights of prison staff. ""We will now be demanding that the government provide safe prisons, meet our demands to improve personal protective equipment, reduce levels of violence and overcrowding,"" he added. Between 50-60 officers protested outside Manchester Prison Protests were also held at Berwyn prison, in Wrexham The union said the decision to call for a protest followed a letter from the chief inspector of prisons, issuing an urgent notification notice at Bedford Prison, published on Thursday. Inspectors said they found Bedford prisoners regularly ignored rules, that there was a smell of drugs ""pervading"" some wings and an infestation of rats. Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, sent a letter to the Ministry of Justice, which means the government has to publish a response and plan of action for the jail within 28 days. It is the fourth jail to be subject to the ""urgent notification"" process after Nottingham, Exeter and Birmingham. Inmates 'effectively control' prison Minister 'disappointed' at prison protests.

The US researchers who carried out the work recommend that those afflicted with the condition should regularly use the theme park attractions. The Ig Nobels are spoof prizes that are published in the Annals of Improbable Research. Many of the topics recognised in the awards actually have a serious point to them. The inspiration behind the roller-coaster research began several years ago when one of Prof David Wartinger's patients at Michigan State University's College of Osteopathic Medicine returned from a holiday trip to Walt Disney World in Florida. The patient reported that one of his kidney stones became dislodged after a ride on the Big Thunder Mountain ride. Rides that constantly rattle passengers are more effective in dislodging stones than ones that involve big drops Wondering whether it was caused by the ride or a coincidence, the patient went on the ride several more times and each time a stone popped out. Intrigued by the story, Prof Wartinger built a silicone model of his patient's renal system, including artificial kidney stones, and took it with him on numerous rides. He discovered that Big Thunder Mountain was indeed effective - more so than the scarier rides such as Space Mountain or Rock 'n' Roller Coaster which involve prolonged drops. Prof Wartinger concluded that this was because Big Thunder Mountain involves more up and down and side to side movements that ""rattle"" the rider. The Medicine Prize is one of 10 Ig Nobels awarded each year for amusing and mind-bending science. They are all genuine studies and nearly all have been published in peer-reviewed journals. At the awards ceremony, held at Harvard University in Cambridge, US, each winner has 60 seconds to deliver an acceptance speech. The time limit is strictly enforced by an eight-year-girl who says ""please stop I'm bored"" several times until the speaker finishes. Medical Education:Scientists are sometimes rudely described as being ""up their own backsides"" if they are thought to be too obsessed with their research. However, this is literally the case with a Japanese researcher, Dr Akira Horiuchi, who won the Medical Education Prize for devising a ""self-colonoscopy"" technique using a small endoscope From the '""Anals"" of Improbable Research. Dr Akira Horiuchi demonstrating the ease of use of his self-colonoscopy device. ""This trial may be funny, but I inserted an endoscope into my colon for a serious purpose,"" he told BBC News. ""People, especially in Japan, are afraid of colonoscopy and they do not want to undergo colonoscopy. So the number of people who die from colorectal cancer is increasing. I do this research to make colonoscopy easier and more comfortable, so fewer people will die"". Literature:This year's Literature Prize was for an investigation into instruction manuals that come with consumer products. The Investigation was called, Life Is Too Short to RTFM: How Users Relate to Documentation and Excess Features. ""RTFM"" is an acronym for ""read the field manual"", though, according to the researchers, it has gained a new meaning by consumers who are often frustrated by the complexity of operation of their product. Nutrition:A British researcher won the Nutrition Prize for calculating that pound per pound, it is not worth eating human flesh compared with other types of meat. This was to analyse the eating practices of early humans, rather than to inform present-day dietary choices. Economics:For economics, the winner was research investigating whether it is effective for employees to use voodoo dolls to retaliate against bullying bosses. This study showed that taking it out on dolls does alleviate negative feelings, but suggested in the long run that it was better to deal with the underlying issue. Chemistry:The winner of the Ig Nobel Chemistry Prize went to research that settled the issue of whether human saliva is a good cleaning agent for dirty surfaces. It is - especially for fragile, painted areas on ceramics, and on gold leaf. Biology:A Swedish team won the biology Ig Nobel for demonstrating that wine experts can reliably identify, by smell, the presence of a fly in a glass of wine - possibly sparking a new genre of jokes involving sommeliers. Peace:Last but not least, the Ig Nobel Peace Prize went to a Spanish group that aimed to find ways of reducing road rage, in a paper titled, Shouting and Cursing While Driving: Frequency, Reasons, Perceived Risk and Punishment. The team's solution is to try to reduce stress on the road - a task as sizable as reducing conflict in the Middle East.

"A security analysis of cyber-attacks against universities and colleges in the UK has discovered staff or students could often be responsible, rather than organised crime or hacking groups. A government-funded agency that provides cyber-security has examined the timing of 850 attacks in 2017-18. Jisc found a ""clear pattern"" of attacks being concentrated during term times and during the working day. When the holidays begin, ""the number of attacks decreases dramatically"". The analysis of cyber-attacks on the research and academic network concludes there are ""suspicions that staff or students could be in the frame"". Rather than criminal gangs or agents of foreign powers, the findings suggest many of the attacks on universities and colleges are more likely to have been caused by disgruntled staff or students wanting to provoke ""chaos"". ""It's notoriously difficult to identify individual cyber-criminals,"" says Dr John Chapman, head of security operations for Jisc, (formerly the Joint Information Systems Committee). But the agency, which provides internet and computer services across the higher and further education sectors, has produced a report showing that the peaks and troughs of attacks mirror when students and staff were most likely to be present. They increased from 08:00 or 09:00 and then tailed off in the early afternoon. There was a very sharp decline in attacks in the Christmas, Easter and summer breaks and during half-terms - with attacks rising again sharply when terms resumed. The incidence varied from more than 60 a week in some parts of the autumn term, down to one a week in mid-summer. There were more than 850 attacks across the academic year, aimed at almost 190 universities and colleges. This was up from fewer than 600 attacks on about 140 institutions in the previous year. These were sustained attempts at disrupting networks and did not include incidents such as phishing frauds or attempts to use ""malware"" or ""ransomware"". UK universities targeted by cyber-thieves Newcastle University students targeted by cyber-scam Top university under 'ransomware' cyber-attack Dr Chapman says the attempts could include sophisticated state-sponsored cyber-attacks from other countries and ""serious criminal players"", targeting research or trying to steal sensitive information. But the analysis suggests many of the attacks on networks seem to be closer to home. These include so-called ""denial of service"" or ""distributed denial of service"" (DDoS) attacks where hackers try to stop or overload networks, crashing computer systems. In one case, the security team monitored a pattern of attacks on an institution and saw they began at 09:00, finished at 12:00, began again at 13:00 and then finished about 15:00 to 16:00. This raised the question whether this was caused by a student or member of staff, who took a break at lunchtime. Another investigation located the source of what seemed to be a four-day cyber-attack on a university. It was found to be coming from a university hall of residence and had been the result of an online gamer who had been ""attacking another gamer to try and secure an advantage"". Other reasons could be a misplaced sense of ""fun"" at disrupting networks, ""kudos among peers"" for causing chaos or because of a grudge over poor grades or ""failure to secure a pay rise"". The Jisc analysis says another factor in the summer dip could have been an international effort to take down so-called ""stresser"" sites. These websites provide the means for carrying out ""denial of service"" attacks, which Jisc says can be sold ""under the pretence"" that the buyer wants to carry out a test to see how well their own network would withstand such an attack. ""So, there is evidence... to suggest that students and staff may well be responsible for many of the DDoS attacks we see,"" says Dr Chapman. ""If connectivity to the network is lost for any length of time, it can be catastrophic for any organisation, both financially and reputationally.""

"In recent years its production moved away from Europe to Mexico, closer to its key US market Volkswagen is ending production of its Beetle in 2019, closing the door on one of the world's most iconic car designs. The German company said output would end at its plant in Mexico next July after production of celebration models. The Beetle has its roots in Nazi Germany with the creation of a ""people's car"", but went on to star in a series of successful Disney films as a vehicle called Herbie. But sales, particularly in the key US market, have fallen in recent years. Mexico's enduring love for a classic car Volkswagen: A brief history Consumers in the US have increasingly turned to larger cars such as crossovers and sports utility vehicles. Volkswagen, in the wake of the diesel emissions scandal and huge investment in electric vehicles, says it will look to slim down its model range with a greater focus on family and electric cars. The company say the final Beetle models will be available in both coupe and convertible styles. The iconic design found fame in the 1960s as Herbie in The Love Bug - a character revived in 2005 ""The loss of the Beetle after three generations, over nearly seven decades, will evoke a host of emotions from the Beetle's many devoted fans,"" said Hinrich Woebcken, chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America. The Beetle was originally designed in the 1930s by legendary engineer Ferdinand Porsche - a name now synonymous with fast cars - at the behest of Adolf Hitler, who wanted to see a cheap and practical mass-produced car made available to the German people. But the outbreak of war would stall its production, as military necessity took precedence. The plant would be severely damaged, then fell into the hands of allied forces - who were eventually to play a large part in its recommissioning. It was intended as a family saloon for the average German worker Production began to take off in the late 1940s, and by 1955 a million of the cars were driving on German roads. The design would find international fame in the 1960s and '70s in films featuring Herbie the Love Bug, a racing car with a mind of its own. It was also popular with the 1960s counter-culture types who extolled the Beetle's small, practical, but aesthetic qualities. How Hitler's idea became a design icon What if the VW Beetle had never existed? Production of the Beetle has ceased and then been revived several times over the decades, with the last of the original design rolling out of VW's Mexican factory in 2003. The ""New Beetle"" redesign, which was based on VW's Golf, stormed the US market in the late 1990s, selling more than 80,000 in 1999. The iconic ""bug"" cars have been a cult favourite for generations The company is already thought to have reviewed a possible model revamp and options for electric versions in recent years, before deciding on its abandonment. But Mr Woebcken didn't completely rule out that the model could one day be resurrected: ""Never say never."" Volkswagen sold 11,151 Beetles during the first eight months of 2018, down 2.2% from the same period a year earlier. US consumers looking for a small Volkswagen vehicle overwhelmingly prefer the Jetta sedan, or the Tiguan compact sport utility vehicle.

"A painting by British artist David Hockney is set to become the most expensive work by a living artist to ever be sold at auction. Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) is expected to fetch $80m (Â£61m) at auction in New York in November, according to Christie's. It is ""one of the great masterpieces of the modern era,"" Christie's added. The current record belongs to American Jeff Koons. His stainless steel Balloon Dog (Orange) sold for $58m in 2013. ""Right now, the price level for this painting is set in the region of $80m, which doesn't mean I want to cap it there, but that's where we place it within the context of market history,"" said Alex Rotter, co-chairman of Post-War and Contemporary Art and Christie's. ""In 10, 15, 20 years from now, if you buy it, we definitely want it back and I can tell you, we'll sell it for more,"" he added. Hockney painting smashes his auction record David Hockney on Tate Britain retrospective One of the Yorkshire painter's most recognisable works, the composition of the two figures began as two separate photographs on the artist's studio floor. It was completed in time for an exhibition at New York's AndrÃ© Emmerich Gallery in 1972. It has since appeared in a number of retrospectives at the Tate Modern, Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Met in New York. Earlier this year, another of the 81-year-old's paintingssold for $28.5m(Â£21.1m) - a personal auction record for the artist. Christie's has not disclosed the private seller, but Mr Rotter added: ""It is this rare coincidence - when the best painting of an artist is actually available. ""With this painting, Hockney cemented his placement within the realm of history's most venerated artists, and come November, it is poised to become the most valuable work of art by a living artist ever sold at auction."" The painting will be exhibited in Hong Kong, London and Los Angeles, before it is auctioned on 15 November.

"Scott Morrison set footage of MPs raising their hands to a song by US artist Fatman Scoop Australian PM Scott Morrison has apologised for posting a video online after discovering its soundtrack - a famous hip-hop song - contained lyrics that were ""just not OK"". The 11-second video showed government MPs raising their hands in parliament. In the caption, Mr Morrison praised his colleagues as being ""on fire today"". But social media users widely expressed puzzlement over its accompanying song - Be Faithful, by US artist Fatman Scoop. The song has several explicit lyrics. The section posted on Mr Morrison's social media accounts was not explicit: ""You got a hundred dollar bill, get your hands up! You got a 50 dollar bill, put your hands up!"" But the post was ridiculed as ""bizarre"" by people online. Many pointed out that the song, released in 1999, had explicit language and sexual references. Allow Twitter content?

"It is illegal to sell knives to children Shops in London are selling knives, alcohol and tobacco to children as young as 13. Over 2,500 test purchases carried out byLondon Trading Standards (LTS),externalrevealed the age-restricted items being sold to under-18s. A total of 285 illegal sales were recorded, with 14% of shops selling knives and 12% selling alcohol. The Met Police said it was ""unacceptable"". There have been 64 fatal stabbings in London since January. This knife was sold to a 15-year-old in Woolwich Sophie Linden, deputy mayor for policing and crime, said: ""The only way we are going to rid our streets of these dangerous weapons is by working together to stop them getting into the hands of young Londoners."" Over an 18 month period, 26 local authorities conducted test purchases for knives, alcohol and tobacco using volunteers between the ages of 12 and 17. Retailers currently face six months in jail or a fine of up to Â£5,000 for underage knife sales. Earlier this year, a large sports and outdoor equipment store in Wandsworth, south London, was fined Â£20,000 after being caught selling a knife to a teenager. In the process of buying the knife at Decathlon LTD - the volunteer - a 16-year-old girl, spoke to two different sales assistants, neither of whom questioned her about her age or challenged her about the purchase. She was able to purchase a foldable lock-knife with an 8cm stainless steel blade without question, LTS said. Decathlon said knives have since been removed from the shop floor and teams have received further training about the sale of knives. These knives were sold to teenagers aged 14 -16 in Barking and Dagenham The latest Met Police figures show a 12% rise in knife crime compared to the previous 12 months, with the force recording 8,704 knife offences this year. LTS has been working with the Met on Operation Sceptre, which aims to reduce knife crime. Vicky Foxcroft, the MP for Lewisham Deptford, described LTS's findings as ""deeply troubling"" - ""particularly in a year where knife crime nationally has reached an all-time high"". ""The Government must take stronger action to ensure children cannot purchase knives,"" she said. ""I would personally like to see legislation in place to ensure all knives are behind counters in shops, a higher minimum age for the purchase of knives and stricter sentences for retailers who fail to ID."" âShockingâ underage knife sales exposed London Trading Standards Met Police What the papers say â January 9 Buying Coordinator (14 months FTC) Robot-guided âsmart biopsyâ technique tested on patients in UK first South London's Christmas Lane The 13 London restaurants named as finalists in the 2025 Good Food Guide Awards Aspiring Psychologist Ealing January 2025 New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"The chief executive of RBS has been accused by MPs of withholding information about an investigation into criminal activity within the bank. Ross McEwan had told the Treasury Committee in January that there was not any criminality inside the bank. But in June, the Times reported that Police Scotland was investigating allegations about a former employee, which MPs then asked him to clarify. Mr McEwan said he had replied to the Committee's questions in ""good faith"". He had been giving evidenceabout the way the bank's Global Restructuring Group (GRG) had treated small business companies (SMEs). The session related to a leaked regulatory report that found an ""intentional, co-ordinated strategy"" to put RBS's interests ahead of customers. RBS escapes action over controversial GRG unit 'Secret' report into RBS published He had been asked: ""Do you think that there has been any criminal activity within the bank by your staff?"" Mr McEwan had replied: ""Not that we have seen or had reported, and certainly none that the police or the Serious Fraud Office are looking at, to our knowledge."" It was then reported in June that Police Scotland was investigating allegations that had been made in relation to a former employee of the restructuring division. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the committee, sought an explanation and after receiving a written explanation from Mr McEwan said he had ""withheld information of relevance and interest"". In his letter to Ms Morgan, Mr McEwan had said the allegations being investigated by Police Scotland did not relate to the period 2008 to 2013, which has been the subject of scrutiny by the Financial Conduct Authority. But Ms Morgan said: ""When asked in January if he was aware of any criminal activity at GRG, Mr McEwan withheld information of relevance and interest to the Committee. ""His letter to me implies that this was not inadvertent, but because he considered that the criminal allegations and police investigation in question were not related to the subject matter of the committee's session."" 'Good faith' ""The committee is unconvinced by that explanation. It expects clarity and openness from witnesses, and Mr McEwan's evidence fell short of that standard,"" she said. Mr McEwan said he was ""disappointed"" by the committee's response to his explanation and that the allegations raised with the police related to a ""unique case"". ""It is obviously of the utmost importance to me that the committee is confident that it can rely on the accuracy of my evidence. I replied to the committee's questions in good faith and clarified my position in writing,"" Mr McEwan said. ""In this particular case, the allegations that we referred to Police Scotland did not relate to any of the issues that the FCA has been considering as part of its four-year investigation into GRG's treatment of SME customers during the period 2008-13. ""I am confident that when the legal process has run its course, this will be seen to be a unique case. There continue to be clear constraints as to what can be disclosed as we would not want to prejudice an ongoing police investigation."" Ms Morgan said: ""The committee is concerned by the pattern of defensiveness, and a failure to acknowledge mistakes, demonstrated by RBS throughout its handling of the GRG affair. ""Mr McEwan's letter to me is an example of this, and it casts doubt on his assurances that RBS's culture has changed fundamentally since he took up his position five years ago.""

"This video can not be played Suspected gas explosions set homes ablaze At least one person has been killed and many others injured after a series of reported gas explosions rocked towns north of Boston in Massachusetts. Local police reported ""fires and explosions"" at dozens of homes and other properties on Thursday evening. Hundreds of people were evacuated, with gas and electricity services cut to try and prevent further incidents. A local fire chief described it as an ""overwhelming event"" that resembled ""Armageddon"". ""I have been in the fire service for almost 39 years and I have never seen anything like this in my entire career,"" Andover Fire Rescue Chief Michael Mansfield said. Leonel Rondon, 18, was killed inside a car in the town of Lawrence when a chimney fell on his vehicle from a house explosion, a spokeswoman with the Essex County District Attorney's office said. Family members told local media that he had been in the car with two friends,external, who were now in hospital. The towns are located approximately 27 miles (43km) north of Boston Officials say at least 25 people have been treated for injuries, but it is not clear how severe a condition they are in. Mr Mansfield said investigators suspected the fires were caused by ""over-pressurisation of a gas main"" belonging to Columbia Gas lines. Officials said that between 60 and 80 fires and a number of explosions broke out in homes and businesses in the towns of Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, which are located around 30 miles (45km) north of Boston. Witness accounts suggest the incidents began at about 16:30 local time (20:30 GMT). Fire crews then spent hours going from property to property tackling blazes, as gas technicians rushed to shut off gas supplies and assist in safety checks. Residents were also urged to cut off their gas supplies if they could do so safely, and advised to evacuate. Neighbouring police chief Joseph Solomon, who came in to assist from the town of Methuen, said there were so many fires burning at one point that you could not see the sky. Allow Twitter content?

"Mark Serwotka rejoined the Labour Party in 2016, after 25 years A trade union leader has been recorded suggesting that Israel ""created"" the anti-Semitism row in the Labour Party. In a recording published by the Independent, PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka suggested the country had created the story to hide what he called its own ""atrocities"". Labour Against Anti-Semitismsaid,externalMr Serwotka had brought the entire TUC into disrepute and he should resign. The PCS said he had made the point that anti-Semitism must be opposed. A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims What is the anti-Semitism row doing to Labour? Can Labour de-toxify the anti-Semitism row? Labour adopts full anti-Semitism definition Marie van der Zyl, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: ""By trading in conspiracy theories and stock anti-Semitic tropes, Mark Serwotka has demeaned his office. ""The only reason Labour's anti-Semitism crisis remains in the media is Labour's failure to deal with it. ""Mr Serwotka should apologise or face disciplinary action from the TUC and the Public and Commercial Services Union."" And Matt Zarb-Cousin, Jeremy Corbyn's former spokesman, said the comments were wrong and ""very unhelpful"". TheIndependent reported,externalthat Mr Serwokta had told an event organised by the Palestinian Solidarity Campaign at the TUC this week that there was no place for anti-Semitism in the Labour movement. ""I think it's unfortunate that the Labour Party allowed a lot of this to drag on, in a way that actually didn't help anybody,"" he said. But he cited the controversial decision by US President Donald Trump to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and the unspecified killing by Israeli troops of ""dozens of Palestiniansâ¦ unarmed, innocent civilians"" as among the real issues being distracted from by ""a summer of asking ourselves whether leading Labour movement people are in any way anti-Semitic?"". ""Now I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I'll tell you what - one of the best forms of trying to hide from the atrocities that you are committing is to go on the offensive and to actually create a story that does not exist for people on this platform, the trade union movement or, I have to say, for the leader of the Labour Party,"" he said. Mr Serwotka is general secretary of the largest civil service trade union, the Public and Commercial Services Union, a post he has held since December 2000. He was re-elected in 2005, 2009 and 2014. In 2015 he was among people banned from voting in Labour's leadership election on the grounds they did not share the party's ""aims and values"" - new rules had allowed non-members to vote as ""registered supporters"". In 2016, he rejoined the Labour Party after 25 years, saying Jeremy Corbyn's leadership offered a ""genuine break from the past"". Labour has been riven by accusations of growing anti-Semitism for more than two years On Wednesday it was announced that had been elected TUC president for the coming year. Labour has been dealing with a row about the extent of anti-Semitism within the party for more than two years. A 2016 inquiry, carried out by Shami Chakrabarti, concluded that while the Labour Party was not overrun by anti-Semitism, there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". But the row over the way the leadership has handled anti-Semitism allegations continued and dominated media coverage of the party over the summer. There was much controversy over a new code of conduct the party adopted on anti-Semitism, amid criticism it did not go as far as the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's guidelines. Veteran MP Frank Field quit the party's parliamentary group in August, saying the leadership was becoming a ""force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". Earlier this month the party's ruling body agreed to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn has apologised for hurt caused by anti-Semitism in the party and pledged to stamp it out. He has stressed that people who hold anti-Semitic views ""have no place in the Labour Party"" and said people who use ""anti-Semitic poison"" are not his supporters, nor do they speak for him or the party. A spokesperson for the Public and Commercial Services Union said: ""Mark spoke at a Palestine Solidarity Campaign fringe event at the TUC - an organisation PCS is affiliated to. ""He made the point at the start of the meeting, that we need to oppose anti-Semitism in society and within the Labour movement. ""But we should not allow the issue of anti-Semitism to be used by people who are attempting to silence Palestinian voices as they legitimately struggle for their rights and a sovereign state.""

"A painting by British artist David Hockney is set to become the most expensive work by a living artist to ever be sold at auction. Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures) is expected to fetch $80m (Â£61m) at auction in New York in November, according to Christie's. It is ""one of the great masterpieces of the modern era,"" Christie's added. The current record belongs to American Jeff Koons. His stainless steel Balloon Dog (Orange) sold for $58m in 2013. ""Right now, the price level for this painting is set in the region of $80m, which doesn't mean I want to cap it there, but that's where we place it within the context of market history,"" said Alex Rotter, co-chairman of Post-War and Contemporary Art and Christie's. ""In 10, 15, 20 years from now, if you buy it, we definitely want it back and I can tell you, we'll sell it for more,"" he added. Hockney painting smashes his auction record David Hockney on Tate Britain retrospective One of the Yorkshire painter's most recognisable works, the composition of the two figures began as two separate photographs on the artist's studio floor. It was completed in time for an exhibition at New York's AndrÃ© Emmerich Gallery in 1972. It has since appeared in a number of retrospectives at the Tate Modern, Centre Pompidou in Paris and the Met in New York. Earlier this year, another of the 81-year-old's paintingssold for $28.5m(Â£21.1m) - a personal auction record for the artist. Christie's has not disclosed the private seller, but Mr Rotter added: ""It is this rare coincidence - when the best painting of an artist is actually available. ""With this painting, Hockney cemented his placement within the realm of history's most venerated artists, and come November, it is poised to become the most valuable work of art by a living artist ever sold at auction."" The painting will be exhibited in Hong Kong, London and Los Angeles, before it is auctioned on 15 November.

"The number of vapers in Great Britain has topped three million for the first time - four times the number in 2012, according to a survey by Action on Smoking and Health. Most use e-cigarettes because they have quit smoking and 40% are smokers who are trying to give up. The estimations are based on a survey of 12,000 British adults. But a ""worrying"" belief that vaping is as bad as smoking still exists, a King's College London analysis found. Earlier this year, Public Health England saide-cigarettes should be made available on prescriptionbecause of how successful they were in helping people give up smoking. Anda report by MPsin August said rules around e-cigarettes should be relaxed and their use on public transport debated. Ash, the public health charity, said this survey suggested smokers were getting the message that switching to vaping could improve their health. It estimates a 10% rise in e-cigarette users between 2017 and 2018, up from 2.9 to 3.2 million. But there are still some smokers - about a third - who have never tried one. Although increasing numbers of smokers now believe vaping is less harmful than smoking, 22% still think it is as bad or worse. And among the general public, one in four adults believes it to be as harmful as tobacco. Also from the survey, 17% correctly believed vaping to be a lot less harmful than smoking - but 23% said they didn't know which was more harmful. This compared with 13% and 29% last year. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash, said: ""UK policy is on the right track, with thousands of smokers making the switch to vaping and improving their health and little sign of non-smokers taking up vaping. ""But even more smokers could benefit if e-cigarettes were licensed as medicines and available on prescription."" Dr Leonie Brose, from King's College London, called the mistaken belief by some people that vaping was as harmful as smoking ""worrying"". ""Campaigns from Public Health England and others to challenge these views are important and must continue,"" she said. The top three reasons ex-smokers gave for using e-cigarettes were: to quit smoking (62%) because they enjoyed it (11%) to save money (10%) Alison Cook, director of policy at the British Lung Foundation, said: ""It's really encouraging to see smokers using e-cigarettes to help them quit the much more harmful practice of smoking."" She said doctors and pharmacists ""should be very clear with people that there is a range of products available and that they can try vaping as a way to stop smoking"".

"Scott Morrison set footage of MPs raising their hands to a song by US artist Fatman Scoop Australian PM Scott Morrison has apologised for posting a video online after discovering its soundtrack - a famous hip-hop song - contained lyrics that were ""just not OK"". The 11-second video showed government MPs raising their hands in parliament. In the caption, Mr Morrison praised his colleagues as being ""on fire today"". But social media users widely expressed puzzlement over its accompanying song - Be Faithful, by US artist Fatman Scoop. The song has several explicit lyrics. The section posted on Mr Morrison's social media accounts was not explicit: ""You got a hundred dollar bill, get your hands up! You got a 50 dollar bill, put your hands up!"" But the post was ridiculed as ""bizarre"" by people online. Many pointed out that the song, released in 1999, had explicit language and sexual references. Allow Twitter content?

"The British authorities released photos of the two men they suspected of carrying out the poisoning Claims the suspects in the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy were only in the UK as tourists are ""deeply offensive to the victims"", the UK government has said. The two men told the state-run RT channel they had travelled to Salisbury on the recommendation of friends. Downing Street described the interview as ""lies and blatant fabrications"". The UK believes the men are Russian military intelligence officers who tried to kill ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in March. The Skripals survived being poisoned by the nerve agent Novichok, but Dawn Sturgess - a woman not connected to the original attack -died in July after being exposed to the same substance. ""The lies and blatant fabrications in this interview given to a Russian state-sponsored TV station are an insult to the public's intelligence,"" Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said. ""More importantly, they are deeply offensive to the victims and loved ones of this horrific attack. Sadly, it is what we have come to expect."" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt tweeted: ""Time to stop the fake TV shows - the world has found Russia out on this."" What happened to the Skripals? Skripal suspects interview: Key excerpts What is the GRU? Recreating the Skripal suspects' walk through Salisbury The two suspects have been named as Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. On WednesdayRussian President Vladimir Putin said ""there is nothing criminal about them""and called them ""civilians"". Dawn Sturgess died in hospital on 8 July after handling a contaminated container Appearing nervous and uncomfortable, the men confirmed their names as those announced by the UK investigators - Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov. ""Those are our real names,"" they said. The men said they worked in the sports nutrition business and had travelled to London for a short holiday, fitting in a couple of day trips to Salisbury. ""Our friends had been suggesting for a long time that we visit this wonderful town,"" Mr Petrov said. Mr Boshirov added: ""There is the famous Salisbury cathedral, well known not just across Europe, but probably around the whole world. ""It's known for its 123m-tall spire. It's known for its clock, the first clock to ever be invented in the world, which is still working."" They said they only stayed an hour in Salisbury on Saturday 3 March because of the snowy weather conditions. Mr Petrov said: ""Of course, we went there to see Stonehenge, Old Sarum, but we couldn't do it because there was muddy slush everywhere."" They said they returned on Sunday 4 March to visit the sights. The two men admitted they may have passed Mr Skripal's house by chance ""but we don't know where it is located,"" Mr Petrov said. When asked about Novichok, they emphatically denied carrying it, or the modified Nina Ricci perfume bottle which UK investigators say contained the substance. ""For normal blokes, to be carrying women's perfume with us, isn't that silly?"" Mr Boshirov asked. The counterfeit perfume bottle recovered from Mr Rowley's home and the box police say it came in The two men told RT their lives had been ""turned upside down"" by the allegations. ""We're afraid to go out, we fear for ourselves, our lives and lives of our loved ones,"" said Mr Boshirov. RT is Russia's state-run international broadcaster, and the pair were interviewed by its chief editor, Margarita Simonyan. ""Their passports match and the photos and the information from the British side shows it's these people,"" she said. The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow described the interview as carefully choreographed and bizarre, pointing out that in tone and content it matched the whole Russian response to the case - flat denial mixed with mockery. British police believe the men to be officers of Russian military intelligence, GRU, who may have travelled on false passports to London from Moscow in March. This video can not be played On the trail of Russians Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who UK police say carried out a nerve agent attack in Salisbury in March 2018 They say the purpose of the men's visit to Salisbury on 3 March was reconnaissance, and on 4 March they returned to apply Novichok to the Skripals' front door. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) says there is enough evidence to convict the two men, although it is not applying to Russia for their extradition because Russia does not extradite its own nationals. However, a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained in case they travel to the EU, and Home Secretary Sajid Javid has warned that the men will be caught and prosecuted if they ever step out of Russia. BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera The appearance of the two men looks like the next step in the struggle between London and Moscow to convince their own publics and those around the world about their respective cases. The amount of detail put out by British police last week, and the direct accusation that the men were officers in Russian military intelligence, was something the Kremlin will not have wanted to go unchallenged. And the Russian government will be hoping this interview will generate sympathy at home for what are said to be a pair of sports nutrition salesmen who wanted to see a beautiful English cathedral with its 123-metre spire, but who instead have found themselves accused of being assassins. But the risk for Russia is that the interview raises more questions than it answers and offers more details for sceptics to unpick and challenge. How plausible are the men generally and specifically about their reasons for visiting Salisbury? How plausible is their account of their movements around the town when compared to the CCTV? And given the UK has suggested the names they use are pseudonyms, how convincing are their stories about who they are, including their past, their jobs and their travel? At around 15:00 GMT on Friday 2 March, the two men arrived at Gatwick Airport Police say they travelled to London Victoria at 17:40 GMT, and were at Waterloo Station between 18:00 and 19:00 GMT before travelling to their London hotel At 11:45 GMT on Saturday 3 March, they took a train from Waterloo Station to Salisbury CCTV footage shows the men in Salisbury around 14:25 GMT The men say they spent less than an hour in Salisbury, deciding against seeing Stonehenge, Old Sarum and Salisbury Cathedral because of ""muddy slush everywhere"" CCTV footage shows the men taking a train back to London at 16:11 GMT On Sunday 4 March, CCTV cameras filmed the men arriving at Salisbury train station at 11:48 GMT Police say they were then seen on CCTV near the home of Sergei Skripal at 11:58 GMT The men say they then visited Salisbury Cathedral CCTV footage shows the men leaving Salisbury station at 13:50 GMT At 19:28 GMT, the men were at Heathrow Airport for an Aeroflot flight to Moscow Yulia Skripal flew in to the UK from Russia on Saturday 3 March to visit her father, Sergei Skripal, a former Russian double agent who was living in Salisbury. They were found ""in an extremely serious condition"" on a bench outside a restaurant in Salisbury on 4 March. They spent weeks in intensive care in hospital before recovering. Ms Skripal was discharged from hospital on 9 April and her father on 18 May. They are both now in a secure location. Why Novichok stays deadly for so long UK police are linking the attack to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June, when Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley fell ill at a house in Amesbury, about 13km (eight miles) away. Police said they were exposed after handling what they believed to be perfume. Ms Sturgess died in hospital on 8 July.

The White House said on Friday that President Donald Trump would travel to the region next week unless his trip would disrupt clean-up and rescue efforts. A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.These storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. ""Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye.

"You may have heard about Hurricane Florence, the storm careering towards the US east coast prompting warnings of an impending disaster. But what makes Florence so different from other storms this year? From Beryl, Chris, and Debby? We've pulled together some of the key elements that explain why officials are so worried, and what damage Florence could cause. The storm's winds may have weakened in recent days - they are now at 110mph (175km/h) - but there are fears Florence's slow-moving nature could bring different problems. Forecasters say it could slow dramatically when it nears land and then linger until Saturday, moving unpredictably along the coast and bringing torrential rain. Up to 1.7 million people have been ordered to evacuate across South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia. A further 10 million people are now under some form of storm watch. So how are these people preparing? We spoke to those braced for Florence's looming arrival. This video can not be played People have left homes and taken precautions ahead of the hurricane Hurricane Florence seen off the US east coast in the Atlantic Ocean This satellite image of Florence hurtling towards the east coast on Wednesday gives a sense of its massive scale. A National Weather Service forecaster has said it will be the ""storm of a lifetime"" for parts of the Carolina coast. One emergency official said it will be a ""Mike Tyson punch"" to the area. There will be hurricane-force winds up to 80 miles from the centre of the storm, meteorologists say. Some forecasters have predicted it could be the most powerful storm ever to hit the region. Florence could do more than $170bn (Â£130bn) of damage and affect nearly 759,000 homes and businesses, says analytics firm CoreLogic. Energy companies have also warned that the storm could knock out power for the foreseeable future in some areas. ""This is no ordinary storm, and people could be without power for a very long time - not days but weeks,"" a president of one energy company in North Carolina said on Wednesday.

Hurricane Floyd hit North Carolina in 1999 and left floodwaters that were heavily polluted by agricultural waste If the storm lingers for a few days, the sheer amount of rainfall could lead to catastrophic flooding. But the biggest danger could be life-threatening storm surges. These could be as high as 13ft (4m) along parts of the North Carolina coast. All of this has led to fears that the state could face an environmental disaster if industrial waste - including hog manure and coal ash - is washed into people's homes. North Carolina has had this problem before. In 1999, Hurricane Floyd barrelled into the region and flooded vast areas with toxic water. Dead hogs and chickens were pictured floating in the floodwaters, which had been polluted with agricultural waste and petrol. Many people in coastal communities have followed the mandatory evacuation orders, but some are vowing to stay put and ride it out. Solange Iliou Thompson, a restaurant owner in the town of Wilmington, North Carolina, made her stance clear. ""I'm staying. The building's solid and Buddha will protect us,"" she told AFP news agency. ""What can you do? You can't stop Mother Nature."" A delicatessen owner in the same town told Reuters that he was also going to stay. ""I'm not approaching Florence from fear or panic,"" he said. ""It's going to happen.

"Hurricane Florence is one of the biggest storms to make landfall along the US eastern seaboard in decades. The Carolinas haven't experienced anything like this since the 1980s. Here's why this storm threatens not only the coast but millions of people inland. The coastal area of South Carolina features hundreds of inlets while North Carolina has barrier islands miles away from the mainland. As the storm moves inland it will find a relatively flat area for hundreds of miles. South Carolina's state capital Columbia is at only 89m (292ft). After landfall, the storm is expected to linger over the area for a few days, which would result in rising river levels and lakes. Most of the damage during Hurricane Matthew in 2016 in North Carolina came from inland flooding - 31 people died and nearly 100,000 homes were destroyed. The eye of that hurricane merely grazed the coast. The path of Hurricane Florence goes over some of the poorest areas on the eastern seaboard. In some counties, nearly one person in three lives below the poverty line. Poor people are less likely to evacuate since they can't afford to travel and stay in other regions. Residents are still recovering from Hurricane Matthew, and communities with financial struggles are slow to rebuild after a major disaster. Flood insurance is common for home and business owners living on the coast, but communities further inland are not as willing or able to afford it. Hurricane Florence's path is hitting many counties where fewer than 5% of people have flood insurance. Along the coast, fewer homes have flood insurance than five years ago. No area in the US would be able to deal easily with Hurricane Florence, but the communities in its path are more vulnerable than in the past. As the recovery from past storms continues in many rural towns, the next storm is striking them. . Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played People in Aparri are tying down their roofs ahead of Typhoon Mangkhut Thousands of people have begun evacuating from coastal areas of the Philippines as a super typhoon heads towards the country. Typhoon Mangkhut, which is currently a Category 4 hurricane, is due to make landfall on the northern tip of the main island of Luzon by Saturday. Schools and offices are being closed and farmers are racing to save crops. Ten million people are in the path of the storm, along with millions more in coastal areas of southern China. Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? A guide to the world's deadliest storms How windy is a hurricane? The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and storms a year. Forecasters say Mangkhut is the strongest so far in 2018 - 900km in diameter, with sustained winds of at least 209 km/h. The storm, which was earlier packing winds of 255km/h (160mph) as a Category 5, has already blasted through the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam. Advertising billboards in Quezon City were dismantled in preparation to the strong winds and heavy rains Authorities in the Philippines say they expect storm surges of up to 7m (23 feet) and are warning that heavy rains could trigger landslides and flash floods. ""We are really frightened,"" said Delaila Pasion, who has fled her home. ""They say it is so strong, we were too scared to remain."" This video can not be played Typhoon Mangkhut barrels towards Philippines ""During previous monsoon rains, half of our house was destroyed so I wanted to take my grandchildren to safety,"" she told journalists. Howard Johnson, BBC News, Arparri, Luzon Residents of this small, low-rise town say they've been through this before, they've seen other storms. Farmers are working around the clock to harvest their rice paddies. They say the rice is still not ripe, but want to salvage what they can before this storm comes in and potentially devastates their fields. Residents are attempting to secure the roofs of their homes in preparation for the super typhoon Authorities have told people to move on, and there is an evacuation centre just 500m down the road. Some cars, seen with bedding on the roof, are leaving the area, but some people say they want to stay inside their homes to prevent thieves entering and taking their belongings. Others have been tying down their roofs with rocks and heavy boulders, in an attempt to prevent them from flying off. Given everything I have seen, it's somewhat alarming that there isn't a bigger presence of police and local authorities telling people to move on. People seem to be very relaxed with the idea that a super typhoon is coming their way. The country's deadliest storm on record is super typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 7,000 people and affected millions in 2013. In Hong Kong preparations are already under way for the storm, though the latest forecasts suggest Mangkhut will pass to the south of the territory later in the weekend.

"The number of vapers in Great Britain has topped three million for the first time - four times the number in 2012, according to a survey by Action on Smoking and Health. Most use e-cigarettes because they have quit smoking and 40% are smokers who are trying to give up. The estimations are based on a survey of 12,000 British adults. But a ""worrying"" belief that vaping is as bad as smoking still exists, a King's College London analysis found. Earlier this year, Public Health England saide-cigarettes should be made available on prescriptionbecause of how successful they were in helping people give up smoking. Anda report by MPsin August said rules around e-cigarettes should be relaxed and their use on public transport debated. Ash, the public health charity, said this survey suggested smokers were getting the message that switching to vaping could improve their health. It estimates a 10% rise in e-cigarette users between 2017 and 2018, up from 2.9 to 3.2 million. But there are still some smokers - about a third - who have never tried one. Although increasing numbers of smokers now believe vaping is less harmful than smoking, 22% still think it is as bad or worse. And among the general public, one in four adults believes it to be as harmful as tobacco. Also from the survey, 17% correctly believed vaping to be a lot less harmful than smoking - but 23% said they didn't know which was more harmful. This compared with 13% and 29% last year. Deborah Arnott, chief executive of Ash, said: ""UK policy is on the right track, with thousands of smokers making the switch to vaping and improving their health and little sign of non-smokers taking up vaping. ""But even more smokers could benefit if e-cigarettes were licensed as medicines and available on prescription."" Dr Leonie Brose, from King's College London, called the mistaken belief by some people that vaping was as harmful as smoking ""worrying"". ""Campaigns from Public Health England and others to challenge these views are important and must continue,"" she said. The top three reasons ex-smokers gave for using e-cigarettes were: to quit smoking (62%) because they enjoyed it (11%) to save money (10%) Alison Cook, director of policy at the British Lung Foundation, said: ""It's really encouraging to see smokers using e-cigarettes to help them quit the much more harmful practice of smoking."" She said doctors and pharmacists ""should be very clear with people that there is a range of products available and that they can try vaping as a way to stop smoking"".

"The Bank of England's governor has warned the cabinet that a chaotic no-deal Brexit could crash house prices and send another financial shock through the economy. Mark Carney met senior ministers on Thursday to discuss the risks of a disorderly exit from the EU. His worst-case scenario was that house prices could fall as much as 35% over three years, a source told the BBC. The warning echoes some of the Bank's previous comments. The Bank of England routinely carries out ""stress tests"" to check whether the banking system can withstand extreme financial shocks. Its latest one was conducted in November, when it said a 33% fall in house prices could occur in a worst-case scenario. Several reports said that the Bank governor also told the Downing Street meeting that mortgage rates could spiral, the pound could fall and inflation would rise, and countless homeowners could be left in negative equity. Speaking on Friday in Dublin, Mr Carney said the stress test was aimed at making sure the the largest UK banks could continue to meet the needs of the country through ""even through a disorderly Brexit, however unlikely that may be"". ""Our job, after all, is not to hope for the best but to plan for the worst,"" he added. Preparing for two 'no deal' scenarios Brexit papers: What no deal could mean Ahmed: Carney and the ""no deal"" Brexit threat Brexit could 're-ignite conflict' in Northern Ireland Bank holds rates amid Brexit uncertainty May says Â£39bn bill linked to Brexit deal Mr Carney, who has just agreed to stay on as governor of the central bank until 2020, has faced strong criticism in the past, with Brexiteers accusing him of being part of the Remain camp. Kamal Ahmed, economics editor It appears that the Governor wasn't providing the Cabinet with a forecast of what the Bank believes would happen in the event of a no deal Brexit. He was briefing the Cabinet on what preparations the Bank was making if that does happen, including last November's stress test. It was not a forecast. It was an apocalyptic test where the Bank deliberately sets the parameters beyond what might reasonably be expected to occur. The major banks all passed the test, giving reassurance that the financial system can cope with whatever happens next year. The Governor believes that a ""no deal"" scenario would be bad for the economy. But not as bad as the headlines today which are based on a doomsday scenario that is not actually forecast to happen. Read more from Kamal here In August,Mr Carney told the BBC that the risk of a no-deal Brexit was ""uncomfortably high"". That comment prompted leading Tory eurosceptic Jacob Rees-Mogg to call Mr Carney ""the high priest of Project Fear"", while former minister Iain Duncan Smith said ""there is no such thing as a no-deal"" and the Bank ""struggled to understand how this would work"". Independent property expert Henry Pryor told the BBC that Mr Carney was ""not predicting Armageddon, he was not predicting house prices would fall by a third, they are just making sure that if, for some extraordinary reason anything was to go horribly wrong, the bank is prepared."" But he warned house prices were likely to fall in the first half of the 2019 as people put off buying amid the Brexit uncertainty, while the number of sellers, ""driven by death, debt and divorce"" would remain about the same. Mark Wahlberg reveals gruelling regimen Dead rat in soup costs restaurant $190m Apple unveils iPhone XS and new Watch Following the Downing Street meeting, the Prime Minister's official spokesman said ministers remained confident of a Brexit deal, but had agreed to ""ramp up"" their no-deal planning. ""As a responsible government, we need to plan for every eventuality. The Cabinet agreed that no-deal remains an unlikely but possible scenario in six months' time,"" the spokesman said. The Bank of England declined to comment. The cabinet meeting was part of a series of no-deal planning sessions designed to discuss the ""unlikely"" scenario that the UK leaves the EU without an agreement in place. After each meeting, planning papers are published on various subjects. On Thursday, the papers disclosedthat UK car drivers may have to get an international driving permit if they want to drive in some European countries after a no-deal Brexit. The government said that after March 2019 ""your driving licence may no longer be valid by itself"" in the EU, in its latest no-deal planning papers. The papers also warned that Britons travelling to the EU may need to make sure their passports have six months left to run. And, in an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government was trying to give the ""reassurance that consumers need"" on the issue of mobile phone roaming charges but admitted that European operators could pass on charges. He said: ""No, I can't give a cast-iron guarantee. What I can say is that the government would legislate to limit the ability of roaming charges to be imposed on customers.""

"Spain has now seen five years of economic growth, but still has the eurozone's second-highest unemployment rate after Greece Ten years on from the crisis in the depths of the American banking system that triggered a global economic shock the real question is this - should we be looking back towards the last catastrophe or counting down to the next one? In Spain where both the physical and financial landscape were altered by the aftershocks that followed the collapse of the Lehman Brothers bank it is possible to find two great cliches of economic journalism side-by-side. There are green shoots of recovery on the ground - but there are certainly storm clouds on the horizon too. Headlines from Spain after the economic crisis were often illustrated by pictures of empty apartment blocks in the deserted streets of ghost towns - communities built with borrowed money which were abandoned when developers went bust, banks stopped lending and families stopped buying. There are still plenty to be found but in the municipality of Valdeluz, a short drive from Madrid, we found something more interesting. A ghost town which is showing signs of coming to life. Valdeluz in 2012, when most apartment blocks were empty The local mayor Miguel Coceras is in no doubt that he is transforming his town from a ""municipio de fantasma"" into what he calls a ""municipio estrella"" - a star city. Certainly if personal energy could be converted into electricity generation Miguel would produce enough in the course of a short meeting to power the whole town. ""We are only a local government, so how does a local government face a global crisis?"" he asks. ""The answer is to focus on the person beside you, the person living near you."" Miguel is a socialist and so for him part of the answer to the crisis was to use public spending to help prime the pump of the local economy - although he points out that it's not only socialists who believe in public sector investment, pointing to stimulus-spending in the United States to make his case. ""If you decided to invest to give your citizens more education, culture and sports you're going to give them a better quality of life, and this is what we decided,"" he explains. Realistically the mechanisms of market economics did their bit too, lowering property prices to make them more attractive. Mayor Miguel Coceras says part of the answer has been to use public money to boost the local economy But Miguel sees Valdeluz as a success story for government action and argues that where two years ago 90% of the town's apartments were empty, today 90% are full. The problem for Spain is that success hasn't really been repeated on a national scale even as the country has grown out of crisis. The financial crisis: A lost decade How the crisis accelerated the rise of China Who was to blame for the financial crisis? On the drive back from Valdeluz to Madrid you can find a desolate stretch of unfinished motorway called MP-203. The surface of the highway was laid, although the lanes were never marked and electrical cables hang down from the roof of a partly-completed toll booth. It was designed to relieve pressure on the existing motorway system - the kind of road project that governments undertake when an economy is booming or when money is being borrowed to boost public spending. It doesn't look as though there are any plans to finish it now - to walk along the deserted fast lane is to feel like an archaeologist of the financial crash. And there are plenty of other signs too that Spain's recovery has a long way to go. The unfinished MP-203 motorway remains a sign that Spain's recovery is not yet complete In a suburb of Madrid we went to a meeting of Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca, an organisation that campaigns to stop banks foreclosing on properties where families can't keep up their mortgage payments. Some of the rhetoric from the activists offers a familiar left-wing analysis of the crisis. ""Don't you know that banks don't pay tax and rich people don't pay tax?"" one of them asks me, but others see the issue of repossession as clear evidence that it's simply too early to say that financial crisis is over. When I ask one woman, Carmen Aguilera, if this is evidence that poor Spanish people are paying the price for mistakes made by wealthy American bankers she replies: ""Nothing has changed, and the banks haven't changed."" But even if you don't take the view that the crisis of 2008 is still going on, it's still possible to be very worried that it could repeat itself. Banks which were deemed ""too big to fail"" are bigger than ever by some measures and in many economies private debt has ballooned to alarming levels. Prof Carlos Rodriguez Braun is an historian of economic thought who laughs out loud when he's asked if he's a pessimist. ""We have a saying in Spanish, 'a pessimist is a well-informed optimist',"" he explains. Prof Carlos Rodriguez Braun says there will be another financial crisis, it's just a matter of time He is gently dismissive of the Valdeluz model that increased public spending in itself is the answer - if using public money to raise demand was the answer, he points out, there'd never be any economic crises. Prof Braun goes on to explain that one of the key policy tools used to combat the crisis has been quantitative easing - a way for central banks to pump money into the financial system - and that in spite of its fancy new name it is a variation on tools which have been used in the past. Overall it's clear that he is something of a pessimist. He agrees it's a question of ""when"" rather than ""if"" there's another financial crisis, adding simply: ""Unluckily I don't know where or when. But if you have the same system and recipes you had in 2007 why would you be sure that you're not heading for a new crisis?"" Not everyone of course is a pessimist, if only because such unanimity would require a degree of agreement amongst economists, but from Prof Braun it certainly feels compelling. And it might help to explain why no-one is rushing to finish the work on Motorway MP-203.

"Sally Hunter joined an online dating service after deciding ""life couldn't get worse"" and met her future husband, Mark How would you cope if an international financial crisis turned your life upside down? Could you handle a drop in income or losing your home? Or would you rise to the challenge and change your life for the better? Life was never the same for millions of people after thecollapse of US investment bank Lehman Brothersin September 2008. Ten years on, we asked two women in the UK how their lives had changed. This is the story of two Sallys. Sally from Birmingham lost her job as an events manager and had to do a combination of bar and temporary work in order to survive. Sally from Essex had to make people redundant at her company and ended up moving back home with her mother as she turned 45. Sally Hunter, from Birmingham, had just started a new job as an events manager for a law firm at the time the crash happened. ""Within two months, they were making redundancies as their major business was construction,"" she told the BBC. Sally survived two rounds of job cuts but in January 2010 was made redundant. ""I was devastated,"" she said. ""I had barely built up any long service, so my payment was minimal. ""My confidence was also shattered - although I understood the market conditions, I couldn't help but feel like it was my fault."" Sally Hunter in New York in 2008 Furthermore, Sally had bought a house in September 2007, just before the housing market began to crash - and her house immediately lost 25% of its value. To make matters worse, Sally was on a fixed-rate mortgage, which in 2007 had seemed like the safest option. ""If I'd gone on a tracker, my payments would have dropped by Â£200 a month,"" she said. Scared about what would happen to her financially, Sally found a temporary job as well as a bar job, working up to 70 hours a week to try to cover her bills. ""I ate a lot of rice during this time and didn't spend money on anything that wasn't food or bills,"" she said. ""Ironically, I've never saved so much."" Within three months, however, Sally had found a permanent job, for which she considered herself ""incredibly lucky"". It was again as an events manager - but this time she was earning much more money. ""Also, deciding that life couldn't get much worse, I joined an online dating service for a weekend, and ended up meeting my husband, Mark, who is a risk and data manager."" The couple have been married for six years and have a three-year-old son, Barnaby. But Sally is mindful that life could have turned out very differently for her. ""I know others who really had a rough time for a number of years, through no fault of their own,"" she said. See more stories and videos like this Sally's life was turned upside down following the financial crash in 2008 Sally Stracey from Witham, Essex, said she had to make four people redundant shortly after the global crash. ""It was horrendously stressful,"" she said. ""I was working as a drawing office manager in the construction industry. ""The subcontractor that I worked for got into severe difficulty. It meant all the staff below me were made redundant. ""Our company went under in 2009. I'd sensed that something was wrong and left just before that happened."" But, with no job, Sally, at the age of 45, had to move 200 miles south, rent out her home in rural Derbyshire and move in with her mother, in Essex. It had been difficult at first, she said, until they had created their own spaces in the home. And then, in 2010, her mother was diagnosed with lung cancer and Sally was glad to be able to be there to look after her while she was ill. Sally's mother died the same year. Eventually, Sally found another job, again in the construction industry. And, 10 years later, she said: ""I am in a far, far better job, I have a new house in Essex and a great lifestyle."" Sally is also on a much better salary. And, all in all, she said, for her, the financial crash had been a ""blessing in disguise"".

"Ten years after the financial crisis, and the shockwaves are still being felt on people's finances. Personal debt levels are at record highs and our banks are fast disappearing from the high street. Low interest rate have left savers enduring a decade of paltry returns, but it's never been cheaper for mortgage borrowers. In the changed financial environment, the question to ask is: ""Are my finances fit for the next decade?"" Here, we examine four personal finances areas - homes, savings, borrowing and banking - to discover the lasting legacy of the financial crisis. The average UK house price fell from a pre-crisis peak of Â£190,032 in September 2007 to a low of Â£154,452 in March 2009, according to data from the Office for National Statistics and the Land Registry. Since then, the price of an average house has recovered to Â£228,384. Is that good news for homeowners? Not necessarily. There's no such thing as an average house, and for homeowners there's been a real north-south divide in the last decade in terms of property prices. Londoners and those in the south-east have seen prices soar, but elsewhere in the country, the picture is much different. Richard Donnell, insight director at Hometrack, said: ""Although a decade has passed since the crash, house prices have still not recovered back to the levels seen in 2008 in many markets across Britain. ""Northern Ireland and parts of northern England, Scotland and Wales are the areas most affected. House prices continued to fall in the markets most affected for up to four years after 2008 as demand for housing was impacted by tighter credit availability and weak economic growth."" In the capital, house prices started to bounce back strongly in 2010 on rising employment and increasing numbers of overseas investors, he said. It means the whole of the London housing market has house prices that are more than 50% higher than 2008 levels. What will happen next? Experts reckon prices will continue to rise but by less than in the last decade, and much less so in London. The UK Office for Budget Responsibility has predicted property price growth will fall to 2.4% by the end of 2019, while estate agents Strutt & Parker have predicted a 2.5% rise a year over the next two years. Meanwhile, accountants PWC have forecast that average UK house prices will rise by 4% a year until 2025. For Britain's savers, the last decade has been a disaster, especially those that had enjoyed decent returns in the years before. In fact. Â£1,000 tucked away in a savings account a decade before the crash would have yielded a healthy Â£652 in interest. But anyone who stashed Â£1,000 in an account in the last ten years would have earned interest of just Â£149. That's because in September 2008, the average deposit account paid interest of 3.1%, according to Bank of England data. That now stands at 0.43%. Ten years ago you could get 5% on instant access savings, more than 6% on a one-year bond and 7% on a five-year bond from well-known established high street names. Now the best rates are nowhere near as generous, with just 1.35% offered on instant access, 2.05% for one year and 2.70% for five years. According to James Blower, founder of The Savings Guru, around 30 new banks and 40 new providers have entered the savings market since the crash.  ""The best interest rates almost entirely come from these new providers,"" he said. Yet the traditional big financial institutions still hold around 85% of savings in the UK, with many savers' loyalty repaid by getting little or no interest on their nest-eggs. Hargreaves Lansdown analysis suggests there has been a huge rise in the amount of money held in accounts paying no interest in the last decade, from Â£48bn in September 2008 to Â£164bn today. ""While the value of the savings market has continued to grow around 5% a year to more than Â£1.5tn, the new entrants have taken much of the growth in the market, rather than make significant progress against the big players,"" said Mr Blower. But things could improve soon, predicted Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""At this point, savers have reason to be marginally more optimistic about the future,"" she said. ""That's because the regulator is looking more closely at how the industry functions, in an effort to protect savers from the lowest rates."" Average household debt has climbed from less than Â£3,000 to Â£4,000 in the last decade. There are lots of reasons for this, not least the easy credit that is available through plastic cards. Credit card companies have been competing to offer ever-longer interest-free periods to attract customers. In 2008 the longest 0% balance transfer was 15 months. Today, it is 36 months, although at one stage it reached a record high of 43 months. Analyst Andrew Hagger, of Moneycomms,co.uk, said: ""I'm not sure this is a good thing for all. Some savvy customers have moved balances around and paid little or no interest but others have struggled to repay their debt when their 0% deal ended - so are now being charged 20% APR or more."" He said it was one reason why personal debt levels have risen. ""It's been easy and cheap money a-plenty over the last decade but paying it back will prove to be a long and costly struggle for some."" Overdrafts have also changed in the last decade. Most banks have changed the way they charge, moving from charging by a traditional interest rates to either daily or monthly fees. ""Providers have proclaimed that daily fees are easier to understand,"" said Mr Hagger. ""That may be true, but at the same time they are also much more expensive for customers and a big profit driver."" The simple truth is that the way to reduce debt is to pay it off as quickly as you can and ignore the temptation of easy credit. With interest rates on the rise, what seems manageable debt now can quickly spiral into problems. There's a completely different banking landscape from 10 years ago, not least because traditional players have been busy closing branches. But at the same time the crisis marked the beginning of the entry of a whole new range of challenger banks. Back in 2008, the most likely challengers looked set to be the supermarkets, Tesco and Sainsbury's. Now the biggest challenge to traditional banking comes from branch-free app banks, such as Starling or Monzo. Julian Skan, senior managing director in banking at Accenture Strategy, said: ""Wider competition is now coming from platform players, which didn't exist ten years ago, and who have greater opportunities to bite at banking revenues."" But he warned that computer attacks are likely to increase in the years ahead, bringing a fresh challenge. ""Resiliency in the face of growing cyber risks is the new threat,"" Mr Skan said. But there also needs a change in outlook, according to Bevis Watts, managing director of ethical challenger Triodos Bank UK. He said: ""The pace of change has been far too slow and more needs to be done to re-purpose banking for good, through greater transparency on how money is used, carbon disclosure, impact reporting and using risk capital weightings to account for environmental and societal risks."" In other words, banks need to respond to the changing demands from customers in the next decade. Workers are Â£800 a year poorer post-crisis Who was to blame for the financial crisis?

"In recent years its production moved away from Europe to Mexico, closer to its key US market Volkswagen is ending production of its Beetle in 2019, closing the door on one of the world's most iconic car designs. The German company said output would end at its plant in Mexico next July after production of celebration models. The Beetle has its roots in Nazi Germany with the creation of a ""people's car"", but went on to star in a series of successful Disney films as a vehicle called Herbie. But sales, particularly in the key US market, have fallen in recent years. Mexico's enduring love for a classic car Volkswagen: A brief history Consumers in the US have increasingly turned to larger cars such as crossovers and sports utility vehicles. Volkswagen, in the wake of the diesel emissions scandal and huge investment in electric vehicles, says it will look to slim down its model range with a greater focus on family and electric cars. The company say the final Beetle models will be available in both coupe and convertible styles. The iconic design found fame in the 1960s as Herbie in The Love Bug - a character revived in 2005 ""The loss of the Beetle after three generations, over nearly seven decades, will evoke a host of emotions from the Beetle's many devoted fans,"" said Hinrich Woebcken, chief executive of Volkswagen Group of America. The Beetle was originally designed in the 1930s by legendary engineer Ferdinand Porsche - a name now synonymous with fast cars - at the behest of Adolf Hitler, who wanted to see a cheap and practical mass-produced car made available to the German people. But the outbreak of war would stall its production, as military necessity took precedence. The plant would be severely damaged, then fell into the hands of allied forces - who were eventually to play a large part in its recommissioning. It was intended as a family saloon for the average German worker Production began to take off in the late 1940s, and by 1955 a million of the cars were driving on German roads. The design would find international fame in the 1960s and '70s in films featuring Herbie the Love Bug, a racing car with a mind of its own. It was also popular with the 1960s counter-culture types who extolled the Beetle's small, practical, but aesthetic qualities. How Hitler's idea became a design icon What if the VW Beetle had never existed? Production of the Beetle has ceased and then been revived several times over the decades, with the last of the original design rolling out of VW's Mexican factory in 2003. The ""New Beetle"" redesign, which was based on VW's Golf, stormed the US market in the late 1990s, selling more than 80,000 in 1999.
