"The return to secondary school in January will be staggered in England, with some pupils starting online rather than in class, says the government. It will allow schools to set up aCovid testing scheme- but exam-year pupils will start term as usual. The National Education Union said making the announcement right at the end of the school term showed ""panic"". Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said testing would ""clamp down"" on the virus after the Christmas break. ""Armed forces personnel"" will support the planning for testing in schools, says the Department for Education. Apart from those taking GCSEs, A-levels and vocational exams next year, secondary school pupils will study online for the first week back in January. School infection rates reflect local levels Mass testing scheme for schools in January School attendance plummeted after half term This is to allow schools to make preparations for mass Covid testing - which will offer school staff a test each week and a daily test for seven days for pupils in contact with a positive case. Those exam year pupils returning for face-to-face lessons will also be offered tests, with all testing to be on a voluntary basis and requiring parental consent. Face-to-face learning is expected to re-start for all by 11 January. Asimilar scheme has been announced for Wales, where schools went online on Monday. A full return to the classroom is expected by 18 January at the latest. But school leaders have reacted angrily at having to set up and manage such a testing system with so little notice - with the National Association of Head Teachers calling it a ""shambles"". ""They have handed schools a confused and chaotic mess at the eleventh hour,"" said the union's leader Paul Whiteman. Jules White, head of Tanbridge House School in Horsham, said: ""The government has spent Â£22bn on a mass testing programme for test and trace. ""Schools are being asked to deliver mass testing for staff and students during the Christmas period with no funding, an 'idiot's guide' handbook and barely any notice."" The government is insisting the change to the start of term is not an extension to the school holidays and primary schools will not be affected by the move. But it comes after the Department for Education instructed all local authorities to keep schools open in the final days of term, despite several initially telling parents that schools would close early and head teachers calling for more flexibility for online study. Teaching unions have challenged the practicality of being expected to train and deploy an ""army of volunteers"" to run the testing. The National Education Union has now written to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson saying the plans for a school testing system are ""inoperable"". It said: ""Telling school leaders, on the last day of term [for many schools], that they must organise volunteers and parents, supported by their staff, to test pupils in the first week of term, whilst Year 11 and 13 pupils are on site for in-school teaching, is a ridiculous ask."" Teachers were already ""exhausted by the unreasonable demands, backed by legal threats, that they have been subjected to this term"", said the union's letter. It added that running such medical procedures was ""significantly outside the experience and job description"" of school staff, highlighting expert advice that tests carried out by non-specialists were less likely to be effective. Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union said: ""Yet again the government is announcing significant changes affecting schools with little or no time to prepare before the Christmas closure period."" He said it was not the responsibility of teachers or school leaders to undertake testing of pupils or employees. ""The government has to ensure that it puts into place all the necessary resources needed to deliver the practical and financial support to schools to ensure safety in schools,"" said Dr Roach. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said: ""We are very concerned about the feasibility of setting up a testing programme at the scale envisaged."" He added: ""The profession is very willing to work with the government over how to roll-out mass testing, but ministers must understand that chaotic, last-minute announcements do not constitute a collaborative approach."" As the plans for January have been announced, an official study suggestsvirus rates in schools reflect the levels in their local communities. Virus rates have been growing fast in some areas, including London and south-east England, in recent weeks, with many schools affected. The analysis of tests on 10,000 staff and pupils from Public Health England, Office for National Statistics and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found 1.24% of pupils and 1.29% of staff tested positive for coronavirus in schools. However, the impact of those cases will have been felt by many more, as close contacts were required to go home and self-isolate. The governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not announced any changes to the start of the January term, but schools in Wales moved online last Monday.

"The FBI is among those investigating the hacking campaign The US energy department is the latest agency to confirm it has been breached in what is being described as the worst-ever hack on the US government. The department is responsible for managing US nuclear weapons, but said the arsenal's security had not been compromised. Tech giant Microsoft also said on Thursday that it had found malicious software in its systems. Many suspect the Russian government is responsible. It has denied any role. The US treasury and commerce departments are among the other targets of the sophisticated, months-long breach, which was first acknowledged by officials on Sunday. SolarWinds: Why the Sunburst hack matters More US government agencies hacked 'State-sponsored' hack hits US cyber-security firm Tech Tent: Hacking the heart of the US government Researchers, who have named the hack Sunburst, say it could take years to fully comprehend what is one of the biggest ever cyber-attacks. Joe Biden said America would impose ""substantial costs on those responsible for such malicious attacks"" President Donald Trump is yet to comment on the cyber-attacks. Meanwhile, US President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to make cyber-security a ""top priority"" of his administration. ""We need to disrupt and deter our adversaries from undertaking significant cyber-attacks in the first place,"" he said. ""We will do that by, among other things, imposing substantial costs on those responsible for such malicious attacks, including in co-ordination with our allies and partners."" America's top cyber agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (Cisa), gave a stark warning on Thursday, saying that addressing the intrusion would be ""highly complex and challenging"". It said ""critical infrastructure"" had been damaged, federal agencies and private sector companies compromised, and that the damage posed a ""grave threat"". The hack began in at least March 2020, and those responsible had ""demonstrated patience, operational security, and complex tradecraft"", the Cisa said. The agency did not identify what information had been stolen or exposed. Addressing the attack on the energy department, spokeswoman Shaylyn Hynes confirmed it was responding to a cyber-breach - but said ""the malware has been isolated to business networks only"". She said security functions at the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), which oversees US nuclear weapons, had not been affected. The list of who was hacked is already long - and it is going to get longer. These are still early, and quite frantic, days in the investigation as government departments, companies and organisations race to see if they have a backdoor in their systems and what might have been stolen through it over a period of months. The scale is potentially huge, but the truth is no-one is quite sure of the impact yet. So far, this looks to have been classic espionage - the targeted theft of information. There is not much sign yet that the hackers were planning to disrupt systems or carry out real world damage, although that could still emerge. That also makes it trickier for the US to respond - after all, espionage is something it also carries out regularly. The problem is that in this case US defences were not good enough to spot and stop those responsible. ""There's a lot we don't yet know, but what we do know is a matter of great concern,"" Mr Biden has said. Hackers are known to have at least monitored data within a range of key US government departments including state, defence, homeland security, treasury and commerce, Reuters news agency reports. Cisa said the perpetrators managed to breach computer networks using network management software made by the Texas-based IT company SolarWinds. Up to 18,000 SolarWinds Orion customers downloaded updates containing malicious software installed by hackers. All US federal civilian agencies were told to remove SolarWinds from their servers earlier this week as a result. Cisa said it was investigating ""evidence of additional access vectors, other than the SolarWinds Orion platform"". Microsoft said it had identified more than 40 of its customers who were targeted in the cyber-attack, including government agencies, think tanks, non-governmental organisations and IT companies. About 80% of these were in the US, while others were in Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Spain, the UK, Israel and the UAE. The company's president Brad Smith said the attack was ""remarkable for its scope, sophistication and impact"". ""This is not 'espionage as usual,' even in the digital age,""he wrote in a blog post,external. ""Instead, it represents an act of recklessness that created a serious technological vulnerability for the United States and the world."" Neither Cisa or the FBI have publicly said who they believe to be behind the attacks, but private security companies and officials quoted in US media have pointed the finger at Russia. The Washington Post cast suspicion on a Russian hacking group called Cozy Bear or APT 29, which has ties to the country's spy agencies. Bears with keyboards: Russian hackers snoop on West The Post reported that the same Russian group hacked the State Department and White House email servers while Barack Obama was president. In a statement shared on social media on Monday,external, the Russian embassy in the US said it ""does not conduct offensive operations in the cyber domain"". ""Malicious activities in the information space contradict the principles of the Russian foreign policy, national interests and our understanding of interstate relations,"" the embassy said.

"This video can not be played A Conservative MP who attended a business dinner was in âbreach of the regulationsâ the home secretary says Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood broke Covid rules by giving a speech at a dinner in London, the home secretary has said. Mr Ellwood had defended his ""well-intentioned attendance"" at the event, saying it was ""fully Covid compliant"". He said he was sorry coverage of it had ""muddled the government's clear message as we head towards Christmas"". But home secretary Priti Patel said he had broken the rules and suggested he could face a fine. Asked about Mr Ellwood's actions, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""I would point you to the home secretary's words. ""The PM has been clear throughout the pandemic that it's vital for everybody to abide by the rules in order to suppress the virus and therefore protect the NHS and save lives."" Toughest Covid rules extended in south of England Which places are moving into tier three? The Iraq Britain Business Council reception, on Tuesday, took place a day before London entered tier three. It was initially described as a ""Christmas dinner"" on the council's website but its president, Tory peer Baroness Nicholson, later said it was a business event. Asked by ITV News if Mr Ellwood's attendance was a breach of the rules, Ms Patel said: ""Well, it is. Of course it is exactly that. ""Having dinner outside of the rules with a large number of people is a breach of the regulations."" Asked if there should be a punishment, Ms Patel said: ""There are fixed penalty notices. I don't know the details as to where this happened or the location, but I'm sure, as it is a breach, that will be followed up."" Tobias Ellwood addressing guests at Tuesday's event The government's tier two guidance states that ""gatherings for work purposes are only allowed where they are reasonably necessary"". Mr Ellwood, who chairs the Commons defence committee, attended the event the day after telling MPs that allowing families to meet over Christmas for five days ""could be very dangerous indeed"". He urged Health Secretary Matt Hancock to review the policy ""so we don't begin the new year with a third wave"". In an interview with BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Mr Ellwood said he did not know the event had been advertised as a Christmas party when he accepted the invitation. This was ""absolutely a business dinner"" following the Covid guidelines, he said. He explained everyone had been more than two metres apart during the event, at which he had learned a lot about the current situation in Iraq and the Middle East. ""I did this because I make an effort to understand what's going on around the world. If I had the choice between going home to play Lego or this, I know where I'd prefer to be,"" he said. But he said he accepted his decision to attend would be criticised. ""Perceptions count and I'm really, really sorry that this coverage of a well-intentioned attendance may have muddied the government's clear message as we head towards Christmas,"" he added. Asked if he was considering his position as chair of the defence committee, he denied breaching the rules. ""But it's the interpretation which I fully appreciate is very different indeed and perception counts - particularly people with a profile. I've been critical and have been vocal about this,"" he said. On the matter of a fine, he said Ms Patel needed to speak to the venue first, then ""let's have a conversation"". The Daily Mail,which first reported Mr Ellwood's attendance,externalat the event, said there had been 27 guests. London moved from tier two to tier three on Wednesday morning. Mr Ellwood, MP for Bournemouth East, told the BBC he had not been present for the whole event and that he had contacted the venue in advance to confirm it was Covid secure. Other guests at the reception included a delegation from the Iraqi Embassy. One of the original photographs appeared to show some attendees standing in small groups taking part in a drinks reception. The rules for tier two state that alcohol at venues should be served as part of a substantial meal or with table service. Baroness Nicholson told the BBC that once she became aware that the event have been described as a ""party"" she immediately asked for it to be clarified. She stressed it was an important business function. Asked why it had initially been labelled as a ""Christmas dinner"" and ""party"" on the organisation's website, she said: ""I think someone was trying to be cheerful"". In a statement on its website, the IBBC said ""working with the venue this event was fully Covid compliant"".

"Thousands of people have gone for testing on Sydney's Northern Beaches Hundreds of thousands of Sydney residents have been told to stay home after a new outbreak of coronavirus ended a two-week run of no local cases. Australian officials are scrambling to trace the source of the infection, after finding 28 cases across the city's Northern Beaches region. The New South Wales (NSW) government has urged all locals to wear masks in public areas and to be on ""high alert"". Residents now face curbs on travel to the country's other states. The new cluster has sparked national concern and cast uncertainty over many Australians' plans for a relatively normal Christmas. Prior to Wednesday, the country had recorded just one locally acquired case in the past fortnight. About 250,000 people live in Sydney's Northern Beaches - they have been asked to stay home until Monday and to get tested if they have symptoms. Others have been told to avoid the area, and to use a mask when on public transport and in public spaces like supermarkets and churches. The outbreak has emerged as many people travel home for the Christmas period Unlike in Melbourne, mask-wearing has not been a common practice in Sydney in recent months due to low rates of infection. But NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged the city's five million residents to be ""extra Covid-safe"" and to reconsider their social activities and movements. ""If we get on top of this in the next two or three days, all of us will have a much better Christmas,"" she told reporters on Friday. ""But if we don't... it could mean further restrictions down the track,"" she added. How Melbourne's long lockdown crushed a second wave Australia abandons vaccine over false HIV response She said that constituted a ""proportional"" response for now, but added: ""I don't want to underestimate how serious the current outbreak is."" In recent months, authorities nationally have lifted most restrictions on daily life and reopened internal borders asAustralia beat its second wave - which was centred in Melbourne. But in response to Sydney's outbreak, several states have begun reinstating bans or quarantine restrictions on travellers from the Northern Beaches region. Western Australia also announced an even broader two-week quarantine order for all those arriving from NSW. NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said he had seen an ""avalanche"" of complacency in Sydney in recent weeks. ""This cluster serves as a timely reminder to all of that we are still in the middle of a worldwide Covid pandemic,"" he said. This video can not be played Cheers and tears as families reunited in Sydney in November Tests have shown that the Northern Beaches outbreak is similar to a strain of Covid-19 found recently in quarantined travellers, state officials said. But authorities still do not know how it got into the community. They said it had spread after one couple failed to isolate at home while awaiting Covid test results. Their December 11 visit to a popular lawn bowls club and pub in the Northern Beaches suburb of Avalon has now been identified as the ""super spreader"" event. However it's unclear how the couple - who hadn't travelled overseas - became infected. Phil Mercer, BBC in Sydney's Northern Beaches A steel moveable bridge at the Spit, a large sandbar, connects Sydney's Northern Beaches to central parts of the city. It's a towering symbol of separateness that many locals on the so-called ""insular peninsula"" appreciate. But an alarming Covid-19 cluster has turned the tables on one of Sydney's most popular, but often parochial, seaside playgrounds. More than 250,000 residents have been told to stay at home and avoid non-essential travel for at three least days, and possibly more. For now, they are not welcome in other parts of Australia. All states and territories have brought in emergency border controls for travellers from the Northern Beaches, which includes Manly and Palm Beach, where the long-running soap opera Home and Away is filmed. Thousands of people have gone for testing on Sydney's Northern Beaches Christmas holiday plans have been ruined.  It's a reminder to Australians that the fight against the virus is far from over. Since Australia closed its borders in March, its outbreaks have largely begun with breaches in its hotel quarantine system for returned international travellers. Typically, these have involved workers in those locations unknowingly spreading the virus. Such instances led to Australia's biggest outbreak in Melbourne, and a quickly-contained outbreak in Adelaide. Overall Australia has recorded 908 deaths and just over 28,000 infections since the pandemic began - far fewer than many nations. It has been praised for responding quickly to the pandemic with border shutdowns, lockdown measures and aggressive contract-tracing efforts. Some failures, however, have been blamed for deaths.

"Commons leader Jacob Rees Mogg has accused Unicef of ""playing politics"" after the charity launched a campaign to help feed children in the UK. The Tory MP said the charity was meant to look after people in the poorest countries and should be ""ashamed"". It comes after Unicef said it would pledge Â£25,000 to a south London charity to help supply breakfast boxes over the Christmas holidays. Unicef said every child deserves to ""thrive"" no matter where they are born. Unicef to feed children in UK for first time Poverty and virus 'push families closer to brink' Fighting food poverty in a virus lockdown The grant to the charity School Food Matters in Southwark aims to help vulnerable children and families during the coronavirus crisis. Unicef said the initiative was its first emergency response in the UK in its 70-year history. This video can not be played ""It is a real scandal that Unicef should be playing politics in this way."" Mr Rees-Mogg was responding to a question from Labour MP Zarah Sultana in the House of Commons. ""For the first time ever, Unicef, the UN agency responsible for providing humanitarian aid to children, is having to feed working-class kids in the UK,"" she said. ""But while children go hungry, a wealthy few enjoy obscene riches."" She asked if Mr Rees-Mogg would ""give government time to discuss the need to make him and his super-rich chums pay their fair share so that we can end the grotesque inequality that scars our society"". Responding, Mr Rees-Mogg said Unicef ""should be ashamed of itself"". ""I think it is a real scandal that Unicef should be playing politics in this way when it is meant to be looking after people in the poorest, the most deprived, countries of the world where people are starving, where there are famines and where there are civil wars, and they make cheap political points of this kind, giving, l think, Â£25,000 to one council,"" he said. ""It is a political stunt of the lowest order."" He said the number of children in absolute poverty across the country had gone down by 100,000 over the past decade, which he described as ""a record of success"". In response, Anna Kettley, Unicef UK's director of programmes and advocacy, said: ""Unicef UK is responding to this unprecedented crisis and building on our 25 years' experience of working on children's rights in the UK with a one-off domestic response, launched in August, to provide support to vulnerable children and families around the country during this crisis period."" She said more than Â£700,000 was being granted to community groups around the country to help tackle food insecurity during the pandemic. ""Unicef will continue to spend our international funding helping the world's poorest children. We believe that every child is important and deserves to survive and thrive no matter where they are born,"" she added.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has extended the furlough scheme for one month until the end of April next year. He said the move would provide ""certainty for millions of jobs and businesses"". It means the government will continue to pay up to 80% of the wages of workers who have been furloughed. Mr Sunak also confirmed he would be extending the government-guaranteed Covid-19 business loan schemes until the end of March. These changes come in the run-up to the next Budget, which the chancellor confirmed would take place on 3 March 2021. The roll-out of vaccinations has provided hope for businesses struggling to get through a winter of stop-start measures to control the virus. But it is likely to be several months before enough of the population has been covered to allow for anything like business as usual. Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid? Furlough extension buys time as vaccine is rolled out ""Our package of support for businesses and workers continues to be one of the most generous and effective in the world - helping our economy to recover and protecting livelihoods across the country,"" Mr Sunak said. ""We know the premium businesses place on certainty, so it is right that we enable them to plan ahead regardless of the path the virus takes, which is why we're providing certainty and clarity by extending this support."" Holly Muldoon, co-founder of RubyLemon, a UK entertainment and event agency Holly Muldoon is the co-founder of RubyLemon, an entertainment and event staffing agency based in London. She welcomes Mr Sunak's announcement, which will mean her office team can be furloughed for longer, but says it's also a worrying sign. ""It's good to know we've got a bit of support there, but it's a bit devastating. Realistically if it's extended until April, this means we're not going to get back to work until at least May,"" she says. Most of the 1,500 people who work for RubyLemon across the UK are freelancers and performers, who can't be furloughed, and will continue to struggle as they wait for business to restart. ""That's why it's really important that the events industry comes back, as we can't give anyone work,"" Ms Muldoon explained. The move drew criticism from the opposition. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said Mr Sunak had ""waited until the last possible minute to act, leaving businesses in the dark with less than 24 hours before they have to issue redundancy notices"". She added: ""Rishi Sunak's irresponsible, last-minute decision-making has left the UK with the worst recession of any major economy."" But CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said the package would ""bring some much-needed certainty and respite"" for businesses. ""Stable employer contributions and an extension to the Job Retention Scheme until the end of April will mean the scheme continues to protect people's livelihoods,"" she added. ""And with cashflow difficulties still at the forefront of the minds of many business owners, continued access to government-backed loans through to spring will bring great comfort."" Industry body UKHospitality said the extension to the furlough scheme was ""welcome"", but it still has grave concerns. ""With yet more of the country having been served notice of moving into tighter restrictions and 72,500 of Britain's 110,00 licensed premises unable to open and a further 12,500 wet led venues with little chance of reopening, more will be needed to safeguard jobs and businesses in a sector being seemingly singled out to bear the brunt of Covid measures,"" said UKHospitality's chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""Without additional business support to accompany this extension, there will inevitably be more widespread business failures and job losses."" The government will continue to pay up to 80% of the salary of employees for hours not worked until the end of April, with a cap of Â£2,500 a month. Employers will only be required to pay the wages, National Insurance (NI) contributions and pensions for hours worked, as well as NI contributions and pensions for hours not worked. The eligibility criteria for the UK-wide scheme will remain unchanged and these changes will continue to apply to all devolved administrations, the government said. The extension of the furlough scheme into April will help some firms - but only to pay wages. Firms urgently need further cash to pay rent, suppliers and energy bills. The Bank of England estimated last week that the private sector as a whole has Â£180bn less cash coming in this financial year than it needs to cover costs. Extending availability of emergency loans by two months may help ease that huge squeeze on cash flow. But it's not clear more debt is the answer. The National Audit Office has estimated that up to Â£26bn of the Â£43bn lent in Bounce Back Loans may not be paid back. There's now growing pressure to offer much more in grants, not loans, to stop a bleak Christmas ruining thousands of normally healthy businesses in the new year. The risk is stark: if you ban two-thirds of the country from meeting anyone from another household indoors eight days before Christmas, tens of thousands of pubs, restaurants and hotels could go under. The furlough scheme is officially known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. So far, it has supported 9.6 million jobs across the UK, with more than one million businesses using it. Businesses will also have until the end of March to access the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, and the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme. These had been due to close at the end of January. To date, they have already provided more than Â£68bn in guaranteed loans to firms. Hospitality, leisure and retail providers have been particularly severely affected by months of changing regulations, sharply reducing their revenues. On Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announcedmore parts of south-eastern England would move into tier three, the strictest level of measures. London was moved to tier three on Wednesday.

"Some 90,000 African artefacts are in France MPs in France have voted to return to Senegal and Benin prized artefacts that were looted during colonial times. Benin will receive a throne taken in 1892 from the palace of Behanzin, the last king of what was then Dahomey. Senegal will get a sword that belonged to a 19th-Century sheikh. Former colonial powers are under pressure to return looted artefacts - mainly from Africa. There some 90,000 African artefacts in France, most from sub-Saharan Africa. French Culture Minister Roselyne Bachelot said President Emmanuel Macron intended to ""renew and deepen the partnership between France and the African continent"". The National Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favour of the return of the artefacts on Thursday. Benin will receive 26 pieces of the Treasure of Behanzin, including the throne of King Glele, a main attraction at the the Quai Branly-Jacques Chirac museum in Paris, where around 70,000 African artefacts are housed.

"The government has turned down a request from the port of Dover for financial support, which could lead to delays after 1 January, its chief executive has told the BBC. ""Without this funding it's going to make the transition more challenging than it is today,"" said Doug Bannister. The government said it had already made ""unprecedented"" new investments in port infrastructure. Several UK ports, including Dover, are facing congestion already. And in two weeks' time, new rules will govern trade and travel between the UK and the EU. ""The port is as prepared as we can be. We've been at this for four years now,"" said Mr Bannister. He added that questions remained over how ready businesses were to trade under the new conditions. ""That is going to be the unknown... until we see it happening,"" he said. Mr Bannister said the port is facing ""the greatest period of uncertainty"" it had seen Around 9,000 trucks pass through the port of Dover every day, transporting nearly 20% of all the goods sold in the UK. Congestion and delays around the UK's ports have already caused concern there could be serious disruption when Britain's trading relationship with the EU changes at the end of this year. However Mr Bannister said that January was typically a slow period which might allow new systems to bed in before cargo volumes started to pick up again. ""We are trying to move ourselves through the greatest period of uncertainty that this facility has seen,"" he said. 'Shipping delays have cost me Â£20,000 in sales' Ikea sorry after port disruption delays orders Brexit: Will the borders be ready? On Wednesday, the government turned down a request for Â£33m of funding to facilitate extra French passport checks on people travelling out of Dover. Dover had requested the extra support as part of the Port Infrastructure Fund, which is designed to smooth the switch to the new rules. After 1 January, anyone travelling from the UK to France will face stricter checks and stamps in their passports. ""Being denied the funding for this programme - what that does mean is that we could see increased friction and increased hold ups while we get through the opening period of the transition,"" said Mr Bannister. However, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, responding to a question in the House of Commons, said: ""The funding in the port infrastructure fund was specifically available for projects that were due to be delivered by July next year, when full import controls will be in place. Dover was bidding for some infrastructure that would be complete by 2023."" The government has made ""an unprecedented"" Â£470m available for new infrastructure in and around the UK's ports, a spokesperson said. Current congestion around the port of Dover was due to the extra pressure of the Christmas trading period, firms stockpiling ahead of the end of the Brexit transition period, and overspill from problems in other ports including Felixstowe, Mr Bannister said. The UK and the EU are still locked in talks over a trade deal to take effect at the end of this year. Although the UK left the EU in January, an 11-month-long transition period was agreed during which previous trade relations would continue.

"Tougher restrictions - including a potential lockdown - after the festive period cannot be ruled out, the deputy first minister has warned. John Swinney said the Scottish government would review Covid levels next Tuesday as part of an unplanned ""decision-making moment"". He said the move reflected the ""deteriorating situation"" across Scotland and the UK. Ministers have however ruled out a law change around the five-day festivities. The current Covid rules will be relaxed between 23 and 27 December to allow people to travel within the UK and spend Christmas together. UK keeps Christmas rules but some advice changes Covid Christmas risk 'hard to control' What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? But the government said on Wednesday it wouldtoughen its Christmas guidancewith people urged not to stay overnight in another house unless necessary. Mr Swinney said next week's review ""reflected the changing position that has developed over the last two or three weeks"". He told theBBC's Good Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""Unfortunately, in Scotland today, we are in a rising tide of coronavirus cases. ""The less we do to have social interaction in the period going forward, the better, in terms of stemming the rise in coronavirus cases within our community."" Mr Swinney said cases were beginning to rise again in Scotland, with 99 cases per 100,000 people 10 days ago increasing to 116. The Welsh government announced on Wednesdaythat tougher restrictions will be imposed on the country immediately after the Christmas easing period, which is due to end on December 27. Asked if the Scottish government was considering similar measures, Mr Swinney did not rule out the idea of a lockdown or tougher restrictions. ""We'll have to look at what the forward prospects look like, we'll have to take decisions that will be sustainable for a period into January and February to protect the public interest and protect the National Health Service,"" he said. Asked specifically if there could be greater restrictions or a possible lockdown, he said: ""That could be a possibility, I can't rule it out."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Wednesday the safest way to spend Christmas was ""unequivocally"" to stay within your own household and your own home. It came as Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the four UK nations had ""unanimously"" agreed to keep relaxed Christmas Covid rules in place between 23 and 27 December. The four UK nations previously agreed a set of rules for the festive period, which has been set down in legislation and is not expected to change - even though the guidance has been updated.

"This video can not be played The health secretary announces several more counties in southern and eastern England will face stronger restrictions More than two-thirds of England's population will be living under the toughest Covid-19 rules from Saturday. Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Hertfordshire will move to tier three, as will parts of Surrey, East Sussex, Cambridgeshire and Hampshire. And swathes of the nation already in tier three will remain there. Announcing the changes, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs: ""We've come so far, we mustn't blow it now."" Bristol and North Somerset will move from tier three to tier two, and Herefordshire will move from tier two into tier one. The changes come into effect at 00:01 on Saturday. It comes as the UK recorded a further 532 coronavirus deaths, taking the total number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus to 66,052. A further 35,383 cases were also recorded on Thursday, up from 25,161 on the previous day. This figure includes11,000 positive cases from Wales that were not previously recorded in official figuresdue to maintenance work on Public Health Wales' computer systems at the end of last week. Which places are moving into tier three? UK coronavirus cases up by 25,161 on Wednesday Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live The announcement on tiers means that 68% of England's population - 38 million people - will be living under the toughest restrictions of tier three from the weekend. Some 30% of the population will be in tier two, while just 2% will be in tier one. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was concerned the tier system was ""just not strong enough to control the virus"". ""We've been seeing the numbers going in the wrong direction across the country in the last seven days in particular,"" he added. In Greater Manchester, which was first placed in tier three on 23 October, mayor Andy Burnham said he was ""not surprised but very disappointed""that the region was staying in tier three, having called for some parts to be downgraded. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Greater Manchester has lower infection rates than Liverpool and London had ""when they were originally put into"" tier two. ""It feels like if... London and the South East has rising cases, everyone stays under restrictions,"" he said. Announcing the outcome of the first formal review of the new tier system in England, Mr Hancock told MPs ""no-one wants tougher restrictions any longer than necessary"". However, he said ""these are always the most difficult months for people's health"" and we ""must keep suppressing this virus"". Cases have risen by 46% in the past week in the south-east of England, he told MPs, and were up by two-thirds in the east of England. Meanwhile, the government has announcedthe return to school in January will be staggered for secondary pupils in England, with some starting term online rather than in class. It will allow schools to set up a Covid testing scheme - but exam-year pupils will start term as usual. There will also be a staggered return for schools in Walesafter the Christmas break. The health secretary said from 00:01 Saturday 19 December: Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Peterborough, the whole of Hertfordshire, Surrey (except Waverley), Hastings and Rother, Portsmouth, Gosport and Havant will move intotier three. Bristol and North Somerset will be moved down totier two. Herefordshire will move from tier two totier one. With the majority of the country in the highest tier, many will be wondering how long it will be before the rules are relaxed. The trajectories are quite different across the tier three areas. Large parts of the North have seen cases fall and now have lower than average infection rates, although there are signs those decreases have stalled. Other areas, particularly large parts of the home counties, have relatively low rates that are rising. Then there are places - east London and the surrounding areas - that have high rates that are rising. The fact that they are all facing the tightest restrictions is a sign of how cautious ministers are being. That, of course, is because of the Christmas relaxation - and fear it could lead to a spike in cases. If that happens, tier three could become the norm for months - maybe accompanied by a third lockdown. That would leave the government and public pinning everything on the vaccine programme. Earlier this week, ministers said a good start had been made with 137,000 people vaccinated. But there are more than 25 million in the priority groups - 12 million of them over the age of 65. In theory, two million could be vaccinated every week, but that depends on multiple things going right. This could become the status quo for many until the spring. Around 34 million people have already been living under tier three rules. London, most of Essex and parts of Hertfordshire were placed under the strictest curbs on social contacts on Wednesday. They joined much of the Midlands, north-west England and north-east England. The news Greater Manchester would remain in tier three provoked anger from some of the area's MPs, including Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers. ""The statement will be greeted with dismay in Greater Manchester where we have had severe restrictions for nine months, where in nine of the 10 boroughs rates are below the national average,"" he said. And the West Midlands' Conservative mayor Andy Street called for more government funding to support businesses in tier three areas. Leaders in areas moving from tier two to tier three also expressed their concerns. Stephen McPartland, Conservative MP for Stevenage in Hertfordshire, tweeted that it was ""ridiculous"" the town is ""being dragged into"" tier three. He said tiers ""should be imposed on a district basis instead of this unbalanced county-wide approach"". Gerald Vernon-Jackson, the Liberal Democrat leader of Portsmouth City Council, said the decision to introduce the toughest measures there was ""bizarre"". He said he was ""slightly surprised"" because he had been told that ""the problem"" was with the city's Queen Alexandra Hospital. However, the hospital also serves nearby local authorities, such as Fareham and Winchester City, which were not being moved up. ""The government has made a number of bizarre decisions, so it's no surprise they have made another one,"" he said. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug?

"The Scottish government is to toughen its Christmas guidance, with people being urged not to stay overnight in another house unless it is unavoidable. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the safest way to spend Christmas was ""unequivocally"" to stay within your own household and your own home. Those who feel it is essential to visit another household indoors should only do so on one of the five days. And any interaction with other households should ideally be outdoors. The new strengthened guidance will be published by the Scottish government later on Wednesday. It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the four UK nations had ""unanimously"" agreed to keep relaxed Christmas Covid rules in place between 23 and 27 December. UK keeps Christmas rules but some advice changes Covid Christmas risk 'hard to control' What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? But some advice will change in different parts of the UK, and sterner warnings will be issued to urge people to keep social contact low. Wales has already said it will be advising that people from only two households, rather than three, should mix over the festive period. Andnon-essential shops in Wales will closefrom the end of trading on Christmas Eve, with the country going into a stay-at-home lockdown four days later. Ms Sturgeon told her daily coronavirus briefing that the Scottish government would also be issuing strengthened guidance. However, the current limit on no more than eight people from three households meeting indoors in Scotland will remain in place, with Ms Sturgeon saying it would not be fair or realistic at this stage to remove that flexibility. She said rates of the virus were currently lower in Scotland than other parts of the UK, but warned against complacency. The first minister said her government's latest advice was to: Spend Christmas in your own home and with your own household Meet other households outdoors if possible Only meet indoors with another household if it is essential Limit the duration and number of people in any indoor meetings as much as possible If you do form a bubble, only meet people in it for one day, if possible Do not stay overnight in another home unless it is unavoidable The first minister went on to say that the Scottish government recommends against travel from areas with a high prevalence of coronavirus to parts of the country with a lower prevalence. She added: ""We will set out advice if you are living in any of the nations in one of the highest level of protection - which in England and London is tier three - then we don't think you should be travelling to other parts of the UK."" ""If you haven't made plans to form a bubble, please don't"", the first minister urged. ""If you are still swithering, please decide against. And if you have made plans but think they are not really essential, please think about postponing until later in the year. ""The reality is that this Christmas simply can't be normal. But we have every reason to hope that next year's will be much more normal."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson later told a Downing Street press conference that ""a shorter Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas"". He added: ""When we say three households can meet on five days, I want to stress, these are maximums, not targets to aim for, and it's always going to be safest to minimise the number of people you meet. ""If that means you're visiting others, we're asking you, for the five days beforehand, as early as Friday, to reduce the number of people you're in contact with to the lowest possible."" The four UK nations previously agreed a set of rules for the festive period, which has been set down in legislation and is not expected to change - even though the guidance has been updated.

And they warned that a newstrain of coronavirusthat has been detected in the UK, including some cases in Scotland, ""has introduced further potential jeopardy"". Global public health expert Dr Andrew Lee from Sheffield University said the Christmas period was a difficult balancing act for all politicians. He told BBC Scotland: ""They are all trying to avoid being The Grinch, but the numbers aren't looking good. ""If we have super-spreading over Christmas, we will have a bumper number of infections come January."" Scotland has recorded a further 689 new cases of the virus in the past 24 hours, as well as the deaths of 38 who had tested positive - taking the total by that measure to 4,173.

"If most UK households get together in ""bubbles"" for the Christmas break, coronavirus infection rates could be hard to control. That's the warning from scientists modelling the potential spread of the virus over the five-day period. In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland the rule is that three different households can temporarily come together under one roof, while in Wales just two are allowed. But there is growing pressure on ministers to change that policy, amid fears of a spike in cases. How to avoid catching Covid this Christmas What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? Leading journals warn over Christmas relaxation Last month, a report by the government's scientific advisers warned the number of infections could easily double over the course of the break. Studies have shown the coronavirus spreads most easily in packed, stuffy rooms where people are together for long periods of time - a typical scenario for Christmas gatherings. And the greater the spread of the virus in the community, the more the chance that someone in a household gathering will be infected, possibly without realising if they have no symptoms. In recent weeks, teams of scientists across the UK have been trying to get a more exact sense of the potential impact of relaxing restrictions. But it's a difficult task with no exact answers, because everything depends on how people choose to spend the coming days - and that's impossible to predict. Scientists at the University of Bristol studied the implications of the bubbles themselves and the effect of having different households come together. And early results, yet to be formally published, indicate the fewer people take up the option of forming a bubble with others, the better, from the point of view of containing the disease. If a single-person household joins another household of any size, the impact on infection rates would be marginal, they suggest. But if all households in the UK paired up with one other, each bubble would contain an average of 4.7 people. That would lead to a reproduction (R) number within households of between 1.9-2.4. And an R number is above one means the disease is escalating. If only half the UK's households join a bubble, that could still raise the R number by 30%. A modern browser with Javascript and a stable internet connection is required to view this interactive. The Bristol modellers assessed the implications of all households across the country opting for the maximum Christmas mixing allowed - by forming a bubble with two other households. In that case, there would be an average of just over seven people in each bubble. And the R number would jump to 2.84-3.55, suggesting a rapid surge in infections. The research concludes everyone joining a Christmas bubble ""has the potential to make transmission extremely hard to control."" According to Dr Ellen Brooks-Pollock, a member of the team, if people understand the scale of the risks, then it will help them work out how best to respond. ""It's important to be as honest as possible about results from the work from the analysis that we've done,"" she says. ""And it's easy to imagine a kind of terrible scenario. ""But actually, when you start modelling it, you can then start thinking about how you would balance these increased risks somewhere else."" Forming household bubbles ""should not be encouraged in general"", Dr Brooks-Pollock says. If people don't really need to get together with another household, it would really help if they didn't. And if they do, they should minimise contacts with people outside the bubble as much as possible - to prevent them  picking up infections while together at Christmas and then dispersing the virus to friends and colleagues when they return home to other parts of the UK. Scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have been investigating the likely scale of social mixing over the Christmas period. Having schools and many workplaces closed at that time should help reduce the number of infections overall. But increased social interaction in homes will have the opposite effect. Key to the effect on infection rates will be how well people limit their interactions before entering their Christmas bubble. ""There is a big risk over Christmas of essentially a transfer of infection from younger groups with more contacts into older age groups who might not usually have this level of mixing especially in this kind of year,"" Dr Adam Kucharski, an associate professor at the LSHTM, says. ""Even in normal years, we do see an increase in hospitalisations for things like pneumonia after the Christmas period. ""And it's likely the sort of inter-generational mixing we see over this Christmas break will be contributing to that, because essentially we have groups with very different risk profiles mixing in ways they don't usually. ""What happens when we get to January is very hard to predict because it's such an unusual year. ""But it all depends on how exclusive and large the gatherings are and how careful people are before and after Christmas.""

"Scotland's drug death rate is three and a half times higher than England and Wales Scotland's record on drug deaths is ""indefensible"" and the government must do more to save lives, the country's first minister has admitted. The number of deaths rose to a record 1,264 in 2019 - double the number in 2014 and the worst rate in Europe. The first minister said she was ""sorry for every family that has suffered grief"", saying they had been let down. And she said she would chair a meeting of the drugs taskforce in January over what ""immediate steps"" could be taken. Opposition parties said the government had cut rehabilitation services ""to the bone"" and repeated their calls for Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick to be sacked. Ms Sturgeon said she wanted to work with Mr FitzPatrick ""to make sure we collectively accept this responsibility and take the actions required to fix the problem"". Scotland's drug deaths rise to new record Scotland's drug death crisis in six charts 'No shortcuts' to reducing record drug death rate The number of drug-related deaths in Scotland has set a new record six years in a row, and now stands far in advance of the figures recorded in any European country per head of population - and is three and a half times worse than in England and Wales. Ms Sturgeon said the figures were ""completely unacceptable"" and ""indefensible"", and said her government had ""much to do to sort this out"". She apologised to families who had been ""let down"", adding: ""This is difficult and complex, but that is not an excuse - these figures tell us that we need to do more and do it quickly"". She said she would chair a meeting of the drug deaths taskforce in January, and would report back to MSPs later that month to set out what ""immediate steps"" could be taken. Nicola Sturgeon said she was not going to try to ""defend the indefensible"" The first minister was pressed by opposition leaders about the availability of rehab beds and the amount of money the government commits to drug and alcohol partnerships. Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said rehabilitation was ""not a panacea"", but that ""it can work and does save lives"". She said services had been ""cut to the bone"" by the Scottish government, saying more funding must be committed to avoid a repeat of the ""horrendous"" figures in future. There are currently 365 rehab beds available in facilities across Scotland, but Ms Sturgeon confirmed that about 100 were being taken up by patients from other countries. She said the government was ""not satisfied"" that the number of rehab beds available was ""necessarily sufficient or that they are being used sufficiently"". And she said funding for drug and alcohol partnerships had gone up in all but two of the 13 years the SNP has been in power. She said: ""This should not be comfortable. I am not going to stand here and defend the indefensible, these lives matter too much. ""We owe it to the lives which can still be saved that people like me do not engage in the usual political defensiveness, but redouble our efforts."" Ms Sturgeon has pledged to work with Mr FitzPatrick to solve the problem despite opposition calls for him to be replaced Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard reiterated calls for Ms Sturgeon to ""fire her minister for public health"" over the figures, saying Mr FitzPatrick's response had been ""woeful"". This was echoed by Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie, who said ""real leadership"" was needed that that Mr FitzPatrick was not capable of ""driving change"". Mr FitzPatrick told BBC Scotland on Tuesday that the high number of deaths ""stem from a long-standing and complex set of challenges"" and that there ""really is no shortcut to suddenly solve this"". He also said one of the biggest challenges was the large number of people in the 35-54 age group who have been taking opioid drugs for many years, but who were not engaging with services to help them. And Mr FitzPatrick, who has been in the role since 2018, pledged to ""keep doing the job I am doing"". The UK government, which has power over drug laws, has refused repeated requests from the Scottish government to allow so-called safe consumption rooms to be set up. It has described consumption rooms as a ""distraction"" from efforts to tackle the problem, and says it is not convinced that they work. Critics also argue that the Scottish government could do more with the powers over health and justice that it does have, and point out that England's drug death rate is far lower despite the country also not having consumption rooms.

"Boris Johnson on a call with Ursula von der Leyen Talks to reach a post-Brexit trade deal are in a ""serious situation"", Boris Johnson said after a call with the EU Commission head Ursula von der Leyen. He warned that ""time was short"" and that a no deal scenario was ""very likely"" unless the EU position changed ""substantially"". Mrs von der Leyen said it would be ""very challenging"" to bridge the ""big differences"", particularly on fish. However, she also welcomed ""substantial progress on many issues"". Talks in Brussels will continue on Friday, with two weeks to go before the UK leaves EU trading rules. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? In a statement issued after the phone call, No 10 said: ""He [Mr Johnson] said that we were making every effort to accommodate reasonable EU requests on the level playing field, but even though the gap had narrowed some fundamental areas remained difficult. ""On fisheries he stressed that the UK could not accept a situation where it was the only sovereign country in the world not to be able to control access to its own waters for an extended period and to be faced with fisheries quotas which hugely disadvantaged its own industry. ""The EU's position in this area was simply not reasonable and if there was to be an agreement it needed to shift significantly."" The UK's chief negotiator David Frost echoed the prime minister's tone,tweeting,external: ""The situation in our talks with the EU is very serious tonight. Progress seems blocked and time is running out."" European Parliament leaders have set Sunday as a deadline for them to see the text of any deal agreed by the negotiating teams. The senior MEPs said they would ""not be rushed"" into approving an agreement at their end, and would have to see the text by the end of the week if they were to sign it off by 31 December. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The call came after minister Michael Gove warned talks may go on until after Christmas. He said that while Christmas Day would be ""sacrosanct"", it was possible that Parliament could be recalled to approve a Brexit deal. Parliament closed for the Christmas break on Thursday evening. Mr Gove also said that although the European Parliament has said it would not have time to ratify a deal if it was not concluded by Sunday, they could ""apply provisional application of the treaty"". This video can not be played Michael Gove said Brexit talks 'may go on after Christmas' He told the Commons Brexit Committee the ""most likely outcome"" was that the current transition period would end on December 31 without a deal. Asked how likely a deal is, he replied ""I think, regrettably, the chances are more likely that we won't secure an agreement. So at the moment less than 50%."" It's long been predicted that competition rules and fishing would be the last areas where compromise is found. For Boris Johnson's government, being tied to EU regulations in perpetuity defeats the purpose of Brexit and makes a mockery of ""taking back control"". For the European Union, it will not allow its internal market to be undermined by offering the UK unfair access. Ursula von der Leyen has claimed the two sides have made a significant step by agreeing to a ""strong mechanism"" to ensure neither side lowers their environmental or social standards, but are yet to agree on how each could diverge from these levels in the future. A good number of EU diplomats were quietly confident it was a matter of when, not if, EU access to UK fishing waters could be sorted. But it's proving trickier than they thought. Sources tell me that Michel Barnier explained to EU ambassadors at the start of this week that if fishing is resolved, then a wider deal would quickly fall into place. But there's no sign of a meeting of minds on fish, with the EU warning openly it may prove to be impossible. But let's remember this is the most intense of negotiations and that every public proclamation from London or Brussels will be chosen to strengthening their respective hands in what are the final days and hours of talks. Although there is only 14 days until the deadline, Mr Gove said he believed there was enough time for the necessary legislation to pass before 31 December ""to give businesses legal certainty"". But a number of opposition MPs raised issues already facing businesses waiting to discover the outcome of talks. One Welsh MP, Jonathan Edwards, said: ""I was contacted late last night by a businessman in my constituency who is reliant on imports from the continent and he can't find a haulage firm willing to carriage on his behalf due to the current delays at the ports. ""He's very concerned unless this issue was resolved his business would not survive into the new year."" Mr Gove said he would get in touch with the business concerned.

"Non-essential shops will have to close again A new lockdown in Northern Ireland will begin on 26 December, the executive has agreed. Non-essential shops in NI will close from the end of trading on Christmas Eve in a bid to stop the spread of Covid-19. Ministers will review the measures after four weeks. Close-contact services, such as hair salons, will have to shut and pubs, cafes and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. The first week of the lockdown, running until 2 January, will see even tighter measures with essential shops having to close each day by 20:00 GMT. No sporting events will be permitted at all - even at elite level - with people being urged only to leave their home for essential reasons. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised the lockdown would be ""disappointing"" for many people, but that it was clear a ""longer and deeper intervention"" was necessary. ""The health service would be completely crushed in January if we didn't intervene now, so while this is draconian, it's about saving lives,"" she said. ""We've never been in such a bad position as we are now, and will be in January if this didn't happen now."" The new rules will include: Closure of all non-essential retail, including garden centres and homeware shops that previously were deemed essential Click-and-collect services will not be permitted Closure of close contact services such as hair and beauty salons Hospitality businesses will only be allowed to offer takeaway and delivery Closure of the leisure and entertainment sector Off-licences will have to close by 20:00 Car washes will be closed Hotels will be allowed to remain open until 28 December to ""accommodate the Christmas situation"" People from up to three households in Northern Ireland will still be able to meet over the festive period in so-called Christmas ""bubbles"" - but that will end on 27 December This video can not be played 'Urgent intervention was needed' Health Minister Robin Swann, who had proposed the package of measures, said it was the ""deepest and hardest"" decision ministers had faced since the beginning of the pandemic. ""There was no other way and the message come Boxing Day [26 December] will be 'work from home, and stay at home',"" he added. 'This sounds the death knell for many businesses' It is understood people will also not be allowed to meet others in private gardens, while restrictions on indoor visits to people's homes will remain in place. Health officials have also proposed limiting the reopening of schools in January. It is understood a package of interventions will be drawn up by the education and health departments and further discussions on this issue will take place. Mr Swann also revealed that by Thursday evening, almost 10,000 people in Northern Ireland had received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. This video can not be played 'We have probably taken our hardest decision' Dr Michael McBride, NI's chief medical officer said the situation ""does not get more serious than this"". ""These interventions and restrictions are absolutely necessary and I know they'll cause concern but if we are to get this virus under control, and take the pressure off our hospitals, then these are absolutely essential,"" he said. He urged people ""not to wait"" until after Christmas to start reducing their number of social contacts. People from up to three households in Northern Ireland will still be able to meet over the festive period in so-called Christmas ""bubbles"". It follows a previous agreement between the UK nations to stick to plans to allow three households to mix between 23 and 27 December. Anyone travelling to or from Northern Ireland is permitted an extra day either side on 22 and 28 December. The new lockdown is being imposed in response to rising numbers of cases of the virus in Northern Ireland. On Thursday, a further 12 Covid-linked deaths were recorded in NI and a further 656 cases of the virus. Hospitality Ulster said the decision to impose a lockdown was the news the industry had been ""dreading for some time"". Its chief executive Colin Neill said he understood why it was necessary, but would ""sound the death knell"" for many firms that would not survive the six-week period. ""The sector now needs urgent financial assistance at the right level to offset previous debts rung up in the race to be Covid secure and make sure that it is covered during this lockdown which will take weeks, if not months, to see out,"" he said. The executive has said previous financial support schemes will continue for businesses forced to close. Colin Neill said the decision was necessary but that the executive needed to immediately get financial support out to businesses The Northern Ireland Retail Consortium said it wanted the executive to ""urgently provide clarity"" about criteria for retail to reopen after the lockdown. ""We also need shoppers to continue to act responsibly in the shopping days that are left until Christmas,"" its director AodhÃ¡n Connolly said. ""Wear a face covering in store and when queueing, keep your distance,  wash your hands, leave extra time for shopping, avoid peak times and most of all be kind to staff and other shoppers."" Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, described the news as ""profoundly disappointing"". ""Make no mistake - this third lockdown will result in a tsunami of independent retailers falling and thousands more jobs being lost with permanent damage done to our local high streets,"" he added.

"This video can not be played Abdulhadi Abubaka describes how he managed to the mass kidnapping in Nigeria's Katsina school. Hundreds of schoolboys kidnapped last week from a boarding school in north-western Nigeria have been released, local authorities have told the BBC. A spokesman for the governor of Katsina state said 344 had been freed and were all in a good condition. However, other reports suggest some remain in the hands of their captors. The attack was claimed by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which hours earlier released a video apparently showing some of the boys. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Was Boko Haram really behind Nigeria school kidnap? 'How I escaped my kidnappers' Who are Boko Haram? In his statement, the spokesman, Abdul Labaran, said the boys were being taken to the regional capital Katsina City, and would soon be reunited with their families. He said the clip released by Boko Haram was authentic, but a message seemingly from the group's leader Abubakar Shekau was, instead, by an impersonator. The authorities have previously given a lower figure than locals for the number abducted and it is unclear if all are now safe. The state Governor Aminu Bello Masari was quoted by Reuters news agency as saying, ""we have recovered most of the boys. It's not all of them,"" while a security source told the AFP news agency some remained with their captors. Mr Labaran said none of the kidnapped boys had been killed, contradicting a boy shown in the video who said some had been killed by Nigerian fighter jets. It is unclear how the boys' release came about but the news was confirmed to BBC Hausa by another state government official. They were found in a forest near the town of Tsafe, in neighbouring Zamfara state. Witnesses said armed men came to the school in Kankara town on Friday evening last week, and many students jumped the school fence and fled when they heard gunshots. Others were tracked by the gunmen, who tricked them into believing that they were security personnel, students who escaped said. Once the students were rounded up, they were marched into the nearby forest by the armed men. Students left their footwear behind in the scramble that followed the attack On Thursday, video was released bearing Boko Haram's emblem, showing dozens of boys, some of whom appear to be very young. One of the boys said they were kidnapped by Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau's group and that all the government troops who had been sent to help them should be turned back. Boko Haram has become notorious over the last decade for school kidnappings, including one in Chibok in 2014, when nearly 300 schoolgirls were seized. The group's name loosely translates as ""Western education is forbidden"". However, these abductions have until now taken place in north-eastern Nigeria, where Boko Haram is based. Despite Boko Haram's claim, the Nigerian government said the Katsina abduction was carried out by local gangs connected to the Islamist group. Armed attacks and kidnappings are rife in north-western Nigeria and are often blamed on bandits, a loose term for gangs operating in the area. Amnesty International says more than 1,100 people were killed by bandits in the first six months of this year, with the government failing to bring the attackers to justice.

"Actor Jeremy Bulloch, who played Boba Fett in the original Star Wars trilogy, has died aged 75. He died in hospital on Thursday from health complications after living with Parkinson's disease for many years, his agent said. ""He had a long and happy career spanning more than 45 years,"" a statement said. ""He was devoted to his wife, three sons, and 10 grandchildren and they will miss him terribly."" Bulloch was best known for playing bounty hunter Boba Fett in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The character has since featured in the second season of Star Wars spin-off series, The Mandalorian. Bulloch appeared alongside Jon Pertwee in a 1973 Doctor Who episode Born in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, Bulloch's first major role was in the musical film Summer Holiday in 1963, aged 17. He starred alongside Sir Cliff Richard, who played Don, as Edwin, one of Don's friends. Bulloch also appeared in James Bond film Octopussy in 1983, and the BBC TV series Doctor Who in the 1970s. Star Wars creator George Lucas said Bulloch ""brought the perfect combination of mystery and menace to his performance of Boba Fett"". He added: ""Jeremy was a true gentleman who was very supportive of Star Wars and its fans, and I'm very grateful for his contributions to the saga and its legacy."" Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker in the original Star Wars trilogy, described Bulloch as the ""quintessential English gentleman"". ""A fine actor, delightful company and so kind to everyone lucky enough to meet or work with him,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""I will deeply miss him and am so grateful to have known him.""

"The berg is a little over 130km in length. The small broken chunk is just visible through the cloud The icy colossus that is A68a has knocked off a corner, seemingly as a result of striking the seafloor. The 3,800-sq-km iceberg, which has been bearing down on the island ofSouth Georgia,external, looked in recent days to be turning with the prevailing current. But as it spun around, it appears part of the frozen block may have scraped the bed, inflicting damage on itself. Satellite images on Thursday revealed a roughly 150-sq-km chunk to be floating free of the main berg. The new piece of debris is so large that it's likely from now on to be called A68d, under the iceberg nomenclature operated by the US National Ice Center. Two other large lumps that broke away previously from the primary block were designated A68b and A68c. Mission to investigate gigantic iceberg A68a RAF cameras capture world's biggest iceberg World's biggest iceberg is fraying at its edges Originating in Antarctica in 2017, A68a is the world's largest iceberg ""in the open ocean"". There is another great tabular berg called A23a which is slightly bigger but this has hardly moved from its calving position at the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea. A68a, on the other hand, has travelled more than 1,500km in the past 3.5 years to get up into the South Atlantic. It's running in a fast stream of water known as the Southern Antarctic Circumpolar Current Front, which is one of the White Continent's main export routes for ice. The SACCF is like a conveyor belt that routinely delivers icebergs to the vicinity of South Georgia. Indeed, it's often said the British Overseas Territory is ""where icebergs go to die"" because so many get caught on the island's shallow continental shelf and end their days melting to nothing. Scientists are watching A68a with greater than normal interest. Its great bulk means that if it anchors at South Georgia, it could pose feeding problems for the island's famous penguins and seals. The shallow continental shelf extends 50-80km from the coastline Such a major obstacle sitting right offshore might restrict the animals' ability to forage for the fish and small crustaceans called krill on which they depend. Satellites are following the trajectory of the berg day by day. As predicted, it has turned with the SACCF at that point where the current gets deflected by continental shelf. If A68a continues to drift in SACCF, it should loop south around the island before turning north. This video can not be played Watch: The RAF flies over iceberg A68a The iceberg came from a part of the Antarctic where it is still very cold - the Larsen C Ice Shelf. This is a mass of floating ice formed by glaciers that have flowed down off the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula into the ocean. On entering the water, the glaciers' buoyant fronts lift up and join together to make a single protrusion. The calving of bergs at the forward edge of this shelf is a very natural behaviour. The shelf likes to maintain an equilibrium and the ejection of bergs is one way it balances the accumulation of mass from snowfall and the input of more ice from the feeding glaciers on land. Larsen C calves big icebergs like A68 on decadal timescales. The main iceberg is constantly now shedding debris The satellite images on this page were prepared byPierre Markuse,externalandStef Lhermitte,external.

"At the beginning of the university year, police were called out to a student halls of residence in Edinburgh Police Scotland's latest data on Covid breaches reveals that officers are repeatedly visiting the same properties to break up parties. The call logs, which have been obtained by BBC Scotland, also show that a number of people have been handed multiple fines. On 28 August thepolice were given the power to break up,externalhouse parties contravening social gathering rules. Since that date, officers have been called out nearly 5,000 times. Police break up hundreds of parties every week First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made it clear that giving Police Scotland enhanced powers was necessary to ensure socialising continued in a safe and responsible manner. The data, received through a Freedom of Information request, listed incidents which included: a party of 10 people found at aGlasgowaddress, where the householder had previously been issued with two fixed penalty notices (FPNs) in thenorth eastsix people were warned after being found at two different parties in the same evening officers attended aGlasgowaddress following a report of a noisy party. Fines were issued to five people - four of whom had previously received Covid-related fines inAyrshirepeople attempted to jump out of the windows of a property when police arrived. This was the second time officers had attended the address having previously issued a fine to the householder and police went to aRenfrewshireaddress where they gave fines to two party-goers who had previously been issued with a warning At the mid-November point, 68% of house parties had taken place in council areas under tier three restrictions, and 28% in tier two areas. Police Scotland declined to comment on whether such incidents suggested fixed penalty notices had failed to be a sufficient deterrent. Deputy Chief Constable Malcolm Graham said: ""Where officers encounter wilful and persistent breaches they will act decisively to enforce the law - this includes consideration of serious charges including culpable and reckless conduct. ""The chief constable has repeatedly underlined that house parties and relatively small gatherings can have a significant influence on spreading the virus and are not permitted."" Police data showed that officers had been alerted to 4,879 gatherings between 28 August and 22 November. In the first part of November police attended about 300 incidents each week with 227 of them deemed to have breached restrictions. However, the force has suggested the number is likely to be greater as it only counted formal call-outs and not incidents on patrol. So far, more than 2,000 fines have been issued and 279 arrests have been made. The information also revealed that the proportion of parties breaching restrictions is increasing in areas like Edinburgh, Glasgow and Tayside. Police Scotland said ""it will continue to explain the rules to the public and encourage people to take personal responsibility and do the right thing"". In the week covering Halloween and Bonfire Night, 84% of the 365 parties that took place were in breach of coronavirus restrictions. The incidents included: officers attending aGlasgowparty where they found three people who had been tested for Covid-19 earlier that day - but had not yet received their results inTaysidea fight broke out when police attended a house party with 60 ""intoxicated"" people police were tipped off about a party inGlasgowwith 200 people present and loud music playing. Officers said none of them were wearing face masks or socially distancing. More than 60 fines were issued and more than 20 people attended aDundeeparty, with many of them escaping through the back garden when police arrived A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Ministers have been consistently clear that we want to see these laws work through high levels of public compliance, rather than relying on enforcement."" There has also been concerns that large-scale parties are being promoted on social media platforms. Police document highlights included: Forth Valley police being alerted to an on-going party outsideBonnybridgewhich had been advertised on social media. On arriving, officers found a 48-seater bus, numerous cars outside and more than 100 party-goers and the police were called to anEdinburghparty where the location was disclosed 24 hours before the event. ""Kate"" has been issued four fines totalling Â£1,240 for attending illegal house parties across Glasgow. But she insists she won't be paying ""just for meeting my friends through a lockdown with rules that don't make sense anyway"". Her most recent fine was for Â£940. ""That's the one I'm most annoyed about as the police officers were awful to everyone in the party,"" she says. ""They were trying to make us feel scared."" Despite Police Scotland's insistence on warning first and fining later, Kate says when officers arrived ""they just started giving out the fines even though we would have been happy to leave."" She says she has been fined for going to small gatherings, as well as house parties with up to 60 people. ""But that's the fault of the people renting out the flats and houses for allowing us to go in the first place,"" she says. She's also not worried about transmitting or contracting coronavirus at the events. ""I've been to multiple parties and not one person I know has had it from the parties"".

"Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf says 2020 was a terrible year Sweden's king has said his country ""failed"" to save lives with its relatively relaxed approach to the coronavirus pandemic. King Carl XVI Gustaf made the remarks as part of an annual TV review of the year,externalwith the royal family. Sweden, which has never imposed a full lockdown, has seen nearly 350,000 cases and more than 7,800 deaths - a lot more than its Scandinavian neighbours. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said he agreed with the king's remarks. ""Of course the fact that so many have died can't be considered as anything other than a failure,"" Mr Lofven told reporters. Referring to the government's strategy, Mr Lofven added that ""it's when we are through the pandemic that the real conclusions can be drawn"". Did Sweden's coronavirus strategy succeed or fail? What is Europe doing about Covid and Christmas? Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? In the programme, the king says: ""I think we have failed. We have a large number who have died and that is terrible. ""The people of Sweden have suffered tremendously in difficult conditions. One thinks of all the family members who have happened to be unable to say goodbye to their deceased family members. I think it is a tough and traumatic experience not to be able to say a warm goodbye."" When asked if he was afraid of being infected with Covid-19, the king - who is 74 - said: ""Lately, it has felt more obvious, it has crept closer and closer. That's not what you want."" Instead of relying on legal sanctions, Sweden appeals to citizens' sense of responsibility and civic duty, and issues only recommendations. There are no sanctions if they are ignored. Sweden has never imposed a nationwide lockdown or the wearing of masks, and bars and restaurants have remained open. However, earlier this week, schools across the Stockholm region were asked to switch to distance learning for 13 to 15-year-olds for the first time as soon as possible. The measure was announced in response to rising Covid-19 cases. This came a week after a nationwide decision on 7 December to switch to remote learning for those over 16. And on Monday, new nationwide social-distancing recommendations for the Christmas period came into force, replacing similar region-specific guidelines. Swedes are advised to meet a maximum of eight people, gather outdoors if possible and avoid travelling by train or bus. A formal ban on public gatherings of more than eight people remains, affecting events such as concerts, sports matches and demonstrations. Sweden's state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, in November explained the strategy relied on a combination of legal and voluntary measures. He told the BBC that this was, in the Swedish context, ""the combination that we really believe is the best one"". This video can not be played Tegnell: ""Not yet possible to say which country has right strategy"" (November 2020 interview) According to an official report released earlier this week, the strategy failed in its effort to protect the elderly in care homes - for which the government has admitted responsibility. Over 90% of Covid-related deaths have been among those aged 70 and over, and nearly half of all Covid deaths have been in  care homes, the government says. Mr Tegnell said his agency (Sweden's Public Health Agency) was not responsible for directing the elderly care system, and added all stakeholders needed to help to improve the situation to make sure the elderly did not get infected. He said he thought Sweden had become better at protecting older people, and that no country had succeeded entirely in that area  - even Germany was being hit hard right now,he told Swedish radio on Wednesday,external. Sweden has had more deaths than the rest of the Nordic countries combined. This has led to criticism from the country's neighbours, Norway, Denmark and Finland, that its less strict approach is putting their own measures at risk. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Lofven also said he felt many experts had underestimated the second wave. ""I think most in the profession did not see such a wave incoming. There was instead talk of different clusters,"" he said in an interview with daily Aftonbladet. Sweden brings in rule of eight for diners Covid-19: Is Sweden getting it right?

"The casino once formed a key part of Atlantic City's skyline A casino formerly owned by Donald Trump is set to be demolished, and you can push the button for the right price. The Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City went bankrupt and shut in 2014. Now, the city is auctioning off the chance to dynamite it for charity. The property was one of three Trump-branded casinos that once formed the centrepiece of the world-famous resort city nicknamed ""America's playground"". But as revenues plummeted, Mr Trump cut his losses and his ties with the city. City officials have called several times for the idle building to be torn down after chunks of the crumbling landmark repeatedly broke off and fell onto surrounding streets. A bidding process that began on Thursday will determine who gets the right to count down and hit the button that will raze the 39-floor casino. Proceeds from the auction will fund the local chapter of the Boys & Girls Club of America, a youth development organisation. ""I want to raise at least a million dollars and I think we can accomplish that,"" said Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small Sr, in a press conference. The mayor said his office has already been ""bombarded"" with phone calls about the auction, from Arkansas to Canada. The building was shut in 2014 and is now considered a safety hazard A noted hotspot of the ""Roaring Twenties'', Atlantic City resurfaced in the 1980s as the de facto casino capital of the US east coast. Touting it as a counterweight to Las Vegas, Donald Trump opened Trump Plaza at the centre of its famed boardwalk in 1984, then two more casinos, including the Trump Taj Mahal (which marketed itself as ""the eighth wonder of the world""). However, as gambling laws eased in neighbouring states, out-of-state gamblers stayed away and casino revenues dried up. Meanwhile, Mr Trump took on mountains of debt and endured negative press.

"A host of European leaders are self-isolating after the French President, Emmanuel Macron, tested positive for Covid-19. Mr Macron, 42, will self-isolate for seven days while working remotely, the ElysÃ©e Palace said in a statement. The French president attended a number of high-profile events in recent days, including an EU summit. Following his diagnosis several other European leaders, including the Spanish PM, said they would self-isolate. ""The President of the Republic has been diagnosed positive for Covid-19 today,"" the ElysÃ©e said on Thursday morning. The diagnosis was made following a ""test performed at the onset of the first symptoms"", the statement added. The French president's wife Brigitte Macron, who is 67, is self-isolating but has no symptoms. It is not yet known how Mr Macron caught the virus but his office said it was identifying any recent close contacts he has had. How are France and other European countries tackling the pandemic? French culture takes centre stage in Covid protest The meteoric rise of France's youngest president On Tuesday President Macron hosted French parliamentary heads and on Monday members of the intergovernmental group the OECD. Last week he, along with almost every other EU leader, attended a summit in Brussels. Among those going into self-isolation areEuropean Council chief Charles Michel, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchezandOECD Secretary-General Angel GurrÃ­a, all of whom met President Macron this week. Mr Sanchez has tested negative but, like Mr Macron, will work remotely from quarantine. Portuguese Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa, 59, has cancelled all official trips, and is isolating and awaiting test results, after a working lunch in Paris with President Macron on Wednesday. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De CrooandLuxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Betteltoo are self-isolating following contact with the French president. In a statement Mr Bettel wished Mr Macron a ""speedy recovery"". Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martinhas tested negative for Covid-19 but will limit his contacts, a spokesperson said. President Macron (L) met Spanish PM Pedro SÃ¡nchez on Monday FrenchPrime Minister Jean Castex, 55, andparliamentary speaker Richard Ferrand, 58, are also self-isolating, their offices confirmed. Mr Castex, who is not showing any symptoms and has tested negative, was due to introduce the government's Covid vaccination policy in the Senate on Thursday - now Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran is doing it instead. France this week ended a six-week national lockdown, replacing the measure with a curfew to help deal with soaring cases. Mr Macron last week attended a two-day European Council heads of state summit, finishing on Friday. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? However, the French president is considered to have become potentially contagious as of Monday evening, a senior EU official told the BBC. All sanitary measures were observed during last week's meeting and the council has not been informed of any other participants testing positive, the source added. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wore a mask at the summit and tested negative for the virus on Tuesday, German officials said after hearing the news about President Macron. A French presidential spokeswoman confirmed that all of Mr Macron's forthcoming trips, including a scheduled visit to Lebanon on 22 December, had been cancelled. The ElysÃ©e is doing everything to project an image of business as usual.  Already President Macron is back at work, and a meeting with his finance and foreign ministers has gone ahead as planned - though with the visitors in an adjacent room. It's being emphasised that the workings of government have already been radically adapted for Covid - with video conferences now the norm - so unless the president takes a turn for the worse no-one will notice much of a difference. And meanwhile - as with any ordinary citizen - the trace-and-test system has kicked in, and numerous dignitaries foreign and domestic have been told the bad news that they have to self-isolate. The message is clear: Emmanuel Macron may be the president of France - but for the purposes of the virus he is a human like any other.  So he will behave according to the rules. From left to right: Boris Johnson, Jair Bolsonaro, Ambrose Dlamini and Donald Trump President Macron is just the latest world leader to test positive for coronavirus: Prime Minister Ambrose Dlamini ofEswatini(formerly Swaziland) died on Monday, four weeks after he tested positive USPresident Donald Trump contracted the virus in October.

"A delay in reporting an extra 11,000 positive Covid tests in Wales has led to a big jump in case rates. Public Health Wales (PHW) said planned IT maintenance meant there was a ""significant under-reporting"" but anyone who tested positive had been contacted in the usual way. The delayed results came from Lighthouse Laboratories, which process about 70% of Wales' tests. The Welsh Conservatives said the news was ""staggering"". The 11,000 extra positive tests were taken between 9 and 15 December. PHW said the ""vast majority"" have been added to itsdashboard,,externalwhich records the figures, on Thursday. 52 more Covid deaths reported in Wales Covid: You asked and we answered How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales The figures show an additional 4,221 cases have been added to the total for the week ending 11 December, an adjustment to what was reported on Wednesday. A total of 11,250 - including the usual daily cases - have been added, meaning the latest weekly case rates have increased as a result. Wales, already at its highest case rate so far, saw a jump to 530.2 cases per 100,000 for the most recent seven days, to 12 December. The case rate stood at 377.8 on Wednesday, although PHW warned this was an underestimation of what we should expect. The new figures showed the case rate for Merthyr Tydfil - already the highest in the UK - is now 1,032.7 cases per 100,000 - with 623 positive tests in the past seven days. Eight council areas in Wales are in the 10 hardest-hit areas in the UK for case rates in latest comparison. There are 14 out of 22 council areas which have their highest case rates so far - including Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. Three others would have reported their highest figures on Wednesday, had all the figures been available. PHW said its previous data collection system was ""on its last legs"". ""The system would collapse very frequently and it was proving to be unsustainable to run with its existing system,"" said PHW incident director Dr Giri Shankar. ""This was not an unplanned activity. We knew it was going to have an impact, therefore weconstantly communicated before it actually happened,externaland while it was happening and even after it had happened, to say that this is affecting the results."" The planned maintenance of the NHS Welsh Laboratory Information Management System (WLMS) ""has not affected individuals receiving their results"", PHW insisted. First Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: ""The story is not about missing data or computer problems, it's about the seriousness of the situation. ""You were told in advance that this was going to happen. The data was never missing it was always there, waiting to be uploaded into the system."" Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""With positive cases in Wales rising to record levels it is crucial that the reporting of data is both timely and robust. ""The public need a complete and current picture of the situation to realise the gravity of what we are facing. ""We need urgent reassurance that the failings have been addressed.""

"Boris Johnson on a call with Ursula von der Leyen Talks to reach a post-Brexit trade deal are in a ""serious situation"", Boris Johnson said after a call with the EU Commission head Ursula von der Leyen. He warned that ""time was short"" and that a no deal scenario was ""very likely"" unless the EU position changed ""substantially"". Mrs von der Leyen said it would be ""very challenging"" to bridge the ""big differences"", particularly on fish. However, she also welcomed ""substantial progress on many issues"". Talks in Brussels will continue on Friday, with two weeks to go before the UK leaves EU trading rules. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? In a statement issued after the phone call, No 10 said: ""He [Mr Johnson] said that we were making every effort to accommodate reasonable EU requests on the level playing field, but even though the gap had narrowed some fundamental areas remained difficult. ""On fisheries he stressed that the UK could not accept a situation where it was the only sovereign country in the world not to be able to control access to its own waters for an extended period and to be faced with fisheries quotas which hugely disadvantaged its own industry. ""The EU's position in this area was simply not reasonable and if there was to be an agreement it needed to shift significantly."" The UK's chief negotiator David Frost echoed the prime minister's tone,tweeting,external: ""The situation in our talks with the EU is very serious tonight. Progress seems blocked and time is running out."" European Parliament leaders have set Sunday as a deadline for them to see the text of any deal agreed by the negotiating teams. The senior MEPs said they would ""not be rushed"" into approving an agreement at their end, and would have to see the text by the end of the week if they were to sign it off by 31 December. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The call came after minister Michael Gove warned talks may go on until after Christmas. He said that while Christmas Day would be ""sacrosanct"", it was possible that Parliament could be recalled to approve a Brexit deal. Parliament closed for the Christmas break on Thursday evening. Mr Gove also said that although the European Parliament has said it would not have time to ratify a deal if it was not concluded by Sunday, they could ""apply provisional application of the treaty"". This video can not be played Michael Gove said Brexit talks 'may go on after Christmas' He told the Commons Brexit Committee the ""most likely outcome"" was that the current transition period would end on December 31 without a deal. Asked how likely a deal is, he replied ""I think, regrettably, the chances are more likely that we won't secure an agreement. So at the moment less than 50%."" It's long been predicted that competition rules and fishing would be the last areas where compromise is found. For Boris Johnson's government, being tied to EU regulations in perpetuity defeats the purpose of Brexit and makes a mockery of ""taking back control"". For the European Union, it will not allow its internal market to be undermined by offering the UK unfair access. Ursula von der Leyen has claimed the two sides have made a significant step by agreeing to a ""strong mechanism"" to ensure neither side lowers their environmental or social standards, but are yet to agree on how each could diverge from these levels in the future. A good number of EU diplomats were quietly confident it was a matter of when, not if, EU access to UK fishing waters could be sorted. But it's proving trickier than they thought. Sources tell me that Michel Barnier explained to EU ambassadors at the start of this week that if fishing is resolved, then a wider deal would quickly fall into place. But there's no sign of a meeting of minds on fish, with the EU warning openly it may prove to be impossible. But let's remember this is the most intense of negotiations and that every public proclamation from London or Brussels will be chosen to strengthening their respective hands in what are the final days and hours of talks. Although there is only 14 days until the deadline, Mr Gove said he believed there was enough time for the necessary legislation to pass before 31 December ""to give businesses legal certainty"". But a number of opposition MPs raised issues already facing businesses waiting to discover the outcome of talks. One Welsh MP, Jonathan Edwards, said: ""I was contacted late last night by a businessman in my constituency who is reliant on imports from the continent and he can't find a haulage firm willing to carriage on his behalf due to the current delays at the ports. ""He's very concerned unless this issue was resolved his business would not survive into the new year."" Mr Gove said he would get in touch with the business concerned.

"This video can not be played A Conservative MP who attended a business dinner was in âbreach of the regulationsâ the home secretary says Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood broke Covid rules by giving a speech at a dinner in London, the home secretary has said. Mr Ellwood had defended his ""well-intentioned attendance"" at the event, saying it was ""fully Covid compliant"". He said he was sorry coverage of it had ""muddled the government's clear message as we head towards Christmas"". But home secretary Priti Patel said he had broken the rules and suggested he could face a fine. Asked about Mr Ellwood's actions, the prime minister's official spokesman said: ""I would point you to the home secretary's words. ""The PM has been clear throughout the pandemic that it's vital for everybody to abide by the rules in order to suppress the virus and therefore protect the NHS and save lives."" Toughest Covid rules extended in south of England Which places are moving into tier three? The Iraq Britain Business Council reception, on Tuesday, took place a day before London entered tier three. It was initially described as a ""Christmas dinner"" on the council's website but its president, Tory peer Baroness Nicholson, later said it was a business event. Asked by ITV News if Mr Ellwood's attendance was a breach of the rules, Ms Patel said: ""Well, it is. Of course it is exactly that. ""Having dinner outside of the rules with a large number of people is a breach of the regulations."" Asked if there should be a punishment, Ms Patel said: ""There are fixed penalty notices. I don't know the details as to where this happened or the location, but I'm sure, as it is a breach, that will be followed up."" Tobias Ellwood addressing guests at Tuesday's event The government's tier two guidance states that ""gatherings for work purposes are only allowed where they are reasonably necessary"". Mr Ellwood, who chairs the Commons defence committee, attended the event the day after telling MPs that allowing families to meet over Christmas for five days ""could be very dangerous indeed"". He urged Health Secretary Matt Hancock to review the policy ""so we don't begin the new year with a third wave"". In an interview with BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Mr Ellwood said he did not know the event had been advertised as a Christmas party when he accepted the invitation. This was ""absolutely a business dinner"" following the Covid guidelines, he said. He explained everyone had been more than two metres apart during the event, at which he had learned a lot about the current situation in Iraq and the Middle East. ""I did this because I make an effort to understand what's going on around the world. If I had the choice between going home to play Lego or this, I know where I'd prefer to be,"" he said. But he said he accepted his decision to attend would be criticised. ""Perceptions count and I'm really, really sorry that this coverage of a well-intentioned attendance may have muddied the government's clear message as we head towards Christmas,"" he added. Asked if he was considering his position as chair of the defence committee, he denied breaching the rules. ""But it's the interpretation which I fully appreciate is very different indeed and perception counts - particularly people with a profile. I've been critical and have been vocal about this,"" he said. On the matter of a fine, he said Ms Patel needed to speak to the venue first, then ""let's have a conversation"". The Daily Mail,which first reported Mr Ellwood's attendance,externalat the event, said there had been 27 guests. London moved from tier two to tier three on Wednesday morning. Mr Ellwood, MP for Bournemouth East, told the BBC he had not been present for the whole event and that he had contacted the venue in advance to confirm it was Covid secure. Other guests at the reception included a delegation from the Iraqi Embassy. One of the original photographs appeared to show some attendees standing in small groups taking part in a drinks reception. The rules for tier two state that alcohol at venues should be served as part of a substantial meal or with table service. Baroness Nicholson told the BBC that once she became aware that the event have been described as a ""party"" she immediately asked for it to be clarified. She stressed it was an important business function. Asked why it had initially been labelled as a ""Christmas dinner"" and ""party"" on the organisation's website, she said: ""I think someone was trying to be cheerful"". In a statement on its website, the IBBC said ""working with the venue this event was fully Covid compliant"".

"Boris Johnson's outgoing aide Dominic Cummings has attacked a system which he says ""incentivises politicians to focus more on Twitter and gossip-column stories about their dogs"" while ignoring ""existential threats"". In the Spectator,he also warned,externalthat parts of the UK's ""nuclear enterprise have rotted from years of neglect"". And he called for more focus on ""low-probability, high-impact events"". Mr Cummings is leaving No 10 following a fractious internal power struggle. His departure was announced last month and he has been working out his notice from home. On Thursday, government figures revealed that his salary rose during 2020 from between Â£95,000-Â£99,999 to Â£140,000-Â£144,999, making him among the highest-earning special advisers in government. Dominic Cummings got Â£45,000 pay rise from PM The man who may have saved the world A pandemic is here. What else should we be worried about? By the conventional literary standards of Dominic Cummings, this is an unquestionably pithy contribution. His blog posts traditionally demand a long train journey and a lot of scrolling to reach their destination. But rather like his personally published reflections, this nugget in The Spectator combines a sweep of history with a few sharp political jabs. No names mentioned, of course, but which prominent resident of Downing Street combines a love of dogs and social media? Ah yes, the Prime Minister's fiancee Carrie Symonds, frequently pictured in the company of Dilyn, her Jack Russell cross. And who was seen as particularly influential in Mr Cummings' departure from No 10? You guessed it.... Dilyn the dog has his own instagram page In a feature for the Spectator Magazine, contributors were asked to nominate their ""highlights of history"". Mr Cummings chose a moment in 1983 when a Soviet Union officer, Stanislav Petrov, potentially averted nuclear war by ignoring his country's nuclear weapons alert system. The satellite system suggested that the US had launched a nuclear-armed missile strike, but Mr Petrov decided it was a false alarm and chose not to inform his superiors, thereby preventing a retaliatory attack. Praising his reaction, Mr Cummings wrote: ""It was only because of his intensive training and quick wits that many millions of lives weren't lost."" He added that there have been many such near-misses since the 1960s and that ""protocols combined with flawed early warning systems remain a huge danger today"". ""In Britain parts of the nuclear enterprise have rotted from years of neglect, though thankfully the new cabinet secretary knows and cares and is acting to remedy this. ""As Covid has shown, far greater intellectual and material resources ought to be deployed on such apparently low-probability, high-impact events."" Earlier this year Lord Sedwill stepped down as cabinet secretary - the top job in the civil service - to be replaced by Simon Case.

"Actor Jeremy Bulloch, who played Boba Fett in the original Star Wars trilogy, has died aged 75. He died in hospital on Thursday from health complications after living with Parkinson's disease for many years, his agent said. ""He had a long and happy career spanning more than 45 years,"" a statement said. ""He was devoted to his wife, three sons, and 10 grandchildren and they will miss him terribly."" Bulloch was best known for playing bounty hunter Boba Fett in The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. The character has since featured in the second season of Star Wars spin-off series, The Mandalorian. Bulloch appeared alongside Jon Pertwee in a 1973 Doctor Who episode Born in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, Bulloch's first major role was in the musical film Summer Holiday in 1963, aged 17. He starred alongside Sir Cliff Richard, who played Don, as Edwin, one of Don's friends. Bulloch also appeared in James Bond film Octopussy in 1983, and the BBC TV series Doctor Who in the 1970s. Star Wars creator George Lucas said Bulloch ""brought the perfect combination of mystery and menace to his performance of Boba Fett"". He added: ""Jeremy was a true gentleman who was very supportive of Star Wars and its fans, and I'm very grateful for his contributions to the saga and its legacy."" Mark Hamill, who played Luke Skywalker in the original Star Wars trilogy, described Bulloch as the ""quintessential English gentleman"".

"Commons leader Jacob Rees Mogg has accused Unicef of ""playing politics"" after the charity launched a campaign to help feed children in the UK. The Tory MP said the charity was meant to look after people in the poorest countries and should be ""ashamed"". It comes after Unicef said it would pledge Â£25,000 to a south London charity to help supply breakfast boxes over the Christmas holidays. Unicef said every child deserves to ""thrive"" no matter where they are born. Unicef to feed children in UK for first time Poverty and virus 'push families closer to brink' Fighting food poverty in a virus lockdown The grant to the charity School Food Matters in Southwark aims to help vulnerable children and families during the coronavirus crisis. Unicef said the initiative was its first emergency response in the UK in its 70-year history. This video can not be played ""It is a real scandal that Unicef should be playing politics in this way."" Mr Rees-Mogg was responding to a question from Labour MP Zarah Sultana in the House of Commons. ""For the first time ever, Unicef, the UN agency responsible for providing humanitarian aid to children, is having to feed working-class kids in the UK,"" she said. ""But while children go hungry, a wealthy few enjoy obscene riches."" She asked if Mr Rees-Mogg would ""give government time to discuss the need to make him and his super-rich chums pay their fair share so that we can end the grotesque inequality that scars our society"". Responding, Mr Rees-Mogg said Unicef ""should be ashamed of itself"". ""I think it is a real scandal that Unicef should be playing politics in this way when it is meant to be looking after people in the poorest, the most deprived, countries of the world where people are starving, where there are famines and where there are civil wars, and they make cheap political points of this kind, giving, l think, Â£25,000 to one council,"" he said. ""It is a political stunt of the lowest order."" He said the number of children in absolute poverty across the country had gone down by 100,000 over the past decade, which he described as ""a record of success"". In response, Anna Kettley, Unicef UK's director of programmes and advocacy, said: ""Unicef UK is responding to this unprecedented crisis and building on our 25 years' experience of working on children's rights in the UK with a one-off domestic response, launched in August, to provide support to vulnerable children and families around the country during this crisis period."" She said more than Â£700,000 was being granted to community groups around the country to help tackle food insecurity during the pandemic. ""Unicef will continue to spend our international funding helping the world's poorest children.

"This video can not be played Abdulhadi avoided the mass kidnapping in Nigeria's Katsina school but his twin brother Mustapha was lost in the chaos A video said to be from the jihadist group Boko Haram shows some of more than 300 Nigerian schoolboys kidnapped last week. In the video, filmed in a forest, gunmen with their faces covered stand guard over boys, some of whom look no older than 10. One child is made to issue demands on behalf of the group. The boys were snatched from a boarding school in the north-western state of Katsina. Africa Live: Other stories from the continent 'How I escaped my Katsina kidnappers' Who are Boko Haram? The attack was the first of its kind in north-western Nigeria. Despite the Boko Haram claim that it was behind the abductions, the Nigerian authorities say they were carried out by local gangs connected to the Islamist group. Boko Haram has been notorious over the last decade for school kidnappings,including in Chibok in 2014, when nearly 300 schoolgirls were seized.Its name loosely translated as ""Western education is forbidden"". However, these abductions have until now taken place in the north-east, where Boko Haram is based. The six-minute footage - which has not been independently verified - features a boy in the foreground whose clothes and face are dishevelled. Dozens of children, some of them appearing to be very young, stand in the background, pleading. Boko Haram said it had targeted the school in opposition to Western education In a mix of English and Hausa, the main speaker says they were kidnapped by Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau's gang. He says some of the boys have been killed by Nigerian fighter jets and calls for the closure of schools other than Koranic schools. He adds that all the government troops who have been sent to help them should be sent back. At one point his voice appears to break and the other children begin to cry. It's a distressing watch, BBC Nigeria correspondent Mayeni Jones says. Analysis by Nduka Orjinmo, BBC News, Lagos This marks a devastating turn in the war against Islamist insurgency in Nigeria; it all but confirms that militant groups such as Boko Haram have spread into the north-west. Worsening crimes such as kidnapping and attacks on farming communities had been linked to ""bandits"" - a loose term for several groups in the vast region which now has to include Islamic insurgents. There have been warnings in the past that the government's failure to deal with such groups posed a threat and a potential breeding ground for sympathisers of Islamist militancy. Boko Haram is led by Abubakar Shekau If the boys are now truly with Boko Haram, then what seemed unimaginable is now ringing true: Islamist militants in Nigeria's north-east spreading west to link up with clusters of other criminal gangs. The security implications should be worrying, not just for Nigeria but for other countries in the Sahel region, where large swathes of lands are now in the hands of such Islamist insurgents. This was a video many Nigerians were hoping they would never see again: schoolchildren in the hands of Boko Haram, and - expectedly - many are angry with the worsening security situation under the current government. People are now waiting to see how President Muhammadu Buhari handles the situation - Boko Haram are likely to use the boys as negotiating pawns. That this happened under an administration that came into power promising better security is a further dent in his reputation as a former military general. The gunmen who kidnapped the schoolboys might have got help from Boko Haram, state Governor Aminu Bello Masari toldthe BBC's Newsday programme. His statement comes after the Islamist militant group said it was responsible for the abduction. But the governor repeated the authorities' view that the attack itself had been carried out by what he termed local bandits. ""One cannot precisely say there is no Boko Haram at all but those who [carried out the attack] are not Boko Haram, are not known to be members of Boko Haram. ""Maybe [they helped] through training or some other means of assistance to the local bandits but all the names we have so far are names of the local bandits,"" Governor Masari said. He also told the BBC the security forces had made contact with the kidnappers and had some idea where they were. But he stressed the authorities would not negotiate with Boko Haram, nor would they agree to paying a ransom. The jihadist group has waged a brutal insurgency since 2009, mostly in north-eastern Nigeria. Tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been forced from their homes.

"The head of Hospitality Ulster has said he would prefer a full lockdown over partial restrictions Health officials have proposed a six-week lockdown across NI in a bid to curb the spread of the virus, BBC News NI understands. It is believed a review of the measures would take place after four weeks. Executive ministers are meeting to discuss the plan, brought by Health Minister Robin Swann. It proposes the closure of non-essential retail after Christmas Eve, and hospitality only allowed to offer takeaway services. Close contact services including hairdresser and beauty salons would also have to shut again. It is also understood health officials have proposed essential shops in NI would have to close by 20:00 GMT every night during the first week of a new lockdown. It is believed there could be changes to what is classed as essential retail, and the potential that click-and-collect services would not be permitted. The first week of a fresh lockdown could also see tighter rules on indoor and outdoor gatherings and a ban on people meeting others in private gardens. Health officials have also proposed measures to limit the reopening of schools in January and it's understood a package of interventions will be drawn up by the education and health departments. However any new lockdown restrictions will have to be signed off by the whole executive, which is meeting now to consider Mr Swann's paper. On Thursday, a further 12 Covid-linked deaths were recorded in NI and a further 656 cases of the virus. Hospitality Ulster said a full lockdown may now be required. Colin Neill says the board of Hospitality Ulster is aware of the situation at hospitals Chief executive Colin Neill said his board would support a full lockdown to get the virus under control. Mr Neill accepted a lockdown would have a big impact on the hospitality sector but added  ""what is worse is opening and closing all the time"". ""Every time you have to reopen costs a lot of money and every time you have to close costs a lot of money because of wastage,"" he told BBC's Stephen Nolan Show. ""If we are going for lockdown, then we will support a total lockdown until we get this thing under control,"" he said. ""I think we can all see the situation at our hospitals,"" he said. ""We need to go back to what we did in March and April."" Mr Neill said many within the hospitality sector only remained open so they could earn enough to pay their contribution towards furlough and retain their staff. The new proposals before the executive come amid warnings from health officials that the system is struggling with winter pressures exacerbated by the pandemic. Ministers will have to decide the date of when any new measures would take effect, how long they would last and how strict they would be. They will also assess the latest data from the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser regarding the R-number in NI, which measures the infection rate of the virus. The executive has expressed concerns that the spread of the virus has not reduced following a two-week limited lockdown, and that cases could spike further after the Christmas holidays unless more interventions are introduced. Swann warns virus will cast shadow into January Patient waits 28 hours as hospitals struggle The lockdown, which ended last Friday, saw non-essential retail, close contact services and hospitality largely have to shut - but Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young said evidence showed not enough people had followed the ""stay at home"" guidance. There were queues of ambulances outside Antrim Area Hospital on Tuesday night, with hospitals in Northern Ireland continuing to face severe pressures Ministers are also expected to discuss a decision by England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to strengthen guidance about how people can meet up with families over Christmas. On Wednesday, London and the devolved governments agreed to keep in place a plan to allow households to form ""Christmas bubbles"" from 23 to 27 December. The first and deputy first ministers said they wanted to ensure people in Northern Ireland were not isolated over Christmas, but stressed that ""personal responsibility"" should be a priority for anyone planning to have contact with others. Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she would also bring more details of her new support scheme for pubs that do not serve food, which have been forced to remain closed, to Thursday's executive meeting. It has yet to open, but last month the executiveallocated Â£10.6m in funding to the sector. It was always a case of when, not if, new restrictions would be imposed following the brief reprieve over Christmas. Mr Swann's use of the word ""extreme"" has some Stormont sources believing that we could be looking at a lockdown similar to that initially imposed back in March. It could even be tougher in some respects, with ministers aware a hard, long period of measures is needed in order to get transmission rates down. Expectations and anxieties have been raised yet again. Some businesses - having just reopened last week - will express frustration that they could lose out on important post-Christmas sales if they are told to shut again before New Year's Eve, particularly if extra financial support from Stormont isn't put in place. But the biggest issue ministers have to address is the lack of compliance, and there is a growing fear around the executive table that not enough people are heeding the message any more. Cases of the virus in Northern Ireland have not significantly reduced, despite several periods of restrictions since October. On Wednesday, eight deaths linked to Covid-19 were recorded in Northern Ireland, taking the Department of Health's total to 1,143. There were 510 more positive tests recorded, meaning there have been 59,631 cases overall. Health officials have urged the politicians to act quickly, in light of hospitals facing significant pressures that could increase as NI moves further into the winter flu season.

"Boris Johnson on a call with Ursula von der Leyen Talks to reach a post-Brexit trade deal are in a ""serious situation"", Boris Johnson said after a call with the EU Commission head Ursula von der Leyen. He warned that ""time was short"" and that a no deal scenario was ""very likely"" unless the EU position changed ""substantially"". Mrs von der Leyen said it would be ""very challenging"" to bridge the ""big differences"", particularly on fish. However, she also welcomed ""substantial progress on many issues"". Talks in Brussels will continue on Friday, with two weeks to go before the UK leaves EU trading rules. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? In a statement issued after the phone call, No 10 said: ""He [Mr Johnson] said that we were making every effort to accommodate reasonable EU requests on the level playing field, but even though the gap had narrowed some fundamental areas remained difficult. ""On fisheries he stressed that the UK could not accept a situation where it was the only sovereign country in the world not to be able to control access to its own waters for an extended period and to be faced with fisheries quotas which hugely disadvantaged its own industry. ""The EU's position in this area was simply not reasonable and if there was to be an agreement it needed to shift significantly."" The UK's chief negotiator David Frost echoed the prime minister's tone,tweeting,external: ""The situation in our talks with the EU is very serious tonight. Progress seems blocked and time is running out."" European Parliament leaders have set Sunday as a deadline for them to see the text of any deal agreed by the negotiating teams. The senior MEPs said they would ""not be rushed"" into approving an agreement at their end, and would have to see the text by the end of the week if they were to sign it off by 31 December. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The call came after minister Michael Gove warned talks may go on until after Christmas. He said that while Christmas Day would be ""sacrosanct"", it was possible that Parliament could be recalled to approve a Brexit deal. Parliament closed for the Christmas break on Thursday evening. Mr Gove also said that although the European Parliament has said it would not have time to ratify a deal if it was not concluded by Sunday, they could ""apply provisional application of the treaty"". This video can not be played Michael Gove said Brexit talks 'may go on after Christmas' He told the Commons Brexit Committee the ""most likely outcome"" was that the current transition period would end on December 31 without a deal. Asked how likely a deal is, he replied ""I think, regrettably, the chances are more likely that we won't secure an agreement. So at the moment less than 50%."" It's long been predicted that competition rules and fishing would be the last areas where compromise is found. For Boris Johnson's government, being tied to EU regulations in perpetuity defeats the purpose of Brexit and makes a mockery of ""taking back control"". For the European Union, it will not allow its internal market to be undermined by offering the UK unfair access. Ursula von der Leyen has claimed the two sides have made a significant step by agreeing to a ""strong mechanism"" to ensure neither side lowers their environmental or social standards, but are yet to agree on how each could diverge from these levels in the future. A good number of EU diplomats were quietly confident it was a matter of when, not if, EU access to UK fishing waters could be sorted. But it's proving trickier than they thought. Sources tell me that Michel Barnier explained to EU ambassadors at the start of this week that if fishing is resolved, then a wider deal would quickly fall into place. But there's no sign of a meeting of minds on fish, with the EU warning openly it may prove to be impossible. But let's remember this is the most intense of negotiations and that every public proclamation from London or Brussels will be chosen to strengthening their respective hands in what are the final days and hours of talks. Although there is only 14 days until the deadline, Mr Gove said he believed there was enough time for the necessary legislation to pass before 31 December ""to give businesses legal certainty"". But a number of opposition MPs raised issues already facing businesses waiting to discover the outcome of talks. One Welsh MP, Jonathan Edwards, said: ""I was contacted late last night by a businessman in my constituency who is reliant on imports from the continent and he can't find a haulage firm willing to carriage on his behalf due to the current delays at the ports. ""He's very concerned unless this issue was resolved his business would not survive into the new year."" Mr Gove said he would get in touch with the business concerned.

"Thousands attended the funeral in June The police say an investigation into potential breaches of restrictions at the funeral of senior IRA figure Bobby Storey is now completed. A file will be submitted to the Public Prosecution Service tomorrow. Twenty-four people were interviewed as part of the investigation, including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill. It began after almost 2,000 people attended the funeral in west Belfast in June at a time when numbers at gatherings were severely restricted. Sinn FÃ©in was criticised for the attendance of many of its senior members, including Ms O'Neill and party president Mary Lou McDonald. The PSNI brought in the deputy chief constable of Cumbria, Mark Webster, to oversee and direct inquiries. In a statement on Thursday he said: ""I was appointed to independently examine the sequence of events surrounding the funeral of Bobby Storey on 30 June this year and alleged breaches of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2020. ""We have now interviewed 24 individuals suspected of having breached the regulations and a file will be submitted to the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) on Friday 18 December 2020. ""I will not be making any further comment so as not to prejudice any future decision made by the PPS."" Unionists had been critical at the pace of the investigation. They have also raised questions about what was agreed between Sinn FÃ©in and the PSNI ahead of the funeral. Police largely stayed away and allowed Sinn FÃ©in to steward proceedings. Ms O'Neilllater admitted the public health message had been undermined. What happened at Bobby Storey's funeral? Speaking to BBC News NI last week, PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne defended how it was handled and said the investigation into potential breaches of health regulations was ""in its end stages"". Sinn FÃ©in's leader Mary-Lou McDonald (left) and deputy leader Michelle O'Neill (right) attended Mr Storey's funeral, along with former leader Gerry Adams (centre) Earlier, Mr Byrne said it was ""not appropriate"" to comment on what the police and Sinn FÃ©in had discussed in advance of the funeral. Sinn FÃ©in president Ms McDonald had previously said it had been ""meticulously"" planned with the PSNI. This story was amended on 27 January 2021 to remove the phrase 'IRA veteran'.

Praising his reaction, Mr Cummings wrote: ""It was only because of his intensive training and quick wits that many millions of lives weren't lost."" He added that there have been many such near-misses since the 1960s and that ""protocols combined with flawed early warning systems remain a huge danger today"".

"Non-essential shops will have to close again A new lockdown in Northern Ireland will begin on 26 December, the executive has agreed. Non-essential shops in NI will close from the end of trading on Christmas Eve in a bid to stop the spread of Covid-19. Ministers will review the measures after four weeks. Close-contact services, such as hair salons, will have to shut and pubs, cafes and restaurants will be restricted to takeaway services. The first week of the lockdown, running until 2 January, will see even tighter measures with essential shops having to close each day by 20:00 GMT. No sporting events will be permitted at all - even at elite level - with people being urged only to leave their home for essential reasons. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she recognised the lockdown would be ""disappointing"" for many people, but that it was clear a ""longer and deeper intervention"" was necessary. ""The health service would be completely crushed in January if we didn't intervene now, so while this is draconian, it's about saving lives,"" she said. ""We've never been in such a bad position as we are now, and will be in January if this didn't happen now."" The new rules will include: Closure of all non-essential retail, including garden centres and homeware shops that previously were deemed essential Click-and-collect services will not be permitted Closure of close contact services such as hair and beauty salons Hospitality businesses will only be allowed to offer takeaway and delivery Closure of the leisure and entertainment sector Off-licences will have to close by 20:00 Car washes will be closed Hotels will be allowed to remain open until 28 December to ""accommodate the Christmas situation"" People from up to three households in Northern Ireland will still be able to meet over the festive period in so-called Christmas ""bubbles"" - but that will end on 27 December This video can not be played 'Urgent intervention was needed' Health Minister Robin Swann, who had proposed the package of measures, said it was the ""deepest and hardest"" decision ministers had faced since the beginning of the pandemic. ""There was no other way and the message come Boxing Day [26 December] will be 'work from home, and stay at home',"" he added. 'This sounds the death knell for many businesses' It is understood people will also not be allowed to meet others in private gardens, while restrictions on indoor visits to people's homes will remain in place. Health officials have also proposed limiting the reopening of schools in January. It is understood a package of interventions will be drawn up by the education and health departments and further discussions on this issue will take place. Mr Swann also revealed that by Thursday evening, almost 10,000 people in Northern Ireland had received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. This video can not be played 'We have probably taken our hardest decision' Dr Michael McBride, NI's chief medical officer said the situation ""does not get more serious than this"". ""These interventions and restrictions are absolutely necessary and I know they'll cause concern but if we are to get this virus under control, and take the pressure off our hospitals, then these are absolutely essential,"" he said. He urged people ""not to wait"" until after Christmas to start reducing their number of social contacts. People from up to three households in Northern Ireland will still be able to meet over the festive period in so-called Christmas ""bubbles"". It follows a previous agreement between the UK nations to stick to plans to allow three households to mix between 23 and 27 December. Anyone travelling to or from Northern Ireland is permitted an extra day either side on 22 and 28 December. The new lockdown is being imposed in response to rising numbers of cases of the virus in Northern Ireland. On Thursday, a further 12 Covid-linked deaths were recorded in NI and a further 656 cases of the virus. Hospitality Ulster said the decision to impose a lockdown was the news the industry had been ""dreading for some time"". Its chief executive Colin Neill said he understood why it was necessary, but would ""sound the death knell"" for many firms that would not survive the six-week period. ""The sector now needs urgent financial assistance at the right level to offset previous debts rung up in the race to be Covid secure and make sure that it is covered during this lockdown which will take weeks, if not months, to see out,"" he said. The executive has said previous financial support schemes will continue for businesses forced to close. Colin Neill said the decision was necessary but that the executive needed to immediately get financial support out to businesses The Northern Ireland Retail Consortium said it wanted the executive to ""urgently provide clarity"" about criteria for retail to reopen after the lockdown. ""We also need shoppers to continue to act responsibly in the shopping days that are left until Christmas,"" its director AodhÃ¡n Connolly said. ""Wear a face covering in store and when queueing, keep your distance,  wash your hands, leave extra time for shopping, avoid peak times and most of all be kind to staff and other shoppers."" Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, described the news as ""profoundly disappointing"". ""Make no mistake - this third lockdown will result in a tsunami of independent retailers falling and thousands more jobs being lost with permanent damage done to our local high streets,"" he added.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has extended the furlough scheme for one month until the end of April next year. He said the move would provide ""certainty for millions of jobs and businesses"". It means the government will continue to pay up to 80% of the wages of workers who have been furloughed. Mr Sunak also confirmed he would be extending the government-guaranteed Covid-19 business loan schemes until the end of March. These changes come in the run-up to the next Budget, which the chancellor confirmed would take place on 3 March 2021. The roll-out of vaccinations has provided hope for businesses struggling to get through a winter of stop-start measures to control the virus. But it is likely to be several months before enough of the population has been covered to allow for anything like business as usual. Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid? Furlough extension buys time as vaccine is rolled out ""Our package of support for businesses and workers continues to be one of the most generous and effective in the world - helping our economy to recover and protecting livelihoods across the country,"" Mr Sunak said. ""We know the premium businesses place on certainty, so it is right that we enable them to plan ahead regardless of the path the virus takes, which is why we're providing certainty and clarity by extending this support."" Holly Muldoon, co-founder of RubyLemon, a UK entertainment and event agency Holly Muldoon is the co-founder of RubyLemon, an entertainment and event staffing agency based in London. She welcomes Mr Sunak's announcement, which will mean her office team can be furloughed for longer, but says it's also a worrying sign. ""It's good to know we've got a bit of support there, but it's a bit devastating. Realistically if it's extended until April, this means we're not going to get back to work until at least May,"" she says. Most of the 1,500 people who work for RubyLemon across the UK are freelancers and performers, who can't be furloughed, and will continue to struggle as they wait for business to restart. ""That's why it's really important that the events industry comes back, as we can't give anyone work,"" Ms Muldoon explained. The move drew criticism from the opposition. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said Mr Sunak had ""waited until the last possible minute to act, leaving businesses in the dark with less than 24 hours before they have to issue redundancy notices"". She added: ""Rishi Sunak's irresponsible, last-minute decision-making has left the UK with the worst recession of any major economy."" But CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said the package would ""bring some much-needed certainty and respite"" for businesses. ""Stable employer contributions and an extension to the Job Retention Scheme until the end of April will mean the scheme continues to protect people's livelihoods,"" she added. ""And with cashflow difficulties still at the forefront of the minds of many business owners, continued access to government-backed loans through to spring will bring great comfort."" Industry body UKHospitality said the extension to the furlough scheme was ""welcome"", but it still has grave concerns. ""With yet more of the country having been served notice of moving into tighter restrictions and 72,500 of Britain's 110,00 licensed premises unable to open and a further 12,500 wet led venues with little chance of reopening, more will be needed to safeguard jobs and businesses in a sector being seemingly singled out to bear the brunt of Covid measures,"" said UKHospitality's chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""Without additional business support to accompany this extension, there will inevitably be more widespread business failures and job losses."" The government will continue to pay up to 80% of the salary of employees for hours not worked until the end of April, with a cap of Â£2,500 a month. Employers will only be required to pay the wages, National Insurance (NI) contributions and pensions for hours worked, as well as NI contributions and pensions for hours not worked. The eligibility criteria for the UK-wide scheme will remain unchanged and these changes will continue to apply to all devolved administrations, the government said. The extension of the furlough scheme into April will help some firms - but only to pay wages. Firms urgently need further cash to pay rent, suppliers and energy bills. The Bank of England estimated last week that the private sector as a whole has Â£180bn less cash coming in this financial year than it needs to cover costs. Extending availability of emergency loans by two months may help ease that huge squeeze on cash flow. But it's not clear more debt is the answer. The National Audit Office has estimated that up to Â£26bn of the Â£43bn lent in Bounce Back Loans may not be paid back. There's now growing pressure to offer much more in grants, not loans, to stop a bleak Christmas ruining thousands of normally healthy businesses in the new year. The risk is stark: if you ban two-thirds of the country from meeting anyone from another household indoors eight days before Christmas, tens of thousands of pubs, restaurants and hotels could go under. The furlough scheme is officially known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. So far, it has supported 9.6 million jobs across the UK, with more than one million businesses using it. Businesses will also have until the end of March to access the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, and the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme. These had been due to close at the end of January. To date, they have already provided more than Â£68bn in guaranteed loans to firms. Hospitality, leisure and retail providers have been particularly severely affected by months of changing regulations, sharply reducing their revenues. On Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announcedmore parts of south-eastern England would move into tier three, the strictest level of measures. London was moved to tier three on Wednesday.

"Liz Truss says ""right-thinking people"" must fight for ""fairness"" The government is promising to focus more on people's social class and individual ""character"", as it overhauls its equality policy. Equalities minister Liz Truss said the discrimination debate should not focus solely on race, religion, sexual orientation and disability. Discussion had too often been dominated by ""fashion"" and not ""facts"", she said. Labour accused Ms Truss of ""gratuitous provocation"" and ignoring the ""devastating impact"" of discrimination. The government is launching an Equality Data Programme to gather information on people's backgrounds, social mobility and inequality between regions. Racial disparities report pushed back into 2021 'Unconscious bias training' scrapped by ministers Speaking at the Centre for Policy Studies think tank, Ms Truss said: ""To make our society more equal, we need the equality debate to be led by facts, not by fashion. ""Time and time again, we see politicians making their own evidence-free judgements."" She also said discussion had ""been dominated by a small number of unrepresentative voices, and by those who believe people are defined by their protected characteristic and not by their individual character"". The Equalities and Human Rights Commissionlists protected characteristics,external- over which it is illegal to discriminate - as age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. Ms Truss argued that data based solely on these characteristics is not fit for purpose when it comes to setting equality policy. The equalities minister said: ""Underlying this [approach] is the soft bigotry of low expectations, where people from certain backgrounds are never expected or considered able enough to reach high standards. ""This diminishes individual humanity and dignity, because when you choose on the basis of protected characteristics, you end up excluding people."" Ms Truss added that it was ""appalling"" that pregnant women suffer discrimination at work"", that women may ""be encouraged to dress in a certain way to get ahead"", and that ""some employers overlook the capabilities of people with disabilities"". Debates on equality must be ""rooted"" in ""real concerns people face"", she said, adding: ""It is our duty to deliver, because if right-thinking people do not lead the fight for fairness, then it will be led by those whose ideas do not work."" For Labour, shadow equalities minister Marsha de Cordova said: ""This is gratuitous provocation from a government that consistently refuses to face up to its responsibilities and the widening inequality it has caused. ""When Liz Truss dismisses 'fashionable' causes, she actually dismisses the devastating impact of discrimination and unfairness in people's day-to-day lives."" Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, a racial equality think tank, said: ""Liz Truss's attempts to 'overhaul' the equalities work in the UK is nothing short of a whitewashing of British history and its relationship with race."" She also said: ""It is time that equalities ministers in this government are held accountable for their words."" The government announced on Wednesday that its report into racial inequality will be delayed until next year, citing problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic. It is looking at health, education and criminal justice, but also ""wider inequalities"" such as issues faced by working-class white boys.

"Commons leader Jacob Rees Mogg has accused Unicef of ""playing politics"" after the charity launched a campaign to help feed children in the UK. The Tory MP said the charity was meant to look after people in the poorest countries and should be ""ashamed"". It comes after Unicef said it would pledge Â£25,000 to a south London charity to help supply breakfast boxes over the Christmas holidays. Unicef said every child deserves to ""thrive"" no matter where they are born. Unicef to feed children in UK for first time Poverty and virus 'push families closer to brink' Fighting food poverty in a virus lockdown The grant to the charity School Food Matters in Southwark aims to help vulnerable children and families during the coronavirus crisis. Unicef said the initiative was its first emergency response in the UK in its 70-year history. This video can not be played ""It is a real scandal that Unicef should be playing politics in this way."" Mr Rees-Mogg was responding to a question from Labour MP Zarah Sultana in the House of Commons. ""For the first time ever, Unicef, the UN agency responsible for providing humanitarian aid to children, is having to feed working-class kids in the UK,"" she said. ""But while children go hungry, a wealthy few enjoy obscene riches."" She asked if Mr Rees-Mogg would ""give government time to discuss the need to make him and his super-rich chums pay their fair share so that we can end the grotesque inequality that scars our society"". Responding, Mr Rees-Mogg said Unicef ""should be ashamed of itself"". ""I think it is a real scandal that Unicef should be playing politics in this way when it is meant to be looking after people in the poorest, the most deprived, countries of the world where people are starving, where there are famines and where there are civil wars, and they make cheap political points of this kind, giving, l think, Â£25,000 to one council,"" he said. ""It is a political stunt of the lowest order."" He said the number of children in absolute poverty across the country had gone down by 100,000 over the past decade, which he described as ""a record of success"". In response, Anna Kettley, Unicef UK's director of programmes and advocacy, said: ""Unicef UK is responding to this unprecedented crisis and building on our 25 years' experience of working on children's rights in the UK with a one-off domestic response, launched in August, to provide support to vulnerable children and families around the country during this crisis period."" She said more than Â£700,000 was being granted to community groups around the country to help tackle food insecurity during the pandemic. ""Unicef will continue to spend our international funding helping the world's poorest children. We believe that every child is important and deserves to survive and thrive no matter where they are born,"" she added.

"Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf says 2020 was a terrible year Sweden's king has said his country ""failed"" to save lives with its relatively relaxed approach to the coronavirus pandemic. King Carl XVI Gustaf made the remarks as part of an annual TV review of the year,externalwith the royal family. Sweden, which has never imposed a full lockdown, has seen nearly 350,000 cases and more than 7,800 deaths - a lot more than its Scandinavian neighbours. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said he agreed with the king's remarks. ""Of course the fact that so many have died can't be considered as anything other than a failure,"" Mr Lofven told reporters. Referring to the government's strategy, Mr Lofven added that ""it's when we are through the pandemic that the real conclusions can be drawn"". Did Sweden's coronavirus strategy succeed or fail? What is Europe doing about Covid and Christmas? Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? In the programme, the king says: ""I think we have failed. We have a large number who have died and that is terrible. ""The people of Sweden have suffered tremendously in difficult conditions. One thinks of all the family members who have happened to be unable to say goodbye to their deceased family members. I think it is a tough and traumatic experience not to be able to say a warm goodbye."" When asked if he was afraid of being infected with Covid-19, the king - who is 74 - said: ""Lately, it has felt more obvious, it has crept closer and closer. That's not what you want."" Instead of relying on legal sanctions, Sweden appeals to citizens' sense of responsibility and civic duty, and issues only recommendations. There are no sanctions if they are ignored. Sweden has never imposed a nationwide lockdown or the wearing of masks, and bars and restaurants have remained open. However, earlier this week, schools across the Stockholm region were asked to switch to distance learning for 13 to 15-year-olds for the first time as soon as possible. The measure was announced in response to rising Covid-19 cases. This came a week after a nationwide decision on 7 December to switch to remote learning for those over 16. And on Monday, new nationwide social-distancing recommendations for the Christmas period came into force, replacing similar region-specific guidelines. Swedes are advised to meet a maximum of eight people, gather outdoors if possible and avoid travelling by train or bus. A formal ban on public gatherings of more than eight people remains, affecting events such as concerts, sports matches and demonstrations. Sweden's state epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, in November explained the strategy relied on a combination of legal and voluntary measures. He told the BBC that this was, in the Swedish context, ""the combination that we really believe is the best one"". This video can not be played Tegnell: ""Not yet possible to say which country has right strategy"" (November 2020 interview) According to an official report released earlier this week, the strategy failed in its effort to protect the elderly in care homes - for which the government has admitted responsibility. Over 90% of Covid-related deaths have been among those aged 70 and over, and nearly half of all Covid deaths have been in  care homes, the government says. Mr Tegnell said his agency (Sweden's Public Health Agency) was not responsible for directing the elderly care system, and added all stakeholders needed to help to improve the situation to make sure the elderly did not get infected. He said he thought Sweden had become better at protecting older people, and that no country had succeeded entirely in that area  - even Germany was being hit hard right now,he told Swedish radio on Wednesday,external. Sweden has had more deaths than the rest of the Nordic countries combined. This has led to criticism from the country's neighbours, Norway, Denmark and Finland, that its less strict approach is putting their own measures at risk. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Lofven also said he felt many experts had underestimated the second wave. ""I think most in the profession did not see such a wave incoming. There was instead talk of different clusters,"" he said in an interview with daily Aftonbladet. Sweden brings in rule of eight for diners Covid-19: Is Sweden getting it right?

"Boris Johnson on a call with Ursula von der Leyen Talks to reach a post-Brexit trade deal are in a ""serious situation"", Boris Johnson said after a call with the EU Commission head Ursula von der Leyen. He warned that ""time was short"" and that a no deal scenario was ""very likely"" unless the EU position changed ""substantially"". Mrs von der Leyen said it would be ""very challenging"" to bridge the ""big differences"", particularly on fish. However, she also welcomed ""substantial progress on many issues"". Talks in Brussels will continue on Friday, with two weeks to go before the UK leaves EU trading rules. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? In a statement issued after the phone call, No 10 said: ""He [Mr Johnson] said that we were making every effort to accommodate reasonable EU requests on the level playing field, but even though the gap had narrowed some fundamental areas remained difficult. ""On fisheries he stressed that the UK could not accept a situation where it was the only sovereign country in the world not to be able to control access to its own waters for an extended period and to be faced with fisheries quotas which hugely disadvantaged its own industry. ""The EU's position in this area was simply not reasonable and if there was to be an agreement it needed to shift significantly."" The UK's chief negotiator David Frost echoed the prime minister's tone,tweeting,external: ""The situation in our talks with the EU is very serious tonight. Progress seems blocked and time is running out."" European Parliament leaders have set Sunday as a deadline for them to see the text of any deal agreed by the negotiating teams. The senior MEPs said they would ""not be rushed"" into approving an agreement at their end, and would have to see the text by the end of the week if they were to sign it off by 31 December. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The call came after minister Michael Gove warned talks may go on until after Christmas. He said that while Christmas Day would be ""sacrosanct"", it was possible that Parliament could be recalled to approve a Brexit deal. Parliament closed for the Christmas break on Thursday evening. Mr Gove also said that although the European Parliament has said it would not have time to ratify a deal if it was not concluded by Sunday, they could ""apply provisional application of the treaty"". This video can not be played Michael Gove said Brexit talks 'may go on after Christmas' He told the Commons Brexit Committee the ""most likely outcome"" was that the current transition period would end on December 31 without a deal. Asked how likely a deal is, he replied ""I think, regrettably, the chances are more likely that we won't secure an agreement. So at the moment less than 50%."" It's long been predicted that competition rules and fishing would be the last areas where compromise is found. For Boris Johnson's government, being tied to EU regulations in perpetuity defeats the purpose of Brexit and makes a mockery of ""taking back control"". For the European Union, it will not allow its internal market to be undermined by offering the UK unfair access. Ursula von der Leyen has claimed the two sides have made a significant step by agreeing to a ""strong mechanism"" to ensure neither side lowers their environmental or social standards, but are yet to agree on how each could diverge from these levels in the future. A good number of EU diplomats were quietly confident it was a matter of when, not if, EU access to UK fishing waters could be sorted. But it's proving trickier than they thought. Sources tell me that Michel Barnier explained to EU ambassadors at the start of this week that if fishing is resolved, then a wider deal would quickly fall into place. But there's no sign of a meeting of minds on fish, with the EU warning openly it may prove to be impossible. But let's remember this is the most intense of negotiations and that every public proclamation from London or Brussels will be chosen to strengthening their respective hands in what are the final days and hours of talks. Although there is only 14 days until the deadline, Mr Gove said he believed there was enough time for the necessary legislation to pass before 31 December ""to give businesses legal certainty"". But a number of opposition MPs raised issues already facing businesses waiting to discover the outcome of talks. One Welsh MP, Jonathan Edwards, said: ""I was contacted late last night by a businessman in my constituency who is reliant on imports from the continent and he can't find a haulage firm willing to carriage on his behalf due to the current delays at the ports. ""He's very concerned unless this issue was resolved his business would not survive into the new year."" Mr Gove said he would get in touch with the business concerned.

"A host of European leaders are self-isolating after the French President, Emmanuel Macron, tested positive for Covid-19. Mr Macron, 42, will self-isolate for seven days while working remotely, the ElysÃ©e Palace said in a statement. The French president attended a number of high-profile events in recent days, including an EU summit. Following his diagnosis several other European leaders, including the Spanish PM, said they would self-isolate. ""The President of the Republic has been diagnosed positive for Covid-19 today,"" the ElysÃ©e said on Thursday morning. The diagnosis was made following a ""test performed at the onset of the first symptoms"", the statement added. The French president's wife Brigitte Macron, who is 67, is self-isolating but has no symptoms. It is not yet known how Mr Macron caught the virus but his office said it was identifying any recent close contacts he has had. How are France and other European countries tackling the pandemic? French culture takes centre stage in Covid protest The meteoric rise of France's youngest president On Tuesday President Macron hosted French parliamentary heads and on Monday members of the intergovernmental group the OECD. Last week he, along with almost every other EU leader, attended a summit in Brussels. Among those going into self-isolation areEuropean Council chief Charles Michel, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchezandOECD Secretary-General Angel GurrÃ­a, all of whom met President Macron this week. Mr Sanchez has tested negative but, like Mr Macron, will work remotely from quarantine. Portuguese Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa, 59, has cancelled all official trips, and is isolating and awaiting test results, after a working lunch in Paris with President Macron on Wednesday. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De CrooandLuxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Betteltoo are self-isolating following contact with the French president. In a statement Mr Bettel wished Mr Macron a ""speedy recovery"". Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martinhas tested negative for Covid-19 but will limit his contacts, a spokesperson said. President Macron (L) met Spanish PM Pedro SÃ¡nchez on Monday FrenchPrime Minister Jean Castex, 55, andparliamentary speaker Richard Ferrand, 58, are also self-isolating, their offices confirmed. Mr Castex, who is not showing any symptoms and has tested negative, was due to introduce the government's Covid vaccination policy in the Senate on Thursday - now Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran is doing it instead. France this week ended a six-week national lockdown, replacing the measure with a curfew to help deal with soaring cases. Mr Macron last week attended a two-day European Council heads of state summit, finishing on Friday. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? However, the French president is considered to have become potentially contagious as of Monday evening, a senior EU official told the BBC. All sanitary measures were observed during last week's meeting and the council has not been informed of any other participants testing positive, the source added. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wore a mask at the summit and tested negative for the virus on Tuesday, German officials said after hearing the news about President Macron. A French presidential spokeswoman confirmed that all of Mr Macron's forthcoming trips, including a scheduled visit to Lebanon on 22 December, had been cancelled. The ElysÃ©e is doing everything to project an image of business as usual.  Already President Macron is back at work, and a meeting with his finance and foreign ministers has gone ahead as planned - though with the visitors in an adjacent room. It's being emphasised that the workings of government have already been radically adapted for Covid - with video conferences now the norm - so unless the president takes a turn for the worse no-one will notice much of a difference. And meanwhile - as with any ordinary citizen - the trace-and-test system has kicked in, and numerous dignitaries foreign and domestic have been told the bad news that they have to self-isolate. The message is clear: Emmanuel Macron may be the president of France - but for the purposes of the virus he is a human like any other.  So he will behave according to the rules.

"British Airways has cancelled services to more than 15 long-haul destinations next year. The news comes as many airlines cut staff and drop routes as passengers cut travel amid the pandemic. Routes to cities in North America such as Pittsburgh, Calgary and Charleston have gone, alongside flights to Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and Osaka. The Seychelles, a popular winter holiday destination, has also been removed. Muscat, Jeddah and Abu Dhabi routes are axed, and BA will also temporarily suspend flights to Sydney, Bangkok and San Jose during the summer of 2021. Passengers have contacted the BBC to say they have had trips cancelled in 2021 and are waiting for advice from BA on whether they will receive a refund or a flight voucher. British Airways owner cuts flight numbers again BA boss replaced amid industry's 'worst crisis' BA said it was sorry and that customers on cancelled flights are entitled to a full refund. Like other airlines, the pandemic meant global travel restrictions had forced it to operate a reduced and dynamic schedule, it said. It advised customers on affected flights to check the BA website for the latest flight information. BA has said previously that the pandemic has hit it harder than anything ever before, with losses that outstrip the financial crisis of 2008 and the September 2001 terror attacks on the World Trade Center in New York. Losses totalled almost Â£4bn in the first half of this year. The airline controversially made about 10,000 staff redundant in the summer, as it fought to save money and limit burning through cash reserves as passenger numbers collapsed. Previously, BA has said it does not expect international travel to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023.

"The next Budget will be held on 3 March 2021, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced. He said it would ""set out the next phase of the plan to tackle the virus and protect jobs"". A budget had been expected to take place in Autumn, but this was scrapped due to the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Sunak also announced that the furlough scheme, which subsidises the wages of workers hit by the virus,will be extendedfrom March to April 2021. Governments usually use the Budget to outline the state of the country's finances and propose tax changes. This will be Mr Sunak's second budget since he became chancellor. Covid crisis forces Autumn Budget to be scrapped Furlough scheme extended for another month Economic emergency has only just begun, says Sunak The budget will come at a difficult time for the UK economy as it faces the fallout from the pandemic. Official forecasts have predicted the biggest economic decline in 300 years with the UK's national income expected to shrink by 11.3% in 2020 and not return to pre-crisis levels until the end of 2022. Government borrowing will also rise to its highest level outside of wartime - and unemployment is predicted to increase to 2.6 million, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. Speaking in Parliament earlier this year, Mr Sunak warned that ""our economic emergency has only just begun."" He said that, although the high levels of borrowing were justified in order to deal with the virus, ""the situation is clearly unsustainable over the medium term."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tankhas warned that tax risesof more than Â£40bn a year are ""all but inevitable"" to stop debt from spinning out of control.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has extended the furlough scheme for one month until the end of April next year. He said the move would provide ""certainty for millions of jobs and businesses"". It means the government will continue to pay up to 80% of the wages of workers who have been furloughed. Mr Sunak also confirmed he would be extending the government-guaranteed Covid-19 business loan schemes until the end of March. These changes come in the run-up to the next Budget, which the chancellor confirmed would take place on 3 March 2021. The roll-out of vaccinations has provided hope for businesses struggling to get through a winter of stop-start measures to control the virus. But it is likely to be several months before enough of the population has been covered to allow for anything like business as usual. Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid? Furlough extension buys time as vaccine is rolled out ""Our package of support for businesses and workers continues to be one of the most generous and effective in the world - helping our economy to recover and protecting livelihoods across the country,"" Mr Sunak said. ""We know the premium businesses place on certainty, so it is right that we enable them to plan ahead regardless of the path the virus takes, which is why we're providing certainty and clarity by extending this support."" Holly Muldoon, co-founder of RubyLemon, a UK entertainment and event agency Holly Muldoon is the co-founder of RubyLemon, an entertainment and event staffing agency based in London. She welcomes Mr Sunak's announcement, which will mean her office team can be furloughed for longer, but says it's also a worrying sign. ""It's good to know we've got a bit of support there, but it's a bit devastating. Realistically if it's extended until April, this means we're not going to get back to work until at least May,"" she says. Most of the 1,500 people who work for RubyLemon across the UK are freelancers and performers, who can't be furloughed, and will continue to struggle as they wait for business to restart. ""That's why it's really important that the events industry comes back, as we can't give anyone work,"" Ms Muldoon explained. The move drew criticism from the opposition. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said Mr Sunak had ""waited until the last possible minute to act, leaving businesses in the dark with less than 24 hours before they have to issue redundancy notices"". She added: ""Rishi Sunak's irresponsible, last-minute decision-making has left the UK with the worst recession of any major economy."" But CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said the package would ""bring some much-needed certainty and respite"" for businesses. ""Stable employer contributions and an extension to the Job Retention Scheme until the end of April will mean the scheme continues to protect people's livelihoods,"" she added. ""And with cashflow difficulties still at the forefront of the minds of many business owners, continued access to government-backed loans through to spring will bring great comfort."" Industry body UKHospitality said the extension to the furlough scheme was ""welcome"", but it still has grave concerns. ""With yet more of the country having been served notice of moving into tighter restrictions and 72,500 of Britain's 110,00 licensed premises unable to open and a further 12,500 wet led venues with little chance of reopening, more will be needed to safeguard jobs and businesses in a sector being seemingly singled out to bear the brunt of Covid measures,"" said UKHospitality's chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""Without additional business support to accompany this extension, there will inevitably be more widespread business failures and job losses."" The government will continue to pay up to 80% of the salary of employees for hours not worked until the end of April, with a cap of Â£2,500 a month. Employers will only be required to pay the wages, National Insurance (NI) contributions and pensions for hours worked, as well as NI contributions and pensions for hours not worked. The eligibility criteria for the UK-wide scheme will remain unchanged and these changes will continue to apply to all devolved administrations, the government said. The extension of the furlough scheme into April will help some firms - but only to pay wages. Firms urgently need further cash to pay rent, suppliers and energy bills. The Bank of England estimated last week that the private sector as a whole has Â£180bn less cash coming in this financial year than it needs to cover costs. Extending availability of emergency loans by two months may help ease that huge squeeze on cash flow. But it's not clear more debt is the answer. The National Audit Office has estimated that up to Â£26bn of the Â£43bn lent in Bounce Back Loans may not be paid back. There's now growing pressure to offer much more in grants, not loans, to stop a bleak Christmas ruining thousands of normally healthy businesses in the new year. The risk is stark: if you ban two-thirds of the country from meeting anyone from another household indoors eight days before Christmas, tens of thousands of pubs, restaurants and hotels could go under. The furlough scheme is officially known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. So far, it has supported 9.6 million jobs across the UK, with more than one million businesses using it. Businesses will also have until the end of March to access the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, and the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme. These had been due to close at the end of January. To date, they have already provided more than Â£68bn in guaranteed loans to firms. Hospitality, leisure and retail providers have been particularly severely affected by months of changing regulations, sharply reducing their revenues. On Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announcedmore parts of south-eastern England would move into tier three, the strictest level of measures. London was moved to tier three on Wednesday.

"This video can not be played Abdulhadi avoided the mass kidnapping in Nigeria's Katsina school but his twin brother Mustapha was lost in the chaos A video said to be from the jihadist group Boko Haram shows some of more than 300 Nigerian schoolboys kidnapped last week. In the video, filmed in a forest, gunmen with their faces covered stand guard over boys, some of whom look no older than 10. One child is made to issue demands on behalf of the group. The boys were snatched from a boarding school in the north-western state of Katsina. Africa Live: Other stories from the continent 'How I escaped my Katsina kidnappers' Who are Boko Haram? The attack was the first of its kind in north-western Nigeria. Despite the Boko Haram claim that it was behind the abductions, the Nigerian authorities say they were carried out by local gangs connected to the Islamist group. Boko Haram has been notorious over the last decade for school kidnappings,including in Chibok in 2014, when nearly 300 schoolgirls were seized.Its name loosely translated as ""Western education is forbidden"". However, these abductions have until now taken place in the north-east, where Boko Haram is based. The six-minute footage - which has not been independently verified - features a boy in the foreground whose clothes and face are dishevelled. Dozens of children, some of them appearing to be very young, stand in the background, pleading. Boko Haram said it had targeted the school in opposition to Western education In a mix of English and Hausa, the main speaker says they were kidnapped by Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau's gang. He says some of the boys have been killed by Nigerian fighter jets and calls for the closure of schools other than Koranic schools. He adds that all the government troops who have been sent to help them should be sent back. At one point his voice appears to break and the other children begin to cry. It's a distressing watch, BBC Nigeria correspondent Mayeni Jones says. Analysis by Nduka Orjinmo, BBC News, Lagos This marks a devastating turn in the war against Islamist insurgency in Nigeria; it all but confirms that militant groups such as Boko Haram have spread into the north-west. Worsening crimes such as kidnapping and attacks on farming communities had been linked to ""bandits"" - a loose term for several groups in the vast region which now has to include Islamic insurgents. There have been warnings in the past that the government's failure to deal with such groups posed a threat and a potential breeding ground for sympathisers of Islamist militancy. Boko Haram is led by Abubakar Shekau If the boys are now truly with Boko Haram, then what seemed unimaginable is now ringing true: Islamist militants in Nigeria's north-east spreading west to link up with clusters of other criminal gangs. The security implications should be worrying, not just for Nigeria but for other countries in the Sahel region, where large swathes of lands are now in the hands of such Islamist insurgents. This was a video many Nigerians were hoping they would never see again: schoolchildren in the hands of Boko Haram, and - expectedly - many are angry with the worsening security situation under the current government. People are now waiting to see how President Muhammadu Buhari handles the situation - Boko Haram are likely to use the boys as negotiating pawns. That this happened under an administration that came into power promising better security is a further dent in his reputation as a former military general. The gunmen who kidnapped the schoolboys might have got help from Boko Haram, state Governor Aminu Bello Masari toldthe BBC's Newsday programme. His statement comes after the Islamist militant group said it was responsible for the abduction. But the governor repeated the authorities' view that the attack itself had been carried out by what he termed local bandits. ""One cannot precisely say there is no Boko Haram at all but those who [carried out the attack] are not Boko Haram, are not known to be members of Boko Haram. ""Maybe [they helped] through training or some other means of assistance to the local bandits but all the names we have so far are names of the local bandits,"" Governor Masari said. He also told the BBC the security forces had made contact with the kidnappers and had some idea where they were. But he stressed the authorities would not negotiate with Boko Haram, nor would they agree to paying a ransom. The jihadist group has waged a brutal insurgency since 2009, mostly in north-eastern Nigeria. Tens of thousands of people have died and millions have been forced from their homes.

"The next Budget will be held on 3 March 2021, Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced. He said it would ""set out the next phase of the plan to tackle the virus and protect jobs"". A budget had been expected to take place in Autumn, but this was scrapped due to the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Sunak also announced that the furlough scheme, which subsidises the wages of workers hit by the virus,will be extendedfrom March to April 2021. Governments usually use the Budget to outline the state of the country's finances and propose tax changes. This will be Mr Sunak's second budget since he became chancellor. Covid crisis forces Autumn Budget to be scrapped Furlough scheme extended for another month Economic emergency has only just begun, says Sunak The budget will come at a difficult time for the UK economy as it faces the fallout from the pandemic. Official forecasts have predicted the biggest economic decline in 300 years with the UK's national income expected to shrink by 11.3% in 2020 and not return to pre-crisis levels until the end of 2022. Government borrowing will also rise to its highest level outside of wartime - and unemployment is predicted to increase to 2.6 million, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. Speaking in Parliament earlier this year, Mr Sunak warned that ""our economic emergency has only just begun."" He said that, although the high levels of borrowing were justified in order to deal with the virus, ""the situation is clearly unsustainable over the medium term."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tankhas warned that tax risesof more than Â£40bn a year are ""all but inevitable"" to stop debt from spinning out of control.

"A host of European leaders are self-isolating after the French President, Emmanuel Macron, tested positive for Covid-19. Mr Macron, 42, will self-isolate for seven days while working remotely, the ElysÃ©e Palace said in a statement. The French president attended a number of high-profile events in recent days, including an EU summit. Following his diagnosis several other European leaders, including the Spanish PM, said they would self-isolate. ""The President of the Republic has been diagnosed positive for Covid-19 today,"" the ElysÃ©e said on Thursday morning. The diagnosis was made following a ""test performed at the onset of the first symptoms"", the statement added. The French president's wife Brigitte Macron, who is 67, is self-isolating but has no symptoms. It is not yet known how Mr Macron caught the virus but his office said it was identifying any recent close contacts he has had. How are France and other European countries tackling the pandemic? French culture takes centre stage in Covid protest The meteoric rise of France's youngest president On Tuesday President Macron hosted French parliamentary heads and on Monday members of the intergovernmental group the OECD. Last week he, along with almost every other EU leader, attended a summit in Brussels. Among those going into self-isolation areEuropean Council chief Charles Michel, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchezandOECD Secretary-General Angel GurrÃ­a, all of whom met President Macron this week. Mr Sanchez has tested negative but, like Mr Macron, will work remotely from quarantine. Portuguese Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa, 59, has cancelled all official trips, and is isolating and awaiting test results, after a working lunch in Paris with President Macron on Wednesday. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De CrooandLuxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Betteltoo are self-isolating following contact with the French president. In a statement Mr Bettel wished Mr Macron a ""speedy recovery"". Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martinhas tested negative for Covid-19 but will limit his contacts, a spokesperson said. President Macron (L) met Spanish PM Pedro SÃ¡nchez on Monday FrenchPrime Minister Jean Castex, 55, andparliamentary speaker Richard Ferrand, 58, are also self-isolating, their offices confirmed. Mr Castex, who is not showing any symptoms and has tested negative, was due to introduce the government's Covid vaccination policy in the Senate on Thursday - now Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran is doing it instead. France this week ended a six-week national lockdown, replacing the measure with a curfew to help deal with soaring cases. Mr Macron last week attended a two-day European Council heads of state summit, finishing on Friday. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? However, the French president is considered to have become potentially contagious as of Monday evening, a senior EU official told the BBC. All sanitary measures were observed during last week's meeting and the council has not been informed of any other participants testing positive, the source added. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wore a mask at the summit and tested negative for the virus on Tuesday, German officials said after hearing the news about President Macron. A French presidential spokeswoman confirmed that all of Mr Macron's forthcoming trips, including a scheduled visit to Lebanon on 22 December, had been cancelled. The ElysÃ©e is doing everything to project an image of business as usual.  Already President Macron is back at work, and a meeting with his finance and foreign ministers has gone ahead as planned - though with the visitors in an adjacent room. It's being emphasised that the workings of government have already been radically adapted for Covid - with video conferences now the norm - so unless the president takes a turn for the worse no-one will notice much of a difference. And meanwhile - as with any ordinary citizen - the trace-and-test system has kicked in, and numerous dignitaries foreign and domestic have been told the bad news that they have to self-isolate. The message is clear: Emmanuel Macron may be the president of France - but for the purposes of the virus he is a human like any other.  So he will behave according to the rules. From left to right: Boris Johnson, Jair Bolsonaro, Ambrose Dlamini and Donald Trump President Macron is just the latest world leader to test positive for coronavirus: Prime Minister Ambrose Dlamini ofEswatini(formerly Swaziland) died on Monday, four weeks after he tested positive USPresident Donald Trump contracted the virus in October. He was given an experimental drugs cocktail and returned to the White House after three nights in hospital PolishPresident Andrzej Duda contracted the virus in October and went into self-isolation AlgerianPresident Abdelmadjid Tebboune has spent two months in hospital in Germany after catching the disease in October - last week he appeared in video for the first time since testing positive, saying he hopes to return to Algeria soon GuatemalanPresident Alejandro Giammattei tested positive in September - despite calling himself ""high-risk"" he did not appear to suffer a severe case Jair Bolsonaro ofBraziltested positive in July and spent more than two weeks quarantining in his residence In June, the outgoing President ofBurundi,Pierre Nkurunziza, died of an illness suspected by many to be Covid-19 Russia'sPrime Minster Mikhail Mishustin contracted the virus in April and was admitted to hospital with moderate to severe symptoms UKPrime Minister Boris Johnson tested positive in March - he spent three nights in intensive care in a London hospital, later saying he owed the health workers there his life US and UK leaders' Covid experiences compared At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"At the beginning of the university year, police were called out to a student halls of residence in Edinburgh Police Scotland's latest data on Covid breaches reveals that officers are repeatedly visiting the same properties to break up parties. The call logs, which have been obtained by BBC Scotland, also show that a number of people have been handed multiple fines. On 28 August thepolice were given the power to break up,externalhouse parties contravening social gathering rules. Since that date, officers have been called out nearly 5,000 times. Police break up hundreds of parties every week First Minister Nicola Sturgeon made it clear that giving Police Scotland enhanced powers was necessary to ensure socialising continued in a safe and responsible manner. The data, received through a Freedom of Information request, listed incidents which included: a party of 10 people found at aGlasgowaddress, where the householder had previously been issued with two fixed penalty notices (FPNs) in thenorth eastsix people were warned after being found at two different parties in the same evening officers attended aGlasgowaddress following a report of a noisy party. Fines were issued to five people - four of whom had previously received Covid-related fines inAyrshirepeople attempted to jump out of the windows of a property when police arrived. This was the second time officers had attended the address having previously issued a fine to the householder and police went to aRenfrewshireaddress where they gave fines to two party-goers who had previously been issued with a warning At the mid-November point, 68% of house parties had taken place in council areas under tier three restrictions, and 28% in tier two areas. Police Scotland declined to comment on whether such incidents suggested fixed penalty notices had failed to be a sufficient deterrent. Deputy Chief Constable Malcolm Graham said: ""Where officers encounter wilful and persistent breaches they will act decisively to enforce the law - this includes consideration of serious charges including culpable and reckless conduct. ""The chief constable has repeatedly underlined that house parties and relatively small gatherings can have a significant influence on spreading the virus and are not permitted."" Police data showed that officers had been alerted to 4,879 gatherings between 28 August and 22 November. In the first part of November police attended about 300 incidents each week with 227 of them deemed to have breached restrictions. However, the force has suggested the number is likely to be greater as it only counted formal call-outs and not incidents on patrol. So far, more than 2,000 fines have been issued and 279 arrests have been made. The information also revealed that the proportion of parties breaching restrictions is increasing in areas like Edinburgh, Glasgow and Tayside. Police Scotland said ""it will continue to explain the rules to the public and encourage people to take personal responsibility and do the right thing"". In the week covering Halloween and Bonfire Night, 84% of the 365 parties that took place were in breach of coronavirus restrictions. The incidents included: officers attending aGlasgowparty where they found three people who had been tested for Covid-19 earlier that day - but had not yet received their results inTaysidea fight broke out when police attended a house party with 60 ""intoxicated"" people police were tipped off about a party inGlasgowwith 200 people present and loud music playing. Officers said none of them were wearing face masks or socially distancing. More than 60 fines were issued and more than 20 people attended aDundeeparty, with many of them escaping through the back garden when police arrived A Scottish government spokesman said: ""Ministers have been consistently clear that we want to see these laws work through high levels of public compliance, rather than relying on enforcement."" There has also been concerns that large-scale parties are being promoted on social media platforms. Police document highlights included: Forth Valley police being alerted to an on-going party outsideBonnybridgewhich had been advertised on social media. On arriving, officers found a 48-seater bus, numerous cars outside and more than 100 party-goers and the police were called to anEdinburghparty where the location was disclosed 24 hours before the event. ""Kate"" has been issued four fines totalling Â£1,240 for attending illegal house parties across Glasgow. But she insists she won't be paying ""just for meeting my friends through a lockdown with rules that don't make sense anyway"". Her most recent fine was for Â£940. ""That's the one I'm most annoyed about as the police officers were awful to everyone in the party,"" she says. ""They were trying to make us feel scared."" Despite Police Scotland's insistence on warning first and fining later, Kate says when officers arrived ""they just started giving out the fines even though we would have been happy to leave."" She says she has been fined for going to small gatherings, as well as house parties with up to 60 people. ""But that's the fault of the people renting out the flats and houses for allowing us to go in the first place,"" she says. She's also not worried about transmitting or contracting coronavirus at the events. ""I've been to multiple parties and not one person I know has had it from the parties"".

"Boris Johnson on a call with Ursula von der Leyen Talks to reach a post-Brexit trade deal are in a ""serious situation"", Boris Johnson said after a call with the EU Commission head Ursula von der Leyen. He warned that ""time was short"" and that a no deal scenario was ""very likely"" unless the EU position changed ""substantially"". Mrs von der Leyen said it would be ""very challenging"" to bridge the ""big differences"", particularly on fish. However, she also welcomed ""substantial progress on many issues"". Talks in Brussels will continue on Friday, with two weeks to go before the UK leaves EU trading rules. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? In a statement issued after the phone call, No 10 said: ""He [Mr Johnson] said that we were making every effort to accommodate reasonable EU requests on the level playing field, but even though the gap had narrowed some fundamental areas remained difficult. ""On fisheries he stressed that the UK could not accept a situation where it was the only sovereign country in the world not to be able to control access to its own waters for an extended period and to be faced with fisheries quotas which hugely disadvantaged its own industry. ""The EU's position in this area was simply not reasonable and if there was to be an agreement it needed to shift significantly."" The UK's chief negotiator David Frost echoed the prime minister's tone,tweeting,external: ""The situation in our talks with the EU is very serious tonight. Progress seems blocked and time is running out."" European Parliament leaders have set Sunday as a deadline for them to see the text of any deal agreed by the negotiating teams. The senior MEPs said they would ""not be rushed"" into approving an agreement at their end, and would have to see the text by the end of the week if they were to sign it off by 31 December. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The call came after minister Michael Gove warned talks may go on until after Christmas. He said that while Christmas Day would be ""sacrosanct"", it was possible that Parliament could be recalled to approve a Brexit deal. Parliament closed for the Christmas break on Thursday evening. Mr Gove also said that although the European Parliament has said it would not have time to ratify a deal if it was not concluded by Sunday, they could ""apply provisional application of the treaty"". This video can not be played Michael Gove said Brexit talks 'may go on after Christmas' He told the Commons Brexit Committee the ""most likely outcome"" was that the current transition period would end on December 31 without a deal. Asked how likely a deal is, he replied ""I think, regrettably, the chances are more likely that we won't secure an agreement. So at the moment less than 50%."" It's long been predicted that competition rules and fishing would be the last areas where compromise is found. For Boris Johnson's government, being tied to EU regulations in perpetuity defeats the purpose of Brexit and makes a mockery of ""taking back control"". For the European Union, it will not allow its internal market to be undermined by offering the UK unfair access. Ursula von der Leyen has claimed the two sides have made a significant step by agreeing to a ""strong mechanism"" to ensure neither side lowers their environmental or social standards, but are yet to agree on how each could diverge from these levels in the future. A good number of EU diplomats were quietly confident it was a matter of when, not if, EU access to UK fishing waters could be sorted. But it's proving trickier than they thought. Sources tell me that Michel Barnier explained to EU ambassadors at the start of this week that if fishing is resolved, then a wider deal would quickly fall into place. But there's no sign of a meeting of minds on fish, with the EU warning openly it may prove to be impossible. But let's remember this is the most intense of negotiations and that every public proclamation from London or Brussels will be chosen to strengthening their respective hands in what are the final days and hours of talks. Although there is only 14 days until the deadline, Mr Gove said he believed there was enough time for the necessary legislation to pass before 31 December ""to give businesses legal certainty"". But a number of opposition MPs raised issues already facing businesses waiting to discover the outcome of talks. One Welsh MP, Jonathan Edwards, said: ""I was contacted late last night by a businessman in my constituency who is reliant on imports from the continent and he can't find a haulage firm willing to carriage on his behalf due to the current delays at the ports. ""He's very concerned unless this issue was resolved his business would not survive into the new year."" Mr Gove said he would get in touch with the business concerned.

"Regions in England will find out later whether they will be moved to a different tier of Covid restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to announce the outcome of the latest review of the three-tier system, after government officials met on Wednesday. In several areas of northern England, leaders say they have met the criteria to move from tier three to two, after a drop in infection rates. Leaders in Lancashire have been told it will stay, as expected, in tier three. NHS bosses have warned against easing restrictions ""prematurely"". More than 34 million people - or 61% of England's population - are living under tier three rules, the highest level of restrictions, including large parts of the Midlands, Yorkshire, the North East and the North West.

In an interview on BBC Breakfast, he said therelaxation of the rules between 23 and 27 Decemberwas ""a mistake"" and ministers could try to ""overcompensate with the decisions on the tiers"". He added that requiring hospitality venues to close as part of tier three measures at this time of year creates ""a substantial risk of many more gatherings in the home.. and that is where most of the virus spreads"". Meanwhile, the leader of Preston City Council, Cllr Matthew Brown said he believed Lancashire will remain in tier three. He said he remained ""gravely concerned"" about the impact of restrictions on the hospitality and culture sectors. ""However, while case numbers in Preston and throughout Lancashire remain high, especially in the over 60s, it is unlikely that we will be placed into tier two before Christmas,"" he said. It is understandable those on the front line of the NHS would want tighter restrictions - they see the impact of severe Covid first hand. But that is just one part of the equation. Councils in areas where cases are falling are torn - they don't want to see their progress in containing the virus reversed. But the impact on the economy disproportionately affects young people, who are more likely to work in hospitality, and that widens health inequalities. What will the government do? It seems very unlikely many areas will move down a tier. There is certainly a big call to be made about Manchester, which is in tier three but has continued to see progress, after Liverpool was moved down into tier two following lockdown. In the South East, there are areas around London that have rates below the national average, but they are rising. Will the government move them into tier three as a preventative measure, or wait and see if the tighter restrictions in London curbs the rising rates in this part of the country? We are about to find out. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, said there was ""a ring of areas around London - for example, in the home counties - where trusts are alarmed at the rise in infection rates and hospital admissions"". In a statement, he said the government must ""urgently consider"" adding other areas to tier three, where infection rates are ""similarly worrying"". Mr Hopson also said there was ""real concern in many trusts in the northern half of the country about leaving tier three prematurely"". ""It is good news that infection rates are dropping, in some cases significantly,"" he said. ""But we can't afford to let up. As soon as infection rates rise, excess death rates rise too."" He warned hospitals in the north of England still had ""very high levels"" of Covid-19 patients and ""even a small increase"" would ""put those hospitals under significant pressure"". About 99% of England's population are currently in tiers two and three, with only the Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly in tier one. The placing of areas in each tier is reviewed every 14 days. Decisions are based on an examination of coronavirus cases across all age groups and specifically among the over-60s, who are more vulnerable to the virus. Officials also look at whether infection rates are rising or falling in an area and the positivity rate - meaning the number of positive cases detected as a percentage of tests taken - as well as the pressure on the NHS. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'A shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas' It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnsonurged people to keep Christmas celebrations ""short"" and ""small""to reduce the risk of spreading Covid over the festive period. Restrictions will still be relaxed between 23 and 27 December, allowing three households to form a ""Christmas bubble"" and mix indoors and stay overnight. However, in Wales,the law will change to limit bubbles to two households. A joint statement by the governments of the UK, Scotland and Wales urged people to think very carefully before forming a bubble and ""strongly recommended"" people spend Christmas with their own household if possible. In Northern Ireland, First Minister Arlene Foster said the public must take ""all and every precaution"" over the festive period and proposals for further restrictions would be brought forward on Thursday. Home Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Breakfast there would be no changes to the enforcement of measures over Christmas, but that the ""public are part of"" upholding the law and are ""working together"" with the police. This video can not be played England Covid-19 tiers: Laura Foster explains the rules The UK recorded a further 25,161 coronavirus cases on Wednesday, along with 612 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Public Health Wales said that an extra 11,000 positive Covid tests are missingfrom its official figures, meaning cases in Wales in the last week could be twice as high as previously thought. Meanwhile, Minister Nadhim Zahawi, who is in charge of the UK's vaccination rollout, saidmore than 130,000 people were vaccinated in the first week of the programme.

"The head of Hospitality Ulster has said he would prefer a full lockdown over partial restrictions Health officials have proposed a six-week lockdown across NI in a bid to curb the spread of the virus, BBC News NI understands. It is believed a review of the measures would take place after four weeks. Executive ministers are meeting to discuss the plan, brought by Health Minister Robin Swann. It proposes the closure of non-essential retail after Christmas Eve, and hospitality only allowed to offer takeaway services. Close contact services including hairdresser and beauty salons would also have to shut again. It is also understood health officials have proposed essential shops in NI would have to close by 20:00 GMT every night during the first week of a new lockdown. It is believed there could be changes to what is classed as essential retail, and the potential that click-and-collect services would not be permitted. The first week of a fresh lockdown could also see tighter rules on indoor and outdoor gatherings and a ban on people meeting others in private gardens. Health officials have also proposed measures to limit the reopening of schools in January and it's understood a package of interventions will be drawn up by the education and health departments. However any new lockdown restrictions will have to be signed off by the whole executive, which is meeting now to consider Mr Swann's paper. On Thursday, a further 12 Covid-linked deaths were recorded in NI and a further 656 cases of the virus. Hospitality Ulster said a full lockdown may now be required. Colin Neill says the board of Hospitality Ulster is aware of the situation at hospitals Chief executive Colin Neill said his board would support a full lockdown to get the virus under control. Mr Neill accepted a lockdown would have a big impact on the hospitality sector but added  ""what is worse is opening and closing all the time"". ""Every time you have to reopen costs a lot of money and every time you have to close costs a lot of money because of wastage,"" he told BBC's Stephen Nolan Show. ""If we are going for lockdown, then we will support a total lockdown until we get this thing under control,"" he said. ""I think we can all see the situation at our hospitals,"" he said. ""We need to go back to what we did in March and April."" Mr Neill said many within the hospitality sector only remained open so they could earn enough to pay their contribution towards furlough and retain their staff. The new proposals before the executive come amid warnings from health officials that the system is struggling with winter pressures exacerbated by the pandemic. Ministers will have to decide the date of when any new measures would take effect, how long they would last and how strict they would be. They will also assess the latest data from the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser regarding the R-number in NI, which measures the infection rate of the virus. The executive has expressed concerns that the spread of the virus has not reduced following a two-week limited lockdown, and that cases could spike further after the Christmas holidays unless more interventions are introduced. Swann warns virus will cast shadow into January Patient waits 28 hours as hospitals struggle The lockdown, which ended last Friday, saw non-essential retail, close contact services and hospitality largely have to shut - but Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young said evidence showed not enough people had followed the ""stay at home"" guidance. There were queues of ambulances outside Antrim Area Hospital on Tuesday night, with hospitals in Northern Ireland continuing to face severe pressures Ministers are also expected to discuss a decision by England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to strengthen guidance about how people can meet up with families over Christmas. On Wednesday, London and the devolved governments agreed to keep in place a plan to allow households to form ""Christmas bubbles"" from 23 to 27 December. The first and deputy first ministers said they wanted to ensure people in Northern Ireland were not isolated over Christmas, but stressed that ""personal responsibility"" should be a priority for anyone planning to have contact with others. Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she would also bring more details of her new support scheme for pubs that do not serve food, which have been forced to remain closed, to Thursday's executive meeting. It has yet to open, but last month the executiveallocated Â£10.6m in funding to the sector. It was always a case of when, not if, new restrictions would be imposed following the brief reprieve over Christmas. Mr Swann's use of the word ""extreme"" has some Stormont sources believing that we could be looking at a lockdown similar to that initially imposed back in March. It could even be tougher in some respects, with ministers aware a hard, long period of measures is needed in order to get transmission rates down. Expectations and anxieties have been raised yet again. Some businesses - having just reopened last week - will express frustration that they could lose out on important post-Christmas sales if they are told to shut again before New Year's Eve, particularly if extra financial support from Stormont isn't put in place. But the biggest issue ministers have to address is the lack of compliance, and there is a growing fear around the executive table that not enough people are heeding the message any more. Cases of the virus in Northern Ireland have not significantly reduced, despite several periods of restrictions since October. On Wednesday, eight deaths linked to Covid-19 were recorded in Northern Ireland, taking the Department of Health's total to 1,143. There were 510 more positive tests recorded, meaning there have been 59,631 cases overall. Health officials have urged the politicians to act quickly, in light of hospitals facing significant pressures that could increase as NI moves further into the winter flu season.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has extended the furlough scheme for one month until the end of April next year. He said the move would provide ""certainty for millions of jobs and businesses"". It means the government will continue to pay up to 80% of the wages of workers who have been furloughed. Mr Sunak also confirmed he would be extending the government-guaranteed Covid-19 business loan schemes until the end of March. These changes come in the run-up to the next Budget, which the chancellor confirmed would take place on 3 March 2021. The roll-out of vaccinations has provided hope for businesses struggling to get through a winter of stop-start measures to control the virus. But it is likely to be several months before enough of the population has been covered to allow for anything like business as usual. Can I go on furlough and how much will I be paid? Furlough extension buys time as vaccine is rolled out ""Our package of support for businesses and workers continues to be one of the most generous and effective in the world - helping our economy to recover and protecting livelihoods across the country,"" Mr Sunak said. ""We know the premium businesses place on certainty, so it is right that we enable them to plan ahead regardless of the path the virus takes, which is why we're providing certainty and clarity by extending this support."" Holly Muldoon, co-founder of RubyLemon, a UK entertainment and event agency Holly Muldoon is the co-founder of RubyLemon, an entertainment and event staffing agency based in London. She welcomes Mr Sunak's announcement, which will mean her office team can be furloughed for longer, but says it's also a worrying sign. ""It's good to know we've got a bit of support there, but it's a bit devastating. Realistically if it's extended until April, this means we're not going to get back to work until at least May,"" she says. Most of the 1,500 people who work for RubyLemon across the UK are freelancers and performers, who can't be furloughed, and will continue to struggle as they wait for business to restart. ""That's why it's really important that the events industry comes back, as we can't give anyone work,"" Ms Muldoon explained. The move drew criticism from the opposition. Shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said Mr Sunak had ""waited until the last possible minute to act, leaving businesses in the dark with less than 24 hours before they have to issue redundancy notices"". She added: ""Rishi Sunak's irresponsible, last-minute decision-making has left the UK with the worst recession of any major economy."" But CBI chief economist Rain Newton-Smith said the package would ""bring some much-needed certainty and respite"" for businesses. ""Stable employer contributions and an extension to the Job Retention Scheme until the end of April will mean the scheme continues to protect people's livelihoods,"" she added. ""And with cashflow difficulties still at the forefront of the minds of many business owners, continued access to government-backed loans through to spring will bring great comfort."" Industry body UKHospitality said the extension to the furlough scheme was ""welcome"", but it still has grave concerns. ""With yet more of the country having been served notice of moving into tighter restrictions and 72,500 of Britain's 110,00 licensed premises unable to open and a further 12,500 wet led venues with little chance of reopening, more will be needed to safeguard jobs and businesses in a sector being seemingly singled out to bear the brunt of Covid measures,"" said UKHospitality's chief executive Kate Nicholls. ""Without additional business support to accompany this extension, there will inevitably be more widespread business failures and job losses."" The government will continue to pay up to 80% of the salary of employees for hours not worked until the end of April, with a cap of Â£2,500 a month. Employers will only be required to pay the wages, National Insurance (NI) contributions and pensions for hours worked, as well as NI contributions and pensions for hours not worked. The eligibility criteria for the UK-wide scheme will remain unchanged and these changes will continue to apply to all devolved administrations, the government said. The extension of the furlough scheme into April will help some firms - but only to pay wages. Firms urgently need further cash to pay rent, suppliers and energy bills. The Bank of England estimated last week that the private sector as a whole has Â£180bn less cash coming in this financial year than it needs to cover costs. Extending availability of emergency loans by two months may help ease that huge squeeze on cash flow. But it's not clear more debt is the answer. The National Audit Office has estimated that up to Â£26bn of the Â£43bn lent in Bounce Back Loans may not be paid back. There's now growing pressure to offer much more in grants, not loans, to stop a bleak Christmas ruining thousands of normally healthy businesses in the new year. The risk is stark: if you ban two-thirds of the country from meeting anyone from another household indoors eight days before Christmas, tens of thousands of pubs, restaurants and hotels could go under. The furlough scheme is officially known as the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. So far, it has supported 9.6 million jobs across the UK, with more than one million businesses using it. Businesses will also have until the end of March to access the Bounce Back Loan Scheme, Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme, and the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme. These had been due to close at the end of January. To date, they have already provided more than Â£68bn in guaranteed loans to firms. Hospitality, leisure and retail providers have been particularly severely affected by months of changing regulations, sharply reducing their revenues. On Thursday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock announcedmore parts of south-eastern England would move into tier three, the strictest level of measures. London was moved to tier three on Wednesday.

"Wicker Riverside development in Sheffield The government has announced a new Â£30m fund to help pay for the installation of fire alarms in high-rise buildings with dangerous cladding. The money will reduce the need for round-the-clock fire patrols known as 'waking watch'. Three years since the Grenfell Tower fire, hundreds of buildings across the UK still have 24-hour safety patrols. Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said the money will ""help relieve financial pressure on residents"". Waking watches were introduced by the National Fire Chiefs Council as a temporary measure to keep residents safe but some buildings have had wardens in place for years costing leaseholders tens of thousands of pounds every month. Recent guidance from the Council advised building owners should move to install common fire alarm systems as quickly as possible to reduce or remove the need for the 24-hour warden patrols. Mr Jenrick said ""rip-off waking watch costs"" were bringing misery to leaseholders in tower blocks with cladding problems and the new fund will ""make a real difference to worried leaseholders"" and ""ensure they are safe"". 'Fire patrols at our flats cost us Â£500,000' No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs Safety checks eased to help flat owners 'in limbo' It comes as residentstold the BBCthey were paying thousands of pounds for fire wardens to patrol their blocks. Ritu Saha, who lives in Bromley, south-east London, said patrols had cost her more than Â£300 a month for the last three years, totalling Â£11,700, and she couldn't bear the cost much longer. Campaigners representing residents said the fund was ""a glimmer of light in the ongoing uncertainty and dark times that our residents face"". But in a statement welcoming the announcement, the Manchester and Liverpool Cladiators said: ""After months of waiting for a full and fair solution, we hoped for more detail and more funding."" The group said it had calculated that the fund would cover up to 300 buildings, adding: ""Given there are up to 1,000 buildings in the country, where a Waking Watch is in place, we remain concerned that this new funding will help less than a third of the residents affected. ""Many will be left unable to benefit from this announcement. In effect, another safety lottery has been created."" The government says leaseholders have on average been paying Â£137 per month for the patrols, and will collectively save over Â£3m per month, when the fund will opens in January. Immediate emergency support will also be provided toWicker Riverside Apartments in Sheffield. Thirty five families, who were recently evacuated from the building because of fire safely faults, should be able to return to their homes before Christmas. A six-month extension to the deadline for building owners to complete their applications to the government's Â£1bn Building Safety Fund (BSF) has also been announced, with a new deadline for submissions of 30 June 2021. The BSF was set up to pay for the removal of unsafe combustible cladding on buildings that are 18 metres or higher. Mr Jenrick also said he will be writing to Trading Standards to ask them to use their powers to investigate evidence of disproportionate charges for waking watch.

'Fire patrols at our flats cost us Â£500,000' No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs Safety checks eased to help flat owners 'in limbo' It comes as residentstold the BBCthey were paying thousands of pounds for fire wardens to patrol their blocks. Ritu Saha, who lives in Bromley, south-east London, said patrols had cost her more than Â£300 a month for the last three years, totalling Â£11,700, and she couldn't bear the cost much longer. Campaigners representing residents said the fund was ""a glimmer of light in the ongoing uncertainty and dark times that our residents face"". But in a statement welcoming the announcement, the Manchester and Liverpool Cladiators said: ""After months of waiting for a full and fair solution, we hoped for more detail and more funding."" The group said it had calculated that the fund would cover up to 300 buildings, adding: ""Given there are up to 1,000 buildings in the country, where a Waking Watch is in place, we remain concerned that this new funding will help less than a third of the residents affected. ""Many will be left unable to benefit from this announcement. In effect, another safety lottery has been created."" The government says leaseholders have on average been paying Â£137 per month for the patrols, and will collectively save over Â£3m per month, when the fund will opens in January. Immediate emergency support will also be provided toWicker Riverside Apartments in Sheffield. Thirty five families, who were recently evacuated from the building because of fire safely faults, should be able to return to their homes before Christmas. A six-month extension to the deadline for building owners to complete their applications to the government's Â£1bn Building Safety Fund (BSF) has also been announced, with a new deadline for submissions of 30 June 2021. The BSF was set up to pay for the removal of unsafe combustible cladding on buildings that are 18 metres or higher. Mr Jenrick also said he will be writing to Trading Standards to ask them to use their powers to investigate evidence of disproportionate charges for waking watch.

"Mick and Debbie Thompson hope next Christmas will look more like life before the pandemic With infections rising and worries about the festive period growing, some families have decided Christmas isn't worth the risk and are either cancelling their plans or making last-minute changes. Mick Thompson is still annoyed about placing third with his wife, Debbie, in the family Zoom quiz at the weekend. Perhaps that's an understatement - ""quite distraught"" is how he puts it. But when the initial red mist cleared, the pair had to address another issue that came up during the call: the annual Boxing Day get-together. Mick's family is one of hundreds across the country weighing up whether or not to go ahead with plans over Christmas, amid a growing number of coronavirus infections across the UK. The usual restrictions on social contact are being relaxed between 23 and 27 December, allowing up to three households to mix indoors over the five-day period. But Mick and Debbie still decided to call off the Boxing Day buffet at their home in Chineham, Hampshire, this week. ""Everyone was saying 'I'll bring desserts' and 'I'll bring this' and 'I'll bring that',"" says Mick, 59, who owns a travel PR company. ""But over the last couple of days... there's been so much talk about this Christmas relaxation that I think for one year only, the sensible thing to do is just not to bother. We can do it any old time, you know?"" He and Debbie broke the news to her sisters in a text message (a method he recommends, by the way, because ""you don't get the opportunity to get emotional on the phone""). ""What I'm worried about is that I could be asymptomatic, catching it from somebody else, and then spreading it afterwards. My conscience wouldn't let me do that,"" he says. ""They said that they understood and didn't want to put us under any pressure."" UK Christmas rules stay but nations toughen advice Seeing my family at Christmas 'not worth the risk' What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? More than 200 miles away in Lancashire, Nicole Cobb, 30, had to have the same conversation with her family. She, her partner and children usually spend the festive period flitting between her relatives' homes in Aberdeen. This year they had planned a gathering within the relaxed rules but, given that her job as a youth and family worker involves meeting so many people, she decided it was not worth the risk of unknowingly passing on the virus. She made the ""difficult decision"" just before the second national lockdown was introduced in England last month. Nicole says her elderly gran is one of her closest family members ""There is that thought that my gran's older and am I missing a special Christmas with her?"" she says, adding that she would love to also see her sister, who is having chemotherapy, and her new niece. Although she'll miss seeing her family, she is also looking forward to a ""much more relaxed"" Christmas at home. ""There's no pressure to run around this year,"" she laughs. Instead, the family will do a virtual quiz on Christmas Day and will meet up next year. ""If you've got the family around the table, it doesn't need to be 25 December, it can be any date that you pick. It's just about getting together as family, isn't it?"" James Downs, 31, from Cambridge, says he would rather find alternative things to do on Christmas Day ""than face the idea of risking my loved ones"". He works in mental health policy but also teaches dance and yoga, so also comes into contact with a lot of people. He had plans to go to to Cardiff to see his family, including his clinically vulnerable dad, but he's called them off. ""The idea of giving my dad the virus and him being very unwell is something I'm not prepared to risk for the sake of a few months, by which time he might have the vaccine,"" he explains. He says anyone worried about having difficult conversations with family members should focus on ""the reasons why you might not want to meet this year - because you care about and love them"". James had been looking forward to spending time with his mum over Christmas On Wednesday,the four UK nations agreed that restrictions will still be relaxedbetween 23 and 27 December, but guidance would be strengthened. Boris Johnson warned ""a smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas"", saying people should ""think hard"" before meeting friends and family. Three households will still be able to meet - apart from in Wales where a law change will allow just two households. And in Scotland people are being asked to meet on just one of the five days. An announcement on Northern Ireland is expected on Thursday. A YouGov survey this week suggested 57% of people think the plans to relax coronavirus rules over Christmas should be scrapped. Around 31% of the 3,856 adults who were asked said the easing should go ahead as planned, and 12% said they were unsure. Diva Fanning, 71, a retired midwife in Herefordshire, always looks forward to spending time over Christmas with her daughters, no matter how grown up they are. She had been planning to host her daughters and their families on Boxing Day. But after a friend told her that a man in her local village had died from coronavirus following a get-together - and with infection rates rising - she decided to change course. ""I didn't want to say 'I'm not doing it' because I didn't want to sound like a killjoy, so I just said 'perhaps it's best',"" she says. In any case, she and her husband will still host one daughter who is in her bubble, and can see other family members outside. ""It wasn't a difficult conversation really. It came together on its own... everybody was thinking the same anyway,"" she says.  ""We've all come to that agreement that it's silly, really, to take the risk."" Diva Fanning's Boxing Day this year will be a bit quieter than usual Back in Chineham, Mick and Debbie will spend Christmas and Boxing Day at home with the dogs. The whole family plans to meet up in the spring, instead. ""I'm very disappointed, but I think it's the only sensible thing to do,"" he says. Until then, another virtual quiz on Christmas Day will have to suffice - and he's got some swotting up to do. ""One of my sister-in-law's sons and his girlfriend put the quiz together and all the oldies sit round and compete, it's quite good fun,"" he says. ""We normally win.""

"Liz Truss says ""right-thinking people"" must fight for ""fairness"" The government is promising to focus more on people's social class and individual ""character"", as it overhauls its equality policy. Equalities minister Liz Truss said the discrimination debate should not focus solely on race, religion, sexual orientation and disability. Discussion had too often been dominated by ""fashion"" and not ""facts"", she said. Labour accused Ms Truss of ""gratuitous provocation"" and ignoring the ""devastating impact"" of discrimination. The government is launching an Equality Data Programme to gather information on people's backgrounds, social mobility and inequality between regions. Racial disparities report pushed back into 2021 'Unconscious bias training' scrapped by ministers Speaking at the Centre for Policy Studies think tank, Ms Truss said: ""To make our society more equal, we need the equality debate to be led by facts, not by fashion. ""Time and time again, we see politicians making their own evidence-free judgements."" She also said discussion had ""been dominated by a small number of unrepresentative voices, and by those who believe people are defined by their protected characteristic and not by their individual character"". The Equalities and Human Rights Commissionlists protected characteristics,external- over which it is illegal to discriminate - as age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation. Ms Truss argued that data based solely on these characteristics is not fit for purpose when it comes to setting equality policy. The equalities minister said: ""Underlying this [approach] is the soft bigotry of low expectations, where people from certain backgrounds are never expected or considered able enough to reach high standards. ""This diminishes individual humanity and dignity, because when you choose on the basis of protected characteristics, you end up excluding people."" Ms Truss added that it was ""appalling"" that pregnant women suffer discrimination at work"", that women may ""be encouraged to dress in a certain way to get ahead"", and that ""some employers overlook the capabilities of people with disabilities"". Debates on equality must be ""rooted"" in ""real concerns people face"", she said, adding: ""It is our duty to deliver, because if right-thinking people do not lead the fight for fairness, then it will be led by those whose ideas do not work."" For Labour, shadow equalities minister Marsha de Cordova said: ""This is gratuitous provocation from a government that consistently refuses to face up to its responsibilities and the widening inequality it has caused. ""When Liz Truss dismisses 'fashionable' causes, she actually dismisses the devastating impact of discrimination and unfairness in people's day-to-day lives."" Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, a racial equality think tank, said: ""Liz Truss's attempts to 'overhaul' the equalities work in the UK is nothing short of a whitewashing of British history and its relationship with race."" She also said: ""It is time that equalities ministers in this government are held accountable for their words."" The government announced on Wednesday that its report into racial inequality will be delayed until next year, citing problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic. It is looking at health, education and criminal justice, but also ""wider inequalities"" such as issues faced by working-class white boys.

"The future of the UK's economy is ""unusually uncertain"", the Bank of England has said, as it held interest rates at record lows. It said new coronavirus vaccines boded well for long-term growth, but that a recent jump in cases would drag on the recovery. Uncertainty over the future UK-EU trading relationship also clouded the outlook, it added. The central bank held rates 0.1% and left its stimulus programme unchanged. ""The outlook for the economy remains unusually uncertain,"" the Bank said. ""It depends on the evolution of the pandemic and measures taken to protect public health, as well as the nature of, and transition to, the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom."" Clothing and food prices fall in November lockdown Hospitality worst-hit as unemployment rises again UK growth slows again in October as rebound stalls The Office for Budgetary Responsibility, the government's independent forecaster, predicts the UK economy will shrink by 11.3% this year - the biggest decline in 300 years. It expects unemployment to peak at 9.7%. The Bank said the successful trialling of some Covid vaccines and plans to roll them out next year were likely to ""reduce the downside risks to the economic outlook"". However, it said recent global activity had been affected by the increase in Covid cases and re-imposition of tougher than expected restrictions. ""The successful rollout of vaccines should support the gradual removal of restrictions and rebound in activity,"" it said, ""although it is less clear how this prospect will affect the immediate economic behaviour of households and businesses."" At 0.3% in November, inflation remains a long way below the central bank's 2% target. However, it said it was ready to accept inflation above 2% if a no-deal Brexit caused sterling to fall sharply, pushing up prices of imports. The Bank also said it planned to keep the pace of its purchases of British government bonds broadly unchanged in early 2021 as it tries to shore up the economy. But it said it was ready to increase them again if the outlook soured. Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Macroeconomics said this was the ""clearest indication yet that it would ease monetary policy further, in the event of no-deal"".

"British Airways has cancelled services to more than 15 long-haul destinations next year. The news comes as many airlines cut staff and drop routes as passengers cut travel amid the pandemic. Routes to cities in North America such as Pittsburgh, Calgary and Charleston have gone, alongside flights to Seoul, Kuala Lumpur and Osaka. The Seychelles, a popular winter holiday destination, has also been removed. Muscat, Jeddah and Abu Dhabi routes are axed, and BA will also temporarily suspend flights to Sydney, Bangkok and San Jose during the summer of 2021. Passengers have contacted the BBC to say they have had trips cancelled in 2021 and are waiting for advice from BA on whether they will receive a refund or a flight voucher. British Airways owner cuts flight numbers again BA boss replaced amid industry's 'worst crisis' BA said it was sorry and that customers on cancelled flights are entitled to a full refund. Like other airlines, the pandemic meant global travel restrictions had forced it to operate a reduced and dynamic schedule, it said. It advised customers on affected flights to check the BA website for the latest flight information. BA has said previously that the pandemic has hit it harder than anything ever before, with losses that outstrip the financial crisis of 2008 and the September 2001 terror attacks on the World Trade Center in New York. Losses totalled almost Â£4bn in the first half of this year. The airline controversially made about 10,000 staff redundant in the summer, as it fought to save money and limit burning through cash reserves as passenger numbers collapsed. Previously, BA has said it does not expect international travel to return to pre-pandemic levels until 2023.

"Boris Johnson on a call with Ursula von der Leyen Talks to reach a post-Brexit trade deal are in a ""serious situation"", Boris Johnson said after a call with the EU Commission head Ursula von der Leyen. He warned that ""time was short"" and that a no deal scenario was ""very likely"" unless the EU position changed ""substantially"". Mrs von der Leyen said it would be ""very challenging"" to bridge the ""big differences"", particularly on fish. However, she also welcomed ""substantial progress on many issues"". Talks in Brussels will continue on Friday, with two weeks to go before the UK leaves EU trading rules. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Will Brexit talks follow the familiar script? In a statement issued after the phone call, No 10 said: ""He [Mr Johnson] said that we were making every effort to accommodate reasonable EU requests on the level playing field, but even though the gap had narrowed some fundamental areas remained difficult. ""On fisheries he stressed that the UK could not accept a situation where it was the only sovereign country in the world not to be able to control access to its own waters for an extended period and to be faced with fisheries quotas which hugely disadvantaged its own industry. ""The EU's position in this area was simply not reasonable and if there was to be an agreement it needed to shift significantly."" The UK's chief negotiator David Frost echoed the prime minister's tone,tweeting,external: ""The situation in our talks with the EU is very serious tonight. Progress seems blocked and time is running out."" European Parliament leaders have set Sunday as a deadline for them to see the text of any deal agreed by the negotiating teams. The senior MEPs said they would ""not be rushed"" into approving an agreement at their end, and would have to see the text by the end of the week if they were to sign it off by 31 December. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The call came after minister Michael Gove warned talks may go on until after Christmas. He said that while Christmas Day would be ""sacrosanct"", it was possible that Parliament could be recalled to approve a Brexit deal. Parliament closed for the Christmas break on Thursday evening. Mr Gove also said that although the European Parliament has said it would not have time to ratify a deal if it was not concluded by Sunday, they could ""apply provisional application of the treaty"". This video can not be played Michael Gove said Brexit talks 'may go on after Christmas' He told the Commons Brexit Committee the ""most likely outcome"" was that the current transition period would end on December 31 without a deal. Asked how likely a deal is, he replied ""I think, regrettably, the chances are more likely that we won't secure an agreement. So at the moment less than 50%."" It's long been predicted that competition rules and fishing would be the last areas where compromise is found. For Boris Johnson's government, being tied to EU regulations in perpetuity defeats the purpose of Brexit and makes a mockery of ""taking back control"". For the European Union, it will not allow its internal market to be undermined by offering the UK unfair access. Ursula von der Leyen has claimed the two sides have made a significant step by agreeing to a ""strong mechanism"" to ensure neither side lowers their environmental or social standards, but are yet to agree on how each could diverge from these levels in the future. A good number of EU diplomats were quietly confident it was a matter of when, not if, EU access to UK fishing waters could be sorted. But it's proving trickier than they thought. Sources tell me that Michel Barnier explained to EU ambassadors at the start of this week that if fishing is resolved, then a wider deal would quickly fall into place. But there's no sign of a meeting of minds on fish, with the EU warning openly it may prove to be impossible. But let's remember this is the most intense of negotiations and that every public proclamation from London or Brussels will be chosen to strengthening their respective hands in what are the final days and hours of talks. Although there is only 14 days until the deadline, Mr Gove said he believed there was enough time for the necessary legislation to pass before 31 December ""to give businesses legal certainty"". But a number of opposition MPs raised issues already facing businesses waiting to discover the outcome of talks. One Welsh MP, Jonathan Edwards, said: ""I was contacted late last night by a businessman in my constituency who is reliant on imports from the continent and he can't find a haulage firm willing to carriage on his behalf due to the current delays at the ports. ""He's very concerned unless this issue was resolved his business would not survive into the new year."" Mr Gove said he would get in touch with the business concerned.

"A host of European leaders are self-isolating after the French President, Emmanuel Macron, tested positive for Covid-19. Mr Macron, 42, will self-isolate for seven days while working remotely, the ElysÃ©e Palace said in a statement. The French president attended a number of high-profile events in recent days, including an EU summit. Following his diagnosis several other European leaders, including the Spanish PM, said they would self-isolate. ""The President of the Republic has been diagnosed positive for Covid-19 today,"" the ElysÃ©e said on Thursday morning. The diagnosis was made following a ""test performed at the onset of the first symptoms"", the statement added. The French president's wife Brigitte Macron, who is 67, is self-isolating but has no symptoms. It is not yet known how Mr Macron caught the virus but his office said it was identifying any recent close contacts he has had. How are France and other European countries tackling the pandemic? French culture takes centre stage in Covid protest The meteoric rise of France's youngest president On Tuesday President Macron hosted French parliamentary heads and on Monday members of the intergovernmental group the OECD. Last week he, along with almost every other EU leader, attended a summit in Brussels. Among those going into self-isolation areEuropean Council chief Charles Michel, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchezandOECD Secretary-General Angel GurrÃ­a, all of whom met President Macron this week. Mr Sanchez has tested negative but, like Mr Macron, will work remotely from quarantine. Portuguese Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa, 59, has cancelled all official trips, and is isolating and awaiting test results, after a working lunch in Paris with President Macron on Wednesday. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De CrooandLuxembourg's Prime Minister Xavier Betteltoo are self-isolating following contact with the French president. In a statement Mr Bettel wished Mr Macron a ""speedy recovery"". Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martinhas tested negative for Covid-19 but will limit his contacts, a spokesperson said. President Macron (L) met Spanish PM Pedro SÃ¡nchez on Monday FrenchPrime Minister Jean Castex, 55, andparliamentary speaker Richard Ferrand, 58, are also self-isolating, their offices confirmed. Mr Castex, who is not showing any symptoms and has tested negative, was due to introduce the government's Covid vaccination policy in the Senate on Thursday - now Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran is doing it instead. France this week ended a six-week national lockdown, replacing the measure with a curfew to help deal with soaring cases. Mr Macron last week attended a two-day European Council heads of state summit, finishing on Friday. This video can not be played Can you become immune to coronavirus? However, the French president is considered to have become potentially contagious as of Monday evening, a senior EU official told the BBC. All sanitary measures were observed during last week's meeting and the council has not been informed of any other participants testing positive, the source added. German Chancellor Angela Merkel wore a mask at the summit and tested negative for the virus on Tuesday, German officials said after hearing the news about President Macron. A French presidential spokeswoman confirmed that all of Mr Macron's forthcoming trips, including a scheduled visit to Lebanon on 22 December, had been cancelled. The ElysÃ©e is doing everything to project an image of business as usual.  Already President Macron is back at work, and a meeting with his finance and foreign ministers has gone ahead as planned - though with the visitors in an adjacent room. It's being emphasised that the workings of government have already been radically adapted for Covid - with video conferences now the norm - so unless the president takes a turn for the worse no-one will notice much of a difference. And meanwhile - as with any ordinary citizen - the trace-and-test system has kicked in, and numerous dignitaries foreign and domestic have been told the bad news that they have to self-isolate.

"This video can not be played 'I played in front of 20,000 people and don't remember' - Hughes More former rugby players have joined the legal process against the game's authorities for alleged negligence. Former Wales Under-20 centre Adam Hughes, 30, is the youngest to claim he has suffered permanent brain damage. Ex-England Under-21 back row Neil Spence is also one of those involved while four former England and Wales players remain anonymous. Legal action is being prepared against the Rugby Football Union (RFU), Wales Rugby Union (WRU) and World Rugby. It means there are now nine players included in preparing the action - although the law firm representing the group says more than 100 players have come forward. Those additional players will now be tested for early onset dementia and their details added to the potential claim involving the existing nine when it is ready. A letter of claim, setting out their intention to sue, was delivered to the governing bodies on Thursday. Rugby and concussion: Key questions the sport faces World Cup winner Merchant has lower cognitive capacity Former Clermont player Cudmore backing dementia-claim group Ex-Wales Under-20 centre Hughes on lost memories In response, the RFU, WRU and World Rugby have issued a joint statement to confirm they have received the letter, and are ""deeply saddened"" to hear personal accounts from the players. They also say player welfare is taken ""extremely seriously"" and it ""continues to be our number one priority"". World Rugby chairman and former England captainSir Bill Beaumont said in an open letter,externalhis ""thoughts are with"" those who are struggling and that the organisation will ""continue to welcome"" the views of former players. He added the area of concussion is ""extremely complex"" but that as ""the science continues to evolve"" rugby will ""evolve with it"". Every member of the group of nine, including England's World Cup-winning hooker Steve Thompson, has recently been diagnosed with early signs of dementia. The former players say repeated blows to the head are to blame. Spence says he used to be ""the fun guy at the party"" but that his condition has ""taken my personality"". ""If I knew I was going to feel like this I wouldn't have signed up,"" Spence told BBC Sport. ""We knew we were signing up to broken arms, broken legs and knee replacements, but not being neurologically impaired and a degenerative disease. ""I still love the game, and what we are trying to get from this is ideally some change. The change should be potentially limiting some contact during the training."" Meanwhile, 42-year-old Thompson played in every England match when they won the 2003 World Cup, but says: ""I can't remember any of those games. It's frightening."" This video can not be played I can't remember England games at World Cup, says 2003 winner Thompson It is the first legal move of its kind in world rugby and, if successful, could change the way the game is played. Rylands Law, which is representing the group, says the risks of concussion injuries were ""known and foreseeable"", and list 24 alleged failures on the part of World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU. ""We know senior figures in the game have been discussing the issue of head injuries since the 1970s, and yet here we are, more than 40 years later, with so many players, and at such an early stage in their lives, finding themselves in this awful position,"" said Richard Boardman of Rylands Law. ""I sincerely hope World Rugby, RFU and WRU will now face up to their responsibilities."" Meanwhile NFL medical experts say they are in regular communication with rugby authorities about how to reduce concussion in the sport. NFL chief medical officer Dr Allen Sills says his sport is trying to ""share knowledge in a more rapid fashion"" with World Rugby and other contact sports. In 2011, theNFL paid out Â£700m to former players who had suffered brain damage. ""We do share regularly with each others sporting groups across the world,"" Sills told the BBC. ""If there are silver linings with the Covid-19 situation, I would say that this has strengthened our communication further."" Sills says there are some differences with technique and training between American football and rugby union, but admits the internal damage can be similar because ""the human body is the same the world over"". ""We talk at least every couple of weeks with World Rugby, Australian Football, and a number of these other contact sports, and we're sharing the learnings that we have,"" he added. ""We share what we're finding in our research, we share what our rules changes are and we're learning from each other and I think we all share the same goal."" Each player to have come forward so far has been diagnosed by neurologists at King's College London with early onset dementia and probable Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is the disease discovered by Dr Bennet Omalu in American football player Mike Webster, and the subject of the film Concussion starring Will Smith. In 2011, a group of former American football players started a class action against the NFL and won a settlement worth about $1bn (Â£700m). CTE can develop when the brain is subjected to numerous small blows or rapid movements - sometimes known as sub-concussions - and is associated with symptoms such as memory loss, depression and progressive dementia.

"Diagnostic tests fell dramatically in England during the first six months of the pandemic Millions of people missed out on potentially life-saving scans when non-Covid-19 NHS services almost ground to a halt this year, analysis shows. In England, at least 4.4 million fewer scans were performed between April and September this year compared to the same period in 2019. One in seven people are now waiting more than three months for a scan as the NHS attempts to clear the backlog. NHS England says some services are now back to the same levels as last year. But professional bodies and Cancer Research UK say the period of inactivity has left a backlog that could leave a swathe of people presenting at hospital in a worsened condition. ""Those patients could be diagnosed with a more aggressive, later-stage cancer,"" said Jody Moffatt, head of early diagnosis for Cancer Research UK. ""There is a cohort of patients out there that have not been diagnosed yet - and who knows what state they will be in when they are."" Former social worker Toni Cunnington had an ultrasound cancelled in March Toni Cunnington, a former social intervention worker and mother of four, had an MRI scan at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust cancelled in March, even though she suspected she had cancer due to a genetic condition. She is now undergoing aggressive chemotherapy for a stage-four lymphoma. ""The symptoms I've had mostly from January to now have been horrific,"" said Toni, 34, who believes her condition would not have deteriorated as much if her cancer had been caught earlier. Earlier in November she had to have white blood cells drained from her lungs. She now spends most of her time in a wheelchair as the chemotherapy leaves her weak. While she is grateful for the NHS, she says she is concerned potential cancer patients are being considered a low priority during the crisis. ""I feel like my life isn't worth as much as a Covid patient,"" she said. ""I just don't want to leave my children and I don't want to die. I'm not ready to die, I just really wish it was caught early.""

SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SYMPTOMS:85% of patients have one of these three symptoms JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) and the British Institute for Radiology (BIR) say the fall in the number of scans was because trusts were told to cancel non-essential appointments at the end of March. But they say the backlog created by the virus has ""exacerbated"" issues linked to a lack of scanners in the UK, as well as a shortfall of 6,000 radiologists and radiographers in the profession. Appointments had to be limited at smaller hospitals with only one MRI scanner, an RCR spokesman said, as the machines had to be kept free for coronavirus patients. Radiologists were also pulled off wards to help in other parts of the hospital, he said. The BBC Shared Data Unit analysed the number of scans carried out by 103 hospital trusts across England as well as the waiting times for diagnostics across the home nations. While scans, including MRI, CT and ultrasound, dropped by a third overall in England during the six-month period between April and September - the largest reductions were felt in the North West and London. Trusts in the capital carried out 39% less scans than the previous year compared to a 26% drop in the South East. In the North West, one in three patients was waiting more than six weeks for a scan in October, compared to one in five in the South East. Some individual hospitals reduced scans considerably more than others, particularly small private facilities. Dorset Healthcare University hospital and Manchester University hospital saw the largest drops at NHS facilities - 70% and 64% respectively. Waiting lists and waiting times across the home nations also grew during the first six months of the pandemic. NHS guidance in England and Scotland states patients should receive a scan within six weeks of referral. In Scotland, 15,000 patients had waited for more than six weeks according to a snapshot in September 2019. This year, the figure was closer to 48,000, with similar rises experienced in Wales and Northern Ireland. Dr William Ramsden said the pandemic had 'exacerbated' the shortage in radiology staff The overall number of people on the waiting list for one of the 15 main diagnostic tests in England increased by 250,000 to 1.27 million. Vice-president of the RCR, Dr William Ramsden, said: ""The trouble is, because of our capacity issues, because of our workforce issues, we can't get through the work as fast as we'd like."" Areport by former national cancer director,externalProf Sir Mike Richards last year said the NHS was in need of 2,000 more radiologists and needed to increase its base of CT and MRI scanners, many of which were aging and in need of regular maintenance.

An NHS England spokesman said, despite rising Covid-19 hospitalisations, CT scans were now back to the same levels as last year.

"A total of 270 people died in the Lockerbie bombing on 21 December 1988 The US will soon announce charges against a Libyan suspected of making the bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988, US media say. Prosecutors will soon seek the extradition of Abu Agila Mohammad Masud to stand trial in the US, reports say. He is currently being held in Libya, according to the Wall Street Journal. This has not been confirmed by the Libyan authorities. The blast on board a Boeing 747 over the Scottish town left 270 people dead. Most of the victims on board the flight from London to New York were American citizens. Eleven people on the ground were also killed. It remains the deadliest terrorist incident ever to have taken place on British soil. The town scarred by Pan Am flight 103 Wreaths laid to mark Lockerbie bombing 30th anniversary Timeline: Lockerbie bombing Libyan national Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was the only man convicted, in 2001, over the bombing. Megrahi, who always proclaimed his innocence, launched two appeals against his 27-year sentence, one was unsuccessful and the other was abandoned. Megrahi was released from prison in Scotland and allowed to return to Libya on compassionate grounds in 2009 after it emerged that he had terminal cancer. He died three years later. A Scottish court is now considering a posthumous appealagainst his conviction by his family. This video can not be played The BBC's Mike Wooldridge reports on the life of Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi The US Department of Justice is expected to unseal a criminal complaint against Abu Agila Mohammad Masud in the coming days, the Wall Street Journal reports, quoting senior department officials. It says this will open a new chapter in one of the world's longest and most sprawling terrorism investigations. The new charges are expected to be announced by outgoing US attorney-general, William Barr. He held the same position when the US announced its first charges against Megrahi and another Libyan suspect, later acquitted, in 1991. ""We will not rest until all those responsible are brought to justice. We have no higher priority,"" Mr Barr said at the time. The Wall Street Journal reports that Mr Masud is being held in Libya, although the New York Times says his exact whereabouts are unknown. But it adds that he was jailed in Libya at one point for unrelated crimes. Mr Masud is alleged to have been a top bomb-maker for late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Neither the US justice department nor the Libyan authorities have commented on the issue. Journalist Ken Dornstein, whose brother David was on board the Pan Am plane, went to Libya to track down Mr Masud as part of a 2015 TV documentary by US network PBS called My Brother's Bomber. This video can not be played Ken Dornstein on how he tracked down new Lockerbie suspects He told the BBC at the time that the Libyan national was ""a mystery figure"" who was named in the initial investigation and ""was said to have been a technical expert"". The documentary alleged that Mr Masud had also been linked to a bombing at a disco in West Berlin in 1986, which killed three people. It also reported that he was imprisoned in Libya over his role in the 2011 uprising that ousted Gaddafi. Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent The images from Lockerbie were searing. The jumbo jet's shattered nose, resting on its side in a Scottish field. The disaster became known, simply, as Lockerbie - by far the worst act of terrorism the UK had ever seen. It spawned any number of theories about who was responsible, with fingers pointing, at one time or another, at Iran, Syria, Palestinian militants and, finally, Libya. The most persistent of those theories is that Iran was bent on revenge after one of its civilian airliners, Iran Air 655, was brought down over the Persian Gulf by a surface-to-air missile, fired in error by an American warship just five months earlier. Iran, it was said, employed the services of bomb-makers from the Palestinian militant group, the PFLP-GC. British officials have never believed this version of events and remain convinced Lockerbie was the work of Libyan agents, working under orders from the country's former dictator, Muammar Gaddafi. News that the US authorities are on the verge of unveiling charges against a second Libyan, someone whose name was mentioned in the original investigation, would seem to bolster this belief. It could, finally, lay other theories to rest. If the US case against Mr Masud is based on a confession made to Libyan interrogators in 2012 and handed over to the Scottish authorities in 2017, as reported by the Wall Street Journal, then it could also affect legal proceedings in Scotland. A third, posthumous appeal against Abdelbaset al-Megrahi's 2001 conviction began at the High Court in Edinburgh last month. US and British investigators indicted Megrahi in 1991 but he was not handed over by the Libyans until April 1999. May 2000- A special trial under Scots law starts on neutral ground at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands. 31 January 2001- Former Libyan intelligence officer Megrahi is found guilty of mass murder and jailed for life with a minimum term of 27 years. March 2002- Megrahi loses an appeal against his conviction. September 2003- The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) is asked to investigate Megrahi's conviction. June 2007- The SCCRC recommends that Megrahi is granted a second appeal against his conviction. 18 August 2009- Megrahi's move to drop his second appeal is accepted by judges at The High Court in Edinburgh. 20 August 2009- Megrahi, who has terminal prostate cancer,is released from prison on compassionate grounds,external. May 2012- Megrahi dies at his home in Tripoli, aged 60. July 2015- Scottish judges rule that relatives of the Lockerbie bombing victims shouldnot be allowed to pursue an appealon Megrahi's behalf. Courts had previously ruled that only next of kin could proceed with a posthumous application. July 2017- Megrahi's familylaunched a new bid to appeal against his conviction.

"This video can not be played Friends and family line the street in an emotional homecoming A man who was given ""almost zero"" chances of surviving after contracting Covid-19 has spoken of how his world has been ""turned upside down"". Mal Martin, 58, was taken to Bridgend's Princess of Wales Hospital in March, a week after ""feeling unwell"" and placed on a ventilator for 61 days. His wife and children even said their goodbyes before he was put into an induced coma. But Mr Martin's recovery was described by doctors as a ""miracle"". 'My husband's chances are almost zero they told me' Dad 'still with us' despite slim survival hope ""Basically it's turned my world upside down but at the same time, I'm getting stronger,"" he told BBC Radio 4'sTodayprogramme. ""I can only walk so far, I'm having lots of dizziness, I've got problems with my lungs, I've got major problems with my kidneys. On Mal Martin's seventh day in hospital, his family were told to prepare for the worst ""My kidneys are only running at 12% at the moment and it's just been horrific really. I need to either go on dialysis for the rest of my life, or a kidney transplant. ""I've lost vision in my right eye which I'll never get back and I've had amputations on my hands - I've lost my thumb from on my one hand and I've lost a forefinger and a half a finger and my thumb is going to come off my right hand."" Mr Martin was taken to hospital just before the UK went into a national lockdown in March. This video can not be played Sue Martin spoke to the BBC about Mal in April Mr Martin is diabetic, which is genetic, not life-style related. Four years ago he'd had a heart attack and had three stents fitted. He recovered well, did park runs regularly and never drank heavily or smoked. Doctors reassured his family that his diabetes was controlled and that he was fit and healthy. He said he does not remember the first two weeks, describing them as ""a blank"", and after that he ""honestly felt it was over"", as did his doctors. He added: ""My consultant said to me my wife and my children came in to say goodbye - he wasn't supposed to have said that to be fair - but he did it and that really sort of got to me at the time. ""Under the ventilation I was having a lot of hallucinations and things, and some scary moments and seeing masks all the time around me. ""I remember one of the nurses saying to me that she held my hand all night... and she wouldn't let go. ""I thought just how amazing the NHS has been and everybody involved really has been fantastic."" The coronavirus pandemic has claimed more than 1.6 million deaths from more than 73 million confirmed cases around the world. There is hope of an end in sight withvaccinations starting to be rolled out. But Mr Martin, who has been recovering at home since July, said there were still people out there who were not taking the virus seriously. From his hospital bed, Mr Martin told his wife Sue ""I want to come home"" ""It's a horrible, horrible, horrible disease to have and I think if I could have any wish, it would be that it would all go away,"" he said. ""But I suppose the biggest wish is for people to understand I was healthy. ""It astounds me really that there's so many people losing their lives, there's so many people in the same position I'm in and in worse positions than I'm in and people are still not taking heed and not understanding. ""I think once somebody gets it in their family, then it really hits home and it's certainly hitting my family.""

"Serco, one of the UK companies which runs the coronavirus test-and-trace scheme, has said it will award bonuses totalling Â£5m to its staff. It said 50,000 workers would be given Â£100 each to recognise ""the extraordinary efforts of our staff around the world during the pandemic"". Serco will also hand back Â£3m in furlough payments to the government and has returned Â£38m in deferred taxes. The NHS Test and Trace programme has faced criticism over its effectiveness. Some call handlers tasked with tracking down people who have tested positive for Covid and getting in touch with their close contacts say they have spoken to hardly anyone. However, other contact tracers say that some members of the public are refusing to engage with the scheme. Contact tracer: 'People threaten us and block our calls' Test and trace: 'I spoke to one person in four months' Serco's chief executive, Rupert Soames, said: ""In what will be remembered as one of the most challenging periods for businesses since the Second World War, Serco's people have proved themselves to be resilient, flexible and dedicated to ensuring the delivery of public services."" The outsourcing company reiterated its guidance on sales and profits for this year. Revenues are expected to rise 19% to Â£3.9bn, while underlying profit is set to grow by around 35% to between Â£160m and Â£165m. Serco said organic revenue growth, not including contributions from acquisitions, continued to accelerate during the second half of its financial year and is expected to reach 17%. It said growth was driven by a number of factors, including providing ""Covid-19 related services"" in the UK as well as running the immigration removal centres at Gatwick on behalf of the Home Office. The company said it has deferred making a decision on whether to pay a dividend to its shareholders as well as paying the cash element of its directors' bonuses. Serco was criticised for considering making the payment to investors. ""This is grim beyond belief,"" shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Rachel Reeves said in October. ""While Serco is raking in the profits, people are paying the price for its failure on contact tracing."" In Thursday's trading update, Serco said that following the ""second wave"" of Covid-19 infections the board believes ""this is not the right time to make a decision on the resumption of payments of dividends, and will reconsider the position again at the time of the publication of our final results for 2020"". ""Likewise, payment of the cash element of executive director bonuses earned in respect of 2019 performance, which was deferred when we announced the withdrawal of the final 2019 dividend, will be further deferred and also reconsidered at the time of our 2020 final results,"" it added.

"Ritu Saha and fellow residents in Bromley organised their own fire patrols but still had to pay Â£500,000 between them Three years afterthe Grenfell fire, many buildings with dangerous cladding still have 24-hour fire safety patrols - introduced originally as a temporary measure. Now, thousands more homeowners are being forced to pay for ""waking watches"" with no end in sight. In November 2017, when people in high-vis jackets arrived at Ritu Saha's block in Bromley, south-east London, she was told not to worry: they'd be gone by January. Three years and about Â£500,000 of charges to flat owners in the block later, they are still there. Most of the cladding - the type that caused the Grenfell fire to spread so fast, killing 72 people - has been removed from Ritu's flat. But entire walls would need to be demolished to clear it away entirely, Ritu says. The contractors suggest the task is too difficult, and the remaining cladding may have to stay, along with other safety measures to prevent a deadly fire. The fire brigade says that could mean the waking watch has to stay. ""Will we have these fire wardens for the rest of our lives?"" Ritu asks. The patrols have already cost her, on average, more than Â£300 a month for the last three years, totalling Â£11,700.  Â£137average monthly cost to a flat owner Â£256the average in London Â£14average hourly rate earned by fire warden - though some earn up to Â£30p/h A university administrator and one of the founders of the UK Cladding Action Group, she says she cannot bear the cost much longer - ""I will be ruined, basically, if that happens."" Costs for the fire patrols vary hugely, with flat owners often saying they are imposed with little notice or consultation. Government researchsuggests the typical flat owner pays Â£137 a month, or Â£256 in London - about Â£11,000 to Â£15,000 per block each month. Fire wardens are mostly paid around Â£14 an hour - but some earn up to Â£30 an hour, the government says. No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs Safety checks eased to help flat owners 'in limbo' Â£30m fund for flats with dangerous cladding And the number of affected buildings continues to rise: in London, 573 blocks now have the patrols, up from 286 in March. One flat owner in east London tells the BBC the waking watch introduced at his block in July costs the equivalent of Â£1,300 per flat every month. At the moment, the bill is being paid by the housing association, but he says if the costs cannot be recovered from the original developer or through the building warranty, leaseholders will be charged. The leasehold system in England and Wales means many flat owners do not own their property outright, but instead buy the right to use it for a fixed period of time - often between 99 and 125 years. Their buildings are owned by a freeholder, who charges them a small annual rent, plus money for repairs - which can mean huge bills for issues such as cladding. After three years, contractors say some of the flammable material on this building may be to difficult to remove ""The buck keeps being passed between each body,"" the flat owner says. ""What are they trying to do to leaseholders? Are they really trying to bankrupt us?"" Some residents have organised their own waking watch to reduce the cost, with volunteers covering many of the shifts, sometimes in the face of opposition from insurers. Ritu says she would rush home from work to start her 19:00 to midnight shift. A retired woman in her block would take some of the night shifts, staying up from midnight to 07:00 three nights a week to watch for signs of a blaze. A fire alarm can be fitted for the same average cost as just seven weeks of waking watch, government research suggests. But in practice it rarely works out that way: many leaseholders are required by the National Fire Chiefs Council to maintain patrols so they can help evacuate the building in the event of a fire. Ritu now has eight highly sensitive smoke and heat detectors scattered around her one-and-a-half bedroom flat, frequently setting off false alarms. But fitting the system - which cost leaseholders Â£120,000 - only allowed residents to reduce their waking watch from two people to one, still leaving them a Â£12,000 monthly bill between them. Matt Browne and Lizzie Bennett are among thousands of flat owners who discovered in the last year they lived in a dangerous block that would require 24-hour fire patrols when they tried to sell. Their estate agent told them their building, in Birmingham city centre, had failed its external wall fire review, known as EWS1. Birmingham flat owners Lizzie Bennett and Matt Browne say the costs are ""unfathomable"" The review process - demanded by lenders - was extended to many more buildings in January this year with a change of government guidance. Blocks that fail because of dangerous cladding, like Matt and Lizzie's, are valued at Â£0, cannot be mortgaged and are almost impossible to sell. Since then, their building's service charge has risen from Â£950 every six months to Â£4,629 to pay for a Â£17,000-a-month waking watch, a Â£150,000 alarm system (not yet installed) and a 300% increase in insurance bills. ""It's unfathomable, you can't really wrap your head around the idea that it costs this much to live in a one-bedroom flat,"" says Lizzie, a primary school teacher. She has suffered anxiety and sleeplessness over the mounting costs, but says: ""It's been a constant battle of trying to keep it together because I can't show emotion at work, I have to be there for the children."" Like many leaseholders, they hope their building wins some of the Â£1.6bn of government funding to remove dangerous cladding when applications close this month. But Matt says the Building Safety Fund is ""nowhere near big enough"" to meet demand. The 26-year-old video producer has been exhausted by the process after six months. ""I know people have been fighting this for years already,"" he says. ""We are at a stage now where in the next year you will start seeing people go bankrupt and people will start losing their homes."" Imprisoned by cladding: The flat owners who cannot sell In 2019, solicitor Peter Tolson signed up to help run his block's management company in order to push forward some minor repairs. He's seen the impact the charges have had on fellow residents - some have lost their jobs in the pandemic - since the flats in east London failed their EWS1 earlier this year. ""We had people literally banging on our doors, crying, banging the door down at this thought of paying a grand or two grand a month to pay for waking watch on top of insurance costs,"" he says. They have since reduced the costs by arguing they did not need such extensive patrol coverage. But residents have nicknamed the waking watch ""the Wombles"" and don't regard them as a serious safety measure. Residents complain the wardens just sit around, Peter says. He questions the likelihood of them being in just in the right spot at the right time when a fire is visible behind a flat door with time still to evacuate. Peter Tolson said residents who lost their jobs in the pandemic have been in tears at the bills Meanwhile, each week more flat owners discover they are in the same situation. Olivia Hill, a PhD student, helped form the Sheffield Cladding Action Group after discovering her block had failed its assessment last month. She says residents face an uncomfortable choice between protection from the dangers of fire and letting strangers into their building. ""I live on my own, I'm a young woman, it's easy to feel unsafe,"" Olivia says. Having done all the due diligence when she purchased it last year, she was shocked to discover potentially deadly faults are still being discovered in buildings more than three years after Grenfell. ""It's been going on so long and potentially there's no end in sight,"" Olivia says. ""It could keep going on that long for us."" The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said waking watches should only be used ""as an interim measure"", adding: ""They are not a substitute for the swift removal of unsafe cladding. ""Where leaseholders have concerns about waking watch costs they should speak to their building owner, who is responsible for putting safety measures in place. Leaseholders can also challenge excessive costs at the First Tier Tribunal."" The government on Thursdayannounced a Â£30m fund to help pay for the installation of common fire alarms in affected buildings, to end what it called the ""scandal"" of excessive waking watch costs. Â£30m fund for flats with dangerous cladding Safety checks eased to help flat owners 'in limbo' Imprisoned by cladding: The flat owners who cannot sell 'Cost of removing cladding is ripping our lives apart' Video, 00:02:53'Cost of removing cladding is ripping our lives apart' No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"The head of Hospitality Ulster has said he would prefer a full lockdown over partial restrictions Health officials have proposed a six-week lockdown across NI in a bid to curb the spread of the virus, BBC News NI understands. It is believed a review of the measures would take place after four weeks. Executive ministers are meeting to discuss the plan, brought by Health Minister Robin Swann. It proposes the closure of non-essential retail after Christmas Eve, and hospitality only allowed to offer takeaway services. Close contact services including hairdresser and beauty salons would also have to shut again. It is also understood health officials have proposed essential shops in NI would have to close by 20:00 GMT every night during the first week of a new lockdown. It is believed there could be changes to what is classed as essential retail, and the potential that click-and-collect services would not be permitted. The first week of a fresh lockdown could also see tighter rules on indoor and outdoor gatherings and a ban on people meeting others in private gardens. Health officials have also proposed measures to limit the reopening of schools in January and it's understood a package of interventions will be drawn up by the education and health departments. However any new lockdown restrictions will have to be signed off by the whole executive, which is meeting now to consider Mr Swann's paper. On Thursday, a further 12 Covid-linked deaths were recorded in NI and a further 656 cases of the virus. Hospitality Ulster said a full lockdown may now be required. Colin Neill says the board of Hospitality Ulster is aware of the situation at hospitals Chief executive Colin Neill said his board would support a full lockdown to get the virus under control. Mr Neill accepted a lockdown would have a big impact on the hospitality sector but added  ""what is worse is opening and closing all the time"". ""Every time you have to reopen costs a lot of money and every time you have to close costs a lot of money because of wastage,"" he told BBC's Stephen Nolan Show. ""If we are going for lockdown, then we will support a total lockdown until we get this thing under control,"" he said. ""I think we can all see the situation at our hospitals,"" he said. ""We need to go back to what we did in March and April."" Mr Neill said many within the hospitality sector only remained open so they could earn enough to pay their contribution towards furlough and retain their staff. The new proposals before the executive come amid warnings from health officials that the system is struggling with winter pressures exacerbated by the pandemic. Ministers will have to decide the date of when any new measures would take effect, how long they would last and how strict they would be. They will also assess the latest data from the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser regarding the R-number in NI, which measures the infection rate of the virus. The executive has expressed concerns that the spread of the virus has not reduced following a two-week limited lockdown, and that cases could spike further after the Christmas holidays unless more interventions are introduced. Swann warns virus will cast shadow into January Patient waits 28 hours as hospitals struggle The lockdown, which ended last Friday, saw non-essential retail, close contact services and hospitality largely have to shut - but Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young said evidence showed not enough people had followed the ""stay at home"" guidance. There were queues of ambulances outside Antrim Area Hospital on Tuesday night, with hospitals in Northern Ireland continuing to face severe pressures Ministers are also expected to discuss a decision by England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to strengthen guidance about how people can meet up with families over Christmas. On Wednesday, London and the devolved governments agreed to keep in place a plan to allow households to form ""Christmas bubbles"" from 23 to 27 December. The first and deputy first ministers said they wanted to ensure people in Northern Ireland were not isolated over Christmas, but stressed that ""personal responsibility"" should be a priority for anyone planning to have contact with others. Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she would also bring more details of her new support scheme for pubs that do not serve food, which have been forced to remain closed, to Thursday's executive meeting. It has yet to open, but last month the executiveallocated Â£10.6m in funding to the sector. It was always a case of when, not if, new restrictions would be imposed following the brief reprieve over Christmas. Mr Swann's use of the word ""extreme"" has some Stormont sources believing that we could be looking at a lockdown similar to that initially imposed back in March. It could even be tougher in some respects, with ministers aware a hard, long period of measures is needed in order to get transmission rates down. Expectations and anxieties have been raised yet again. Some businesses - having just reopened last week - will express frustration that they could lose out on important post-Christmas sales if they are told to shut again before New Year's Eve, particularly if extra financial support from Stormont isn't put in place. But the biggest issue ministers have to address is the lack of compliance, and there is a growing fear around the executive table that not enough people are heeding the message any more. Cases of the virus in Northern Ireland have not significantly reduced, despite several periods of restrictions since October. On Wednesday, eight deaths linked to Covid-19 were recorded in Northern Ireland, taking the Department of Health's total to 1,143. There were 510 more positive tests recorded, meaning there have been 59,631 cases overall. Health officials have urged the politicians to act quickly, in light of hospitals facing significant pressures that could increase as NI moves further into the winter flu season.

"Covid cases in schools reflect virus levels in the local community, a study of 100 schools across England suggests. In tests on nearly 10,000 staff and pupils in November, 1.24% of pupils and 1.29% of staff tested positive for coronavirus in schools. This is a combined analysis from Public Health England, Office for National Statistics and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The researchers suggest school closures have only a temporary effect on cases. And they add driving down infections in wider society is the best way to keep schools open and safe. TheSchools Infection Survey,externalwill continue to track cases and transmission in schools over the coming months. It comes asmass testing of schools pupils in England is to be expandedin January, withmost pupils having their return to school delayed by a weekto allow time for the scheme to be set up. Covid: Will schools close early for Christmas? Covid: Which schools will get mass testing? Covid: Children more likely to be infected in second wave The first round of survey results are based on tests of more than 6,000 pupils and nearly 5,000 staff from 105 schools - 63 secondary and 42 primary - in areas of England where the virus was spreading quickly at the start of the school year. Children and staff had to be in school to be given a nasal swab test, and so are unlikely to have had symptoms. The survey found a higher percentage of staff and pupils testing positive for the virus in secondary schools than primary schools - around 1.47% compared to around 0.8%. Roughly 1.2% of the general population is estimated to have had the coronavirus during the same period, according to the ONS. Dr Shamez Ladhani, the study's chief investigator and a consultant at Public Health England, said: ""While there is still more research to be done, these results appear to show that the rate of infection among students and staff attending school closely mirrors what's happening outside the school gates. ""That's why we all need to take responsibility for driving infections down if we want to keep schools open and safe for our children."" The researchers are trying to find out more about the role of schools in the spread of the virus - something that has been a challenge so far. The key is to discover whether infections are more likely to be brought into school from outside, or are starting in school and moving into households in the community. Data from PHE so far suggests infections in school year groups are being introduced from different sources rather than being spread between pupils in schools, but genetic analysis of virus strains is needed to confirm this, Dr Ladhani says. This would give more detailed information on the order in which the virus had passed from person to person. After schools reopened in the autumn, Dr Ladhani said the rate of infections in all year groups had been rising every week, with older pupils seeing the biggest increases. He explained that lockdowns have a greater impact on adult infection rates rather than children's, but there is often a delayed effect in children a week later than seen in adults. Closing schools would only have a ""temporary effect"", Dr Ladhani added. Prof James Hargreaves, co-chief investigator of the study from LSHTM, said the more information collected within schools ""the better understanding we have of their role in transmission within the wider community and how to minimise SARS-CoV2 transmission"". ""We hope to answer questions to ensure children's education can continue in the safest way possible,"" he said. As part of the study, pupils and staff will be tested for the virus and also for antibodies - signs they have had it in the past - throughout the school year. The aim is to detect new cases, monitor absences from school and find out how well measures to control the virus work in schools.

"The return to secondary school in January will be staggered in England, with some pupils starting online rather than in class, says the government. It will allow schools to set up aCovid testing scheme- but exam-year pupils will start term as usual. The National Education Union said making the announcement right at the end of the school term showed ""panic"". Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said testing would ""clamp down"" on the virus after the Christmas break. ""Armed forces personnel"" will support the planning for testing in schools, says the Department for Education. Apart from those taking GCSEs, A-levels and vocational exams next year, secondary school pupils will study online for the first week back in January. School infection rates reflect local levels Mass testing scheme for schools in January School attendance plummeted after half term This is to allow schools to make preparations for mass Covid testing - which will offer school staff a test each week and a daily test for seven days for pupils in contact with a positive case. Those exam year pupils returning for face-to-face lessons will also be offered tests, with all testing to be on a voluntary basis and requiring parental consent. Face-to-face learning is expected to re-start for all by 11 January. Asimilar scheme has been announced for Wales, where schools went online on Monday. A full return to the classroom is expected by 18 January at the latest. But school leaders have reacted angrily at having to set up and manage such a testing system with so little notice - with the National Association of Head Teachers calling it a ""shambles"". ""They have handed schools a confused and chaotic mess at the eleventh hour,"" said the union's leader Paul Whiteman. Jules White, head of Tanbridge House School in Horsham, said: ""The government has spent Â£22bn on a mass testing programme for test and trace. ""Schools are being asked to deliver mass testing for staff and students during the Christmas period with no funding, an 'idiot's guide' handbook and barely any notice."" The government is insisting the change to the start of term is not an extension to the school holidays and primary schools will not be affected by the move. But it comes after the Department for Education instructed all local authorities to keep schools open in the final days of term, despite several initially telling parents that schools would close early and head teachers calling for more flexibility for online study. Teaching unions have challenged the practicality of being expected to train and deploy an ""army of volunteers"" to run the testing. The National Education Union has now written to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson saying the plans for a school testing system are ""inoperable"". It said: ""Telling school leaders, on the last day of term [for many schools], that they must organise volunteers and parents, supported by their staff, to test pupils in the first week of term, whilst Year 11 and 13 pupils are on site for in-school teaching, is a ridiculous ask."" Teachers were already ""exhausted by the unreasonable demands, backed by legal threats, that they have been subjected to this term"", said the union's letter. It added that running such medical procedures was ""significantly outside the experience and job description"" of school staff, highlighting expert advice that tests carried out by non-specialists were less likely to be effective. Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union said: ""Yet again the government is announcing significant changes affecting schools with little or no time to prepare before the Christmas closure period."" He said it was not the responsibility of teachers or school leaders to undertake testing of pupils or employees. ""The government has to ensure that it puts into place all the necessary resources needed to deliver the practical and financial support to schools to ensure safety in schools,"" said Dr Roach. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said: ""We are very concerned about the feasibility of setting up a testing programme at the scale envisaged."" He added: ""The profession is very willing to work with the government over how to roll-out mass testing, but ministers must understand that chaotic, last-minute announcements do not constitute a collaborative approach."" As the plans for January have been announced, an official study suggestsvirus rates in schools reflect the levels in their local communities. Virus rates have been growing fast in some areas, including London and south-east England, in recent weeks, with many schools affected. The analysis of tests on 10,000 staff and pupils from Public Health England, Office for National Statistics and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found 1.24% of pupils and 1.29% of staff tested positive for coronavirus in schools. However, the impact of those cases will have been felt by many more, as close contacts were required to go home and self-isolate. The governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have not announced any changes to the start of the January term, but schools in Wales moved online last Monday.

"A delay in reporting an extra 11,000 positive Covid tests in Wales has led to a big jump in case rates.

The delayed results came from Lighthouse Laboratories, which process about 70% of Wales' tests. The Welsh Conservatives said the news was ""staggering"".

Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales The figures show an additional 4,221 cases have been added to the total for the week ending 11 December, an adjustment to what was reported on Wednesday. A total of 11,250 - including the usual daily cases - have been added, meaning the latest weekly case rates have increased as a result. Wales, already at its highest case rate so far, saw a jump to 530.2 cases per 100,000 for the most recent seven days, to 12 December. The case rate stood at 377.8 on Wednesday, although PHW warned this was an underestimation of what we should expect.

"This video can not be played 'There are tough compromises that have to be made' The outgoing US administration is in talks with the UK to try to seal a mini-deal to reduce trade tariffs, Donald Trump's trade chief has said. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told the BBC he was hopeful for a deal that could see punitive tariffs on Scottish whisky lowered. The UK recently said it would drop tariffs against the US over subsidies for aerospace firms. This was in a bid to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. In his first international interview, Mr Lighthizer suggested the UK would need to go further than last week's announcementbreaking with the EU's support of European plane maker Airbus. ""I'm talking to [International Trade Secretary] Liz Truss, about trying to work out some kind of a deal... I'm hopeful we can get some kind of an agreement out you know, we don't have a lot of time left,"" he said. ""We have the advantage in that both the US and the UK - particularly the current government of the UK - are not big subsidisers, where some other countries are more inclined to subsidise. So it would be helpful if we could come to some kind of agreement,"" he said when asked about lowering tariffs on whisky and cashmere. ""We are in discussions, we'll see how that works out."" UK lacks 'authority' to impose tariffs in plane row EU imposes tariffs on US goods in Boeing row What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Last week, the UK unilaterally broke with European support of Airbus in a long-running transatlantic trade dispute, changing policy expressed only in January this year of ongoing support even after Brexit, by announcing it would no longer apply tariffs to imports of Boeing aircraft. Liz Truss said that she wanted to ""de-escalate"" the 16-year-old conflict over subsidies. However, the BBC understands that in a phone call, the USTR told the trade secretary directly that the US would not treat this as a concession, because, outside of the EU, the UK had ""no authority"" to continue to apply retaliatory measures on the US. ""For sure, it's true that the UK as an individual was not a party to that Airbus-Boeing litigation, right,"" said Mr Lighthizer. ""We brought an action against the EU, France, Germany and the UK. The EU just brought one against us, the member states did not in all cases. so there's no question that as a legal point, that is correct,"" he added. Instead, the US wants the UK to make concessions on the separate EU dispute over steel and aluminium, where US bourbon was among products upon which European tariffs were levied. The talks are part of a general move by President Trump's trade team to wrap up the Boeing-Airbus dispute with the EU, and the UK separately, outside the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The US' top trade negotiator also explained why, despite high hopes even this year for a full US-UK free trade agreement, the next administration had a ""short period"" now in the first half of 2021 to try to wrap up a deal. While he said it was ""extremely likely"" that a full deal would be struck ""before long"", he emphasised that ""tough compromises have to be made"" on agricultural issues, for example. Asked about demands to adapt UK food standards on beef and chicken, as well as reforms to the way the NHS pays for US medicines, Mr Lighthizer said: ""These negotiations are ongoing. ""You know, clearly, the US needs to get additional access to the agricultural market in the UK - that's an important part of it, each side has to get something out of it. These are complicated technical issues. And they're the kinds of things that will be worked out, I think, in the in the final stages of negotiation."" Chickens being treated with chlorine at a plant in Arkansas, US He also indicated that the US team were never convinced that the UK was actually going fully to depart from EU trade rules, because of the sheer amount of UK-EU trade, despite that being the stated policy of the current government. ""The Brexit situation was always something that was on our mind, if you think about it,"" he stressed. ""The nature of our relationship is going to be affected by the nature of the relationship between the EU and the UK, right. They're a much bigger trading partner to you than we are, so that has an impact... I've always had the view that there's just an awful lot of trade between the UK and the EU and it was hard to see there weren't going to be any rules to that."" This video can not be played 'I wouldn't say we've started a lot of trade wars' Mr Lighthizer made it clear that giving the US ""new access"" to UK markets was important, but would be ""less significant"" should the same deal be offered by the UK to another country. ""But, you know, that'll be sorted out here probably in the next two or three weeks or so... one way or another. And then I think there's no reason why the US and the UK can't get to a deal fairly expeditiously after that,"" he added. Mr Lighthizer confirmed that the Trump administration was still planning to hit back against countries levying digital services tax hitting big US tech firms ""unfairly"". He also defended the actions of the current administration in ripping up decades of multilateral action in building a global trade system. However, he said he had no regrets and had helped ""reorient the global trading system"" to help ordinary American workers rather than large corporations.

"This video can not be played 'I played in front of 20,000 people and don't remember' - Hughes More former rugby players have joined the legal process against the game's authorities for alleged negligence. Former Wales Under-20 centre Adam Hughes, 30, is the youngest to claim he has suffered permanent brain damage. Ex-England Under-21 back row Neil Spence is also one of those involved while four former England and Wales players remain anonymous. Legal action is being prepared against the Rugby Football Union (RFU), Wales Rugby Union (WRU) and World Rugby. It means there are now nine players included in preparing the action - although the law firm representing the group says more than 100 players have come forward. Those additional players will now be tested for early onset dementia and their details added to the potential claim involving the existing nine when it is ready. A letter of claim, setting out their intention to sue, was delivered to the governing bodies on Thursday. Rugby and concussion: Key questions the sport faces World Cup winner Merchant has lower cognitive capacity Former Clermont player Cudmore backing dementia-claim group Ex-Wales Under-20 centre Hughes on lost memories In response, the RFU, WRU and World Rugby have issued a joint statement to confirm they have received the letter, and are ""deeply saddened"" to hear personal accounts from the players. They also say player welfare is taken ""extremely seriously"" and it ""continues to be our number one priority"". World Rugby chairman and former England captainSir Bill Beaumont said in an open letter,externalhis ""thoughts are with"" those who are struggling and that the organisation will ""continue to welcome"" the views of former players. He added the area of concussion is ""extremely complex"" but that as ""the science continues to evolve"" rugby will ""evolve with it"". Every member of the group of nine, including England's World Cup-winning hooker Steve Thompson, has recently been diagnosed with early signs of dementia. The former players say repeated blows to the head are to blame. Spence says he used to be ""the fun guy at the party"" but that his condition has ""taken my personality"". ""If I knew I was going to feel like this I wouldn't have signed up,"" Spence told BBC Sport. ""We knew we were signing up to broken arms, broken legs and knee replacements, but not being neurologically impaired and a degenerative disease. ""I still love the game, and what we are trying to get from this is ideally some change. The change should be potentially limiting some contact during the training."" Meanwhile, 42-year-old Thompson played in every England match when they won the 2003 World Cup, but says: ""I can't remember any of those games. It's frightening."" This video can not be played I can't remember England games at World Cup, says 2003 winner Thompson It is the first legal move of its kind in world rugby and, if successful, could change the way the game is played. Rylands Law, which is representing the group, says the risks of concussion injuries were ""known and foreseeable"", and list 24 alleged failures on the part of World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU. ""We know senior figures in the game have been discussing the issue of head injuries since the 1970s, and yet here we are, more than 40 years later, with so many players, and at such an early stage in their lives, finding themselves in this awful position,"" said Richard Boardman of Rylands Law. ""I sincerely hope World Rugby, RFU and WRU will now face up to their responsibilities."" Meanwhile NFL medical experts say they are in regular communication with rugby authorities about how to reduce concussion in the sport. NFL chief medical officer Dr Allen Sills says his sport is trying to ""share knowledge in a more rapid fashion"" with World Rugby and other contact sports. In 2011, theNFL paid out Â£700m to former players who had suffered brain damage. ""We do share regularly with each others sporting groups across the world,"" Sills told the BBC. ""If there are silver linings with the Covid-19 situation, I would say that this has strengthened our communication further."" Sills says there are some differences with technique and training between American football and rugby union, but admits the internal damage can be similar because ""the human body is the same the world over"". ""We talk at least every couple of weeks with World Rugby, Australian Football, and a number of these other contact sports, and we're sharing the learnings that we have,"" he added. ""We share what we're finding in our research, we share what our rules changes are and we're learning from each other and I think we all share the same goal."" Each player to have come forward so far has been diagnosed by neurologists at King's College London with early onset dementia and probable Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is the disease discovered by Dr Bennet Omalu in American football player Mike Webster, and the subject of the film Concussion starring Will Smith. In 2011, a group of former American football players started a class action against the NFL and won a settlement worth about $1bn (Â£700m). CTE can develop when the brain is subjected to numerous small blows or rapid movements - sometimes known as sub-concussions - and is associated with symptoms such as memory loss, depression and progressive dementia.

"This video can not be played 'There are tough compromises that have to be made' The outgoing US administration is in talks with the UK to try to seal a mini-deal to reduce trade tariffs, Donald Trump's trade chief has said. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told the BBC he was hopeful for a deal that could see punitive tariffs on Scottish whisky lowered. The UK recently said it would drop tariffs against the US over subsidies for aerospace firms. This was in a bid to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. In his first international interview, Mr Lighthizer suggested the UK would need to go further than last week's announcementbreaking with the EU's support of European plane maker Airbus. ""I'm talking to [International Trade Secretary] Liz Truss, about trying to work out some kind of a deal... I'm hopeful we can get some kind of an agreement out you know, we don't have a lot of time left,"" he said. ""We have the advantage in that both the US and the UK - particularly the current government of the UK - are not big subsidisers, where some other countries are more inclined to subsidise. So it would be helpful if we could come to some kind of agreement,"" he said when asked about lowering tariffs on whisky and cashmere. ""We are in discussions, we'll see how that works out."" UK lacks 'authority' to impose tariffs in plane row EU imposes tariffs on US goods in Boeing row What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Last week, the UK unilaterally broke with European support of Airbus in a long-running transatlantic trade dispute, changing policy expressed only in January this year of ongoing support even after Brexit, by announcing it would no longer apply tariffs to imports of Boeing aircraft. Liz Truss said that she wanted to ""de-escalate"" the 16-year-old conflict over subsidies. However, the BBC understands that in a phone call, the USTR told the trade secretary directly that the US would not treat this as a concession, because, outside of the EU, the UK had ""no authority"" to continue to apply retaliatory measures on the US. ""For sure, it's true that the UK as an individual was not a party to that Airbus-Boeing litigation, right,"" said Mr Lighthizer. ""We brought an action against the EU, France, Germany and the UK. The EU just brought one against us, the member states did not in all cases. so there's no question that as a legal point, that is correct,"" he added. Instead, the US wants the UK to make concessions on the separate EU dispute over steel and aluminium, where US bourbon was among products upon which European tariffs were levied. The talks are part of a general move by President Trump's trade team to wrap up the Boeing-Airbus dispute with the EU, and the UK separately, outside the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The US' top trade negotiator also explained why, despite high hopes even this year for a full US-UK free trade agreement, the next administration had a ""short period"" now in the first half of 2021 to try to wrap up a deal. While he said it was ""extremely likely"" that a full deal would be struck ""before long"", he emphasised that ""tough compromises have to be made"" on agricultural issues, for example. Asked about demands to adapt UK food standards on beef and chicken, as well as reforms to the way the NHS pays for US medicines, Mr Lighthizer said: ""These negotiations are ongoing. ""You know, clearly, the US needs to get additional access to the agricultural market in the UK - that's an important part of it, each side has to get something out of it. These are complicated technical issues. And they're the kinds of things that will be worked out, I think, in the in the final stages of negotiation."" Chickens being treated with chlorine at a plant in Arkansas, US He also indicated that the US team were never convinced that the UK was actually going fully to depart from EU trade rules, because of the sheer amount of UK-EU trade, despite that being the stated policy of the current government. ""The Brexit situation was always something that was on our mind, if you think about it,"" he stressed. ""The nature of our relationship is going to be affected by the nature of the relationship between the EU and the UK, right. They're a much bigger trading partner to you than we are, so that has an impact... I've always had the view that there's just an awful lot of trade between the UK and the EU and it was hard to see there weren't going to be any rules to that."" This video can not be played 'I wouldn't say we've started a lot of trade wars' Mr Lighthizer made it clear that giving the US ""new access"" to UK markets was important, but would be ""less significant"" should the same deal be offered by the UK to another country. ""But, you know, that'll be sorted out here probably in the next two or three weeks or so... one way or another. And then I think there's no reason why the US and the UK can't get to a deal fairly expeditiously after that,"" he added. Mr Lighthizer confirmed that the Trump administration was still planning to hit back against countries levying digital services tax hitting big US tech firms ""unfairly"". He also defended the actions of the current administration in ripping up decades of multilateral action in building a global trade system. However, he said he had no regrets and had helped ""reorient the global trading system"" to help ordinary American workers rather than large corporations.

"Serco, one of the UK companies which runs the coronavirus test-and-trace scheme, has said it will award bonuses totalling Â£5m to its staff. It said 50,000 workers would be given Â£100 each to recognise ""the extraordinary efforts of our staff around the world during the pandemic"". Serco will also hand back Â£3m in furlough payments to the government and has returned Â£38m in deferred taxes. The NHS Test and Trace programme has faced criticism over its effectiveness. Some call handlers tasked with tracking down people who have tested positive for Covid and getting in touch with their close contacts say they have spoken to hardly anyone. However, other contact tracers say that some members of the public are refusing to engage with the scheme. Contact tracer: 'People threaten us and block our calls' Test and trace: 'I spoke to one person in four months' Serco's chief executive, Rupert Soames, said: ""In what will be remembered as one of the most challenging periods for businesses since the Second World War, Serco's people have proved themselves to be resilient, flexible and dedicated to ensuring the delivery of public services."" The outsourcing company reiterated its guidance on sales and profits for this year. Revenues are expected to rise 19% to Â£3.9bn, while underlying profit is set to grow by around 35% to between Â£160m and Â£165m. Serco said organic revenue growth, not including contributions from acquisitions, continued to accelerate during the second half of its financial year and is expected to reach 17%. It said growth was driven by a number of factors, including providing ""Covid-19 related services"" in the UK as well as running the immigration removal centres at Gatwick on behalf of the Home Office. The company said it has deferred making a decision on whether to pay a dividend to its shareholders as well as paying the cash element of its directors' bonuses. Serco was criticised for considering making the payment to investors. ""This is grim beyond belief,"" shadow Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Rachel Reeves said in October. ""While Serco is raking in the profits, people are paying the price for its failure on contact tracing."" In Thursday's trading update, Serco said that following the ""second wave"" of Covid-19 infections the board believes ""this is not the right time to make a decision on the resumption of payments of dividends, and will reconsider the position again at the time of the publication of our final results for 2020"". ""Likewise, payment of the cash element of executive director bonuses earned in respect of 2019 performance, which was deferred when we announced the withdrawal of the final 2019 dividend, will be further deferred and also reconsidered at the time of our 2020 final results,"" it added.

"This video can not be played The health secretary announces several more counties in southern and eastern England will face stronger restrictions More than two-thirds of England's population will be living under the toughest Covid-19 rules from Saturday. Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire and Hertfordshire will move to tier three, as will parts of Surrey, East Sussex, Cambridgeshire and Hampshire. And swathes of the nation already in tier three will remain there. Announcing the changes, Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs: ""We've come so far, we mustn't blow it now."" Bristol and North Somerset will move from tier three to tier two, and Herefordshire will move from tier two into tier one. The changes come into effect at 00:01 on Saturday. It comes as the UK recorded a further 532 coronavirus deaths, taking the total number of people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus to 66,052. A further 35,383 cases were also recorded on Thursday, up from 25,161 on the previous day. This figure includes11,000 positive cases from Wales that were not previously recorded in official figuresdue to maintenance work on Public Health Wales' computer systems at the end of last week. Which places are moving into tier three? UK coronavirus cases up by 25,161 on Wednesday Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live The announcement on tiers means that 68% of England's population - 38 million people - will be living under the toughest restrictions of tier three from the weekend. Some 30% of the population will be in tier two, while just 2% will be in tier one. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was concerned the tier system was ""just not strong enough to control the virus"". ""We've been seeing the numbers going in the wrong direction across the country in the last seven days in particular,"" he added. In Greater Manchester, which was first placed in tier three on 23 October, mayor Andy Burnham said he was ""not surprised but very disappointed""that the region was staying in tier three, having called for some parts to be downgraded. He told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Greater Manchester has lower infection rates than Liverpool and London had ""when they were originally put into"" tier two. ""It feels like if... London and the South East has rising cases, everyone stays under restrictions,"" he said. Announcing the outcome of the first formal review of the new tier system in England, Mr Hancock told MPs ""no-one wants tougher restrictions any longer than necessary"". However, he said ""these are always the most difficult months for people's health"" and we ""must keep suppressing this virus"". Cases have risen by 46% in the past week in the south-east of England, he told MPs, and were up by two-thirds in the east of England. Meanwhile, the government has announcedthe return to school in January will be staggered for secondary pupils in England, with some starting term online rather than in class. It will allow schools to set up a Covid testing scheme - but exam-year pupils will start term as usual. There will also be a staggered return for schools in Walesafter the Christmas break. The health secretary said from 00:01 Saturday 19 December: Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Berkshire, Peterborough, the whole of Hertfordshire, Surrey (except Waverley), Hastings and Rother, Portsmouth, Gosport and Havant will move intotier three. Bristol and North Somerset will be moved down totier two. Herefordshire will move from tier two totier one. With the majority of the country in the highest tier, many will be wondering how long it will be before the rules are relaxed. The trajectories are quite different across the tier three areas. Large parts of the North have seen cases fall and now have lower than average infection rates, although there are signs those decreases have stalled. Other areas, particularly large parts of the home counties, have relatively low rates that are rising. Then there are places - east London and the surrounding areas - that have high rates that are rising. The fact that they are all facing the tightest restrictions is a sign of how cautious ministers are being. That, of course, is because of the Christmas relaxation - and fear it could lead to a spike in cases. If that happens, tier three could become the norm for months - maybe accompanied by a third lockdown. That would leave the government and public pinning everything on the vaccine programme. Earlier this week, ministers said a good start had been made with 137,000 people vaccinated. But there are more than 25 million in the priority groups - 12 million of them over the age of 65. In theory, two million could be vaccinated every week, but that depends on multiple things going right. This could become the status quo for many until the spring. Around 34 million people have already been living under tier three rules. London, most of Essex and parts of Hertfordshire were placed under the strictest curbs on social contacts on Wednesday. They joined much of the Midlands, north-west England and north-east England. The news Greater Manchester would remain in tier three provoked anger from some of the area's MPs, including Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers. ""The statement will be greeted with dismay in Greater Manchester where we have had severe restrictions for nine months, where in nine of the 10 boroughs rates are below the national average,"" he said. And the West Midlands' Conservative mayor Andy Street called for more government funding to support businesses in tier three areas. Leaders in areas moving from tier two to tier three also expressed their concerns. Stephen McPartland, Conservative MP for Stevenage in Hertfordshire, tweeted that it was ""ridiculous"" the town is ""being dragged into"" tier three. He said tiers ""should be imposed on a district basis instead of this unbalanced county-wide approach"". Gerald Vernon-Jackson, the Liberal Democrat leader of Portsmouth City Council, said the decision to introduce the toughest measures there was ""bizarre"". He said he was ""slightly surprised"" because he had been told that ""the problem"" was with the city's Queen Alexandra Hospital. However, the hospital also serves nearby local authorities, such as Fareham and Winchester City, which were not being moved up. ""The government has made a number of bizarre decisions, so it's no surprise they have made another one,"" he said. SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug?

"Mick and Debbie Thompson hope next Christmas will look more like life before the pandemic With infections rising and worries about the festive period growing, some families have decided Christmas isn't worth the risk and are either cancelling their plans or making last-minute changes. Mick Thompson is still annoyed about placing third with his wife, Debbie, in the family Zoom quiz at the weekend. Perhaps that's an understatement - ""quite distraught"" is how he puts it. But when the initial red mist cleared, the pair had to address another issue that came up during the call: the annual Boxing Day get-together. Mick's family is one of hundreds across the country weighing up whether or not to go ahead with plans over Christmas, amid a growing number of coronavirus infections across the UK. The usual restrictions on social contact are being relaxed between 23 and 27 December, allowing up to three households to mix indoors over the five-day period. But Mick and Debbie still decided to call off the Boxing Day buffet at their home in Chineham, Hampshire, this week. ""Everyone was saying 'I'll bring desserts' and 'I'll bring this' and 'I'll bring that',"" says Mick, 59, who owns a travel PR company. ""But over the last couple of days... there's been so much talk about this Christmas relaxation that I think for one year only, the sensible thing to do is just not to bother. We can do it any old time, you know?"" He and Debbie broke the news to her sisters in a text message (a method he recommends, by the way, because ""you don't get the opportunity to get emotional on the phone""). ""What I'm worried about is that I could be asymptomatic, catching it from somebody else, and then spreading it afterwards. My conscience wouldn't let me do that,"" he says. ""They said that they understood and didn't want to put us under any pressure."" UK Christmas rules stay but nations toughen advice Seeing my family at Christmas 'not worth the risk' What are the rules for meeting up at Christmas? More than 200 miles away in Lancashire, Nicole Cobb, 30, had to have the same conversation with her family. She, her partner and children usually spend the festive period flitting between her relatives' homes in Aberdeen. This year they had planned a gathering within the relaxed rules but, given that her job as a youth and family worker involves meeting so many people, she decided it was not worth the risk of unknowingly passing on the virus. She made the ""difficult decision"" just before the second national lockdown was introduced in England last month. Nicole says her elderly gran is one of her closest family members ""There is that thought that my gran's older and am I missing a special Christmas with her?"" she says, adding that she would love to also see her sister, who is having chemotherapy, and her new niece. Although she'll miss seeing her family, she is also looking forward to a ""much more relaxed"" Christmas at home. ""There's no pressure to run around this year,"" she laughs. Instead, the family will do a virtual quiz on Christmas Day and will meet up next year. ""If you've got the family around the table, it doesn't need to be 25 December, it can be any date that you pick. It's just about getting together as family, isn't it?"" James Downs, 31, from Cambridge, says he would rather find alternative things to do on Christmas Day ""than face the idea of risking my loved ones"". He works in mental health policy but also teaches dance and yoga, so also comes into contact with a lot of people. He had plans to go to to Cardiff to see his family, including his clinically vulnerable dad, but he's called them off. ""The idea of giving my dad the virus and him being very unwell is something I'm not prepared to risk for the sake of a few months, by which time he might have the vaccine,"" he explains. He says anyone worried about having difficult conversations with family members should focus on ""the reasons why you might not want to meet this year - because you care about and love them"". James had been looking forward to spending time with his mum over Christmas On Wednesday,the four UK nations agreed that restrictions will still be relaxedbetween 23 and 27 December, but guidance would be strengthened. Boris Johnson warned ""a smaller Christmas is going to be a safer Christmas"", saying people should ""think hard"" before meeting friends and family. Three households will still be able to meet - apart from in Wales where a law change will allow just two households. And in Scotland people are being asked to meet on just one of the five days. An announcement on Northern Ireland is expected on Thursday. A YouGov survey this week suggested 57% of people think the plans to relax coronavirus rules over Christmas should be scrapped. Around 31% of the 3,856 adults who were asked said the easing should go ahead as planned, and 12% said they were unsure. Diva Fanning, 71, a retired midwife in Herefordshire, always looks forward to spending time over Christmas with her daughters, no matter how grown up they are. She had been planning to host her daughters and their families on Boxing Day. But after a friend told her that a man in her local village had died from coronavirus following a get-together - and with infection rates rising - she decided to change course. ""I didn't want to say 'I'm not doing it' because I didn't want to sound like a killjoy, so I just said 'perhaps it's best',"" she says. In any case, she and her husband will still host one daughter who is in her bubble, and can see other family members outside. ""It wasn't a difficult conversation really. It came together on its own... everybody was thinking the same anyway,"" she says.  ""We've all come to that agreement that it's silly, really, to take the risk."" Diva Fanning's Boxing Day this year will be a bit quieter than usual Back in Chineham, Mick and Debbie will spend Christmas and Boxing Day at home with the dogs. The whole family plans to meet up in the spring, instead. ""I'm very disappointed, but I think it's the only sensible thing to do,"" he says. Until then, another virtual quiz on Christmas Day will have to suffice - and he's got some swotting up to do. ""One of my sister-in-law's sons and his girlfriend put the quiz together and all the oldies sit round and compete, it's quite good fun,"" he says. ""We normally win.""

"Toy store owner Hellen Stirling-Baker says container delays have cost her Â£20,000 in sales so far - 40% of her annual turnover Delays at UK ports mean a number of toy orders will now miss Christmas, according to the British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA). The industry body has called on the government to help ""save the festive season"" by easing port congestion. Hellen Stirling-Baker, who runs a Sheffield shop, says she has lost Â£20,000 in sales because of container delays, or 40% of her annual turnover. Other shops say it is impossible to order some popular toys including Lego. Ms Stirling-Baker has been told that her order of cotton Dinkum Dolls, made in China, won't arrive in England until 7 January. The British company that designs the dolls told her their container is held up in customs, but it's already experienced seven weeks of delays due to the pandemic, port congestion and other logistics issues. Other toy orders from Ms Stirling-Baker has made have arrived incomplete. ""I just received an order today which I placed three weeks ago, and only part [of it] has come. The rest is stuck in ports,"" she said. ""Demand has been really high but stock levels are low."" While many UK importers are struggling with the congestion issues at Felixstowe and Southampton, the toy sector has been particularly hard hit, since the problems have coincided with the peak Christmas season. The Leeds-based toy designer Boxer Gifts, which manufacturers its products in China, estimates a loss in sales of up to Â£1m this year due to stock delays. Managing director Thomas O'Brien says one of his containers is currently stuck in the Belgian port of Zeebrugge and there's no way it will get to the UK in time for Christmas. ""Some of the ships are bypassing the UK and tipping off at European ports, but others are just slowing down because they've got nowhere to unload,"" he said. ""Various games and stocking-filler toys such as Grow-a-Sloth are hugely popular, but we've had stock outages for months because shipments are delayed and that's costing us sales. ""More importantly it's reducing availability for consumers to find fun gifts. There's less about."" Toy designer Boxer Gifts says lost sales from shipping delays will mean less money for innovation next year. Like many importers, Mr O'Brien has also had to contend with a sharp rise in shipping costs, as shipping firms hike up freight rates in response to port congestion and a shortage of empty containers in Asia. He says containers shipped from Qingdao, China to Felixstowe are costing him $10,000 (Â£7,492.03), rather than the normal rate of $2,500. BTHA has called on the government to help where it can. ""We would urge the government to help at this crucial time for business, to save the festive season and alleviate blockages now ahead of the UK's departure from the EU,"" said a spokesman. Adding to the calls for government to intervene at the ports are the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Food and Drink Federation (FDF). The two trade bodies have written to MPs to request an urgent inquiry into the ongoing disruption at UK ports and skyrocketing shipping rates. A spokesman for the Department for Transport (DfT) said: ""This is not a problem unique to the UK, with ports around the globe experiencing similar container capacity issues. The government is working closely with the freight industry to work through the challenges some of our ports are facing. ""Ports are employing more staff, as well as working with hauliers to improve container collection and with shipping lines to maximise efficient utilisation of port capacity. We will do everything we can to resolve the situation as quickly as possible."" 'Price rises likely' due to UK shipping problems Port in 'chaos' as Christmas and Brexit loom While many small toy shops are struggling, some larger toy retailers say they've managed to avoid problems at the ports by stockpiling early in the year. Many have also benefitted from booming toy sales as families spent more time at home during coronavirus lockdowns.

"Toy store owner Hellen Stirling-Baker says container delays have cost her Â£20,000 in sales so far - 40% of her annual turnover Delays at UK ports mean a number of toy orders will now miss Christmas, according to the British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA). The industry body has called on the government to help ""save the festive season"" by easing port congestion. Hellen Stirling-Baker, who runs a Sheffield shop, says she has lost Â£20,000 in sales because of container delays, or 40% of her annual turnover. Other shops say it is impossible to order some popular toys including Lego. Ms Stirling-Baker has been told that her order of cotton Dinkum Dolls, made in China, won't arrive in England until 7 January. The British company that designs the dolls told her their container is held up in customs, but it's already experienced seven weeks of delays due to the pandemic, port congestion and other logistics issues. Other toy orders from Ms Stirling-Baker has made have arrived incomplete. ""I just received an order today which I placed three weeks ago, and only part [of it] has come. The rest is stuck in ports,"" she said. ""Demand has been really high but stock levels are low."" While many UK importers are struggling with the congestion issues at Felixstowe and Southampton, the toy sector has been particularly hard hit, since the problems have coincided with the peak Christmas season. The Leeds-based toy designer Boxer Gifts, which manufacturers its products in China, estimates a loss in sales of up to Â£1m this year due to stock delays. Managing director Thomas O'Brien says one of his containers is currently stuck in the Belgian port of Zeebrugge and there's no way it will get to the UK in time for Christmas. ""Some of the ships are bypassing the UK and tipping off at European ports, but others are just slowing down because they've got nowhere to unload,"" he said. ""Various games and stocking-filler toys such as Grow-a-Sloth are hugely popular, but we've had stock outages for months because shipments are delayed and that's costing us sales. ""More importantly it's reducing availability for consumers to find fun gifts. There's less about."" Toy designer Boxer Gifts says lost sales from shipping delays will mean less money for innovation next year. Like many importers, Mr O'Brien has also had to contend with a sharp rise in shipping costs, as shipping firms hike up freight rates in response to port congestion and a shortage of empty containers in Asia. He says containers shipped from Qingdao, China to Felixstowe are costing him $10,000 (Â£7,492.03), rather than the normal rate of $2,500. BTHA has called on the government to help where it can. ""We would urge the government to help at this crucial time for business, to save the festive season and alleviate blockages now ahead of the UK's departure from the EU,"" said a spokesman. Adding to the calls for government to intervene at the ports are the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Food and Drink Federation (FDF). The two trade bodies have written to MPs to request an urgent inquiry into the ongoing disruption at UK ports and skyrocketing shipping rates. A spokesman for the Department for Transport (DfT) said: ""This is not a problem unique to the UK, with ports around the globe experiencing similar container capacity issues. The government is working closely with the freight industry to work through the challenges some of our ports are facing. ""Ports are employing more staff, as well as working with hauliers to improve container collection and with shipping lines to maximise efficient utilisation of port capacity. We will do everything we can to resolve the situation as quickly as possible."" 'Price rises likely' due to UK shipping problems Port in 'chaos' as Christmas and Brexit loom While many small toy shops are struggling, some larger toy retailers say they've managed to avoid problems at the ports by stockpiling early in the year. Many have also benefitted from booming toy sales as families spent more time at home during coronavirus lockdowns. ToyTown, which has 30 outlets across the UK, says it has had a bumper year with especially high orders of puzzles and games. ""We took a decision to load up pre-Brexit - if companies run a 'just-in-time' model, they'll suffer,"" explains managing director Alan Simpson.

" Marjory McQueen was in the living room of her home in Lockerbie watching television with her teenage daughter Victoria. It was the shortest day of the year and there were just four more days until Christmas. Marjory McQueen saw the sky turn orange For the McQueen family, like millions of others in the UK, the must-see midweek show was This is Your Life. Children’s entertainer Harry Corbett was the celebrity being surprised by presenter Michael Aspel who was dressed as Sooty, one of Corbett’s glove puppet creations. As the programme got into its rhythm, Marjory became unsettled by a noise – “I think I hear thunder,” she said to 14-year-old Victoria. But instead of rumbling away, the thunder kept getting louder. “Oh, I wonder if the boiler’s about to explode,” the 42-year-old thought. The whole sky turned orange and there were flames hundreds of feet up into the air Marjory, whose doctor husband Ken was out with friends, was so baffled by this sound she ventured into the cold wintry night. She recalls: “When I went outside, I was aware of something just going past the house. “And then, within five seconds, there was this enormous - it wasn’t an explosion, I would never call it an explosion - it was a ‘crump’. That was all I heard. “And then there was a whoosh, and suddenly the whole sky turned orange, and there were flames hundreds of feet up into the air. I had no idea what had happened.” A few hundred yards away from her home in this small town in south-west Scotland, a scene of unimaginable devastation was unfolding. Canon Patrick Keegans had recently been appointed parish priest and was looking forward to spending his first Christmas in Lockerbie, where he lived at 1 Sherwood Crescent. The clergyman had made new friends in the street and that evening he was due to meet up with two of them, Dora and Maurice Henry. Fr Keegans had recently moved to Lockerbie He planned to take his visiting mother to the Henrys’ after watching the evening news on television. Before they left, he went upstairs to make sure he had hidden his mother’s Christmas present. Suddenly he heard what he thought was a military plane overhead. To Fr Keegans, it sounded like it was going to crash into a nearby field. “Immediately after that, there was an enormous explosion,” he says. The shaking stopped and to his surprise he was uninjured. Downstairs, Fr Keegans found his mother safe, having been shielded from the blast by a fridge freezer. Houses in Sherwood Crescent were destroyed in the explosion The pair stumbled out of the house into a scene of destruction. Sherwood Crescent was on fire and most of the houses were destroyed. The bodies of the Henrys were never found. They were among 11 residents of Sherwood Crescent who died that night. Peter Giesecke lived in Park Place in the Rosebank area of Lockerbie - a quiet neighbourhood of neat former council houses, arranged around play parks on the eastern edge of town. The 35-year-old’s three children were in bed when, just after 7pm, he heard a deep rumbling sound. Peter Giesecke heard a huge crash at his back door From his front window, he saw a bright light fall from the sky and explode on the ground close to nearby Sherwood Crescent. Within moments there was a huge crash at the back door. The lights went out and the family were in darkness. “The children had come down the stairs, they were screaming, there was glass and debris all over the place,” he says. “So I got a torch and I shone the torch outside.” There was a strong smell of aviation fuel and debris was scattered across his garden. But worse than that were the bodies. “There were bodies over my hedge, they were lying outside the front windows. They were all over the place.” Forever in his mind is the girl lying on his garden hedge. “I shall always remember that girl - she was wearing a blue top, a sweater.” The remains of more than 60 people were eventually removed from this small corner of the town. Just over 35 minutes before the explosion, Pan Am flight 103 took off from Heathrow Airport and headed almost directly north. After crossing the border with Scotland, the pilot guided the plane slightly to the west. It was due to head out over the Atlantic, bound for New York’s John F Kennedy airport. But shortly after 7pm, PA103 disappeared from radar screens. Multiple signals were seen fanning out and downwards from its last radar position. There was no distress call. Afterwards there was radio silence. There were 259 passengers and crew on board. The cockpit and the forward section of the plane, along with the crew and passengers inside, fell 31,000ft to the ground. It landed in a field near Tundergarth Church, two-and-a-half miles east of Lockerbie. The rest of the 747 went into a steep, gliding dive, from 31,000ft to 19,000ft. By now almost directly above Lockerbie, the entire wing section broke off. The wings and the fuel tanks dropped down in a straight line, landing on Sherwood Crescent, close to the home of Fr Keegans. More than 1,500 tonnes of material was blown into the air, leaving a crater 143ft long. The back end of the plane, which contained most of the flight’s passengers, fell on Rosebank - the area around Peter Giesecke’s family home. Just over the fence from Peter’s garden, houses in Rosebank Crescent bore the brunt of the crash. A huge slice was taken out of the side of one home, exposing bedrooms to the open air. George Stobbs was a police inspector at Lockerbie. A former miner, he was a “rural bobby”, just a few years away from retirement. That night, his wife heard the explosion from their home in Lochmaben, four miles to the west of Lockerbie. George Stobbs witnessed the immediate aftermath of the crash When he learned that a plane had crashed, he went straight back on duty. George was keen to understand the scale of the devastation. “I went to Rosebank and there was this part of the fuselage which was buried in the garden, it had clipped the side of a house,” he says. “And there was a lot of people still inside. No bodies had been removed by that time. Eventually they took 60 people out of that part of the plane.” Military personnel were brought in to help emergency service workers From there, he went to Tundergarth where the nose cone was lying in a field. With its windows still intact, from one angle the wreckage looked “not too bad”. “But obviously when you went round to the other side of the aircraft, it was just miles of wires and people strapped in seats. It was a gruesome mess inside.” Just a few hours after the explosion, Josephine Donaldson and her husband Robert went back to their house. There was a rumour that looters were already in the area, and they wanted to make sure their home in Carlisle Road was secure. The town was full of fires, debris, ambulances, firefighters, and police. The area around their house was cleared amid fears a nearby petrol station could catch fire. Josephine Donaldson found a girl's handbag in her garden The Donaldsons crept home along the fields behind their home. Once inside, Josephine looked out into her garden and spotted a handbag lying on the ground. “I opened it up, and there was this girl’s 21st birthday cards,” she says. “Her name was Nicole Boulanger, and she had been 21 on the 28th October that year.” When she switched the news on, Josephine saw Nicole’s mother waiting at the airport in New York. Nicole Boulanger was one of 35 students from Syracuse University “I just felt so, so sad,” she says. “She was there to meet her daughter at the airport and then discovered that the Pan Am 103 had been blown up, and I just felt how strange having her daughter’s handbag. “And that’s when I decided right away, I would look after that girl and always put a flower down at the memorial garden for her.” Nicole Boulanger was a talented singer, dancer, and musician. She was studying for a degree in musical theatre, and her coming-of-age had coincided with the trip of a lifetime. Nicole celebrated her 21st birthday in London, where she was one of 35 students from New York State’s Syracuse University who had just completed a term studying in the capital. They all lost their lives in the Lockerbie bombing. Thursday 22 December 1988 was the first day of a changed Lockerbie. Across the town, across Scotland, across the world, the scale of the tragedy was becoming clear. Rescue workers and media flooded in. In the surrounding hills, police and rescue teams were finding and tagging the bodies of the victims. Soldiers searched the streets for parts of the wrecked passenger plane They brought them back to the makeshift mortuaries which were set up in Lockerbie town hall, and later the local ice rink. Meanwhile, David and Steven Flannigan, whose parents and sister were killed in Sherwood Crescent the previous night, visited Marjory McQueen at her home. Steven, 14, witnessed the plane crash from a neighbour’s home; his 19-year-old brother had been living in Blackpool. Thomas and Kathleen Flannigan died with their daughter, Joanne. She didn’t know what to say to them and for a while they sat in silence. “And then David said to me, ‘Can I show you something?’ “And I said, ‘Yeah, sure’. And he took me out to the car, and he opened the boot, and he took out a tiny watering can. “Something that you pick up in Woolworths for 50p. And he said, ‘That’s all I can find of my family’. “And I think it was then that we just realised, just how awful this was. And that’s something I will never, ever forget. Never.” Despite the horror of the crash, Fr Keegans was keen to keep Christmas as normal as possible for the children of Lockerbie. The Christmas lights remained lit but he told his bishop he would only be able to say one short prayer during midnight mass. “Well, I managed to get out about 10 words, and that was it. I just cracked up.” Many of the town’s residents were keen to help the families of the bereaved. A group of local women set up a “laundry” to sort, wash and iron clothes recovered from the wreckage. They matched them to their owners, packed them up and sent them to the victims’ families. Josephine Donaldson – who found Nicole Boulanger’s handbag in her garden – was among the volunteers. Amy Elizabeth Shapiro was among the passengers on Flight 103 “Some of the boxes the police would give you, you just did it on autopilot, others you maybe had a wee look through,” she says. “And this particular day, it was a portfolio I was interested in, and obviously she was one of the students, and she had these lovely photographs, and inside her portfolio was her 21st birthday cards, and she had the same birthday as Nicole Boulanger. “She’d celebrated her birthday on the 28th October. Her name was Amy Beth Shapiro. So I always referred to these two girls as my two girls.” During the weeks that followed the bombing, relatives of the Pan Am passengers arrived in Lockerbie. They sought comfort and answers about the deaths of their loved ones. Peter Giesecke learned that the girl whose body he found in his back garden was Anne Lindsey Otenasek. The 21-year-old social work student was a native of Baltimore and one of the 35 Syracuse students. Sometime later, her parents came to Peter’s front door. He recalls that the student’s mother said “I believe my daughter was found in your garden”. Peter showed her exactly where he found the body and they talked about it all night. “We actually went out for tea that night and they were a very, very, nice couple,” he says. “And we still keep in contact at Christmas time and send cards and send flowers.” Twelve years after Pan Am 103 fell on Lockerbie, Libyan intelligence agent Abdelbaset al-Megrahi was convicted of mass murder. The trial took place in a Scottish court specially set up at Camp Zeist in The Netherlands. He was sentenced in 2001 to 27 years in a Scottish prison but was released on compassionate grounds eight years later after being diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer. He died in 2012. But the story did not die with him. Megrahi was released from a Scottish prison on compassionate grounds Doubts about the safety of his conviction and the part played by the CIA in gathering evidence against Megrahi persist to this day. Megrahi’s family is currently making a third attempt to appeal against his conviction. The Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission is now considering whether there are grounds to refer his case to the appeal court. There is no one view on this in Lockerbie. For Peter Giesecke, Megrahi was “guilty all the way” and he was against his early release. But he does not think Megrahi was the sole murderer. “It hasn’t come completely out and I don’t think it will. We’ll never get to the root of it. I don’t think so. Megrahi was the main man but there’s other men out there as well.” Dr Jim Swire lost his daughter, Flora, in the Pan Am bombing Marjory McQueen has little interest in the legal and political fallout from the bombing. “I really, really felt that what Lockerbie was about, was about looking after the people who so tragically lost their lives here,” she says. “And that’s what we want to be remembered for.” Fr Keegans, who is now retired, joined the Justice for Megrahi campaign after meeting Megrahi and his family. The group, which was set up by Dr Jim Swire, the father of one of the British victims of the bombing, is backing the push for an appeal. Lockerbie lives with us, we’re part of Lockerbie and Lockerbie’s part of us “I can’t live with myself being silent, when I’m truly convinced that this man has been unjustly convicted,” Fr Keegans says. “Lockerbie is an unfinished story from the point of view of the legal aspects. “But for those of us who experienced Lockerbie, Lockerbie’s story will never come to an end. Lockerbie lives with us, we’re part of Lockerbie and Lockerbie’s part of us.” “All aspects of Lockerbie stay with us. The horror, the tragedy, the sadness, the grief, the support and love that was shown. All of that stays with us.” Today Lockerbie is a neat, handsome town which appears to be doing rather well. It stands beside the motorway linking Glasgow and Carlisle, and it is a market town for the surrounding farms. Home to 4,000 residents, it was never a remote, isolated village - but it never expected to be the centre of global terrorism and tragedy. It has changed a lot in three decades, with new factories and housing estates contributing to a slight population increase. I’m very proud to say that I live in Lockerbie, and that the town reacted the way it did Where families were wiped out, lives cut short and homes destroyed, there are memorials - but there is also new life. In Sherwood Crescent - the epicentre of the devastation - houses have been rebuilt alongside a modest stone of remembrance. To the west of the town is Dryfesdale Cemetery, where a visitor centre tells the story of Pan Am 103 and the Lockerbie Air Disaster Memorial stands in silent testimony to the 270 dead. Street sculptures celebrate Lockerbie's connection with agriculture The other lasting memorial is the scholarship which every year gives two students from Lockerbie Academy the chance to study at Syracuse University. The university’s motto is “Look Back, Act Forward”. It could speak for the whole town and all those whose lives were touched by the murders. Marjory McQueen says the scholarship proves that good can come out of terrible tragedy. “I’m very proud to say that I live in Lockerbie, and that the town reacted the way it did,” she says. “I think, in a way, when something like this happens, it’s a terrible tragedy. It’s dreadful. But if you wait long enough, good comes out of it. “And anyone who comes to Lockerbie, I’m very pleased to say that they are met and are shown round. And Lockerbie will never, never forget their relatives, and how they died here.” Visitors to the town pay tribute to the victims of flight 103 Josephine Donaldson is typical of the people in Lockerbie - proud of the way they came together, but reluctant to take credit for the part she played. Twice a year, she visits the memorial in a small act of remembrance for Nicole and Amy Elizabeth, two young women she never met but still refers to as “my girls”. “I always put the flowers on there for their birthday and the 21 December. I never told anyone, I never signed the card, I just put ‘JD’. “I just felt I had to do it. I had a son, and if that had happened in America and I never got him home, I would have hoped someone would have done the same.” Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.9960686

"Toy store owner Hellen Stirling-Baker says container delays have cost her Â£20,000 in sales so far - 40% of her annual turnover Delays at UK ports mean a number of toy orders will now miss Christmas, according to the British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA). The industry body has called on the government to help ""save the festive season"" by easing port congestion. Hellen Stirling-Baker, who runs a Sheffield shop, says she has lost Â£20,000 in sales because of container delays, or 40% of her annual turnover. Other shops say it is impossible to order some popular toys including Lego. Ms Stirling-Baker has been told that her order of cotton Dinkum Dolls, made in China, won't arrive in England until 7 January. The British company that designs the dolls told her their container is held up in customs, but it's already experienced seven weeks of delays due to the pandemic, port congestion and other logistics issues. Other toy orders from Ms Stirling-Baker has made have arrived incomplete. ""I just received an order today which I placed three weeks ago, and only part [of it] has come. The rest is stuck in ports,"" she said. ""Demand has been really high but stock levels are low."" While many UK importers are struggling with the congestion issues at Felixstowe and Southampton, the toy sector has been particularly hard hit, since the problems have coincided with the peak Christmas season. The Leeds-based toy designer Boxer Gifts, which manufacturers its products in China, estimates a loss in sales of up to Â£1m this year due to stock delays. Managing director Thomas O'Brien says one of his containers is currently stuck in the Belgian port of Zeebrugge and there's no way it will get to the UK in time for Christmas. ""Some of the ships are bypassing the UK and tipping off at European ports, but others are just slowing down because they've got nowhere to unload,"" he said. ""Various games and stocking-filler toys such as Grow-a-Sloth are hugely popular, but we've had stock outages for months because shipments are delayed and that's costing us sales. ""More importantly it's reducing availability for consumers to find fun gifts. There's less about."" Toy designer Boxer Gifts says lost sales from shipping delays will mean less money for innovation next year. Like many importers, Mr O'Brien has also had to contend with a sharp rise in shipping costs, as shipping firms hike up freight rates in response to port congestion and a shortage of empty containers in Asia. He says containers shipped from Qingdao, China to Felixstowe are costing him $10,000 (Â£7,492.03), rather than the normal rate of $2,500. BTHA has called on the government to help where it can. ""We would urge the government to help at this crucial time for business, to save the festive season and alleviate blockages now ahead of the UK's departure from the EU,"" said a spokesman. Adding to the calls for government to intervene at the ports are the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Food and Drink Federation (FDF). The two trade bodies have written to MPs to request an urgent inquiry into the ongoing disruption at UK ports and skyrocketing shipping rates. A spokesman for the Department for Transport (DfT) said: ""This is not a problem unique to the UK, with ports around the globe experiencing similar container capacity issues. The government is working closely with the freight industry to work through the challenges some of our ports are facing. ""Ports are employing more staff, as well as working with hauliers to improve container collection and with shipping lines to maximise efficient utilisation of port capacity. We will do everything we can to resolve the situation as quickly as possible."" 'Price rises likely' due to UK shipping problems Port in 'chaos' as Christmas and Brexit loom While many small toy shops are struggling, some larger toy retailers say they've managed to avoid problems at the ports by stockpiling early in the year. Many have also benefitted from booming toy sales as families spent more time at home during coronavirus lockdowns. ToyTown, which has 30 outlets across the UK, says it has had a bumper year with especially high orders of puzzles and games. ""We took a decision to load up pre-Brexit - if companies run a 'just-in-time' model, they'll suffer,"" explains managing director Alan Simpson. He says it is typical for some toy lines to run-out of stock before Christmas, but this year's port problems are ""limiting choice"" for retailers, and he's had to closely monitor his supply chain. Charlotte Khan and her husband Naveed run a toy store in Folkestone Charlotte Khan from children's boutique Moo Like a Monkey in Folkestone, Kent, says her business has had to be ""more resilient than ever this year"". After losing thousands of pounds due to shipping problems that have left her having to hold onto late-arriving stock for next year, she is planning to refocus on stockists much closer to home. ""I'm going to look much more locally for suppliers now, they're the ones who've kept us in more reliable stock,"" she said. ""Even though we've taken a hit on our Christmas turnover, we've dealt with worse this year, and at least we've been able to trade during our peak season. I'm grateful to still be in business.""

"A delay in reporting an extra 11,000 positive Covid tests in Wales has led to a big jump in case rates. Public Health Wales (PHW) said planned IT maintenance meant there was a ""significant under-reporting"" but anyone who tested positive had been contacted in the usual way. The delayed results came from Lighthouse Laboratories, which process about 70% of Wales' tests. The Welsh Conservatives said the news was ""staggering"". The 11,000 extra positive tests were taken between 9 and 15 December. PHW said the ""vast majority"" have been added to itsdashboard,,externalwhich records the figures, on Thursday. 52 more Covid deaths reported in Wales Covid: You asked and we answered How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales The figures show an additional 4,221 cases have been added to the total for the week ending 11 December, an adjustment to what was reported on Wednesday. A total of 11,250 - including the usual daily cases - have been added, meaning the latest weekly case rates have increased as a result. Wales, already at its highest case rate so far, saw a jump to 530.2 cases per 100,000 for the most recent seven days, to 12 December. The case rate stood at 377.8 on Wednesday, although PHW warned this was an underestimation of what we should expect. The new figures showed the case rate for Merthyr Tydfil - already the highest in the UK - is now 1,032.7 cases per 100,000 - with 623 positive tests in the past seven days. Eight council areas in Wales are in the 10 hardest-hit areas in the UK for case rates in latest comparison. There are 14 out of 22 council areas which have their highest case rates so far - including Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham. Three others would have reported their highest figures on Wednesday, had all the figures been available. PHW said its previous data collection system was ""on its last legs"". ""The system would collapse very frequently and it was proving to be unsustainable to run with its existing system,"" said PHW incident director Dr Giri Shankar. ""This was not an unplanned activity. We knew it was going to have an impact, therefore weconstantly communicated before it actually happened,externaland while it was happening and even after it had happened, to say that this is affecting the results."" The planned maintenance of the NHS Welsh Laboratory Information Management System (WLMS) ""has not affected individuals receiving their results"", PHW insisted. First Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: ""The story is not about missing data or computer problems, it's about the seriousness of the situation. ""You were told in advance that this was going to happen. The data was never missing it was always there, waiting to be uploaded into the system."" Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""With positive cases in Wales rising to record levels it is crucial that the reporting of data is both timely and robust. ""The public need a complete and current picture of the situation to realise the gravity of what we are facing. ""We need urgent reassurance that the failings have been addressed.""

"This video can not be played Friends and family line the street in an emotional homecoming A man who was given ""almost zero"" chances of surviving after contracting Covid-19 has spoken of how his world has been ""turned upside down"". Mal Martin, 58, was taken to Bridgend's Princess of Wales Hospital in March, a week after ""feeling unwell"" and placed on a ventilator for 61 days. His wife and children even said their goodbyes before he was put into an induced coma. But Mr Martin's recovery was described by doctors as a ""miracle"". 'My husband's chances are almost zero they told me' Dad 'still with us' despite slim survival hope ""Basically it's turned my world upside down but at the same time, I'm getting stronger,"" he told BBC Radio 4'sTodayprogramme. ""I can only walk so far, I'm having lots of dizziness, I've got problems with my lungs, I've got major problems with my kidneys. On Mal Martin's seventh day in hospital, his family were told to prepare for the worst ""My kidneys are only running at 12% at the moment and it's just been horrific really. I need to either go on dialysis for the rest of my life, or a kidney transplant. ""I've lost vision in my right eye which I'll never get back and I've had amputations on my hands - I've lost my thumb from on my one hand and I've lost a forefinger and a half a finger and my thumb is going to come off my right hand."" Mr Martin was taken to hospital just before the UK went into a national lockdown in March. This video can not be played Sue Martin spoke to the BBC about Mal in April Mr Martin is diabetic, which is genetic, not life-style related. Four years ago he'd had a heart attack and had three stents fitted. He recovered well, did park runs regularly and never drank heavily or smoked. Doctors reassured his family that his diabetes was controlled and that he was fit and healthy. He said he does not remember the first two weeks, describing them as ""a blank"", and after that he ""honestly felt it was over"", as did his doctors. He added: ""My consultant said to me my wife and my children came in to say goodbye - he wasn't supposed to have said that to be fair - but he did it and that really sort of got to me at the time. ""Under the ventilation I was having a lot of hallucinations and things, and some scary moments and seeing masks all the time around me. ""I remember one of the nurses saying to me that she held my hand all night... and she wouldn't let go. ""I thought just how amazing the NHS has been and everybody involved really has been fantastic."" The coronavirus pandemic has claimed more than 1.6 million deaths from more than 73 million confirmed cases around the world. There is hope of an end in sight withvaccinations starting to be rolled out. But Mr Martin, who has been recovering at home since July, said there were still people out there who were not taking the virus seriously. From his hospital bed, Mr Martin told his wife Sue ""I want to come home"" ""It's a horrible, horrible, horrible disease to have and I think if I could have any wish, it would be that it would all go away,"" he said. ""But I suppose the biggest wish is for people to understand I was healthy. ""It astounds me really that there's so many people losing their lives, there's so many people in the same position I'm in and in worse positions than I'm in and people are still not taking heed and not understanding.

"This video can not be played 'There are tough compromises that have to be made' The outgoing US administration is in talks with the UK to try to seal a mini-deal to reduce trade tariffs, Donald Trump's trade chief has said. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told the BBC he was hopeful for a deal that could see punitive tariffs on Scottish whisky lowered. The UK recently said it would drop tariffs against the US over subsidies for aerospace firms. This was in a bid to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with Washington. In his first international interview, Mr Lighthizer suggested the UK would need to go further than last week's announcementbreaking with the EU's support of European plane maker Airbus. ""I'm talking to [International Trade Secretary] Liz Truss, about trying to work out some kind of a deal... I'm hopeful we can get some kind of an agreement out you know, we don't have a lot of time left,"" he said. ""We have the advantage in that both the US and the UK - particularly the current government of the UK - are not big subsidisers, where some other countries are more inclined to subsidise. So it would be helpful if we could come to some kind of agreement,"" he said when asked about lowering tariffs on whisky and cashmere. ""We are in discussions, we'll see how that works out."" UK lacks 'authority' to impose tariffs in plane row EU imposes tariffs on US goods in Boeing row What you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Last week, the UK unilaterally broke with European support of Airbus in a long-running transatlantic trade dispute, changing policy expressed only in January this year of ongoing support even after Brexit, by announcing it would no longer apply tariffs to imports of Boeing aircraft. Liz Truss said that she wanted to ""de-escalate"" the 16-year-old conflict over subsidies. However, the BBC understands that in a phone call, the USTR told the trade secretary directly that the US would not treat this as a concession, because, outside of the EU, the UK had ""no authority"" to continue to apply retaliatory measures on the US. ""For sure, it's true that the UK as an individual was not a party to that Airbus-Boeing litigation, right,"" said Mr Lighthizer. ""We brought an action against the EU, France, Germany and the UK. The EU just brought one against us, the member states did not in all cases. so there's no question that as a legal point, that is correct,"" he added. Instead, the US wants the UK to make concessions on the separate EU dispute over steel and aluminium, where US bourbon was among products upon which European tariffs were levied. The talks are part of a general move by President Trump's trade team to wrap up the Boeing-Airbus dispute with the EU, and the UK separately, outside the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO). The US' top trade negotiator also explained why, despite high hopes even this year for a full US-UK free trade agreement, the next administration had a ""short period"" now in the first half of 2021 to try to wrap up a deal. While he said it was ""extremely likely"" that a full deal would be struck ""before long"", he emphasised that ""tough compromises have to be made"" on agricultural issues, for example. Asked about demands to adapt UK food standards on beef and chicken, as well as reforms to the way the NHS pays for US medicines, Mr Lighthizer said: ""These negotiations are ongoing. ""You know, clearly, the US needs to get additional access to the agricultural market in the UK - that's an important part of it, each side has to get something out of it. These are complicated technical issues. And they're the kinds of things that will be worked out, I think, in the in the final stages of negotiation."" Chickens being treated with chlorine at a plant in Arkansas, US He also indicated that the US team were never convinced that the UK was actually going fully to depart from EU trade rules, because of the sheer amount of UK-EU trade, despite that being the stated policy of the current government. ""The Brexit situation was always something that was on our mind, if you think about it,"" he stressed. ""The nature of our relationship is going to be affected by the nature of the relationship between the EU and the UK, right. They're a much bigger trading partner to you than we are, so that has an impact... I've always had the view that there's just an awful lot of trade between the UK and the EU and it was hard to see there weren't going to be any rules to that."" This video can not be played 'I wouldn't say we've started a lot of trade wars' Mr Lighthizer made it clear that giving the US ""new access"" to UK markets was important, but would be ""less significant"" should the same deal be offered by the UK to another country. ""But, you know, that'll be sorted out here probably in the next two or three weeks or so... one way or another. And then I think there's no reason why the US and the UK can't get to a deal fairly expeditiously after that,"" he added. Mr Lighthizer confirmed that the Trump administration was still planning to hit back against countries levying digital services tax hitting big US tech firms ""unfairly"". He also defended the actions of the current administration in ripping up decades of multilateral action in building a global trade system. However, he said he had no regrets and had helped ""reorient the global trading system"" to help ordinary American workers rather than large corporations.

"Global internet firms could be banned from automatically detecting child abuse images on their systems from as early as next Monday, amid a row over privacy laws within the European Union. The companies voluntarily assist police across the UK and Europe but face being forced to stop the work. Talks are ongoing to try and create anexemption for the tech giants.,external Child safety experts say if the row is unresolved the law will inadvertently make it easier for abusers. The threat to the investigations has been triggered by attempts in the European Parliament to protect private online communications from monitoring by internet companies. However, the new rules could prevent those same companies using software to automatically scan for child sexual abuse material going through their systems. The tools developed over a decade can identify: Newly-created violent and exploitative images that have not yet been logged by investigators Online conversations which have the hallmarks of abusers grooming victims On Thursday, talks in Brussels between the European Parliament, Commission officials and representatives of the member states will attempt to agreehow to exempt the internet companies,externalfrom the incoming privacy law. If those talks fail, the law will ban the use of the most automated tools that sweep through million of communications, before passing leads and patterns on to law enforcement agencies. John Carr, secretary of the UK Children's Charities' Coalition on Internet Safety and a globally-recognised expert in the field, warned that time was running out to ensure all of the detection work would continue. ""If Brussels does not change this law or put it on hold... sexual predators will have an easier time contacting children,"" said Mr Carr. ""There will be more videos of children being raped available for people to view or download. ""The latter not only does further harm to the children depicted in the videos, to the extent such material also encourages or sustains paedophile behaviour, it puts children as yet unharmed in danger in every country in the world."" This video can not be played WATCH: In June the BBC spoke to an internet safety campaigner and investigator who poses as a 14-year-old girl online Experts estimate that if the most controversial privacy measures become law, there could be a 70% drop in reports from internet companies to law enforcement agencies across the world. The US-based National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children received almost 17m reports from internet companies in 2019, including alerts about potential abusers and victims operating across Europe. The UK's National Crime Agency has not commented on the stand-off in Brussels - but it is part of a global group of law enforcement organisations that has lobbied Europe becauseit believes there is a risk to investigations and protection work,external.

And MEP David Lega, co-president of the European Parliament's child safety group, said the privacy measures demanded by campaigners could set back the fight against online abuse 10 years. ""The cooperation between the tech companies and the law-enforcement authorities has proven instrumental in rescuing children in the EU and globally from child sexual abuse,"" he said.

"Ritu Saha and fellow residents in Bromley organised their own fire patrols but still had to pay Â£500,000 between them Three years afterthe Grenfell fire, many buildings with dangerous cladding still have 24-hour fire safety patrols - introduced originally as a temporary measure. Now, thousands more homeowners are being forced to pay for ""waking watches"" with no end in sight. In November 2017, when people in high-vis jackets arrived at Ritu Saha's block in Bromley, south-east London, she was told not to worry: they'd be gone by January. Three years and about Â£500,000 of charges to flat owners in the block later, they are still there. Most of the cladding - the type that caused the Grenfell fire to spread so fast, killing 72 people - has been removed from Ritu's flat. But entire walls would need to be demolished to clear it away entirely, Ritu says. The contractors suggest the task is too difficult, and the remaining cladding may have to stay, along with other safety measures to prevent a deadly fire. The fire brigade says that could mean the waking watch has to stay. ""Will we have these fire wardens for the rest of our lives?"" Ritu asks. The patrols have already cost her, on average, more than Â£300 a month for the last three years, totalling Â£11,700.  Â£137average monthly cost to a flat owner Â£256the average in London Â£14average hourly rate earned by fire warden - though some earn up to Â£30p/h A university administrator and one of the founders of the UK Cladding Action Group, she says she cannot bear the cost much longer - ""I will be ruined, basically, if that happens."" Costs for the fire patrols vary hugely, with flat owners often saying they are imposed with little notice or consultation. Government researchsuggests the typical flat owner pays Â£137 a month, or Â£256 in London - about Â£11,000 to Â£15,000 per block each month. Fire wardens are mostly paid around Â£14 an hour - but some earn up to Â£30 an hour, the government says. No guarantees for leaseholders over cladding costs Safety checks eased to help flat owners 'in limbo' Â£30m fund for flats with dangerous cladding And the number of affected buildings continues to rise: in London, 573 blocks now have the patrols, up from 286 in March. One flat owner in east London tells the BBC the waking watch introduced at his block in July costs the equivalent of Â£1,300 per flat every month. At the moment, the bill is being paid by the housing association, but he says if the costs cannot be recovered from the original developer or through the building warranty, leaseholders will be charged. The leasehold system in England and Wales means many flat owners do not own their property outright, but instead buy the right to use it for a fixed period of time - often between 99 and 125 years. Their buildings are owned by a freeholder, who charges them a small annual rent, plus money for repairs - which can mean huge bills for issues such as cladding. After three years, contractors say some of the flammable material on this building may be to difficult to remove ""The buck keeps being passed between each body,"" the flat owner says. ""What are they trying to do to leaseholders? Are they really trying to bankrupt us?"" Some residents have organised their own waking watch to reduce the cost, with volunteers covering many of the shifts, sometimes in the face of opposition from insurers. Ritu says she would rush home from work to start her 19:00 to midnight shift. A retired woman in her block would take some of the night shifts, staying up from midnight to 07:00 three nights a week to watch for signs of a blaze. A fire alarm can be fitted for the same average cost as just seven weeks of waking watch, government research suggests. But in practice it rarely works out that way: many leaseholders are required by the National Fire Chiefs Council to maintain patrols so they can help evacuate the building in the event of a fire. Ritu now has eight highly sensitive smoke and heat detectors scattered around her one-and-a-half bedroom flat, frequently setting off false alarms. But fitting the system - which cost leaseholders Â£120,000 - only allowed residents to reduce their waking watch from two people to one, still leaving them a Â£12,000 monthly bill between them. Matt Browne and Lizzie Bennett are among thousands of flat owners who discovered in the last year they lived in a dangerous block that would require 24-hour fire patrols when they tried to sell. Their estate agent told them their building, in Birmingham city centre, had failed its external wall fire review, known as EWS1. Birmingham flat owners Lizzie Bennett and Matt Browne say the costs are ""unfathomable"" The review process - demanded by lenders - was extended to many more buildings in January this year with a change of government guidance. Blocks that fail because of dangerous cladding, like Matt and Lizzie's, are valued at Â£0, cannot be mortgaged and are almost impossible to sell. Since then, their building's service charge has risen from Â£950 every six months to Â£4,629 to pay for a Â£17,000-a-month waking watch, a Â£150,000 alarm system (not yet installed) and a 300% increase in insurance bills. ""It's unfathomable, you can't really wrap your head around the idea that it costs this much to live in a one-bedroom flat,"" says Lizzie, a primary school teacher. She has suffered anxiety and sleeplessness over the mounting costs, but says: ""It's been a constant battle of trying to keep it together because I can't show emotion at work, I have to be there for the children."" Like many leaseholders, they hope their building wins some of the Â£1.6bn of government funding to remove dangerous cladding when applications close this month. But Matt says the Building Safety Fund is ""nowhere near big enough"" to meet demand. The 26-year-old video producer has been exhausted by the process after six months. ""I know people have been fighting this for years already,"" he says. ""We are at a stage now where in the next year you will start seeing people go bankrupt and people will start losing their homes."" Imprisoned by cladding: The flat owners who cannot sell In 2019, solicitor Peter Tolson signed up to help run his block's management company in order to push forward some minor repairs. He's seen the impact the charges have had on fellow residents - some have lost their jobs in the pandemic - since the flats in east London failed their EWS1 earlier this year. ""We had people literally banging on our doors, crying, banging the door down at this thought of paying a grand or two grand a month to pay for waking watch on top of insurance costs,"" he says. They have since reduced the costs by arguing they did not need such extensive patrol coverage. But residents have nicknamed the waking watch ""the Wombles"" and don't regard them as a serious safety measure. Residents complain the wardens just sit around, Peter says. He questions the likelihood of them being in just in the right spot at the right time when a fire is visible behind a flat door with time still to evacuate. Peter Tolson said residents who lost their jobs in the pandemic have been in tears at the bills Meanwhile, each week more flat owners discover they are in the same situation. Olivia Hill, a PhD student, helped form the Sheffield Cladding Action Group after discovering her block had failed its assessment last month. She says residents face an uncomfortable choice between protection from the dangers of fire and letting strangers into their building. ""I live on my own, I'm a young woman, it's easy to feel unsafe,"" Olivia says. Having done all the due diligence when she purchased it last year, she was shocked to discover potentially deadly faults are still being discovered in buildings more than three years after Grenfell. ""It's been going on so long and potentially there's no end in sight,"" Olivia says. ""It could keep going on that long for us."" The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said waking watches should only be used ""as an interim measure"", adding: ""They are not a substitute for the swift removal of unsafe cladding. ""Where leaseholders have concerns about waking watch costs they should speak to their building owner, who is responsible for putting safety measures in place. Leaseholders can also challenge excessive costs at the First Tier Tribunal."" The government on Thursdayannounced a Â£30m fund to help pay for the installation of common fire alarms in affected buildings, to end what it called the ""scandal"" of excessive waking watch costs.

"Toy store owner Hellen Stirling-Baker says container delays have cost her Â£20,000 in sales so far - 40% of her annual turnover Delays at UK ports mean a number of toy orders will now miss Christmas, according to the British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA). The industry body has called on the government to help ""save the festive season"" by easing port congestion. Hellen Stirling-Baker, who runs a Sheffield shop, says she has lost Â£20,000 in sales because of container delays, or 40% of her annual turnover. Other shops say it is impossible to order some popular toys including Lego. Ms Stirling-Baker has been told that her order of cotton Dinkum Dolls, made in China, won't arrive in England until 7 January. The British company that designs the dolls told her their container is held up in customs, but it's already experienced seven weeks of delays due to the pandemic, port congestion and other logistics issues. Other toy orders from Ms Stirling-Baker has made have arrived incomplete. ""I just received an order today which I placed three weeks ago, and only part [of it] has come. The rest is stuck in ports,"" she said. ""Demand has been really high but stock levels are low."" While many UK importers are struggling with the congestion issues at Felixstowe and Southampton, the toy sector has been particularly hard hit, since the problems have coincided with the peak Christmas season. The Leeds-based toy designer Boxer Gifts, which manufacturers its products in China, estimates a loss in sales of up to Â£1m this year due to stock delays. Managing director Thomas O'Brien says one of his containers is currently stuck in the Belgian port of Zeebrugge and there's no way it will get to the UK in time for Christmas. ""Some of the ships are bypassing the UK and tipping off at European ports, but others are just slowing down because they've got nowhere to unload,"" he said. ""Various games and stocking-filler toys such as Grow-a-Sloth are hugely popular, but we've had stock outages for months because shipments are delayed and that's costing us sales. ""More importantly it's reducing availability for consumers to find fun gifts. There's less about."" Toy designer Boxer Gifts says lost sales from shipping delays will mean less money for innovation next year. Like many importers, Mr O'Brien has also had to contend with a sharp rise in shipping costs, as shipping firms hike up freight rates in response to port congestion and a shortage of empty containers in Asia. He says containers shipped from Qingdao, China to Felixstowe are costing him $10,000 (Â£7,492.03), rather than the normal rate of $2,500. BTHA has called on the government to help where it can. ""We would urge the government to help at this crucial time for business, to save the festive season and alleviate blockages now ahead of the UK's departure from the EU,"" said a spokesman. Adding to the calls for government to intervene at the ports are the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Food and Drink Federation (FDF). The two trade bodies have written to MPs to request an urgent inquiry into the ongoing disruption at UK ports and skyrocketing shipping rates. A spokesman for the Department for Transport (DfT) said: ""This is not a problem unique to the UK, with ports around the globe experiencing similar container capacity issues. The government is working closely with the freight industry to work through the challenges some of our ports are facing. ""Ports are employing more staff, as well as working with hauliers to improve container collection and with shipping lines to maximise efficient utilisation of port capacity. We will do everything we can to resolve the situation as quickly as possible."" 'Price rises likely' due to UK shipping problems Port in 'chaos' as Christmas and Brexit loom While many small toy shops are struggling, some larger toy retailers say they've managed to avoid problems at the ports by stockpiling early in the year. Many have also benefitted from booming toy sales as families spent more time at home during coronavirus lockdowns. ToyTown, which has 30 outlets across the UK, says it has had a bumper year with especially high orders of puzzles and games. ""We took a decision to load up pre-Brexit - if companies run a 'just-in-time' model, they'll suffer,"" explains managing director Alan Simpson. He says it is typical for some toy lines to run-out of stock before Christmas, but this year's port problems are ""limiting choice"" for retailers, and he's had to closely monitor his supply chain. Charlotte Khan and her husband Naveed run a toy store in Folkestone Charlotte Khan from children's boutique Moo Like a Monkey in Folkestone, Kent, says her business has had to be ""more resilient than ever this year"". After losing thousands of pounds due to shipping problems that have left her having to hold onto late-arriving stock for next year, she is planning to refocus on stockists much closer to home. ""I'm going to look much more locally for suppliers now, they're the ones who've kept us in more reliable stock,"" she said. ""Even though we've taken a hit on our Christmas turnover, we've dealt with worse this year, and at least we've been able to trade during our peak season. I'm grateful to still be in business.""

"There were queues of ambulances outside Antrim Area Hospital on Tuesday night Hospitals in Northern Ireland are continuing to face severe pressures after a night which saw queuing ambulances outside hospitals across NI. On Wednesday morning there were 48 people in the emergency department at Antrim Area hospital. On Tuesday night,doctors treated patients in ambulances with 17 vehicles outside the hospital at one point. An emergency department consultant from the Ulster Hospital said one patient there had waited 28 hours for a bed. Speaking on BBC's Evening Extra, Sean McGovern, said: ""That patient is still waiting, they're waiting within the emergency department. ""People are maybe waiting on a bed in a designated area within the emergency department, or waiting on a trolley."" At 11:25 GMT, there were 34 people waiting to be admitted to the Ulster Hospital, with 30 waiting more than 12 hours, according to a spokesperson for the South Eastern Trust. The spokesperson said there were 59 patients at the hospital's emergency department, with one waiting outside in an ambulance. Five of the patients had been in the department for between four and 12 hours. There have also been long waits at Antrim Hospital on Wednesday, with 48 people in the emergency department at 07:00 GMT. Of these, 43 were waiting to be admitted, with 29 of those people who have been waiting for more than 12 hours. Hundreds of hospital staff from across NI are also isolating for Covid-related reasons In a statement, the trust said it was ""not a situation that anyone wants to see"", adding that the hospital remained under ""severe pressure"". ""We sincerely apologise to the patients affected and their families. Staff are working very hard to try to manage the situation and maintain flow,"" the trust said. At hospitals in Belfast, 39 were awaiting admission - 29 more than 12 hours. In the Western Trust, 34 were awaiting admission - all 34 waiting more than 12 hours. In the Southern Trust hospitals, 60 were waiting admission but no figure for length of wait is known. The British Medical Association in Northern Ireland said the pressures on hospitals were ""extremely concerning"". A spokesperson said: ""I have spoken to many secondary care colleagues over the past few days who are very worried as to how hospitals are going to cope over the next few days and weeks, and the decisions they may have to take over how people are cared for."" Medical Director with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service Dr Nigel Ruddell said there had been 30 to 35 ambulances outside Emergency Departments across Northern Ireland on Tuesday night. He said they were ""the most significant queues"" he had seen in the 12 years he had worked for the ambulance service. ""What we are seeing reflects the pressure of the normal increase in illness, particularly among the elderly and, of course, the pressures of Covid,"" he told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. Dr Ruddell thanked the hospital and ambulance staff, and said it had taken a ""massive effort overnight"" to clear queues outside hospitals. Speaking to RTÃ's Morning Ireland programme on Wednesday, Wendy Magowan, the Northern Health Trust operations director, said ""whilst it has improved dramatically overnight we are still starting out this morning with a very low base rate"". There are also hundreds of staff isolating for Covid-related reasons. So far, 366 staff from the Southern Trust are isolating as are 681 from Belfast Trust, 324 from the Western Trust, 307 from the South Eastern Trust and 289 from the Northern Trust. Health Minister Robin Swann is to bring new proposals about Covid restrictions to Thursday's executive meeting. The meeting will see ministers look at options to manage the spread of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland. There were 17 ambulances queued at Antrim Hospital at 17:00 GMT on Tuesday Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said Sinn FÃ©in ""will support any proposals brought forward by the health minister to tackle the current situation."" Stronger guidance has been issued by London and the devolved governments about how people should celebrate Christmas this year. Relaxed rules between 23 December and 27 December are to stay in place. Mrs Foster and Ms O'Neill spoke to leaders from the other governments earlier and more guidance from the executive is expected later in the week. The big issue is not so much what they agree when it comes to restrictions, but the fact that compliance is not where it should be. The health service has stepped forward and they're hoping that they're going to listen to the voices that we heard last night with ambulances queued outside the hospitals. Health Minister Robin Swann is going to be bringing recommendations to the executive on Thursday for a decision around restrictions and the likelihood is that we will see, perhaps, an partial lockdown started after Christmas. We could be looking at, maybe, 28 December. The key concern is that we may be heading for a third wave at a point when our hospitals are saturated.

"The head of Hospitality Ulster has said he would prefer a full lockdown over partial restrictions Health officials have proposed a six-week lockdown across NI in a bid to curb the spread of the virus, BBC News NI understands. It is believed a review of the measures would take place after four weeks. Executive ministers are meeting to discuss the plan, brought by Health Minister Robin Swann. It proposes the closure of non-essential retail after Christmas Eve, and hospitality only allowed to offer takeaway services. Close contact services including hairdresser and beauty salons would also have to shut again. It is also understood health officials have proposed essential shops in NI would have to close by 20:00 GMT every night during the first week of a new lockdown. It is believed there could be changes to what is classed as essential retail, and the potential that click-and-collect services would not be permitted. The first week of a fresh lockdown could also see tighter rules on indoor and outdoor gatherings and a ban on people meeting others in private gardens. Health officials have also proposed measures to limit the reopening of schools in January and it's understood a package of interventions will be drawn up by the education and health departments. However any new lockdown restrictions will have to be signed off by the whole executive, which is meeting now to consider Mr Swann's paper. On Thursday, a further 12 Covid-linked deaths were recorded in NI and a further 656 cases of the virus. Hospitality Ulster said a full lockdown may now be required. Colin Neill says the board of Hospitality Ulster is aware of the situation at hospitals Chief executive Colin Neill said his board would support a full lockdown to get the virus under control. Mr Neill accepted a lockdown would have a big impact on the hospitality sector but added  ""what is worse is opening and closing all the time"". ""Every time you have to reopen costs a lot of money and every time you have to close costs a lot of money because of wastage,"" he told BBC's Stephen Nolan Show. ""If we are going for lockdown, then we will support a total lockdown until we get this thing under control,"" he said. ""I think we can all see the situation at our hospitals,"" he said. ""We need to go back to what we did in March and April."" Mr Neill said many within the hospitality sector only remained open so they could earn enough to pay their contribution towards furlough and retain their staff. The new proposals before the executive come amid warnings from health officials that the system is struggling with winter pressures exacerbated by the pandemic. Ministers will have to decide the date of when any new measures would take effect, how long they would last and how strict they would be. They will also assess the latest data from the chief medical officer and chief scientific adviser regarding the R-number in NI, which measures the infection rate of the virus. The executive has expressed concerns that the spread of the virus has not reduced following a two-week limited lockdown, and that cases could spike further after the Christmas holidays unless more interventions are introduced. Swann warns virus will cast shadow into January Patient waits 28 hours as hospitals struggle The lockdown, which ended last Friday, saw non-essential retail, close contact services and hospitality largely have to shut - but Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young said evidence showed not enough people had followed the ""stay at home"" guidance. There were queues of ambulances outside Antrim Area Hospital on Tuesday night, with hospitals in Northern Ireland continuing to face severe pressures Ministers are also expected to discuss a decision by England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales to strengthen guidance about how people can meet up with families over Christmas. On Wednesday, London and the devolved governments agreed to keep in place a plan to allow households to form ""Christmas bubbles"" from 23 to 27 December. The first and deputy first ministers said they wanted to ensure people in Northern Ireland were not isolated over Christmas, but stressed that ""personal responsibility"" should be a priority for anyone planning to have contact with others. Economy Minister Diane Dodds said she would also bring more details of her new support scheme for pubs that do not serve food, which have been forced to remain closed, to Thursday's executive meeting. It has yet to open, but last month the executiveallocated Â£10.6m in funding to the sector. It was always a case of when, not if, new restrictions would be imposed following the brief reprieve over Christmas. Mr Swann's use of the word ""extreme"" has some Stormont sources believing that we could be looking at a lockdown similar to that initially imposed back in March. It could even be tougher in some respects, with ministers aware a hard, long period of measures is needed in order to get transmission rates down. Expectations and anxieties have been raised yet again. Some businesses - having just reopened last week - will express frustration that they could lose out on important post-Christmas sales if they are told to shut again before New Year's Eve, particularly if extra financial support from Stormont isn't put in place. But the biggest issue ministers have to address is the lack of compliance, and there is a growing fear around the executive table that not enough people are heeding the message any more. Cases of the virus in Northern Ireland have not significantly reduced, despite several periods of restrictions since October. On Wednesday, eight deaths linked to Covid-19 were recorded in Northern Ireland, taking the Department of Health's total to 1,143. There were 510 more positive tests recorded, meaning there have been 59,631 cases overall. Health officials have urged the politicians to act quickly, in light of hospitals facing significant pressures that could increase as NI moves further into the winter flu season.

"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is leading the latest lawsuit against Google Ten US states, led by Texas, are suing Google, accusing it of taking illegal steps to preserve its monopoly over the online advertising market. The alleged moves include striking a deal with Facebook to manipulate online advertising auctions, the states said. This is the latest legal complaint facing the tech giant, which is under pressure from regulators globally. Google rejected the claims, saying it would be ""strongly"" defending itself in court. ""We've invested in state-of-the-art ad tech services that help businesses and benefit consumers. Digital ad prices have fallen over the last decade. Ad tech fees are falling too. Google's ad tech fees are lower than the industry average,"" a company spokesperson said in response to Wednesday's lawsuit. ""These are the hallmarks of a highly competitive industry."" Facebook declined to comment. The lawsuit,externaltakes aim at Google's control of the online advertising market, which it says was cemented in 2008 with its purchase of DoubleClick, the main software that publishers use to sell online advertising. Google's advertising sales account for over 80% of its revenues. EU reveals plan to regulate Big Tech UK plans tailored set of rules for each tech giant The 10 states suing Google are Texas, Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, Mississippi, South Dakota, North Dakota, Utah and Idaho, all of which have Republican prosecutors. The states claim Google used its new role to benefit other parts of its business, for example by forcing publishers to license its advertising servers. The lawsuit also says the firm took steps to secretly undercut innovations that were circumventing its fees. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The lawsuit also accuses Google of giving Facebook advantages in online advertising markets, in exchange for the firm dropping some of its plans to compete. ""Google repeatedly used its monopolistic power to control pricing, engage in market collusion to rig auctions in a tremendous violation of justice,"" said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in a video announcing the lawsuit, posted on Twitter. ""Right now, when you visit the website of a news outlet you know and trust, like the Wall Street Journal or your favourite local paper, you'll see advertisements likely placed there by Google. But Google doesn't tell you - the public - that they manipulate the advertising auctions, and they continually illegally profit by taking money away from those web pages and putting it in their own pockets."" He added that the tech giant was a ""Goliath of a company"" using its power to manipulate the market, and that this was causing harm to every US citizen. ""It isn't fair that Google can harm the web pages you visit and read,"" said Mr Paxton. ""Let me put it this way - if the free market were a baseball game, Google positioned itself as the pitcher, the batter and the umpire."" The lawsuit adds to the scrutiny facing Google's operations, in which it serves as both a search engine serving up results, as well as a broker of online advertising sales. In October, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) filed a landmark anti-monopoly lawsuit against the firm, focusing on the billions of dollars Google pays each year to ensure its search engine is installed as the default option on browsers and devices like mobile phones. Google has maintained that it is operating in a competitive market, with new threats emerging from Amazon and others. But it is not the only tech firm to find itself in regulators' crosshairs - in the UK and Europe in recent weeks, officials have announced plans for new rules aimed at regulating Big Tech. Facebook this month was hit by lawsuits from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and nearly all 50 US states, also over monopoly abuse. And over time, internet giants are increasingly being criticised for their impact on the global media industry and content publishers. Many news providers say they are struggling to survive and feel tech giants and social networks have thrived by reposting and aggregating news content. Earlier this month,Facebook announced that it would begin paying UK news publishers for some articles in January, following a similar move in the US.

"Regions in England will find out later whether they will be moved to a different tier of Covid restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to announce the outcome of the latest review of the three-tier system, after government officials met on Wednesday. In several areas of northern England, leaders say they have met the criteria to move from tier three to two, after a drop in infection rates. Leaders in Lancashire have been told it will stay, as expected, in tier three. NHS bosses have warned against easing restrictions ""prematurely"". More than 34 million people - or 61% of England's population - are living under tier three rules, the highest level of restrictions, including large parts of the Midlands, Yorkshire, the North East and the North West. On Wednesday, London and parts of Essex and Hertfordshiremoved to tier threeamid a rise in infection rates. Mr Hancock is expected to make a statement at 11:30 GMT. How does England's three-tier system work? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live UK coronavirus cases up by 25,161 on Wednesday Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said ""the evidence would support"" parts of the region being moved from tier three to tier two, but he feels ""less and less hopeful"". He previously said there had been ""steady decreases"" across all of the region's 10 boroughs and its average rate is around 150 cases per 100,000 - below the England-wide average of 194. In an interview on BBC Breakfast, he said therelaxation of the rules between 23 and 27 Decemberwas ""a mistake"" and ministers could try to ""overcompensate with the decisions on the tiers"". He added that requiring hospitality venues to close as part of tier three measures at this time of year creates ""a substantial risk of many more gatherings in the home.. and that is where most of the virus spreads"". Meanwhile, the leader of Preston City Council, Cllr Matthew Brown said he believed Lancashire will remain in tier three. He said he remained ""gravely concerned"" about the impact of restrictions on the hospitality and culture sectors. ""However, while case numbers in Preston and throughout Lancashire remain high, especially in the over 60s, it is unlikely that we will be placed into tier two before Christmas,"" he said. It is understandable those on the front line of the NHS would want tighter restrictions - they see the impact of severe Covid first hand. But that is just one part of the equation. Councils in areas where cases are falling are torn - they don't want to see their progress in containing the virus reversed. But the impact on the economy disproportionately affects young people, who are more likely to work in hospitality, and that widens health inequalities. What will the government do? It seems very unlikely many areas will move down a tier. There is certainly a big call to be made about Manchester, which is in tier three but has continued to see progress, after Liverpool was moved down into tier two following lockdown. In the South East, there are areas around London that have rates below the national average, but they are rising. Will the government move them into tier three as a preventative measure, or wait and see if the tighter restrictions in London curbs the rising rates in this part of the country? We are about to find out. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, said there was ""a ring of areas around London - for example, in the home counties - where trusts are alarmed at the rise in infection rates and hospital admissions"". In a statement, he said the government must ""urgently consider"" adding other areas to tier three, where infection rates are ""similarly worrying"". Mr Hopson also said there was ""real concern in many trusts in the northern half of the country about leaving tier three prematurely"". ""It is good news that infection rates are dropping, in some cases significantly,"" he said. ""But we can't afford to let up. As soon as infection rates rise, excess death rates rise too."" He warned hospitals in the north of England still had ""very high levels"" of Covid-19 patients and ""even a small increase"" would ""put those hospitals under significant pressure"". About 99% of England's population are currently in tiers two and three, with only the Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly in tier one. The placing of areas in each tier is reviewed every 14 days. Decisions are based on an examination of coronavirus cases across all age groups and specifically among the over-60s, who are more vulnerable to the virus. Officials also look at whether infection rates are rising or falling in an area and the positivity rate - meaning the number of positive cases detected as a percentage of tests taken - as well as the pressure on the NHS. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'A shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas' It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnsonurged people to keep Christmas celebrations ""short"" and ""small""to reduce the risk of spreading Covid over the festive period. Restrictions will still be relaxed between 23 and 27 December, allowing three households to form a ""Christmas bubble"" and mix indoors and stay overnight. However, in Wales,the law will change to limit bubbles to two households. A joint statement by the governments of the UK, Scotland and Wales urged people to think very carefully before forming a bubble and ""strongly recommended"" people spend Christmas with their own household if possible. In Northern Ireland, First Minister Arlene Foster said the public must take ""all and every precaution"" over the festive period and proposals for further restrictions would be brought forward on Thursday. Home Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Breakfast there would be no changes to the enforcement of measures over Christmas, but that the ""public are part of"" upholding the law and are ""working together"" with the police. This video can not be played England Covid-19 tiers: Laura Foster explains the rules The UK recorded a further 25,161 coronavirus cases on Wednesday, along with 612 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Public Health Wales said that an extra 11,000 positive Covid tests are missingfrom its official figures, meaning cases in Wales in the last week could be twice as high as previously thought. Meanwhile, Minister Nadhim Zahawi, who is in charge of the UK's vaccination rollout, saidmore than 130,000 people were vaccinated in the first week of the programme. Sir Ian McKellen, 81, said he felt ""euphoric"" ashe became the latest celebrity to be photographed receiving the vaccine.

"Toy store owner Hellen Stirling-Baker says container delays have cost her Â£20,000 in sales so far - 40% of her annual turnover Delays at UK ports mean a number of toy orders will now miss Christmas, according to the British Toy and Hobby Association (BTHA). The industry body has called on the government to help ""save the festive season"" by easing port congestion. Hellen Stirling-Baker, who runs a Sheffield shop, says she has lost Â£20,000 in sales because of container delays, or 40% of her annual turnover. Other shops say it is impossible to order some popular toys including Lego. Ms Stirling-Baker has been told that her order of cotton Dinkum Dolls, made in China, won't arrive in England until 7 January. The British company that designs the dolls told her their container is held up in customs, but it's already experienced seven weeks of delays due to the pandemic, port congestion and other logistics issues. Other toy orders from Ms Stirling-Baker has made have arrived incomplete. ""I just received an order today which I placed three weeks ago, and only part [of it] has come. The rest is stuck in ports,"" she said. ""Demand has been really high but stock levels are low."" While many UK importers are struggling with the congestion issues at Felixstowe and Southampton, the toy sector has been particularly hard hit, since the problems have coincided with the peak Christmas season. The Leeds-based toy designer Boxer Gifts, which manufacturers its products in China, estimates a loss in sales of up to Â£1m this year due to stock delays. Managing director Thomas O'Brien says one of his containers is currently stuck in the Belgian port of Zeebrugge and there's no way it will get to the UK in time for Christmas. ""Some of the ships are bypassing the UK and tipping off at European ports, but others are just slowing down because they've got nowhere to unload,"" he said. ""Various games and stocking-filler toys such as Grow-a-Sloth are hugely popular, but we've had stock outages for months because shipments are delayed and that's costing us sales. ""More importantly it's reducing availability for consumers to find fun gifts. There's less about."" Toy designer Boxer Gifts says lost sales from shipping delays will mean less money for innovation next year. Like many importers, Mr O'Brien has also had to contend with a sharp rise in shipping costs, as shipping firms hike up freight rates in response to port congestion and a shortage of empty containers in Asia. He says containers shipped from Qingdao, China to Felixstowe are costing him $10,000 (Â£7,492.03), rather than the normal rate of $2,500. BTHA has called on the government to help where it can. ""We would urge the government to help at this crucial time for business, to save the festive season and alleviate blockages now ahead of the UK's departure from the EU,"" said a spokesman. Adding to the calls for government to intervene at the ports are the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and the Food and Drink Federation (FDF). The two trade bodies have written to MPs to request an urgent inquiry into the ongoing disruption at UK ports and skyrocketing shipping rates. A spokesman for the Department for Transport (DfT) said: ""This is not a problem unique to the UK, with ports around the globe experiencing similar container capacity issues. The government is working closely with the freight industry to work through the challenges some of our ports are facing. ""Ports are employing more staff, as well as working with hauliers to improve container collection and with shipping lines to maximise efficient utilisation of port capacity. We will do everything we can to resolve the situation as quickly as possible."" 'Price rises likely' due to UK shipping problems Port in 'chaos' as Christmas and Brexit loom While many small toy shops are struggling, some larger toy retailers say they've managed to avoid problems at the ports by stockpiling early in the year. Many have also benefitted from booming toy sales as families spent more time at home during coronavirus lockdowns. ToyTown, which has 30 outlets across the UK, says it has had a bumper year with especially high orders of puzzles and games. ""We took a decision to load up pre-Brexit - if companies run a 'just-in-time' model, they'll suffer,"" explains managing director Alan Simpson. He says it is typical for some toy lines to run-out of stock before Christmas, but this year's port problems are ""limiting choice"" for retailers, and he's had to closely monitor his supply chain. Charlotte Khan and her husband Naveed run a toy store in Folkestone Charlotte Khan from children's boutique Moo Like a Monkey in Folkestone, Kent, says her business has had to be ""more resilient than ever this year"". After losing thousands of pounds due to shipping problems that have left her having to hold onto late-arriving stock for next year, she is planning to refocus on stockists much closer to home. ""I'm going to look much more locally for suppliers now, they're the ones who've kept us in more reliable stock,"" she said. ""Even though we've taken a hit on our Christmas turnover, we've dealt with worse this year, and at least we've been able to trade during our peak season. I'm grateful to still be in business.""

"Temporary accommodation is not always suitable for families The number of people in temporary accommodation in England is at its highest level in 14 years, says a new report by charity Shelter. It jumped by 6,000 in the first three months of the pandemic and now stands at 253,000, according to Shelter's analysis of government data. Temporary accommodation offered by councils ranges from bed and breakfasts to self-contained flats. The government says finding people a permanent home is a ""priority"". It suggests the increase in people living in temporary accommodation this year may be down to the ""everyone in"" scheme, which aimed to get rough sleepers off the streets and out of hostels at the start of the pandemic. Fund launched to buy homes for homeless Families 'face period of destitution' during Covid Labour: Take all rough sleepers off streets again Local councils have placed more than 15,000 homeless people in emergency accommodation, such as hotels, student flats and bed and breakfasts, since March. Councils are now attempting to find permanent homes for many of them, with the aid of a Â£266m pot of money known as the Next Steps Accommodation Programme. But Shelter says a shortage of social housing means families made homeless during the pandemic have become ""trapped"" in often cramped, dirty and insecure accommodation, with little hope of a permanent home. Jenny was placed in a tiny self-contained flat in South West London, with her two children, aged one and three, after they became homeless four months ago. She lives in fear of the other residents. she says. ""It is awful. They are trying to get into here all the time. They keep nicking stuff from us. There are needles all over the place and broken glass. You can smell the drugs in the rooms. At night you can't sleep. I'm worried they will come and take my children."" The family had to move out of their first temporary flat, as it was infested with bed bugs, but their latest accommodation is not much of an improvement, says Jenny, and she is worried about the impact it is having on her children. She is trying to make the best of if for now. ""I have bought presents for the kids. I am going to try and make it Christmassy for them. I have got a little Â£2 tree."" But she was recently told it could be up to three years before the family is offered a permanent home. ""I don't want anybody to live like this,"" she says. ""It's not fair."" Shelter's chief executive Polly Neate said: ""Over a quarter of a million people - half of them children - are homeless and stuck in temporary accommodation. This should shame us all. ""With this deadly virus on the loose, 2020 has taught us the value of a safe home like never before. But too many are going without, because of the chronic lack of social homes."" According to Shelter's analysis, 68% of all homeless people living in temporary accommodation are in London, which amounts to 1 in 52 of the city's population. Outside of London, Luton has the highest rate of people in temporary accommodation (1 in 55), followed by Brighton and Hove (1 in 78), Manchester (1 in 93) and Birmingham (1 in 94). A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""Reducing the number of households in temporary accommodation is a priority for this government. This is why we are investing over Â£750m to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping next year. ""Our Homelessness Reduction Act has helped over 270,000 households who were homeless or at risk of homelessness into more permanent accommodation since it came into force in 2018."" But Labour's shadow housing secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, said homelessness had doubled under the Conservatives and ""their irresponsible mismanagement of the Covid crisis threatens to make this even worse, with unemployment expected to spike next year"". ""Too many people will spend this Christmas without a safe and stable home,"" she added. ""For families having to live with no kitchen and little space this will be devastating.""

"This video can not be played Friends and family line the street in an emotional homecoming A man who was given ""almost zero"" chances of surviving after contracting Covid-19 has spoken of how his world has been ""turned upside down"". Mal Martin, 58, was taken to Bridgend's Princess of Wales Hospital in March, a week after ""feeling unwell"" and placed on a ventilator for 61 days. His wife and children even said their goodbyes before he was put into an induced coma. But Mr Martin's recovery was described by doctors as a ""miracle"". 'My husband's chances are almost zero they told me' Dad 'still with us' despite slim survival hope ""Basically it's turned my world upside down but at the same time, I'm getting stronger,"" he told BBC Radio 4'sTodayprogramme. ""I can only walk so far, I'm having lots of dizziness, I've got problems with my lungs, I've got major problems with my kidneys. On Mal Martin's seventh day in hospital, his family were told to prepare for the worst ""My kidneys are only running at 12% at the moment and it's just been horrific really. I need to either go on dialysis for the rest of my life, or a kidney transplant. ""I've lost vision in my right eye which I'll never get back and I've had amputations on my hands - I've lost my thumb from on my one hand and I've lost a forefinger and a half a finger and my thumb is going to come off my right hand."" Mr Martin was taken to hospital just before the UK went into a national lockdown in March. This video can not be played Sue Martin spoke to the BBC about Mal in April Mr Martin is diabetic, which is genetic, not life-style related. Four years ago he'd had a heart attack and had three stents fitted. He recovered well, did park runs regularly and never drank heavily or smoked. Doctors reassured his family that his diabetes was controlled and that he was fit and healthy. He said he does not remember the first two weeks, describing them as ""a blank"", and after that he ""honestly felt it was over"", as did his doctors. He added: ""My consultant said to me my wife and my children came in to say goodbye - he wasn't supposed to have said that to be fair - but he did it and that really sort of got to me at the time. ""Under the ventilation I was having a lot of hallucinations and things, and some scary moments and seeing masks all the time around me. ""I remember one of the nurses saying to me that she held my hand all night... and she wouldn't let go. ""I thought just how amazing the NHS has been and everybody involved really has been fantastic."" The coronavirus pandemic has claimed more than 1.6 million deaths from more than 73 million confirmed cases around the world. There is hope of an end in sight withvaccinations starting to be rolled out. But Mr Martin, who has been recovering at home since July, said there were still people out there who were not taking the virus seriously. From his hospital bed, Mr Martin told his wife Sue ""I want to come home"" ""It's a horrible, horrible, horrible disease to have and I think if I could have any wish, it would be that it would all go away,"" he said. ""But I suppose the biggest wish is for people to understand I was healthy. ""It astounds me really that there's so many people losing their lives, there's so many people in the same position I'm in and in worse positions than I'm in and people are still not taking heed and not understanding.

"Temporary accommodation is not always suitable for families The number of people in temporary accommodation in England is at its highest level in 14 years, says a new report by charity Shelter. It jumped by 6,000 in the first three months of the pandemic and now stands at 253,000, according to Shelter's analysis of government data. Temporary accommodation offered by councils ranges from bed and breakfasts to self-contained flats. The government says finding people a permanent home is a ""priority"". It suggests the increase in people living in temporary accommodation this year may be down to the ""everyone in"" scheme, which aimed to get rough sleepers off the streets and out of hostels at the start of the pandemic. Fund launched to buy homes for homeless Families 'face period of destitution' during Covid Labour: Take all rough sleepers off streets again Local councils have placed more than 15,000 homeless people in emergency accommodation, such as hotels, student flats and bed and breakfasts, since March. Councils are now attempting to find permanent homes for many of them, with the aid of a Â£266m pot of money known as the Next Steps Accommodation Programme. But Shelter says a shortage of social housing means families made homeless during the pandemic have become ""trapped"" in often cramped, dirty and insecure accommodation, with little hope of a permanent home. Jenny was placed in a tiny self-contained flat in South West London, with her two children, aged one and three, after they became homeless four months ago. She lives in fear of the other residents. she says. ""It is awful. They are trying to get into here all the time. They keep nicking stuff from us. There are needles all over the place and broken glass. You can smell the drugs in the rooms. At night you can't sleep. I'm worried they will come and take my children."" The family had to move out of their first temporary flat, as it was infested with bed bugs, but their latest accommodation is not much of an improvement, says Jenny, and she is worried about the impact it is having on her children. She is trying to make the best of if for now. ""I have bought presents for the kids. I am going to try and make it Christmassy for them. I have got a little Â£2 tree."" But she was recently told it could be up to three years before the family is offered a permanent home. ""I don't want anybody to live like this,"" she says. ""It's not fair."" Shelter's chief executive Polly Neate said: ""Over a quarter of a million people - half of them children - are homeless and stuck in temporary accommodation. This should shame us all. ""With this deadly virus on the loose, 2020 has taught us the value of a safe home like never before. But too many are going without, because of the chronic lack of social homes."" According to Shelter's analysis, 68% of all homeless people living in temporary accommodation are in London, which amounts to 1 in 52 of the city's population. Outside of London, Luton has the highest rate of people in temporary accommodation (1 in 55), followed by Brighton and Hove (1 in 78), Manchester (1 in 93) and Birmingham (1 in 94). A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""Reducing the number of households in temporary accommodation is a priority for this government. This is why we are investing over Â£750m to tackle homelessness and rough sleeping next year. ""Our Homelessness Reduction Act has helped over 270,000 households who were homeless or at risk of homelessness into more permanent accommodation since it came into force in 2018."" But Labour's shadow housing secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, said homelessness had doubled under the Conservatives and ""their irresponsible mismanagement of the Covid crisis threatens to make this even worse, with unemployment expected to spike next year"". ""Too many people will spend this Christmas without a safe and stable home,"" she added. ""For families having to live with no kitchen and little space this will be devastating.""

"Diagnostic tests fell dramatically in England during the first six months of the pandemic Millions of people missed out on potentially life-saving scans when non-Covid-19 NHS services almost ground to a halt this year, analysis shows. In England, at least 4.4 million fewer scans were performed between April and September this year compared to the same period in 2019. One in seven people are now waiting more than three months for a scan as the NHS attempts to clear the backlog. NHS England says some services are now back to the same levels as last year. But professional bodies and Cancer Research UK say the period of inactivity has left a backlog that could leave a swathe of people presenting at hospital in a worsened condition. ""Those patients could be diagnosed with a more aggressive, later-stage cancer,"" said Jody Moffatt, head of early diagnosis for Cancer Research UK. ""There is a cohort of patients out there that have not been diagnosed yet - and who knows what state they will be in when they are."" Former social worker Toni Cunnington had an ultrasound cancelled in March Toni Cunnington, a former social intervention worker and mother of four, had an MRI scan at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust cancelled in March, even though she suspected she had cancer due to a genetic condition. She is now undergoing aggressive chemotherapy for a stage-four lymphoma. ""The symptoms I've had mostly from January to now have been horrific,"" said Toni, 34, who believes her condition would not have deteriorated as much if her cancer had been caught earlier. Earlier in November she had to have white blood cells drained from her lungs. She now spends most of her time in a wheelchair as the chemotherapy leaves her weak. While she is grateful for the NHS, she says she is concerned potential cancer patients are being considered a low priority during the crisis. ""I feel like my life isn't worth as much as a Covid patient,"" she said. ""I just don't want to leave my children and I don't want to die. I'm not ready to die, I just really wish it was caught early."" Chief medical officer at Leeds Teaching Hospitals Dr Phil Wood said the trust ""regrettably had to make difficult decisions"" during the first wave of the pandemic and said he was pleased Toni was ""receiving the appropriate treatment and care"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SYMPTOMS:85% of patients have one of these three symptoms JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) and the British Institute for Radiology (BIR) say the fall in the number of scans was because trusts were told to cancel non-essential appointments at the end of March. But they say the backlog created by the virus has ""exacerbated"" issues linked to a lack of scanners in the UK, as well as a shortfall of 6,000 radiologists and radiographers in the profession. Appointments had to be limited at smaller hospitals with only one MRI scanner, an RCR spokesman said, as the machines had to be kept free for coronavirus patients. Radiologists were also pulled off wards to help in other parts of the hospital, he said. The BBC Shared Data Unit analysed the number of scans carried out by 103 hospital trusts across England as well as the waiting times for diagnostics across the home nations. While scans, including MRI, CT and ultrasound, dropped by a third overall in England during the six-month period between April and September - the largest reductions were felt in the North West and London. Trusts in the capital carried out 39% less scans than the previous year compared to a 26% drop in the South East. In the North West, one in three patients was waiting more than six weeks for a scan in October, compared to one in five in the South East. Some individual hospitals reduced scans considerably more than others, particularly small private facilities. Dorset Healthcare University hospital and Manchester University hospital saw the largest drops at NHS facilities - 70% and 64% respectively. Waiting lists and waiting times across the home nations also grew during the first six months of the pandemic. NHS guidance in England and Scotland states patients should receive a scan within six weeks of referral. In Scotland, 15,000 patients had waited for more than six weeks according to a snapshot in September 2019. This year, the figure was closer to 48,000, with similar rises experienced in Wales and Northern Ireland. Dr William Ramsden said the pandemic had 'exacerbated' the shortage in radiology staff The overall number of people on the waiting list for one of the 15 main diagnostic tests in England increased by 250,000 to 1.27 million. Vice-president of the RCR, Dr William Ramsden, said: ""The trouble is, because of our capacity issues, because of our workforce issues, we can't get through the work as fast as we'd like."" Areport by former national cancer director,externalProf Sir Mike Richards last year said the NHS was in need of 2,000 more radiologists and needed to increase its base of CT and MRI scanners, many of which were aging and in need of regular maintenance. Man who 'begged' for MRI scan dies from cancer Covid 'may see England cancer survival rate fall' 'Rash' Christmas Covid rules 'will cost many lives' Though the government pledged Â£200m towards new equipment in September 2019, the Health Foundation said Â£1.5bn would be needed to bring the UK up to the required capacity. At the time, the UK had the lowest number of both CT and MRI scanners per capita among the EU15 and G7 countries. This video can not be played Why this cancer patient feels coronavirus has 'cost me a future' NHS England recently contracted 34 mobile CT scanners to visit hospitals around the country. But more needs to be done to bring down the growing waiting list in the short term, according to BIR vice-president Dr Nick Screaton. ""We need to recruit from abroad and I know trusts are already making great efforts to do that,"" he said. ""The NHS will also have to think more broadly about doing things differently. I think people will be much more willing to listen to the idea of regional diagnostic hubs as a result of the crisis."" An NHS England spokesman said, despite rising Covid-19 hospitalisations, CT scans were now back to the same levels as last year. MRI scans are also back up to 88% compared to last October and GP appointments are now operating at ""well above usual levels"", the spokesman added. ""The NHS message to the public remains the same,"" he said. ""Come forward and get the care you need.""

"The capsule touched down on snow-covered grassland China's Chang'e-5 mission has returned to Earth with the cargo of rock and ""soil"" it picked up off the Moon. A capsule carrying the materials landed in Inner Mongolia at 01:59 local time on Thursday (17:59 GMT, Wednesday). It's more than 40 years since the American Apollo and Soviet Luna missions brought their samples home. The new specimens should provide fresh insight on the geology and early history of Earth's satellite. For China, the successful completion of the Chang'e-5 venture will also be seen as another demonstration of the nation's increasing capability in space. Recovery teams were quick to move in on the returned capsule. It was first spotted by helicopters using infrared cameras. Support staff following up in SUVs planted a Chinese flag in the snow-covered grassland next to the module.

The Chang'e-5 venture was launched at the end of November. A probe comprising several elements was sent into orbit around the Moon. These elements then separated, with one half going down to the lunar surface. The lander system used a scoop and a drill to dig up samples. It's not clear how much, but possibly in the range of 2-4kg. An ascent vehicle subsequently carried the materials back into lunar orbit where they were transferred to an Earth-return module. This was shepherded home by a fourth element and released just before it had to make the fiery descent through Earth's atmosphere. The mission spent only two days on the Moon's surface gathering samples The capsule's contents will be removed in a dedicated laboratory Returning from the Moon, the Chang'e-5 module would have been moving much faster than, say, a capsule coming back from the International Space Station. Engineers had chosen to scrub some of this extra energy by doing an initial ""skip"" in the atmosphere. This saw the module briefly dip into the gases that shroud our planet, before then plunging much deeper to try to reach Earth's surface. The Chang'e-5 capsule was targeted to float down on parachute to Siziwang Banner in Inner Mongolia. This is the same location used to bring Chinese astronauts home. Again, infrared cameras were on hand to follow the action by detecting the heat of the module. Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical tests Water on the Moon could sustain a lunar base Artemis: To the Moon and Beyond A total of just under 400kg of lunar surface materials were collected by American Apollo astronauts and the Soviets' robotic Luna landers. But all these samples were very old - more than three billion years in age. Chang'e-5's rock and dust should be quite different. The Chinese mission targeted a high volcanic region called Mons RÃ¼mker in the northwest of the nearside of the Moon. Samples from this terrain may be no more than 1.2 or 1.3 billion years old, and, as such, should provide additional information on how the Moon is constructed internally. The samples will also allow scientists to more precisely calibrate the ""chronometer"" they use to age surfaces on the inner Solar System planets. This is done by counting craters (the more craters, the older the surface), but it depends on having some definitive dating at a number of locations, and the Apollo and Soviet samples were key to this. Chang'e-5 would offer a further data point. Chinese space officials have said the new samples will be shared with the UN and international partners. The Chinese public will also get to see some of the materials when they are put on display in a national museum. This video can not be played Watch the moment the Chang'e-5 mission launches from Earth The Moon is once again in vogue. America is planning on returning astronauts to the surface in the middle of this decade. A series of robotic spacecraft will land ahead of these human explorers to do reconnaissance. Some of these probes will be from national space agencies; some will be sent by commercial enterprises - including from the UK. Tony Azzarelli, director and co-founder of the UK industry space body Access Space Alliance, said exciting times lay ahead, and highlighted the start-up Spacebit's quest to put a rover on the lunar surface next year. ""It'll be the first time that a legged robot will walk on another celestial world. Of course, all of these lunar missions are just a prelude to the return of humans to the Moon in the not-too-distant future,"" he told BBC News.

"Regions in England will find out later whether they will be moved to a different tier of Covid restrictions. Health Secretary Matt Hancock is due to announce the outcome of the latest review of the three-tier system, after government officials met on Wednesday. In several areas of northern England, leaders say they have met the criteria to move from tier three to two, after a drop in infection rates. Leaders in Lancashire have been told it will stay, as expected, in tier three. NHS bosses have warned against easing restrictions ""prematurely"". More than 34 million people - or 61% of England's population - are living under tier three rules, the highest level of restrictions, including large parts of the Midlands, Yorkshire, the North East and the North West. On Wednesday, London and parts of Essex and Hertfordshiremoved to tier threeamid a rise in infection rates. Mr Hancock is expected to make a statement at 11:30 GMT. How does England's three-tier system work? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live UK coronavirus cases up by 25,161 on Wednesday Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham said ""the evidence would support"" parts of the region being moved from tier three to tier two, but he feels ""less and less hopeful"". He previously said there had been ""steady decreases"" across all of the region's 10 boroughs and its average rate is around 150 cases per 100,000 - below the England-wide average of 194. In an interview on BBC Breakfast, he said therelaxation of the rules between 23 and 27 Decemberwas ""a mistake"" and ministers could try to ""overcompensate with the decisions on the tiers"". He added that requiring hospitality venues to close as part of tier three measures at this time of year creates ""a substantial risk of many more gatherings in the home.. and that is where most of the virus spreads"". Meanwhile, the leader of Preston City Council, Cllr Matthew Brown said he believed Lancashire will remain in tier three. He said he remained ""gravely concerned"" about the impact of restrictions on the hospitality and culture sectors. ""However, while case numbers in Preston and throughout Lancashire remain high, especially in the over 60s, it is unlikely that we will be placed into tier two before Christmas,"" he said. It is understandable those on the front line of the NHS would want tighter restrictions - they see the impact of severe Covid first hand. But that is just one part of the equation. Councils in areas where cases are falling are torn - they don't want to see their progress in containing the virus reversed. But the impact on the economy disproportionately affects young people, who are more likely to work in hospitality, and that widens health inequalities. What will the government do? It seems very unlikely many areas will move down a tier. There is certainly a big call to be made about Manchester, which is in tier three but has continued to see progress, after Liverpool was moved down into tier two following lockdown. In the South East, there are areas around London that have rates below the national average, but they are rising. Will the government move them into tier three as a preventative measure, or wait and see if the tighter restrictions in London curbs the rising rates in this part of the country? We are about to find out. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, said there was ""a ring of areas around London - for example, in the home counties - where trusts are alarmed at the rise in infection rates and hospital admissions"". In a statement, he said the government must ""urgently consider"" adding other areas to tier three, where infection rates are ""similarly worrying"". Mr Hopson also said there was ""real concern in many trusts in the northern half of the country about leaving tier three prematurely"". ""It is good news that infection rates are dropping, in some cases significantly,"" he said. ""But we can't afford to let up. As soon as infection rates rise, excess death rates rise too."" He warned hospitals in the north of England still had ""very high levels"" of Covid-19 patients and ""even a small increase"" would ""put those hospitals under significant pressure"". About 99% of England's population are currently in tiers two and three, with only the Isle of Wight, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly in tier one. The placing of areas in each tier is reviewed every 14 days. Decisions are based on an examination of coronavirus cases across all age groups and specifically among the over-60s, who are more vulnerable to the virus. Officials also look at whether infection rates are rising or falling in an area and the positivity rate - meaning the number of positive cases detected as a percentage of tests taken - as well as the pressure on the NHS. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'A shorter Christmas is a safer Christmas' It comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnsonurged people to keep Christmas celebrations ""short"" and ""small""to reduce the risk of spreading Covid over the festive period. Restrictions will still be relaxed between 23 and 27 December, allowing three households to form a ""Christmas bubble"" and mix indoors and stay overnight. However, in Wales,the law will change to limit bubbles to two households. A joint statement by the governments of the UK, Scotland and Wales urged people to think very carefully before forming a bubble and ""strongly recommended"" people spend Christmas with their own household if possible. In Northern Ireland, First Minister Arlene Foster said the public must take ""all and every precaution"" over the festive period and proposals for further restrictions would be brought forward on Thursday. Home Secretary Priti Patel told BBC Breakfast there would be no changes to the enforcement of measures over Christmas, but that the ""public are part of"" upholding the law and are ""working together"" with the police.

Public Health Wales said that an extra 11,000 positive Covid tests are missingfrom its official figures, meaning cases in Wales in the last week could be twice as high as previously thought. Meanwhile, Minister Nadhim Zahawi, who is in charge of the UK's vaccination rollout, saidmore than 130,000 people were vaccinated in the first week of the programme. Sir Ian McKellen, 81, said he felt ""euphoric"" ashe became the latest celebrity to be photographed receiving the vaccine.

"Dutch prosecutors have found a hacker did successfully log in to Donald Trump's Twitter account by guessing his password - ""MAGA2020!"" But they will not be punishing Victor Gevers, who was acting ""ethically"". Mr Gevers shared what he said were screenshots of the inside of Mr Trump's account on 22 October, during the final stages of the US presidential election. But at the time, the White House denied it had been hacked and Twitter said it had no evidence of it. In reference to the latest development, Twitter said: ""We've seen no evidence to corroborate this claim, including from the article published in the Netherlands today. We proactively implemented account security measures for a designated group of high-profile, election-related Twitter accounts in the United States, including federal branches of government."" The White House has not responded to a request for further comment. Mr Gevers had previously shared this screenshot that appeared to show him editing Donald Trump's Twitter profile information Mr Gevers said he was very happy with the outcome. ""This is not just about my work but all volunteers who look for vulnerabilities in the internet,"" he said. The well respected cyber-security researcher said he had been conducting a semi-regular sweep of the Twitter accounts of high-profile US election candidates, on 16 October, when he had guessed President Trump's password. Victor Gevers has been discovering security flaws in software and websites for 22 years Dutch police said: ""The hacker released the login himself. ""He later stated to police that he had investigated the strength of the password because there were major interests involved if this Twitter account could be taken over so shortly before the presidential election."" They had sent the US authorities their findings, they added. Mr Gevers had told officers he had substantially more evidence of the ""hack"". In theory, he would have been able to see all the president's data, including: private photos and messages privately bookmarked tweets how many people he had blocked The president's account, which has 89 million followers, is now secure. But Twitter has refused to answer direct questions from BBC News, including whether the account had extra security or logs that would have shown an unknown login. Earlier this year, Mr Gevers also claimed he and other security researchers had logged in to Mr Trump's Twitter account in 2016 using a password - ""yourefired"" - linked to another of his social-network accounts in a previous data breach.
