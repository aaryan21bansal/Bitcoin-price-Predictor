"Finland has been named the happiest country for a fourth year running Finland has been named the happiest place in the world for a fourth year running, in an annual UN-sponsored report. TheWorld Happiness Report,externalsaw Denmark in second place, then Switzerland, Iceland and the Netherlands. New Zealand was again the only non-European nation in the top 10. The UK fell from 13th to 17th place. Data fromanalytics researcher Gallup,externalasked people in 149 countries to rate their own happiness. Measures including social support, personal freedom, gross domestic product (GDP) and levels of corruption were also factored in. The country deemed the most unhappy in the world was Afghanistan, followed by Lesotho, Botswana, Rwanda and Zimbabwe. There was a ""significantly higher frequency of negative emotions"" in just over a third of the countries, the report authors said, likely pointing to the effects of the pandemic. However, things got better for 22 countries. Several Asian countries fared better than they had in last year's rankings, while China moved to 84th place from 94th. ""Surprisingly there was not, on average, a decline in well-being when measured by people's own evaluation of their lives,"" John Helliwell, one of the report's authors, said in a statement. ""One possible explanation is that people see Covid-19 as a common, outside threat affecting everybody and that this has generated a greater sense of solidarity and fellow-feeling."" Finland ""ranked very high on the measures of mutual trust that have helped to protect lives and livelihoods during the pandemic"", the authors said. The Nordic nation of 5.5 million people has managed far better than the majority of Europe during the pandemic, with just over 70,000 cases and 805 deaths, according toJohns Hopkins University,external.

"Tyrone and Alina appear to share a kiss but they are played here by a real-life couple When Tyrone and Alina stole a kiss in Friday's episode of Coronation Street, many viewers will have been rightly left wondering how they filmed it following social distancing guidelines. The answer: real-life kissing doubles. Actors Alan Halsall and Ruxandra Porojnicu were filmed talking before their kiss, but did not get within two metres of one another, ITV bosses said. Instead, regular Corrie extra Alex Mulvaney and his wife Hannah then stepped in for the romantic moment. How EastEnders is 'cheating' with kissing scenes ""My agent said that Coronation Street needed extras who were in a support bubble, and because I used to be an extra three times a week and they knew half of my family had done extra work on the show, it worked out perfectly,"" explained Mulvaney. ""My partner Hannah hadn't done any extra work before, but my agent knew she had dark hair like Alina's so I asked her if she wanted to do it,"" he added. Alex Mulvaney and his wife Hannah are body doubles with a difference ""Hannah was nervous at first, but she is a big Coronation Street fan. I had been on set many times before, and I was able to talk her through what to expect - she was a bit star-struck when she saw the actors."" Like most other shows, Coronation Street stopped filming during the first national lockdown in March 2020 andresumed filmingin a restricted manner several months later. Porojnicu, who plays Alina, said the (non) kissing scene was a ""challenge"" but one she ""really enjoyed"". Alan Halsall and Ruxandra Porojnicu keep their distance during filming Although their characters look like they are sitting together, the actors were filmed having the conversation separately. The footage was  composited together during post-production, giving the illusion they were next to each other. The design department taped a pair of sunglasses onto a telescopic radio aerial to ensure the actors had the correct eye line, so they would appear to be looking into each other's eyes. ""It was difficult not being able to look into each other's eyes for the emotion of the scene but Coronation Street came up with a clever way to cheat that with sunglasses on an aerial,"" the actress said. ""Everything that's been said in the scene leads to the kiss which is very important for Alina because it is the first time that she has said out loud to Tyrone that she is falling for him."" Producer Iain MacLeod praised the popular programme's writers, cast and crew for having ""cleverly worked around"" restrictions, for the best part of a difficult year. When the characters Debbie and Kevin were trapped in a fridge, the actors were tested for Covid beforehand and were placed in a bubble for the three days of filming, as were Alya, Yasmeen and Geoff for the dramatic rooftop scenes for the 60th anniversary show in December. ""We have therefore told the same stories throughout the pandemic that we would have told in 'normal' times,"" said MacLeod. ""But it just felt wrong to tell a story of an illicit liaison, where someone betrays their partner based on lust and sexual attraction, only for us not to see any of the chemistry and closeness.

"Helen Bevan's professional Twitter account has nearly 100,000 followers NHS executive Helen Bevan had her two Twitter accounts, with nearly 140,000 followers, stolen by hackers and used to promote fake PlayStation 5 sales. She now has the accounts back but has received dozens of messages from people who fell for the scam. Ms Bevan also paid money to someone who said they could help - but they turned out to be a scammer too. She said she wanted to highlight the importance of extra security measures. NHS Horizons chief transformation officer Ms Bevan mistakenly thought she had activated two-factor authentication (2FA), which requires account-holders to use two methods to log in, the second often involving a code sent by text or email. However providing those contact details does not automatically activate 2FA, so the hackers were able to simply change the email address and phone number she had linked to the accounts once they had cracked her password. One was a professional account with 97,000 followers discussing Ms Bevan's work, and the other one was about her cat, a local ""celebrity"", which was followed by 36,000 people. The hackers deleted all of her original tweets, unfollowed the people she was following, and renamed the accounts. The rebranded account, which has now been returned to normal It happened the day before Ms Bevan was due to lead an online event for thousands of people, and she had encouraged her audience to use Twitter as their discussion tool. Facing this pressure, she felt panicked that her own account was not under her control. ""I was the social media heartbeat of this event, I didn't know what to do,"" she said. ""Someone said, 'You have a basic choice, you can wait for Twitter to give your account back or you can find someone to help you.'"" As her friends and network were tweeting about the hack, offers of help flooded in and she chose someone who promised to have the accounts back within 25 minutes in return for a fee of Â£110. ""I don't think he did anything, he kept sending me films of computer files whirring, saying this is me doing your work,"" she said. ""Then he said he had got it back, but Twitter had changed the verification and he needed an extra $100, then he wanted a service chargeâ¦ they prey on desperate people."" She did not pay anything further and accepts that the money she handed over is lost. After two days, Twitter itself restored the accounts for her. When she accessed them, she found dozens of direct messages from people asking about PlayStation 5 orders. The PS5 is in high demand She says she has no idea how many fake sales were generated by the scammers but the PS5s were being advertised at upwards of $450 (Â£320). ""They were following Walmart, Dixons, PC World, Target,"" she said. ""They would wait for them to tweet about PS5s and then reply, saying we've got PS5s in stock now, DM [direct message] me."" There were also Fleets - temporary Twitter posts - featuring photos of PlayStation boxes. Ms Bevan later had to explain to all who messaged her, having paid for games consoles, that she was also a victim of the scam. She said she wanted to share her story as a warning to others. ""There are things I now know that I wish I'd known - everybody should have two-factor authentication, it's absolutely critical that you put that on,"" she said. ""Also, under no circumstances, even if you're desperate, do not go to one of these services that claim they'll get your account back in 30 minutes and stuff - I think they're likely to be a scammer. ""The only thing you can do is go through Twitter. Do it one step at a time."" Lisa Forte, from Red Goat Cyber Security, said having all the security settings enabled on all social media accounts is  ""absolutely essential"". ""This means using a complex and long password, turning on two-factor authentication and, in the case of Twitter, enabling the password-reset protection setting,"" she said. ""Attackers are looking for easy targets. They have amazing eco-systems of businesses that allow them to take over your account, lock you out and then charge you to gain access back again.""

"There have been calls from tourism businesses for a firm reopening date A decision on whether Welsh tourism can reopen in time for Easter will not be made until ""the last moment"", the first minister has confirmed. Self-contained holiday accommodation could reopen on 27 March if coronavirus case rates remain stable under Welsh government plans. Tourism businesses have called forroadmap to allow them to prepare and for people to book trips. Mr Drakeford said any confirmation would not be given until next week. Speaking at the Welsh government's coronavirus briefing on Friday, Mr Drakeford said it was important ""to wait until the last moment you can"" before making and announcing decisions about easing lockdown, to see if case rates had changed. ""There are some parts of Wales where the position is not as good as we would like it to be,"" he said. ""People who follow the newswill have seen overnight Paris has gone back into a lockdown again, so we've known all along how fast circumstances can change in coronavirus. ""That's why it's important to wait until the last moment you can in order to make these decisions because that way you have the best and latest data."" Sue Steadman started her business, Cadair View Lodge, in 2003 with her then husband. Sue Steadman, who runs Cadair View Lodge in Snowdonia, said: ""Obviously it makes it more difficult. But we've had so much last-minute changes it's almost what we've come to expect."" ""We've lost income, I haven't been paid since 2019 because everything I have has gone into running the business,"" she said. ""People need certainty. At the moment customers are debating whether or not to come thinking the pub won't be open, or the takeaway won't be available."" ""We have a lot of regular guests who have all been very supportive. And they're looking forward to coming back,"" she said. ""The business has been running for 17 years, some of them have become like family. There have been first dates, proposals, and families brought to stay."" Hywel James Davies, who runs the South Wales Touring Park in Llanelli, said: ""I'm not sure that two days is enough time to prepare everything to open up but we'll cross our fingers and hope that everything will go to plan."" Siblings Hywel and Cathrin run the site together on their farm Mr Davies and his sister Cathrin have made the most of the lockdown by making improvements to the site for when customers come back. ""It's been very hard. But it's looking good this year, we're booked up,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to reopening to tell the truth. It's what we want, for people to come on their holidays and enjoy their stay with us."" What are Wales' lockdown rules? Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us? Mr Drakeford also refused to rule out local lockdown restrictions in two hot spot areas in Wales, after a spike in cases. Rates on Anglesey stand at 127.1 for every 100,000 people, and 147.5 in Merthyr Tydfil. Those higher levels of infection compare with an average falling rate for Wales of 43.7 per 100,000 people. Mr Drakeford said the rise in cases in the communities was linked to ""household and social mixing"", and there were concerns people were not engaging with contact tracers. A Oxford-AstraZeneca shipment for Wales has been delayed by four weeks A delayed shipment from India to the UK could also impact the easing of lockdown, the first minister warned. An estimated 250,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca doses due to arrive in Walesby mid-April are set to be delivereda month late. Mr Drakeford said he could not pretend the delayed doses would ""have no affect at all"". From Monday garden centres will be allowed to reopen, and supermarkets to sell ""non-essential goods"", under slight easing of lockdown rules. Mr Drakeford said he hoped more could be allowed - including outdoor children's activities and the reopening of castle grounds - in coming weeks if cases continued to fall. ""Of course our ability to lift restrictions is linked to the successful vaccination programme,"" he said. ""But our hope must be that we continue to see the position in Wales [as] stable and reducing, and that we will continue to have the headroom to lift restrictions in the way that we hope."" He said he was confident that no vaccine appointments would be cancelled due to the delay, but that the loss of such a large amount of doses would have an effect. ""We are doing everything we can to mitigate the effect on appointments for people to get vaccinated, there are a number of different ways in which we are looking to do that,"" he said. Reacting to the briefing, the Conservative group leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies said it was ""unfair"" for supermarkets to be allowed to sell non-essential goods, and called for the high street to reopen. ""If he feels it's safe for supermarkets why persecute the high street and say the high street can't do that?"" he said. Member of the Senedd for Ynys Mon Rhun ap Iorwerth said while he did not want to see his area placed under local lockdown again, the option was needed to stop case rates rising further. The Plaid Cymru MS called for more support for people who were told to self-isolate in the area.

When she accessed them, she found dozens of direct messages from people asking about PlayStation 5 orders. The PS5 is in high demand She says she has no idea how many fake sales were generated by the scammers but the PS5s were being advertised at upwards of $450 (Â£320). ""They were following Walmart, Dixons, PC World, Target,"" she said. ""They would wait for them to tweet about PS5s and then reply, saying we've got PS5s in stock now, DM [direct message] me."" There were also Fleets - temporary Twitter posts - featuring photos of PlayStation boxes. Ms Bevan later had to explain to all who messaged her, having paid for games consoles, that she was also a victim of the scam. She said she wanted to share her story as a warning to others. ""There are things I now know that I wish I'd known - everybody should have two-factor authentication, it's absolutely critical that you put that on,"" she said. ""Also, under no circumstances, even if you're desperate, do not go to one of these services that claim they'll get your account back in 30 minutes and stuff - I think they're likely to be a scammer. ""The only thing you can do is go through Twitter. Do it one step at a time."" Lisa Forte, from Red Goat Cyber Security, said having all the security settings enabled on all social media accounts is  ""absolutely essential"". ""This means using a complex and long password, turning on two-factor authentication and, in the case of Twitter, enabling the password-reset protection setting,"" she said. ""Attackers are looking for easy targets. They have amazing eco-systems of businesses that allow them to take over your account, lock you out and then charge you to gain access back again.""

"PM Boris Johnson has received his first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, saying he ""did not feel a thing"" The UK's latest R number is estimated to be between 0.6 and 0.9, government figures suggest The figure shows the average number of people each person goes on to infect and when below 1 it means the Covid epidemic is shrinking The UK saw 7% more deaths than normally expected during 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics A further 101 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test are recorded in the UK More than two million people in the UK have now received a second dose of a vaccine European countries including Germany, France, Italy and Spain are resuming use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine The positive benefits of the vaccine outweigh risks, the World Health Organization says, with data not suggesting an increase in blood clots Edited by James Clarke and Sarah Collerton That's all from the team so goodbye for now. Your updates were written by Hamish Mackay, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Katie Wright and Sarah Collerton. We're about to bring our coronavirus updates to a close for the day. Before we go, here's a look at what's been going on in the UK and around the world: This video can not be played ""That was the last time mummy ever saw him"" Today marks a year since the first Covid-19 related death was reported in Northern Ireland. It came three weeks after the first case of coronavirus in Northern Ireland was confirmed. Since then, more than 2,000 people have died. Three families have spoken to BBC News NI about losing a loved one, coping with grief and saying goodbye in the midst of a pandemic. You can read that piece here. A GP surgery was ""overwhelmed"" when it received more than 126,000 calls in one day about Covid-19 vaccinations, health chiefs have revealed. One patient tried ringing the practice in Stockton-on-Tees 300 times in the space of a morning, they said. Other surgeries have also reported a ""deluge"" of similar calls. NHS Tees Valley Clinical Commissioning Group has warned the volume of calls prevents patients with urgent healthcare needs from getting through. Janet Walker, medical director at NHS Tees Valley CCG, said: ""The number of calls practices are getting from people inquiring about the vaccine is absolutely overwhelming, with one practice receiving over 126,000 calls in one day. ""We are asking people again - please, please do not phone your practice about vaccinations."" You can read the full story here. The current estimate for R - the average number of others each infected person passes the virus to - currently stands between 0.6-0.9 in the UK. However, the value of R varies across the UK. In Northern Ireland, for example, the R number is between 0.9-1.1. Below, you can see how the estimate for R has changed in recent months. During the past 12 months, many of the major events in the royal calendar have been cancelled or postponed because of the ongoing pandemic. Now, the Queen's official birthday celebration known as Trooping the Colour has been cancelled for a second year running. The annual event, which sees thousands of well-wishers fill central London to watch the Queen and members of the Royal Family travel to and from the spectacle, will not go ahead its traditional form, Buckingham Palace has said. Last summer, an event dubbed ""mini Trooping"" was staged at Windsor Castle and the palace says options for an ""alternative parade"" were being considered at the Queen's Berkshire home. The annual Garter service, which sees the Royal Family parading through the grounds of Windsor Castle in their ceremonial robes, will also not go ahead in June, the palace says. Multiple coronavirus vaccines are being rolled out in the UK and around the world. Each one is being seen as a way out of the global pandemic and the quickest way to get things back to normal. In many countries, having a vaccine is not mandatory yet the success of vaccination programmes depends upon how many people take up the offer of one. So what will happen if you choose not to get the vaccine? BBC News Health Reporter Laura Foster explains. This video can not be played What happens if I don't get the Covid vaccine? We've got more on the prime minister getting his vaccine. Boris Johnson received his first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine after reassuring the public that it is ""safe"". ""I literally did not feel a thing. It was very good, very quick,"" Johnson says after receiving the jab at St Thomas' Hospital in London. ""I cannot recommend it too highly, everybody when you do get your notification to go for a jab, please go and get it, it is the best thing for you, best thing for your family and for everyone else."" We've got the full story here. For weeks now, Covid-19 infection rates have been falling across the UK. But there are some towns that have bucked the trend, with infections remaining stubbornly high. This is particularly true of towns where the local economy relies on manufacturing, construction or food processing jobs - the kind of work that simply can't be done from home. BBC health correspondent Dominic Hughes has taken a closer look at the situation in some of those towns. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Johnson, 56, spent time in intensive care at St Thomas' Hospital in London last year after contracting Covid-19. He returned to the same hospital for his jab and left telling journalists he ""did not feel a thing"" and encouraged people to get their vaccination. As we reported earlier, the UK has recorded a further 101 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. While the daily figures can fluctuate due to delays in reporting, the seven-day average gives a clearer indication of the true situation. The seven-day average for deaths by this measure now stands at 98. The seven-day average for new cases, meanwhile, now stands at 5,343, after a further 4,802 were recorded yesterday. The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall have thanked volunteers for supporting people during the pandemic, saying they have been a ""great help"". They took part in a video call to thank members of the Royal Voluntary Service (RVS) to mark one year since it launched the NHS Volunteer Responders Scheme. The Queen, patron of the RVS, said they had done ""wonderful work"", including delivering books to people. Nearly one million volunteers have been recruited to the scheme. You can read the full story here. A woman who has been making scrubs for NHS workers says it was ""absolutely phenomenal"" to be vaccinated by a nurse wearing one of her creations. Caroline Farquharson, 50, from Bracknell, went to the Waitrose HQ Sports and Leisure Centre for her first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. She was treated by a nurse adorned in an unmistakable red and white pattern, made from an old duvet. ""What were the chances of that?"" she asks the BBC. ""It was brilliant."" Caroline started making colourful clothing for the NHS last March when a local group called Rainbow Scrubs was looking for volunteers. She has since made about 95 full sets, all in her spare time. You can read the full story here. Less than 12% of the EU's population is reportedto have received the vaccine,external, compared with nearly 40% in the UK. The rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine across the bloc has hit a number of hurdles. In January, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the jab for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initiallyrefused to recommend its use for people over 65. France and Germany eventually revised their stance andapproved the vaccine for people aged 65-74at the beginning of March. However, they were among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again in March, after reports a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab. They restarted it after the EMA said there was no evidence the vaccine caused the clots. However, the French authorities say only people aged 55 and over should get the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. The headlines surrounding AstraZeneca may have led people to be reluctant about taking the jab. Some countries arereporting,externalthat as many as half of the doses delivered to them are currently unused. Read more about the other issues facing the EU. A woman made redundant three times during the pandemic has found her ""dream role"" after calling into a BBC radio phone-in. Annabelle Smith, 29, lost her job as a marketing manager in March, a property company role in May and finally as an assistant gym manager in December. After taking part in a careers discussion on BBC Radio 5 Live, she was offered a job by one of the panellists, Catherine Shuttleworth, who runs marketing agency Get Savvy, based in Leeds. Shuttleworth says she was impressed with Smith's ""energy and tenacity"" on the radio. After an interview and formal job offer, Smith has started her ""dream role"" at the agency. ""It was surreal,"" she says. ""Neither of us knew we were going to be on the show.It was almost fate."" Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi, 53, has been photographed receiving a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine today in London. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 56,is due to receive his later. Chelsea Leigh Richardson said her mum Sarah was her rock For Chelsea Leigh Richardson and her four siblings, life has changed beyond belief since their mum Sarah died with Covid in October, aged 42. ""Mum was our everything, then all of a sudden she was gone,"" she says. Faced with the loss of their only parent, the 21-year-old went from big sister to the sole carer of her younger brothers and sisters - Kala-Jai, 19, Jayden, 17, Preston-James, 14, and seven-year-old Bobbee-Mae -overnight. Chelsea was determined the five of them would not be split up, so she became the glue to hold them together. She says: ""I pulled my big girl knickers up and said to myself: 'Come on Chels, you can do this. Be brave.'"" You can read Chelsea's story here. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The Swiss government says there will be no relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions for at least another four weeks. There had been tentative plans to allow bars and restaurants to open their outdoor terraces next week, and to allow small cultural events - but today the government has said the situation remains too risky. Cases have been rising again over the past two weeks, and at least 80% of all new cases are the more infectious B117 (UK) variant. The government says the limit on private gatherings will be raised from five to 10, but is warning families to follow strict distancing and hygiene rules, and to enjoy Easter outside if possible. It also advises people to take advantage of the new mass testing system, which is free to all, before meeting friends and relatives. The government believes the criteria for relaxation of restrictions must include not just falling cases, hospitalisations, and R value, but that all risk groups are vaccinated. Switzerland has so far vaccinated about 12% of its population of 8.6 million. A blind woman who was sent a shielding letter she could not read has won ""promising"" commitments from the government after a legal challenge. Sarah Leadbetter, from Narborough in Leicestershire, is classed as clinically extremely vulnerable. However, government correspondence advising her to shield was not sent in a format she could access - which she argued was discrimination. The government has agreed to review its communication with disabled people. Leadbetter, 45, who is registered blind, says she is ""very proud"" of the results of her legal challenge.

The so-called Kent variant is now the most commonly found strain  in the UK and it's more easily spread than the first variant, which arrived in Spring 2020. Scientists are looking at tweaking the coronavirus vaccines to make sure they continue to be highly effective. But where are these variants coming from? What are these new variants? And why do viruses mutate in the first place? Health correspondent Laura Foster explains. This video can not be played Covid variants: What happens when a virus mutates? Â© 2025 BBC.

"The rise in cases in Germany is said to be fuelled by outbreaks among younger people Coronavirus cases are rising exponentially in Germany, officials warn, as continental Europe braces for a third wave of infections. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said it was likely that the country would now need to apply an ""emergency brake"" and re-impose lockdown measures. France, Poland and other nations are also reintroducing restrictions. German Health Minister Jens Spahn has said that Europe lacks the vaccines needed to significantly reduce cases. ""We have to be honest about the situation - in Europe we don't have enough vaccines to stop a third wave through vaccinations alone,"" he told reporters. The vaccine rollout across the EU has been hindered by delayed deliveries as well as the suspension in several countries of the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, over fears of possible side effects. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? On Friday, Ms Merkel defended Germany's decision to temporarily suspend the rollout of the vaccine and said she did not believe its reputation had been damaged. ""I would get vaccinated with AstraZeneca,"" the 66-year-old said, adding: ""I would like to wait until it's my turn."" The increase in reported cases in Germany is said to be fuelled by outbreaks among younger people. ""The numbers are rising, the share of mutations is large and there are some fairly challenging weeks ahead of us,"" Mr Spahn said. Germany has recently been easing restrictions, with the first in-person performance at the Berliner Ensemble theatre taking place on Friday Ms Merkel said she had hoped lockdown measures would not need to be reintroduced so soon after easing restrictions, but that ""sadly"" developments meant that it was looking unavoidable. ""We agreed that, should the seven-day incidence rate exceed 100 per 100,000 people in a region or state, we will go back to the restrictions which were in place until 7 March - we called it the emergency brake."" Ministers are particularly concerned about the Easter holidays. They are urging people not to travel and to limit gatherings to immediate family. Just 8% of Germany's population has so far received a first dose of vaccine, although the government on Friday resumed the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. Vice-president of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases, Lars Schaade, warned of the possibility of ""many severe cases and deaths, and hospitals that are overwhelmed"". The RKI has said that cases in Germany are rising at a ""very clearly exponential rate"". Despite assurances from the European medicines regulator that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective, some countries remain reluctant to resume their campaigns using the jab. Finland's health authority has announced a pause in its use of the vaccine that will last at least a week. The move, which follows two reports of blood clots in patients who had received the jab in the country, was said to be a precautionary measure. Is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine safe? Is Europe's AstraZeneca jab decision-making flawed? Meanwhile, Sweden, Denmark and Norway said on Friday that they needed more time to determine whether they should resume AstraZeneca inoculations. Germany, Italy, France, Spain and the Netherlands are among the countries that have restarted their AstraZeneca vaccination campaigns. Health authorities in France have recommended that the vaccine be offered only to people aged 55 and over. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) reviewed the jab after 13 European countries suspended use of the vaccine over fears of a link to blood clots. It found the jab was ""not associated"" with a higher risk of clots. This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries to continue using the AstraZeneca vaccine. On Friday, experts at the WHO said the vaccine had ""tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths across the world"". ""The available data do not suggest any overall increase in clotting conditions such as deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism following administration of Covid-19 vaccines,"" the WHO's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety said in a statement. Other European leaders have sought to reassure citizens that the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab is safe. Italy's Prime Minister Mario Draghi, 73, said he would happily have the vaccine, but that he had ""not yet made a booking"". His French counterpart, 55-year-old Jean Castex, received an AstraZeneca dose on Friday. French PM Jean Castex receives his first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine at a hospital on the outskirts of Paris Meanwhile,UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also received his first doseof the vaccine. Some 21 million people in 16 areas of France, including the capital Paris, will be placed under Covid lockdown measuresfrom midnight on Friday as the country fears a third wave. Trains leaving Paris for parts of the country where lockdown restrictions do not apply, such as Brittany and Lyon, were reportedly fully booked hours before the measures were due to come into effect. Traffic jams were reported on several roads leaving the capital. In Poland, coronavirus cases are continuing to surge with new daily infections reaching levels not seen since the second wave peaked in November. A three-week partial lockdown is being introduced on Saturday to try to slow the spread of Covid-19. Shops, hotels, cultural and sporting facilities will close across the country.

"There have been calls from tourism businesses for a firm reopening date A decision on whether Welsh tourism can reopen in time for Easter will not be made until ""the last moment"", the first minister has confirmed. Self-contained holiday accommodation could reopen on 27 March if coronavirus case rates remain stable under Welsh government plans. Tourism businesses have called forroadmap to allow them to prepare and for people to book trips. Mr Drakeford said any confirmation would not be given until next week. Speaking at the Welsh government's coronavirus briefing on Friday, Mr Drakeford said it was important ""to wait until the last moment you can"" before making and announcing decisions about easing lockdown, to see if case rates had changed. ""There are some parts of Wales where the position is not as good as we would like it to be,"" he said. ""People who follow the newswill have seen overnight Paris has gone back into a lockdown again, so we've known all along how fast circumstances can change in coronavirus. ""That's why it's important to wait until the last moment you can in order to make these decisions because that way you have the best and latest data."" Sue Steadman started her business, Cadair View Lodge, in 2003 with her then husband. Sue Steadman, who runs Cadair View Lodge in Snowdonia, said: ""Obviously it makes it more difficult. But we've had so much last-minute changes it's almost what we've come to expect."" ""We've lost income, I haven't been paid since 2019 because everything I have has gone into running the business,"" she said. ""People need certainty. At the moment customers are debating whether or not to come thinking the pub won't be open, or the takeaway won't be available."" ""We have a lot of regular guests who have all been very supportive. And they're looking forward to coming back,"" she said. ""The business has been running for 17 years, some of them have become like family. There have been first dates, proposals, and families brought to stay."" Hywel James Davies, who runs the South Wales Touring Park in Llanelli, said: ""I'm not sure that two days is enough time to prepare everything to open up but we'll cross our fingers and hope that everything will go to plan."" Siblings Hywel and Cathrin run the site together on their farm Mr Davies and his sister Cathrin have made the most of the lockdown by making improvements to the site for when customers come back. ""It's been very hard. But it's looking good this year, we're booked up,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to reopening to tell the truth. It's what we want, for people to come on their holidays and enjoy their stay with us."" What are Wales' lockdown rules? Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us? Mr Drakeford also refused to rule out local lockdown restrictions in two hot spot areas in Wales, after a spike in cases. Rates on Anglesey stand at 127.1 for every 100,000 people, and 147.5 in Merthyr Tydfil. Those higher levels of infection compare with an average falling rate for Wales of 43.7 per 100,000 people. Mr Drakeford said the rise in cases in the communities was linked to ""household and social mixing"", and there were concerns people were not engaging with contact tracers. A Oxford-AstraZeneca shipment for Wales has been delayed by four weeks A delayed shipment from India to the UK could also impact the easing of lockdown, the first minister warned. An estimated 250,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca doses due to arrive in Walesby mid-April are set to be delivereda month late. Mr Drakeford said he could not pretend the delayed doses would ""have no affect at all"". From Monday garden centres will be allowed to reopen, and supermarkets to sell ""non-essential goods"", under slight easing of lockdown rules. Mr Drakeford said he hoped more could be allowed - including outdoor children's activities and the reopening of castle grounds - in coming weeks if cases continued to fall. ""Of course our ability to lift restrictions is linked to the successful vaccination programme,"" he said. ""But our hope must be that we continue to see the position in Wales [as] stable and reducing, and that we will continue to have the headroom to lift restrictions in the way that we hope."" He said he was confident that no vaccine appointments would be cancelled due to the delay, but that the loss of such a large amount of doses would have an effect. ""We are doing everything we can to mitigate the effect on appointments for people to get vaccinated, there are a number of different ways in which we are looking to do that,"" he said. Reacting to the briefing, the Conservative group leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies said it was ""unfair"" for supermarkets to be allowed to sell non-essential goods, and called for the high street to reopen. ""If he feels it's safe for supermarkets why persecute the high street and say the high street can't do that?"" he said. Member of the Senedd for Ynys Mon Rhun ap Iorwerth said while he did not want to see his area placed under local lockdown again, the option was needed to stop case rates rising further. The Plaid Cymru MS called for more support for people who were told to self-isolate in the area.

"Some 1,200 people are said to be in intensive care in hospitals across Paris The French capital is set to go into a month-long Covid lockdown as the country fears a third wave. Some 21 million people in 16 areas of France will be placed under the measures from midnight on Friday. These measures will not be as strict as the previous lockdown, Prime Minister Jean Castex said, with people allowed to exercise outdoors. France has recorded more than 35,000 new infections within the past 24 hours. Mr Castex said a ""third wave"" of infections in the country was looking increasingly likely. The situation in Paris is particularly worrying with 1,200 people in intensive care there, more than at the peak of the second wave in November, Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said. Under the new measures, non-essential businesses will be forced to close, but schools will remain open, along with hairdressers if they follow a ""particular sanitary protocol"". Government spokesman Gabriel Attal stressed there would be differences with the two earlier lockdowns and said further details would be given of which business could stay open or would have to shut. People will be allowed to exercise outdoors within 10km (6 miles) of their home and are not allowed to travel to other parts of the country unless they have a valid reason. Those in the affected areas will have to fill out a form to explain why they have left their homes. There is a weary resignation about Paris, as people prepare for another four weeks of tedium. Yes, we know this third lockdown won't be quite as bad as the second - which was itself a lighter version of the first. But still. Another month of bits of paper for the police; another month of having to justify a trip to the supermarket; another month without meaningful social contact. It's enough to drive you to distraction. France's SNCF train company reported a surge in bookings ahead of the new lockdown Except it hasn't. In general, most Parisians simply knuckle under. Those who can are leaving by train or car, but because schools are staying open, most families will stick it out in the city. Everyone's made the calculation. The long Easter weekend in two weeks is a bust. But the Paris school holidays start on 17 April - exactly when the lockdown is supposed to end. That's the light that will keep people going. Spring break. As well as the greater Paris region, the northern Hauts-de-France, Seine-Maritime and Eure areas will go under lockdown as well as the Alpes-Maritimes on the French Riviera. France's nationwide curfew will remain in place. However, it will begin an hour later at 19:00 (18:00 GMT), taking into account the longer hours of daylight. Europe in vaccine race to save summer EU agency says AstraZeneca is 'safe and effective' This video can not be played French lockdown highlights small business struggles (November 2020 report) Fears of a third wave come as the French government faces criticism for its slow vaccine rollout. From Friday, France will resume vaccinating using the AstraZeneca jabfollowing the EMA's announcement that it was fit for use. Mr Castex said he would be getting the vaccine straight away to prove that it was OK. France had suspended the jab after a number of people in Europe reported blood clots developing after the vaccine was administered. A survey conducted just as the suspension was announced found that only 20% of the French have confidence in AstraZeneca.

Mr Johnson told a Downing Street conference on Thursday that the AstraZeneca jab was safe but ""the thing that isn't safe is catching Covid, which is why it is so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes"". The prime ministerwas himself treated in hospital for Covid-19in April 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic. ""The way to ensure this [lockdown easing] happens is to get that jab when your turn comes, so let's get the jab done,"" he said. Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said there were ""anecdotal reports"" of small numbers of people not turning up for vaccine appointments following the controversy over the AstraZeneca jab in Europe. But he said he expected many of those would decide to get the jab after ""a pause for thought"", adding that Covid was still a ""very dangerous disease"". ""People dying, people getting significant blood clotting problems, that's one of the risks of Covid, people having long-term physical and mental effects from Covid,"" he said. This video can not be played Boris Johnson said England's roadmap out of lockdown will not be disrupted by vaccine supply issues Mr Johnson said England's progress towards leaving restrictions on daily life was ""unchecked"" byvaccine supply issues, where fewer doses have arrived from India than initially expected. There were often delays with vaccine rollout programmes, he said, and he stressed the Indian government had not stopped any exports. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said while the delay was ""disappointing"" he did not think it would have ""an enormous effect"" on the rollout. However, he warned the UK needed to keep variants of concern ""at bay"" until it could update vaccines and roll them out to the whole population. Prof Ferguson, who is a member of the government's SPI-M modelling group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there should be particular concern about cases being imported from France, where infection levels are increasing. He added that 5-10% of cases in France were the South African variant, which is of concern because it could be more resistant to current vaccines. But Prof Ferguson suggested that adding France to the ""red list"" of countries, from which arrivals are required to quarantine in a hotel, would not be ""practical"" given the amount of essential trade between the UK and France. Instead he said ""a more bespoke arrangement"" to mitigate the risks, perhaps including testing of arrivals, would be needed. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said rising infection rates in Europe should act as a ""wake-up call"" and the travel red list was kept under ""regular review"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? The European medical regulator had reviewed the AstraZeneca jab after 13 countries in Europe suspended its use over fears about blood clots in a very small number of patients. France, Germany and Italy, along with Cyprus, Latvia and Lithuania, are to resume use of the jab on Friday while Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands will do so next week. But Norway, Sweden and Denmark have said they will continue to pause the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine while they conduct their own independent reviews. Like his UK counterpart, French Prime Minister Jean Castex will receive the AstraZeneca vaccine in an effort to sway a doubtful French public. Sir Kent Woods, former chairman of the EMA, told BBC Breakfast the pause of the rollout of the AstraZeneca jab in some European countries was ""unfortunate"" because it could damage public confidence. Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine group, said the EMA findings would help ""rebuild confidence"" and it was ""reassuring"" that safety monitoring was taking place. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) also concluded that any link between the jab and clots was unproven. The MHRA and the EMA say people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised but anyone with a headache lasting more than four days after vaccination should seek medical advice, as a precaution. The same advice applies if someone develops unusual bruising. That is because the regulators have received a very small number of reports of an extremely rare form of blood clot occurring in the brain. It is this type of clot that triggered some European countries to pause rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. In the UK, five cases of cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT), among 11 million people who have received the vaccine, occurred in men aged between 19 and 59. One of these was fatal. The EMA has received an additional 13 reports of CSVT. The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on countries to continue using the vaccine, and is due to release the results of its own review into the vaccine's safety later on Friday. Meanwhile, the UK saw 7% more deaths than would be expected in 2020 based on the previous five years,according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics covering up to mid-December. It experienced one of the worst death rates in Europe in the first half of 2020 but has since been overtaken by Poland, Spain, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.

"Government borrowing levels continued to set new records last month, reflecting the cost of supporting the UK's economy during the pandemic. The government borrowed Â£19.1bn in February, the highest figure for that month since records began in 1993. Measures such as furlough payments have hit government finances hard. However, February's borrowing figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was not as high as some economists had forecast. Borrowing for the financial year to date - between April and February - has now reached Â£278.8bn,the Office for National Statistics said,external, a record for that period. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said: ""Coronavirus has caused one of the largest economic shocks this country has ever faced, which is why we responded with our Â£352bn package of support to protect lives and livelihoods. ""This was the fiscally responsible thing to do and the best way to support the public finances in the medium term."" Christine Jardine, Treasury spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said that while the latest figures showed scale of the challenge posed by the pandemic, ""they can not be used as an excuse by the government to end support prematurely, and leave behind people and businesses struggling across the UK"". ""Thousands of small businesses are due to stay closed for months to come, and millions of people are still worried about their jobs. Yet the chancellor failed to provide them with long-term certainty and direct support in the Budget."" The latest ONS figures showed the government spent Â£3.9bn last month on job support measures alone. They also revealed a fall in tax income, notably from lower VAT, business rates and fuel duty, although they also showed money coming in from self-employed tax payments rose by Â£900m from last year. Where does the government borrow billions from? Total public sector debt has risen to Â£2.13 trillion, according to the ONS. The figure almost exceeds the size of the UK's economy, with debt having reached 97.5% of annual economic output. Debt levels as high as this have not been seen since the early 1960s. Ultimately, if it's consistently spending much more than it has in the past, the state has to raise more money in taxes. But the key word there is ""ultimately"". There is no urgency to repaying the government's debt. More urgent are the debts of small businesses and poorer households. Ordinary households rightly fear getting into too much debt because if interest rates rise, lenders can close in and deploy lawyers and bailiffs with all the attendant unpleasantness. But it is profoundly wrong and misleading to infer that it's like that for governments who issue their own sovereign currency. Unlike households, governments controlling their own currency can borrow without limit money that they have freshly created. They therefore can't go bankrupt. Because almost all of the money borrowed by the government in this financial year (by issuing gilts) will be owed to another public sector body, the Bank of England, it's nothing like a household borrowing from a bank. And in fact, as the government tacitly acknowledged in its recent Budget, it makes sense in the midst of an economic contraction for the government to spend more, not less - not least because other parts of the economy (households and businesses) aren't spending anything like what they normally would. Without the additional government spending the economic contraction would, without a shadow of a doubt, be worse. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said that despite the high level of borrowing, the government's increased spending was the only sensible course at this time. ""Today's figures are pretty terrible but it is important to take in to account the economy as well. The chancellor is doing the right thing in continuing to support the economy,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""His action in the Budgetto extend many of the existing schemes means the rug will not pulled out from under the feet of households and businesses. ""If we can limit the damage to the economy now, when the crisis ends it means the country will be stronger amore able to cope with that debt."" Separately, the government said it would receive Â£1.1bn from selling part of its stake in NatWest Group. The sale will cut the size of the government's stake in the bank - which was previously called Royal Bank of Scotland - from almost 62% to 59.8%. The government bought shares in the bank to help keep it afloat during the 2008 financial crisis. The value of those shares has since fallen, meaning the government has made an overall loss of Â£1.84bn excluding dividend payments. The Treasury said ""its ambition is to return the bank to private ownership once the original goal of preserving financial stability has been achieved"". How does the government borrow money?

"First Minister Mark Drakeford has been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic He confirms an easing of Covid rules on shopping from Monday, allowing garden centres to reopen and the sale of non-essential items in shops already open A decision on whether to reopen parts of the tourism sector in time for Easter will be made ""by the end of next week"" A delay in supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine will not affect anyone who already has an appointment for their jab, Mr Drakeford says Seasonal flu has dropped from more than 1,600 cases last winter to just 18 this year due to Covid curbs, Public Health Wales says Learner drivers and instructors say they are frustrated that lessons remain on hold under lockdown rules James McCarthy, Luca Weinmann Al-Nawab and Andy Roberts That's it for our live coverage of the Welsh Government's update on the pandemic. The main points have been:  Thanks for joining us - have a great weekend, and stay safe.  Are there reasons to be optimistic despite Covid-19 keeping people mostly at homes for more than a year? 17-year-old Lloyd Warburton from Aberystwyth certainly thinks so. He says the first steps out of lockdown have been made, infection rates are down across most of Wales and, of course, Wales are just one match away from rugby's Grand Slam. Allow Twitter content?

A ""remarkable"" suppression of seasonal fluhas seen only 18 cases recorded in Wales this winter, with no confirmed cases in the most recent week of data. This compares with 1,657 recorded cases last winter, the largest year-on-year drop ever recorded. Catherine Moore of Public Health Wales said measures to slow the spread of Covid had led to reduced levels of flu in winter she had never seen before. But she said it could mean ""slightly more severe"" flu cases next winter. Public Health Wales has said the flu virus is not currently circulating in Wales. This year saw the highest ever uptake of the flu vaccine in over-65s As Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepared to receivehis first AstraZeneca vaccine dosetoday, he urged people to do the same. It comes as several EU nations, including Germany and France, have pledged to continue their roll-out of the jab following their suspension of its use amid fears it caused blood clots. Mr Johnson claimed on Thursday that the AstraZeneca jab was safe but ""the thing that isn't safe is catching Covid, which is why it is so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes"". ""The way to ensure this [lockdown easing] happens is to get that jab when your turn comes, so let's get the jab done,"" he said. PM Boris Johnson assured people the AstraZeneca vaccine was safe About 50 driving
school instructors have staged a protest convoy in Newport against lockdown rules preventing them from working. Instructors are waiting for Covid rules to be changed so they can resume lessons. One, Anita Hughes, said: âWeâre sanitising cars and assuring everything
is clean. ""Itâs just there and ready to go.â Protest organiser Luke Thompson said: âWe want clarity from Welsh Government about
when we can restart our business. ""Theyâve had it in England and Scotland. We
believe weâve done enough to ensure our cars are safe.â Instructor Anita Hughes: âWeâre sanitising cars and assuring everything is clean"" Wales' first minister has urged people who are contacted by test and trace teams to âplease take it seriously."" Mark Drakeford told reporters that this week there had been âsome evidence that in some places people are reluctant to cooperateâ. âThere may be a number of reasons for that, I'm afraid it may be that they know that they've been doing things they shouldn't do, and they're not keen for that to come to the surface,"" he said. âWhatever the reason behind it is, it is not a sensible way of behaviour because it just means that the risk goes on for longer."" The first minister added: âWhen the phone goes from the TTP (Test, Trace, Protect) system, please take it seriously. âIt's there to protect you and not cooperating with it puts you and other people that matter to you at risk.â Mr Drakeford explained that he understood self-isolating was a âreal challengeâ for some people due to the financial burden, but stressed that help was now available in Wales for people on low incomes. The Conservative group leader in the Senedd repeated his call for the first minister to publish a ""clear roadmap out of lockdown"" for Wales. Andrew RT Davies said: ""Supermarkets, for example, are going to be allowed to be open to non-essential retail, why not the high street? ""If he feels it's safe for supermarkets why persecute the high street and say the high street can't do that? ""Because he did give a clear indication to the high street some weeks ago that they too would be able to open. ""Now that doesn't seem fair to me and people need to have a sense of fairness that the regulations apply evenly across the whole of Wales."" Plaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said local lockdowns in Wales should be kept as an option but he'd prefer to see more support offered to people who need to self-isolate. He is the Senedd member for Anglesey where a Covid cluster has been identified in Holyhead. Mr ap Iorwerth said: ""Do I want to see another lockdown in my constituency? ""No I don't. There's a way to avoid that happening and it's by making sure that people do those little things such as washing hands, keeping distance, wearing a mask, if you happen to be indoors open a window, that kind of thing."" He added: ""The countries that have been most successful in clamping down on local outbreaks are those that have put really, really strong support mechanisms in place - everything from financial support packages that are better than the ones that we have here, even putting people up in hotels to self-isolate."" First Minister Mark Drakeford has not ruled out bringing in local restrictions on Anglesey and in Merthyr Tydfil following localised flare-ups of coronavirus, but said the plan at the moment was to conduct testing locally. Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government was talking with the respective local councils ""about actions that we can take together to address the circumstances we are facing"". He said ""there are more things we can do immediately"", adding that ""the plan embarked on at this point"" was to look at ""further testing"" and ""mobilising the resources"" Welsh Government can provide to assist the councils. Wales' first minister says he hopes to make a decision on whether parts of the tourism sector can reopen next weekend âby the end of next weekâ. At last Fridayâs review of lockdown rules Mark Drakeford said he hoped to lift the stay-local rule and allow people to stay in self-contained accommodation from 27 March. Speaking at todayâs press conference Mr Drakeford said: âProvided things continue as they are - stable and improving - then Iâm hopeful that I'll be able to confirm that by the end of next week.â The first minister warned that âthere are some parts of Wales where the position is not as good as we would like it to be"". He added: âParis has gone back into a lockdown again, so we've known all along how fast circumstances can change in coronavirus. ""That's why it's important to wait until the last moment you can in order to make these decisions, because that way you have the best and latest data.â Ministers plan to wait until ""the last moment"" to decide whether it is safe to reopen the tourism sector in Wales for Easter Vaccinated people in Wales should continue to follow the Covid-19 rules because the jab is ""not a silver bullet"", according to the first minister. Mark Drakeford said it was ""a risk"" that people who have been vaccinated ""feel that it is safer"" to meet people indoors. But he asked people not to do that. Speaking at the Welsh Government's press conference, Mr Drakeford said: ""You may have been vaccinated but still most people in Wales have not been. ""And even when you have been vaccinated, it will take three weeks before you have any impact from it. ""The vaccine is not a silver bullet - it does not mean that people can behave in ways that create additional risk. ""There is some worrying evidence that where we are seeing these additional flare-ups of the virus it is because household mixing is resuming."" A month-long delay to 250,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine due to come to Wales will have to be taken into account during reviews on lifting coronavirus restrictions, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. ""Of course our ability to lift restrictions is linked to the successful vaccination programme,"" he said. ""But our hope must be that we continue to see the position in Wales [as] stable and reducing, and that we will continue to have the headroom to lift restrictions in the way that we hope."" The first minister added: ""I think when you lose a quarter of a million doses of vaccine, we can't pretend that it has no effect at all. ""We are doing everything we can to mitigate the effect on appointments for people to get vaccinated. There are a number of different ways in which we are looking to do that."" First Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government will examine the impact that the Covid pandemic has had on people with disabilities. ""I met the disability forum yesterday to discuss the impact of the pandemic,"" he said. ""We will set up a taskforce to address the inequalities disabled people are facing, as highlighted in a report presented by the group at that meeting."" Mr Drakeford added that next week the government would publish the Race Equality Action Plan for consultation. He said it would set out ""our aim of creating a truly anti-racist Wales by 2030"". First Minister Mark Drakeford says as the public health situation improves, restrictions are being relaxed. ""On Monday we will begin the process of opening non-essential retail, starting by lifting the restrictions on what those shops which are currently open can sell,"" he said. âGarden centres will also open. âIf conditions remain positive, on March 27 we will lift 'stay local' and begin the process of re-opening our tourism sector, starting with self-contained accommodation and organised outdoor childrenâs activities for the Easter holidays. âWe are also looking at if outdoor areas of some historic places and gardens can reopen to the public.â Mr Drakeford said a final decision on relaxing tourism restrictions would be made next week. First Minister Mark Drakeford is urging Welsh rugby fans to stick to the Covid rules and not gather when Wales play France in their final Six Nations game tomorrow evening. âIf youâre watching Wales this weekend, please watch with members of your household only,â he said. âSurely the last thing we want is to mark a potential Grand Slam weekend with the legacy of a surge in Covid cases.â First Minister Mark Drakeford says rises in Covid caseson Angleseyand inMerthyr Tydfilare being closely monitored with concerns about âan apparent reluctanceâ of some people to engage with contact tracing teams. Mr Drakeford said the overall public health situation in Wales remained stable at around 44 cases per 100,000 people and a positivity rate of 3.9%. But he said: âWe are closely monitoring the situation in Anglesey and Merthyr Tydfil where clusters of cases, linked to household and social mixing, have driven up the rates. âWe are particularly concerned about an apparent reluctance in some places, to engage with contact tracing teams. âThat contact is vital. âIt means we can identify the source of infection and how far it has spread.â Extended households and workplaces are behind a rise in Covid cases in Merthyr Tydfil, a health chief has said First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed the delay in the supply of vaccines following a four-week hold-up in a shipment to the UK from India. ""We are confident that no appointments for a second dose will be cancelled - and all appointments for the rest of this month will be honoured,"" he said. He said there were ""flexible plans"" and they would be adjusted to make sure that people get vaccinations in line with the supplies. On concerns in Europe over the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, Mr Drakeford said the UK's independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has confirmed that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing Covid-19 far outweighed any risks. âThe MHRA has said people should get their vaccine when invited. I strongly echo this advice,"" the first minister said First Minister Mark Drakeford says almost 40% of people in their 50s and 62% of people in priority group six in Wales â those with an underlying health condition â have had their first dose of a Covid vaccine. Speaking at the Welsh Governmentâs coronavirus briefing, he said more than  1.2m people had âsaid yes to the vaccineâ. The first minister said âgreat progressâ was being made in providing second doses over the last month. âMore than 318,000 people have completed the full two doses of the vaccine,"" Mr Drakeford said. âWe have the highest second dose vaccination rate in the UK.â Authorities in Wales have given second doses to a much higher proportion of the population than the other UK nations Public Health Wales has urged people with a BMI of 40 or higher to get their jabs. People in this bracket of BMI are at a higher risk of Covid according to Public Health Wales. These people are in eligibility group six, a group that contains all 16 to 64 year-olds with underlying health conditions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Guidance for people in England identified as being ""clinically extremely vulnerable"" is being updated from 19 July - but what is actually changing? Formal advice telling them to take extra care, or ""shield"", to avoid becoming seriously ill from Covid was paused at the start of April. Most coronavirus restrictionsare being lifted in Englandon 19 July. The government says people considered to be clinically extremely should, as a minimum, follow the same guidance as everyone else. However, if you are at higher risk of becoming ill, it says you may wish to ""think particularly carefully"" about taking extra precautions when meeting others you do not usually meet, including: limiting moments of close contact considering whether you and others have been fully vaccinated (you might want to wait until 14 days after your second dose before meeting) considering the risk if Covid levels are high in the general community meeting outside if possible ensuring inside spaces are well-ventilated washing hands regularly and avoiding face-touching continuing social distancing if that feels right for you asking friends/family to take lateral flow tests before meeting There is similar but separate official advice for people who have been shielding inScotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. Although Scotland moves toCovid protection level zero,externalon 19 July, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidkeeping the mandatory use of face coveringspast then would give ""added protection and assurance"" to people who were particularly vulnerable. From 19 July in England, general advice to work from home where possible will end - as will the need for social distancing measures in the workplace. However, companies still havelegally binding health and safety responsibilities,external- and your employer should explain the measures in place to keep you safe at work. Some firms, for example, may ask employees to take regular Covid tests to identify asymptomatic people. TheCoronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough),externalis available until 30 September. You may be eligible to benefit, provided your employer agrees. You may also qualify for Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) or Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) if you are sick or incapable of work, either due to coronavirus or other health reasons. Read theupdated government advice,external. Although the legal requirement to wear a face covering is being lifted from 19 July, the government says it ""expects and recommends"" that people wear them in crowded areas - such as busy shops and public transport. You should consider travelling outside peak hours, and shopping at quieter times of day, to reduce the number of people you come into contact with. You may be more comfortable booking supermarket deliveries online. TheNHS Volunteer Responders,externalprogramme is still available to offer support. Data showsCovid vaccines are highly effectivein most people in clinical risk groups. Two doses are needed for best protection. Being double-jabbed reduces the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%, say experts. But no vaccine is 100% effective. Some people with weak immune systems may not get as much benefit from the vaccine, for example. You should already have been offered a vaccine but, if not,book through the NHS website,externalor call 119. The most vulnerable peopleare likely to be offered booster jabs from September,external, to provide extra protection against virus variants through the winter months. You are encouraged to go outside for exercise and attend NHS appointments for your existing health conditions. The pandemic may have triggered feelings of worry, distress or loneliness - a normal response to an unprecedented period of disruption. The governmentrecommends several support websites,external. If you are thought to be at very high risk of serious illness from coronavirus you will have been put on theNHS Shielded Patient List,external. A combination of factors can contribute toa person's risk,external, including: age (older being higher risk) ethnicity deprivation (according to postcode) weight (body mass index) underlying health issues prescribed medications Cancer patients need to take extra care High risk categories,externalinclude people: with transplanted solid organs undergoing some cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy on immunosuppression drugs with heart disease who are also pregnant with severe respiratory conditions (for example: cystic fibrosis, severe asthma and COPD) with rare diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency with Down's syndrome (adults) on dialysis or with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (adults) EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"Annabelle Smith was offered her ""dream role"" after appearing on national radio A woman made redundant three times during the pandemic has found her ""dream role"" after calling into a radio phone-in. Annabelle Smith, 29, lost her job as a marketing manager in March, a property company role in May and finally as an assistant gym manager in December. After calling a careers advice panel on BBC Radio 5 Live she was offered a marketing job by one of the experts. Her new employer said she liked Ms Smith's ""energy and tenacity"". ""When you're unemployed you're looking for a job as a survival route, not as a stepping stone,"" Ms Smith said. She was ""despondent"" after successfully researching, applying and interviewing for jobs only to lose them when a new round of lockdown restrictions kicked in. ""It got to the point where I was being rejected from jobs I'm overqualified for or being invited to trial days being told I've 'exceeded expectations' but not been given the job.""

"PM Boris Johnson has received his first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, saying he ""did not feel a thing"" The UK's latest R number is estimated to be between 0.6 and 0.9, government figures suggest The figure shows the average number of people each person goes on to infect and when below 1 it means the Covid epidemic is shrinking The UK saw 7% more deaths than normally expected during 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics A further 101 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test are recorded in the UK More than two million people in the UK have now received a second dose of a vaccine European countries including Germany, France, Italy and Spain are resuming use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine The positive benefits of the vaccine outweigh risks, the World Health Organization says, with data not suggesting an increase in blood clots Edited by James Clarke and Sarah Collerton That's all from the team so goodbye for now. Your updates were written by Hamish Mackay, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Katie Wright and Sarah Collerton. We're about to bring our coronavirus updates to a close for the day. Before we go, here's a look at what's been going on in the UK and around the world: This video can not be played ""That was the last time mummy ever saw him"" Today marks a year since the first Covid-19 related death was reported in Northern Ireland. It came three weeks after the first case of coronavirus in Northern Ireland was confirmed. Since then, more than 2,000 people have died. Three families have spoken to BBC News NI about losing a loved one, coping with grief and saying goodbye in the midst of a pandemic. You can read that piece here. A GP surgery was ""overwhelmed"" when it received more than 126,000 calls in one day about Covid-19 vaccinations, health chiefs have revealed. One patient tried ringing the practice in Stockton-on-Tees 300 times in the space of a morning, they said. Other surgeries have also reported a ""deluge"" of similar calls. NHS Tees Valley Clinical Commissioning Group has warned the volume of calls prevents patients with urgent healthcare needs from getting through. Janet Walker, medical director at NHS Tees Valley CCG, said: ""The number of calls practices are getting from people inquiring about the vaccine is absolutely overwhelming, with one practice receiving over 126,000 calls in one day. ""We are asking people again - please, please do not phone your practice about vaccinations."" You can read the full story here. The current estimate for R - the average number of others each infected person passes the virus to - currently stands between 0.6-0.9 in the UK. However, the value of R varies across the UK. In Northern Ireland, for example, the R number is between 0.9-1.1. Below, you can see how the estimate for R has changed in recent months. During the past 12 months, many of the major events in the royal calendar have been cancelled or postponed because of the ongoing pandemic. Now, the Queen's official birthday celebration known as Trooping the Colour has been cancelled for a second year running. The annual event, which sees thousands of well-wishers fill central London to watch the Queen and members of the Royal Family travel to and from the spectacle, will not go ahead its traditional form, Buckingham Palace has said. Last summer, an event dubbed ""mini Trooping"" was staged at Windsor Castle and the palace says options for an ""alternative parade"" were being considered at the Queen's Berkshire home. The annual Garter service, which sees the Royal Family parading through the grounds of Windsor Castle in their ceremonial robes, will also not go ahead in June, the palace says. Multiple coronavirus vaccines are being rolled out in the UK and around the world. Each one is being seen as a way out of the global pandemic and the quickest way to get things back to normal. In many countries, having a vaccine is not mandatory yet the success of vaccination programmes depends upon how many people take up the offer of one. So what will happen if you choose not to get the vaccine? BBC News Health Reporter Laura Foster explains. This video can not be played What happens if I don't get the Covid vaccine? We've got more on the prime minister getting his vaccine. Boris Johnson received his first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine after reassuring the public that it is ""safe"". ""I literally did not feel a thing. It was very good, very quick,"" Johnson says after receiving the jab at St Thomas' Hospital in London. ""I cannot recommend it too highly, everybody when you do get your notification to go for a jab, please go and get it, it is the best thing for you, best thing for your family and for everyone else."" We've got the full story here. For weeks now, Covid-19 infection rates have been falling across the UK. But there are some towns that have bucked the trend, with infections remaining stubbornly high. This is particularly true of towns where the local economy relies on manufacturing, construction or food processing jobs - the kind of work that simply can't be done from home. BBC health correspondent Dominic Hughes has taken a closer look at the situation in some of those towns. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Johnson, 56, spent time in intensive care at St Thomas' Hospital in London last year after contracting Covid-19. He returned to the same hospital for his jab and left telling journalists he ""did not feel a thing"" and encouraged people to get their vaccination. As we reported earlier, the UK has recorded a further 101 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. While the daily figures can fluctuate due to delays in reporting, the seven-day average gives a clearer indication of the true situation. The seven-day average for deaths by this measure now stands at 98. The seven-day average for new cases, meanwhile, now stands at 5,343, after a further 4,802 were recorded yesterday. The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall have thanked volunteers for supporting people during the pandemic, saying they have been a ""great help"". They took part in a video call to thank members of the Royal Voluntary Service (RVS) to mark one year since it launched the NHS Volunteer Responders Scheme. The Queen, patron of the RVS, said they had done ""wonderful work"", including delivering books to people. Nearly one million volunteers have been recruited to the scheme. You can read the full story here. A woman who has been making scrubs for NHS workers says it was ""absolutely phenomenal"" to be vaccinated by a nurse wearing one of her creations. Caroline Farquharson, 50, from Bracknell, went to the Waitrose HQ Sports and Leisure Centre for her first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. She was treated by a nurse adorned in an unmistakable red and white pattern, made from an old duvet. ""What were the chances of that?"" she asks the BBC. ""It was brilliant."" Caroline started making colourful clothing for the NHS last March when a local group called Rainbow Scrubs was looking for volunteers. She has since made about 95 full sets, all in her spare time. You can read the full story here. Less than 12% of the EU's population is reportedto have received the vaccine,external, compared with nearly 40% in the UK. The rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine across the bloc has hit a number of hurdles. In January, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the jab for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initiallyrefused to recommend its use for people over 65. France and Germany eventually revised their stance andapproved the vaccine for people aged 65-74at the beginning of March. However, they were among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again in March, after reports a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab. They restarted it after the EMA said there was no evidence the vaccine caused the clots. However, the French authorities say only people aged 55 and over should get the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. The headlines surrounding AstraZeneca may have led people to be reluctant about taking the jab. Some countries arereporting,externalthat as many as half of the doses delivered to them are currently unused. Read more about the other issues facing the EU. A woman made redundant three times during the pandemic has found her ""dream role"" after calling into a BBC radio phone-in. Annabelle Smith, 29, lost her job as a marketing manager in March, a property company role in May and finally as an assistant gym manager in December. After taking part in a careers discussion on BBC Radio 5 Live, she was offered a job by one of the panellists, Catherine Shuttleworth, who runs marketing agency Get Savvy, based in Leeds. Shuttleworth says she was impressed with Smith's ""energy and tenacity"" on the radio. After an interview and formal job offer, Smith has started her ""dream role"" at the agency. ""It was surreal,"" she says. ""Neither of us knew we were going to be on the show.It was almost fate."" Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi, 53, has been photographed receiving a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine today in London. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 56,is due to receive his later. Chelsea Leigh Richardson said her mum Sarah was her rock For Chelsea Leigh Richardson and her four siblings, life has changed beyond belief since their mum Sarah died with Covid in October, aged 42. ""Mum was our everything, then all of a sudden she was gone,"" she says. Faced with the loss of their only parent, the 21-year-old went from big sister to the sole carer of her younger brothers and sisters - Kala-Jai, 19, Jayden, 17, Preston-James, 14, and seven-year-old Bobbee-Mae -overnight. Chelsea was determined the five of them would not be split up, so she became the glue to hold them together. She says: ""I pulled my big girl knickers up and said to myself: 'Come on Chels, you can do this. Be brave.'"" You can read Chelsea's story here. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The Swiss government says there will be no relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions for at least another four weeks. There had been tentative plans to allow bars and restaurants to open their outdoor terraces next week, and to allow small cultural events - but today the government has said the situation remains too risky. Cases have been rising again over the past two weeks, and at least 80% of all new cases are the more infectious B117 (UK) variant. The government says the limit on private gatherings will be raised from five to 10, but is warning families to follow strict distancing and hygiene rules, and to enjoy Easter outside if possible. It also advises people to take advantage of the new mass testing system, which is free to all, before meeting friends and relatives. The government believes the criteria for relaxation of restrictions must include not just falling cases, hospitalisations, and R value, but that all risk groups are vaccinated. Switzerland has so far vaccinated about 12% of its population of 8.6 million. A blind woman who was sent a shielding letter she could not read has won ""promising"" commitments from the government after a legal challenge. Sarah Leadbetter, from Narborough in Leicestershire, is classed as clinically extremely vulnerable. However, government correspondence advising her to shield was not sent in a format she could access - which she argued was discrimination. The government has agreed to review its communication with disabled people. Leadbetter, 45, who is registered blind, says she is ""very proud"" of the results of her legal challenge. You can read the full story here. There are many thousands of different versions, or variants, of Covid circulating, including those first identified in Kent, Brazil or South Africa. The so-called Kent variant is now the most commonly found strain  in the UK and it's more easily spread than the first variant, which arrived in Spring 2020. Scientists are looking at tweaking the coronavirus vaccines to make sure they continue to be highly effective. But where are these variants coming from? What are these new variants? And why do viruses mutate in the first place? Health correspondent Laura Foster explains. This video can not be played Covid variants: What happens when a virus mutates? Â© 2025 BBC.

"There have been calls from tourism businesses for a firm reopening date A decision on whether Welsh tourism can reopen in time for Easter will not be made until ""the last moment"", the first minister has confirmed. Self-contained holiday accommodation could reopen on 27 March if coronavirus case rates remain stable under Welsh government plans. Tourism businesses have called forroadmap to allow them to prepare and for people to book trips. Mr Drakeford said any confirmation would not be given until next week. Speaking at the Welsh government's coronavirus briefing on Friday, Mr Drakeford said it was important ""to wait until the last moment you can"" before making and announcing decisions about easing lockdown, to see if case rates had changed. ""There are some parts of Wales where the position is not as good as we would like it to be,"" he said. ""People who follow the newswill have seen overnight Paris has gone back into a lockdown again, so we've known all along how fast circumstances can change in coronavirus. ""That's why it's important to wait until the last moment you can in order to make these decisions because that way you have the best and latest data."" Sue Steadman started her business, Cadair View Lodge, in 2003 with her then husband. Sue Steadman, who runs Cadair View Lodge in Snowdonia, said: ""Obviously it makes it more difficult. But we've had so much last-minute changes it's almost what we've come to expect."" ""We've lost income, I haven't been paid since 2019 because everything I have has gone into running the business,"" she said. ""People need certainty. At the moment customers are debating whether or not to come thinking the pub won't be open, or the takeaway won't be available."" ""We have a lot of regular guests who have all been very supportive. And they're looking forward to coming back,"" she said. ""The business has been running for 17 years, some of them have become like family. There have been first dates, proposals, and families brought to stay."" Hywel James Davies, who runs the South Wales Touring Park in Llanelli, said: ""I'm not sure that two days is enough time to prepare everything to open up but we'll cross our fingers and hope that everything will go to plan."" Siblings Hywel and Cathrin run the site together on their farm Mr Davies and his sister Cathrin have made the most of the lockdown by making improvements to the site for when customers come back. ""It's been very hard. But it's looking good this year, we're booked up,"" he said. ""I'm looking forward to reopening to tell the truth. It's what we want, for people to come on their holidays and enjoy their stay with us."" What are Wales' lockdown rules? Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us? Mr Drakeford also refused to rule out local lockdown restrictions in two hot spot areas in Wales, after a spike in cases. Rates on Anglesey stand at 127.1 for every 100,000 people, and 147.5 in Merthyr Tydfil. Those higher levels of infection compare with an average falling rate for Wales of 43.7 per 100,000 people. Mr Drakeford said the rise in cases in the communities was linked to ""household and social mixing"", and there were concerns people were not engaging with contact tracers. A Oxford-AstraZeneca shipment for Wales has been delayed by four weeks A delayed shipment from India to the UK could also impact the easing of lockdown, the first minister warned. An estimated 250,000 Oxford-AstraZeneca doses due to arrive in Walesby mid-April are set to be delivereda month late. Mr Drakeford said he could not pretend the delayed doses would ""have no affect at all"". From Monday garden centres will be allowed to reopen, and supermarkets to sell ""non-essential goods"", under slight easing of lockdown rules. Mr Drakeford said he hoped more could be allowed - including outdoor children's activities and the reopening of castle grounds - in coming weeks if cases continued to fall. ""Of course our ability to lift restrictions is linked to the successful vaccination programme,"" he said. ""But our hope must be that we continue to see the position in Wales [as] stable and reducing, and that we will continue to have the headroom to lift restrictions in the way that we hope."" He said he was confident that no vaccine appointments would be cancelled due to the delay, but that the loss of such a large amount of doses would have an effect. ""We are doing everything we can to mitigate the effect on appointments for people to get vaccinated, there are a number of different ways in which we are looking to do that,"" he said. Reacting to the briefing, the Conservative group leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies said it was ""unfair"" for supermarkets to be allowed to sell non-essential goods, and called for the high street to reopen. ""If he feels it's safe for supermarkets why persecute the high street and say the high street can't do that?"" he said. Member of the Senedd for Ynys Mon Rhun ap Iorwerth said while he did not want to see his area placed under local lockdown again, the option was needed to stop case rates rising further. The Plaid Cymru MS called for more support for people who were told to self-isolate in the area.

"This video can not be played Young people ""frustrated"" about suspended driving lessons Young learner drivers are ""frustrated"" that lessons remain stuck in neutral under lockdown rules in Wales. With hairdressers set to reopen in Wales, driving instructors and learners have questioned why they cannot start lessons once again. Protests by instructors are taking place across the country. The Welsh government has now confirmed car lessons should be able to resume on 12 April, if coronavirus cases continue to fall. Car driving tests should also be able to restart from 22 April. Driving instructors are protesting in various places in Wales Learners like Georgia Davies, from Aberystwyth, have been stalled and relying on sometimes ""erratic"" public transport. She has spent roughly Â£2,000 on lessons, tests and a car but her driving test has been cancelled four times. It has also left her unable to apply for some jobs, that require a driving licence, before she heads to university in the autumn. ""There was a long waiting list for a test because of the pandemic last year,"" she said. ""It has since been cancelled four times and now my theory test has expired. ""So I have to re-sit that in June, meaning I won't be able to do my practical test for a long time after that. It's really unfair."" The delay has meant relying on public transport, often to see friends who live an hour away. ""I have a car because I thought I'd be driving by now, but it's costing a lot for insurance and tax - and I can't even drive it."" Driving instructors call for restart clarity Learner drivers 'anxious' for tests to restart Learner drivers park manual cars in shift to automatic ""I can't wait for the freedom. It's really frustrating because I've got plans and my own car but I can't do anything with it."" Harry Nicholls is desperate to take his new car on the road Harry Nicholls was hoping to take his test on Friday, having been postponed from last summer, but Covid rules mean he is not allowed. The next available date is not until September. ""I started learning after my birthday in March, which was when lockdown started,"" said the 17-year-old from Monmouth. ""I passed my theory test and my parents booked me 10 lessons, but I couldn't start them because of lockdown. ""After [the first] lockdown I went out for 15 lessons with an instructor and by the end I was in a good position to pass my test."" Then lockdown happened again and having spent Â£450 on lessons, Harry has also spent Â£4,500 on a Kia Rio that has sat outside the house. ""It's a nightmare. It [the car] cost a lot and it's getting to the point where I am wondering whether it was worth it,"" he said. ""Not being able to go out with friends is an issue and being in Monmouth it's harder to get to other places, especially with buses, they can be erratic."" Daisy Corne has to be careful using public transport because of a medical condition Daisy Corne, 18, has a condition that makes her clinically vulnerable ""I've to be quite careful on trains and buses, which is why cars and taxis are a better option, which is why it would be good to be able to drive."" Daisy, who is preparing to start a health and social care course at Cardiff Metropolitan University, has had to cancel two tests. She is hopeful it will be third time lucky later in the year. ""It would be a lot less stress knowing I could get in the car and go wherever,"" she said. The Welsh government said it had been a difficult time, especially for business owners. A spokesman added: ""If the public health situation continues to improve, we will be able to carry on relaxing restrictions in a phased way, being careful not to undermine all the progress made by everyone in Wales to bring coronavirus cases under control."" ""We hope driving lessons will be able to resume from April 12 and tests from April 22, in line with the DVSA's [Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency] roadmap."" Organiser of the Newport protest Luke Thompson said ""we want clarity"" Protests have been staged in multiple cities on Friday hoping to see driving lessons resume soon. Luke Thompson, is the director of M4 motoring driving school and the Newport protest organiser. He said they wanted ""clarity"" from the Welsh government about restarting their businesses. ""We believe we've done enough to ensure our cars are safe."" Thomas Netherway is at the Newport protest Thomas Netherway is also at the Newport protest and the halt on driving lessons have caused a financial struggle.

"First-year bankers at investment bank Goldman Sachs have warned that they might quit unless their gruelling working conditions improve. An internal survey among 13 employees showed they averaged 95 hours of work a week and slept five hours a night. Their personal relationships also suffered as did their physical and mental health. The analysts warned that they would be likely to leave within six months unless things changed. Bank boss rejects work from home as a 'new normal' Bank boss gets $10m pay cut for Malaysia scandal Banking giant Goldman Sachs lets in more women The survey offers a rare glimpse into the fiercely competitive work culture of Wall Street's top firms, where junior analysts scramble for well-paid career paths. The survey,which began circulating on social media on Wednesday,external, is presented on Goldman Sachs-branded slides that note they were produced within the investment banking division. But the BBC understands that the survey was conducted by a ""self-selected"" group of US-based first-year investment banking analysts among themselves. ""The sleep deprivation, the treatment by senior bankers, the mental and physical stressâ¦ I've been through foster care and this is arguably worse,"" one respondent said in the survey, which has been seen by the BBC. ""This is beyond the level of 'hard-working', this is inhumane/abuse,"" said another. All of the respondents said the job had negatively affected their relationships with friends and family, while 77% said they had been victims of workplace abuse. It's not just those in the world of finance who endure long days and little sleep. David works in software development. Before the pandemic he would travel from his home in Torquay in Devon to London on a Sunday night and only return on Friday evening - sometimes not getting through the door before midnight. On top of his full-time job, he always has a side project that can keep him up until 02:00 and intrudes on weekends. He says his wife would describe him as a workaholic but he doesn't use the term himself. ""I'm definitely the kind of person who would sleep less if I could,"" David says. ""It's wasted time."" Before working for the firm, the analysts assessed their own mental health at 8.8 out of 10 and their physical health at 9 out of 10. After starting the job, they rated their mental health at 2.8 and their physical health at 2.3. 83% said they had experienced ""excessive monitoring or micromanagement"", while 17% said they frequently experienced shouting or swearing. The survey recommended maximum 80-hour work weeks with no work on Saturday or after 9pm on Friday. It also urged more realistic deadlines and better work flows aimed at reducing stress. The analysts presented their findings to Goldman Sachs' management in February, and the bank said it has since taken steps to address employee burnout among this small group, and wider teams. This video can not be played White boys' club? New tales from the City ""We recognise that our people are very busy, because business is strong and volumes are at historic levels,"" a spokeswoman for the bank told the BBC. ""A year into Covid, people are understandably quite stretched, and that's why we are listening to their concerns and taking multiple steps to address them."" The bank says it has been reinforcing its ""Saturday Exception"" policy and moving to automate certain tasks for junior staff. Goldman Sachs reported net revenues of $44.6bn (Â£32.1bn) for 2020.

"The government has announced the first stages of its plans to get ultra-fast broadband to the remotest of homes in the UK. Originally it had promised to roll out gigabit-speed broadband to every home in Britain by 2025 but that was reduced to 85% coverage in November. The budget remains at Â£5bn - but only Â£1.2bn of that will be made available up to 2024. The infrastructure build should start in 2022, the government said. The first to benefit will be homes and businesses in Cambridgeshire, Cornwall, Cumbria, Dorset, Durham, Essex, Northumberland, South Tyneside and Tees Valley. The next areas are expected to be Norfolk, Shropshire, Suffolk, Worcestershire, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. A former voucher scheme is also being relaunched to provide more immediate help to those struggling with poor broadband coverage, with up to Â£210m being made available. It is expected that commercial deployments of gigabit-capable fibre networks will reach more than 70% of premises by the end of 2025, without government intervention. The government has said that reaching the final 1% of homes in very remote areas could be prohibitively expensive. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described Project Gigabit as ""the rocket boost that we need to get lightning-fast broadband to all areas of the country"". The trade organisation techUK has also welcomed the news. And speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Oliver Dowden said:  ""We've already made tremendous progress with Project Gigabit - our national mission to get everyone in the country the fastest broadband on the planet. ""We've gone from around 9% coverage in 2019 to 40% now - I'm confident we'll get to 60% by the end of the year. ""The challenge is the last 20%, which can't be delivered commercially - and that's what our plans being outlined today are all about."" He reiterated the watered-down plans to reach ""at least 85% of the country by 2025"". ""I think we will be able to go faster than that still - and the prime minister and I are meeting with telecoms companies again.

"The government has announced the first stages of its plans to get ultra-fast broadband to the remotest of homes in the UK. Originally it had promised to roll out gigabit-speed broadband to every home in Britain by 2025 but that was reduced to 85% coverage in November. The budget remains at Â£5bn - but only Â£1.2bn of that will be made available up to 2024. The infrastructure build should start in 2022, the government said. The first to benefit will be homes and businesses in Cambridgeshire, Cornwall, Cumbria, Dorset, Durham, Essex, Northumberland, South Tyneside and Tees Valley. The next areas are expected to be Norfolk, Shropshire, Suffolk, Worcestershire, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. A former voucher scheme is also being relaunched to provide more immediate help to those struggling with poor broadband coverage, with up to Â£210m being made available. It is expected that commercial deployments of gigabit-capable fibre networks will reach more than 70% of premises by the end of 2025, without government intervention.

"Ms Sturgeon gave evidence to the inquiry in a marathon eight-hour session earlier this month A majority of MSPs on the Alex Salmond committee have said Nicola Sturgeon misled their inquiry, sources have told the BBC. It is understood MSPs on the committee voted by five to four that the SNP leader had given them an inaccurate account. The committee's final report is expected to be published next Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon has insisted she stands by all of the evidence she gave to the committee earlier this month. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross has called for the first minister to resign. However, Ms Sturgeon told Sky News: ""What has been clear is that opposition members of this committee made their minds up before I uttered a single word of evidence. Their public comments have made that clear. Laura Kuenssberg: 'More than Nicola Sturgeon's future' ""So this very partisan leak tonight before they've actually finalised the report is not that surprising. ""Let's wait and see the final report, but more importantly the question of whether or not I breached the ministerial code is being considered independently by James Hamilton and I hope and expect he will publish that report soon."" Mr Hamilton, a senior Irish lawyer, has been specifically examining whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code, which says that any minister who knowingly misleads parliament would be ""expected to offer their resignation"". His inquiry is separate from the committee and is also expected to publish its report in the coming days. What is the Salmond and Sturgeon row all about? Could Alex Salmond bring down Nicola Sturgeon? Watch - Panorama: Salmond V Sturgeon The cross-party committee includes four SNP MSPs, two Conservatives, one Labour, one Liberal Democrat and independent Andy Wightman. A spokesman for the Scottish Parliament said the committee was still finalising its report, and it would not make any comment until it was published. Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond - her predecessor as first minister and SNP leader - have both taken part  in lengthy evidence sessions in front of the committee in recent weeks. Mr Salmond claimed to have been the victim of a ""malicious scheme"" drawn up by figures within the SNP who are close to Ms Sturgeon. Mr Salmond was Ms Sturgeon's political mentor, but the pair have been embroiled in an increasingly bitter war of words But Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that any suggestion there had been conspiracy were ""absurd"", and insisted she had not been out to ""get"" Mr Salmond. She told the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that Mr Salmond and his ""cronies"" In the ""old boys' club"" had been spinning ""conspiracy theories"" which opposition politicians had bought into. It came after Conservative MP David Davis - a longstanding friend of Mr Salmond - used parliamentary privilege in the House of Commons to read out messages that he suggested showed a ""concerted effort by senior members of the SNP to encourage complaints"" against the former first minister. Nicola Sturgeon did not intervene in the investigation into harassment complaints against Alex Salmond. The dispute is about whether or not she was ever prepared to. Alex Salmond claims she was and is backed up in that by his lawyer, Duncan Hamilton who went with him to see Nicola Sturgeon on 2 April 2018. Nicola Sturgeon claims she made clear an intervention would not be possible, although she has also acknowledged that in trying to let Mr Salmond down gently she may not have been blunt enough. Her testimony is understood to be supported by written evidence from one of her colleagues, shared with the committee in private. The opposition majority appears to have found Team Salmond's evidence more persuasive. SNP members refuse to accept Team Sturgeon has given a misleading account. With the committee divided along party lines over the first minister's conduct, the conclusions of James Hamilton - the Irish lawyer who's independently examining the evidence - gain ever greater importance. Some MSPs on the committee - including the SNP MSP who chairs it - have accused the government of attempting to frustrate its work Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""All the evidence points to the fact that Nicola Sturgeon misled parliament, misled the people of Scotland and has to resign. ""I have said for weeks that evidence against Nicola Sturgeon has been mounting, it has been growing and it is clear she has breached the ministerial code. ""You cannot continue as first minister of Scotland if you have misled Parliament and breached the ministerial code."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said it would be ""incredibly serious"" if the committee concluded that the first minister had misled parliament and potentially breached the ministerial code. He added: ""This is about the integrity of our Scottish Parliament and upholding standards in public life.""

"This video can not be played Blinken: We will discuss ""our deep concerns with actions by China"" US and Chinese officials have exchanged sharp rebukes in the first high-level talks between the Biden administration and China, taking place in Alaska. Chinese officials accused the US of inciting countries ""to attack China"", while the US said China had ""arrived intent on grandstanding"". Relations between the two superpowers are at their most strained for years. The US pledged to raise contentious issues such as Beijing's treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. Who are the Uighurs? The ill-tempered talks in Anchorage involved Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on the US side, facing off with China's most senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, and foreign minister Wang Yi. However, a US official said the subsequent talks behind closed doors had been ""substantive, serious and direct"" and ran over the planned two hours. Are the US and China in a new 'Cold War'? Details released of Biden's first call with Xi In a blunt opening statement before the talks in private, Mr Blinken said the US would ""discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion of our allies"". ""Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability,"" he said. This video can not be played Yang Jiechi: US not qualified to ""speak from a position of strength"" when criticising China In response, Mr Yang accused Washington of using its military might and financial supremacy to suppress other countries. ""It abuses so-called notions of national security to obstruct normal trade exchanges, and incite some countries to attack China,"" he added. Mr Yang said human rights in the US were at a low point, with black Americans being ""slaughtered"". Mr Sullivan hit back, saying Washington did not seek a conflict with China, but added: ""We will always stand up for our principles for our people, and for our friends."" Can the US and China work together? The exchange, which took place in front of the world's media, went on for more than an hour. It came at the start of three sessions, which are due to end on Friday morning. It is the first high-level meeting between the US and China since last June - during the administration of the previous US President, Donald Trump. It was an unusually undiplomatic sparring match, especially for a meeting called to take stock of the US-China relationship under a new American administration. Beforehand the Biden team had been blunt in public criticism of Beijing. So the Chinese knew what to expect and seemed to have come prepared to hit back. They were particularly angry that Washington had imposed sanctions on them the day before the talks, over a crackdown on pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong. There may have been a certain amount of posturing involved, as a US official said the private conversation that followed was substantive and serious. The Biden administration has said it will be tough on issues of concern, but willing to work with Beijing on matters of interest. However, it has described the relationship as a geopolitical competition between democracy and autocracy. And the Chinese have refused to compromise on what they say are matters of national sovereignty and security. Whether or not they can find pragmatic points of co-operation will be the measure of how the relationship moves forward. Afterwards, the US delegation accused China of violating the agreed protocol of two minutes of opening remarks by each side. ""The Chinese delegation... seems to have arrived intent on grandstanding, focused on public theatrics and dramatics over substance,"" a senior administration official said. The official said the US would continue with the talks as planned, adding that ""exaggerated diplomatic presentations often are aimed at a domestic audience"". In later remarks via state media, Chinese officials said it had been the US, not China, that had violated protocol by exceeding the agreed time in opening remarks. They accused the US of making a ""groundless attack on China's domestic and foreign policies"". On a more positive note, it quoted Mr Yang as saying that ""serious difficulties in China-US relations in the past should not continue"". The BBC's Barbara Plett Usher says the talks are the first chance for the Biden administration to show how it intends to deal with what Mr Blinken has called ""the biggest geopolitical test of the 21st Century"". China is looking for a reset after relations hit rock bottom under the Trump administration, our correspondent adds. Mr Wang has said that Beijing is ready to reopen ""constructive dialogue."" Quite a lot. Trade for instance. The US accuses China of unfair practices, such as subsidising industries, stealing intellectual property, keeping its currency low and putting up barriers to trade. For its part, China wants the big trade tariffs introduced by the Trump administration on Chinese goods eliminated. It also accuses the US of ""suppressing"" successful Chinese tech companies, such as Huawei. Human rights and democracy. The US accuses China of genocide against the Uighur population in the province of Xinjiang, and trampling on democratic rights in Hong Kong with a recently introduced security law. What the US really wants from the China talks But China calls on the US to stop interfering in what Beijing considers its internal affairs and accuses the US of ""smearing"" the ruling Communist Party. China is also pushing back against what it sees as US naval encroachment in the South China Sea, which Beijing considers Chinese territory. Why is the South China Sea contentious? Are the US and China in a new 'Cold War'? What the US really wants from the China talks Details released of Biden's first call with Xi China takes new foreign investment top spot from US China says Uighur genocide claims 'absurd' Huawei boss hopes for better relations with US Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"Bernard McGovern had admitted attacking Kevin Lunney and Dara O'Reilly An amateur boxer has been jailed for three years and three months for assaulting two directors of the former Quinn group of companies. Bernard McGovern, 24, from Springtown Road in Kinawley, County Fermanagh, admitted attacking Kevin Lunney and Dara O'Reilly at a service station in County Cavan on 1 February 2019. He was sentenced on Friday. Mr Lunney and Mr O'Reilly were having lunch in Ballyconnell when they were attacked. Cavan Circuit Court was told that McGovern punched Kevin Lunney up to eight times in the face, leaving the chief operating officer with a broken nose and swollen eye. He also threw a cup of hot tea in the face of Mr O'Reilly, the chief financial officer. The previous day McGovern's father had been fired from his job as a driver with the company. The court was told McGovern had no involvement in subsequent events in September 2019, when Mr Lunney was abducted and tortured by a gang. Kevin Lunney was attacked while eating lunch The judge described the attack as the two men were having lunch as ""callous and premeditated"". In his sentencing remarks, the judge said McGovern had been motivated by a desire to avenge a grievance. He said the prize-winning boxer had caused very serious injuries through ""the vicious use of his fists"" and had thrown a cup of recently-boiled water in the face of Mr O'Reilly. The judge said the offences were at the upper end of the scale when it came to assault causing harm, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. He added that although the accused had pleaded guilty, that was in the context of the overwhelming case against him. The Quinn group of companies - of which Kevin Lunney and Dara O'Reilly were directors - was rebranded last year The judge said he would give McGovern some credit for his young age and no previous convictions. He said ""his first experience of prison will no doubt be hard on him"". McGovern was sentenced to three years and three months in prison for assault causing harm for the attack on Mr Lunney, and five months for assaulting Mr O'Reilly, to be served concurrently. McGovern will receive credit for six-and-a-half months already spent in custody. The judge said the offer of â¬1,000 (Â£854) compensation to Mr Lunney as a token of his remorse was not appropriate in this case, given the severe nature of the injuries. He said he had also considered suspending a portion of the sentence but had decided it was not appropriate to do so.

"First-year bankers at investment bank Goldman Sachs have warned that they might quit unless their gruelling working conditions improve. An internal survey among 13 employees showed they averaged 95 hours of work a week and slept five hours a night. Their personal relationships also suffered as did their physical and mental health. The analysts warned that they would be likely to leave within six months unless things changed. Bank boss rejects work from home as a 'new normal' Bank boss gets $10m pay cut for Malaysia scandal Banking giant Goldman Sachs lets in more women The survey offers a rare glimpse into the fiercely competitive work culture of Wall Street's top firms, where junior analysts scramble for well-paid career paths. The survey,which began circulating on social media on Wednesday,external, is presented on Goldman Sachs-branded slides that note they were produced within the investment banking division. But the BBC understands that the survey was conducted by a ""self-selected"" group of US-based first-year investment banking analysts among themselves. ""The sleep deprivation, the treatment by senior bankers, the mental and physical stressâ¦ I've been through foster care and this is arguably worse,"" one respondent said in the survey, which has been seen by the BBC. ""This is beyond the level of 'hard-working', this is inhumane/abuse,"" said another. All of the respondents said the job had negatively affected their relationships with friends and family, while 77% said they had been victims of workplace abuse. It's not just those in the world of finance who endure long days and little sleep. David works in software development. Before the pandemic he would travel from his home in Torquay in Devon to London on a Sunday night and only return on Friday evening - sometimes not getting through the door before midnight. On top of his full-time job, he always has a side project that can keep him up until 02:00 and intrudes on weekends. He says his wife would describe him as a workaholic but he doesn't use the term himself. ""I'm definitely the kind of person who would sleep less if I could,"" David says. ""It's wasted time."" Before working for the firm, the analysts assessed their own mental health at 8.8 out of 10 and their physical health at 9 out of 10. After starting the job, they rated their mental health at 2.8 and their physical health at 2.3. 83% said they had experienced ""excessive monitoring or micromanagement"", while 17% said they frequently experienced shouting or swearing. The survey recommended maximum 80-hour work weeks with no work on Saturday or after 9pm on Friday. It also urged more realistic deadlines and better work flows aimed at reducing stress. The analysts presented their findings to Goldman Sachs' management in February, and the bank said it has since taken steps to address employee burnout among this small group, and wider teams. This video can not be played White boys' club?

The bank says it has been reinforcing its ""Saturday Exception"" policy and moving to automate certain tasks for junior staff. Goldman Sachs reported net revenues of $44.6bn (Â£32.1bn) for 2020.

This compares with 1,657 recorded cases last winter, the largest year-on-year drop ever recorded. Catherine Moore of Public Health Wales said measures to slow the spread of Covid had led to reduced levels of flu in winter she had never seen before.

It comes as several EU nations, including Germany and France, have pledged to continue their roll-out of the jab following their suspension of its use amid fears it caused blood clots. Mr Johnson claimed on Thursday that the AstraZeneca jab was safe but ""the thing that isn't safe is catching Covid, which is why it is so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes"". ""The way to ensure this [lockdown easing] happens is to get that jab when your turn comes, so let's get the jab done,"" he said.

believe weâve done enough to ensure our cars are safe.â Instructor Anita Hughes: âWeâre sanitising cars and assuring everything is clean"" Wales' first minister has urged people who are contacted by test and trace teams to âplease take it seriously."" Mark Drakeford told reporters that this week there had been âsome evidence that in some places people are reluctant to cooperateâ. âThere may be a number of reasons for that, I'm afraid it may be that they know that they've been doing things they shouldn't do, and they're not keen for that to come to the surface,"" he said. âWhatever the reason behind it is, it is not a sensible way of behaviour because it just means that the risk goes on for longer."" The first minister added: âWhen the phone goes from the TTP (Test, Trace, Protect) system, please take it seriously. âIt's there to protect you and not cooperating with it puts you and other people that matter to you at risk.â Mr Drakeford explained that he understood self-isolating was a âreal challengeâ for some people due to the financial burden, but stressed that help was now available in Wales for people on low incomes. The Conservative group leader in the Senedd repeated his call for the first minister to publish a ""clear roadmap out of lockdown"" for Wales. Andrew RT Davies said: ""Supermarkets, for example, are going to be allowed to be open to non-essential retail, why not the high street? ""If he feels it's safe for supermarkets why persecute the high street and say the high street can't do that? ""Because he did give a clear indication to the high street some weeks ago that they too would be able to open. ""Now that doesn't seem fair to me and people need to have a sense of fairness that the regulations apply evenly across the whole of Wales."" Plaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said local lockdowns in Wales should be kept as an option but he'd prefer to see more support offered to people who need to self-isolate. He is the Senedd member for Anglesey where a Covid cluster has been identified in Holyhead. Mr ap Iorwerth said: ""Do I want to see another lockdown in my constituency? ""No I don't. There's a way to avoid that happening and it's by making sure that people do those little things such as washing hands, keeping distance, wearing a mask, if you happen to be indoors open a window, that kind of thing."" He added: ""The countries that have been most successful in clamping down on local outbreaks are those that have put really, really strong support mechanisms in place - everything from financial support packages that are better than the ones that we have here, even putting people up in hotels to self-isolate."" First Minister Mark Drakeford has not ruled out bringing in local restrictions on Anglesey and in Merthyr Tydfil following localised flare-ups of coronavirus, but said the plan at the moment was to conduct testing locally. Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government was talking with the respective local councils ""about actions that we can take together to address the circumstances we are facing"". He said ""there are more things we can do immediately"", adding that ""the plan embarked on at this point"" was to look at ""further testing"" and ""mobilising the resources"" Welsh Government can provide to assist the councils. Wales' first minister says he hopes to make a decision on whether parts of the tourism sector can reopen next weekend âby the end of next weekâ. At last Fridayâs review of lockdown rules Mark Drakeford said he hoped to lift the stay-local rule and allow people to stay in self-contained accommodation from 27 March. Speaking at todayâs press conference Mr Drakeford said: âProvided things continue as they are - stable and improving - then Iâm hopeful that I'll be able to confirm that by the end of next week.â The first minister warned that âthere are some parts of Wales where the position is not as good as we would like it to be"". He added: âParis has gone back into a lockdown again, so we've known all along how fast circumstances can change in coronavirus. ""That's why it's important to wait until the last moment you can in order to make these decisions, because that way you have the best and latest data.â Ministers plan to wait until ""the last moment"" to decide whether it is safe to reopen the tourism sector in Wales for Easter Vaccinated people in Wales should continue to follow the Covid-19 rules because the jab is ""not a silver bullet"", according to the first minister. Mark Drakeford said it was ""a risk"" that people who have been vaccinated ""feel that it is safer"" to meet people indoors. But he asked people not to do that. Speaking at the Welsh Government's press conference, Mr Drakeford said: ""You may have been vaccinated but still most people in Wales have not been. ""And even when you have been vaccinated, it will take three weeks before you have any impact from it. ""The vaccine is not a silver bullet - it does not mean that people can behave in ways that create additional risk. ""There is some worrying evidence that where we are seeing these additional flare-ups of the virus it is because household mixing is resuming."" A month-long delay to 250,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine due to come to Wales will have to be taken into account during reviews on lifting coronavirus restrictions, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. ""Of course our ability to lift restrictions is linked to the successful vaccination programme,"" he said. ""But our hope must be that we continue to see the position in Wales [as] stable and reducing, and that we will continue to have the headroom to lift restrictions in the way that we hope."" The first minister added: ""I think when you lose a quarter of a million doses of vaccine, we can't pretend that it has no effect at all. ""We are doing everything we can to mitigate the effect on appointments for people to get vaccinated. There are a number of different ways in which we are looking to do that."" First Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government will examine the impact that the Covid pandemic has had on people with disabilities. ""I met the disability forum yesterday to discuss the impact of the pandemic,"" he said. ""We will set up a taskforce to address the inequalities disabled people are facing, as highlighted in a report presented by the group at that meeting."" Mr Drakeford added that next week the government would publish the Race Equality Action Plan for consultation. He said it would set out ""our aim of creating a truly anti-racist Wales by 2030"". First Minister Mark Drakeford says as the public health situation improves, restrictions are being relaxed. ""On Monday we will begin the process of opening non-essential retail, starting by lifting the restrictions on what those shops which are currently open can sell,"" he said. âGarden centres will also open. âIf conditions remain positive, on March 27 we will lift 'stay local' and begin the process of re-opening our tourism sector, starting with self-contained accommodation and organised outdoor childrenâs activities for the Easter holidays. âWe are also looking at if outdoor areas of some historic places and gardens can reopen to the public.â Mr Drakeford said a final decision on relaxing tourism restrictions would be made next week. First Minister Mark Drakeford is urging Welsh rugby fans to stick to the Covid rules and not gather when Wales play France in their final Six Nations game tomorrow evening. âIf youâre watching Wales this weekend, please watch with members of your household only,â he said. âSurely the last thing we want is to mark a potential Grand Slam weekend with the legacy of a surge in Covid cases.â First Minister Mark Drakeford says rises in Covid caseson Angleseyand inMerthyr Tydfilare being closely monitored with concerns about âan apparent reluctanceâ of some people to engage with contact tracing teams. Mr Drakeford said the overall public health situation in Wales remained stable at around 44 cases per 100,000 people and a positivity rate of 3.9%. But he said: âWe are closely monitoring the situation in Anglesey and Merthyr Tydfil where clusters of cases, linked to household and social mixing, have driven up the rates. âWe are particularly concerned about an apparent reluctance in some places, to engage with contact tracing teams. âThat contact is vital. âIt means we can identify the source of infection and how far it has spread.â Extended households and workplaces are behind a rise in Covid cases in Merthyr Tydfil, a health chief has said First Minister Mark Drakeford has confirmed the delay in the supply of vaccines following a four-week hold-up in a shipment to the UK from India. ""We are confident that no appointments for a second dose will be cancelled - and all appointments for the rest of this month will be honoured,"" he said. He said there were ""flexible plans"" and they would be adjusted to make sure that people get vaccinations in line with the supplies. On concerns in Europe over the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, Mr Drakeford said the UK's independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has confirmed that the benefits of the vaccine in preventing Covid-19 far outweighed any risks. âThe MHRA has said people should get their vaccine when invited. I strongly echo this advice,"" the first minister said First Minister Mark Drakeford says almost 40% of people in their 50s and 62% of people in priority group six in Wales â those with an underlying health condition â have had their first dose of a Covid vaccine. Speaking at the Welsh Governmentâs coronavirus briefing, he said more than  1.2m people had âsaid yes to the vaccineâ. The first minister said âgreat progressâ was being made in providing second doses over the last month. âMore than 318,000 people have completed the full two doses of the vaccine,"" Mr Drakeford said. âWe have the highest second dose vaccination rate in the UK.â Authorities in Wales have given second doses to a much higher proportion of the population than the other UK nations Public Health Wales has urged people with a BMI of 40 or higher to get their jabs. People in this bracket of BMI are at a higher risk of Covid according to Public Health Wales. These people are in eligibility group six, a group that contains all 16 to 64 year-olds with underlying health conditions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The prime minister is to receive his first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine after reassuring the public it was ""safe"". Boris Johnson, 56, has urged people to get inoculated and said England'sroadmap out of lockdownwas ""on track"". He said there was ""no change"" to the plan despite a drop in vaccine supply. Several European countries are toresume using the AstraZeneca jabafter the European Medicines Agency (EMA) confirmed it was ""safe and effective"". The regulator reviewed the vaccine amid fears about blood clots, but said it was ""not associated"" with a higher risk and the benefits outweighed any risks. When will it be my turn to be vaccinated? Why is the EU warning the UK over vaccines? How will we know Covid vaccines are safe? Mr Johnson told a Downing Street conference on Thursday that the AstraZeneca jab was safe but ""the thing that isn't safe is catching Covid, which is why it is so important that we all get our jabs as soon as our turn comes"". The prime ministerwas himself treated in hospital for Covid-19in April 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic. ""The way to ensure this [lockdown easing] happens is to get that jab when your turn comes, so let's get the jab done,"" he said. Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said there were ""anecdotal reports"" of small numbers of people not turning up for vaccine appointments following the controversy over the AstraZeneca jab in Europe. But he said he expected many of those would decide to get the jab after ""a pause for thought"", adding that Covid was still a ""very dangerous disease"". ""People dying, people getting significant blood clotting problems, that's one of the risks of Covid, people having long-term physical and mental effects from Covid,"" he said. This video can not be played Boris Johnson said England's roadmap out of lockdown will not be disrupted by vaccine supply issues Mr Johnson said England's progress towards leaving restrictions on daily life was ""unchecked"" byvaccine supply issues, where fewer doses have arrived from India than initially expected. There were often delays with vaccine rollout programmes, he said, and he stressed the Indian government had not stopped any exports. Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said while the delay was ""disappointing"" he did not think it would have ""an enormous effect"" on the rollout. However, he warned the UK needed to keep variants of concern ""at bay"" until it could update vaccines and roll them out to the whole population. Prof Ferguson, who is a member of the government's SPI-M modelling group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there should be particular concern about cases being imported from France, where infection levels are increasing. He added that 5-10% of cases in France were the South African variant, which is of concern because it could be more resistant to current vaccines. But Prof Ferguson suggested that adding France to the ""red list"" of countries, from which arrivals are required to quarantine in a hotel, would not be ""practical"" given the amount of essential trade between the UK and France. Instead he said ""a more bespoke arrangement"" to mitigate the risks, perhaps including testing of arrivals, would be needed. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said rising infection rates in Europe should act as a ""wake-up call"" and the travel red list was kept under ""regular review"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? The European medical regulator had reviewed the AstraZeneca jab after 13 countries in Europe suspended its use over fears about blood clots in a very small number of patients. France, Germany and Italy, along with Cyprus, Latvia and Lithuania, are to resume use of the jab on Friday while Spain, Portugal and the Netherlands will do so next week. But Norway, Sweden and Denmark have said they will continue to pause the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine while they conduct their own independent reviews. Like his UK counterpart, French Prime Minister Jean Castex will receive the AstraZeneca vaccine in an effort to sway a doubtful French public. Sir Kent Woods, former chairman of the EMA, told BBC Breakfast the pause of the rollout of the AstraZeneca jab in some European countries was ""unfortunate"" because it could damage public confidence. Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine group, said the EMA findings would help ""rebuild confidence"" and it was ""reassuring"" that safety monitoring was taking place. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) also concluded that any link between the jab and clots was unproven. The MHRA and the EMA say people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised but anyone with a headache lasting more than four days after vaccination should seek medical advice, as a precaution. The same advice applies if someone develops unusual bruising. That is because the regulators have received a very small number of reports of an extremely rare form of blood clot occurring in the brain. It is this type of clot that triggered some European countries to pause rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. In the UK, five cases of cerebral sinus vein thrombosis (CSVT), among 11 million people who have received the vaccine, occurred in men aged between 19 and 59. One of these was fatal. The EMA has received an additional 13 reports of CSVT. The World Health Organization (WHO) has called on countries to continue using the vaccine, and is due to release the results of its own review into the vaccine's safety later on Friday. Meanwhile, the UK saw 7% more deaths than would be expected in 2020 based on the previous five years,according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics covering up to mid-December. It experienced one of the worst death rates in Europe in the first half of 2020 but has since been overtaken by Poland, Spain, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.

"PM Boris Johnson has received his first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, saying he ""did not feel a thing"" The UK's latest R number is estimated to be between 0.6 and 0.9, government figures suggest The figure shows the average number of people each person goes on to infect and when below 1 it means the Covid epidemic is shrinking The UK saw 7% more deaths than normally expected during 2020, according to the Office for National Statistics A further 101 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test are recorded in the UK More than two million people in the UK have now received a second dose of a vaccine European countries including Germany, France, Italy and Spain are resuming use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine The positive benefits of the vaccine outweigh risks, the World Health Organization says, with data not suggesting an increase in blood clots Edited by James Clarke and Sarah Collerton That's all from the team so goodbye for now. Your updates were written by Hamish Mackay, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Katie Wright and Sarah Collerton. We're about to bring our coronavirus updates to a close for the day. Before we go, here's a look at what's been going on in the UK and around the world: This video can not be played ""That was the last time mummy ever saw him"" Today marks a year since the first Covid-19 related death was reported in Northern Ireland. It came three weeks after the first case of coronavirus in Northern Ireland was confirmed. Since then, more than 2,000 people have died. Three families have spoken to BBC News NI about losing a loved one, coping with grief and saying goodbye in the midst of a pandemic. You can read that piece here. A GP surgery was ""overwhelmed"" when it received more than 126,000 calls in one day about Covid-19 vaccinations, health chiefs have revealed. One patient tried ringing the practice in Stockton-on-Tees 300 times in the space of a morning, they said. Other surgeries have also reported a ""deluge"" of similar calls. NHS Tees Valley Clinical Commissioning Group has warned the volume of calls prevents patients with urgent healthcare needs from getting through. Janet Walker, medical director at NHS Tees Valley CCG, said: ""The number of calls practices are getting from people inquiring about the vaccine is absolutely overwhelming, with one practice receiving over 126,000 calls in one day. ""We are asking people again - please, please do not phone your practice about vaccinations."" You can read the full story here. The current estimate for R - the average number of others each infected person passes the virus to - currently stands between 0.6-0.9 in the UK. However, the value of R varies across the UK. In Northern Ireland, for example, the R number is between 0.9-1.1. Below, you can see how the estimate for R has changed in recent months. During the past 12 months, many of the major events in the royal calendar have been cancelled or postponed because of the ongoing pandemic. Now, the Queen's official birthday celebration known as Trooping the Colour has been cancelled for a second year running. The annual event, which sees thousands of well-wishers fill central London to watch the Queen and members of the Royal Family travel to and from the spectacle, will not go ahead its traditional form, Buckingham Palace has said. Last summer, an event dubbed ""mini Trooping"" was staged at Windsor Castle and the palace says options for an ""alternative parade"" were being considered at the Queen's Berkshire home. The annual Garter service, which sees the Royal Family parading through the grounds of Windsor Castle in their ceremonial robes, will also not go ahead in June, the palace says. Multiple coronavirus vaccines are being rolled out in the UK and around the world. Each one is being seen as a way out of the global pandemic and the quickest way to get things back to normal. In many countries, having a vaccine is not mandatory yet the success of vaccination programmes depends upon how many people take up the offer of one. So what will happen if you choose not to get the vaccine? BBC News Health Reporter Laura Foster explains. This video can not be played What happens if I don't get the Covid vaccine? We've got more on the prime minister getting his vaccine. Boris Johnson received his first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine after reassuring the public that it is ""safe"". ""I literally did not feel a thing. It was very good, very quick,"" Johnson says after receiving the jab at St Thomas' Hospital in London. ""I cannot recommend it too highly, everybody when you do get your notification to go for a jab, please go and get it, it is the best thing for you, best thing for your family and for everyone else."" We've got the full story here. For weeks now, Covid-19 infection rates have been falling across the UK. But there are some towns that have bucked the trend, with infections remaining stubbornly high. This is particularly true of towns where the local economy relies on manufacturing, construction or food processing jobs - the kind of work that simply can't be done from home. BBC health correspondent Dominic Hughes has taken a closer look at the situation in some of those towns. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine. Johnson, 56, spent time in intensive care at St Thomas' Hospital in London last year after contracting Covid-19. He returned to the same hospital for his jab and left telling journalists he ""did not feel a thing"" and encouraged people to get their vaccination. As we reported earlier, the UK has recorded a further 101 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. While the daily figures can fluctuate due to delays in reporting, the seven-day average gives a clearer indication of the true situation. The seven-day average for deaths by this measure now stands at 98. The seven-day average for new cases, meanwhile, now stands at 5,343, after a further 4,802 were recorded yesterday. The Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall have thanked volunteers for supporting people during the pandemic, saying they have been a ""great help"". They took part in a video call to thank members of the Royal Voluntary Service (RVS) to mark one year since it launched the NHS Volunteer Responders Scheme. The Queen, patron of the RVS, said they had done ""wonderful work"", including delivering books to people. Nearly one million volunteers have been recruited to the scheme. You can read the full story here. A woman who has been making scrubs for NHS workers says it was ""absolutely phenomenal"" to be vaccinated by a nurse wearing one of her creations. Caroline Farquharson, 50, from Bracknell, went to the Waitrose HQ Sports and Leisure Centre for her first dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. She was treated by a nurse adorned in an unmistakable red and white pattern, made from an old duvet. ""What were the chances of that?"" she asks the BBC. ""It was brilliant."" Caroline started making colourful clothing for the NHS last March when a local group called Rainbow Scrubs was looking for volunteers. She has since made about 95 full sets, all in her spare time. You can read the full story here. Less than 12% of the EU's population is reportedto have received the vaccine,external, compared with nearly 40% in the UK. The rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine across the bloc has hit a number of hurdles. In January, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the use of the jab for all age groups, but a number of EU countries initiallyrefused to recommend its use for people over 65. France and Germany eventually revised their stance andapproved the vaccine for people aged 65-74at the beginning of March. However, they were among 13 European countries who paused the AstraZeneca rollout again in March, after reports a small number of people developed blood clots after receiving the jab. They restarted it after the EMA said there was no evidence the vaccine caused the clots. However, the French authorities say only people aged 55 and over should get the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. The headlines surrounding AstraZeneca may have led people to be reluctant about taking the jab. Some countries arereporting,externalthat as many as half of the doses delivered to them are currently unused. Read more about the other issues facing the EU. A woman made redundant three times during the pandemic has found her ""dream role"" after calling into a BBC radio phone-in. Annabelle Smith, 29, lost her job as a marketing manager in March, a property company role in May and finally as an assistant gym manager in December. After taking part in a careers discussion on BBC Radio 5 Live, she was offered a job by one of the panellists, Catherine Shuttleworth, who runs marketing agency Get Savvy, based in Leeds. Shuttleworth says she was impressed with Smith's ""energy and tenacity"" on the radio. After an interview and formal job offer, Smith has started her ""dream role"" at the agency. ""It was surreal,"" she says. ""Neither of us knew we were going to be on the show.It was almost fate."" Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi, 53, has been photographed receiving a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine today in London. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, 56,is due to receive his later. Chelsea Leigh Richardson said her mum Sarah was her rock For Chelsea Leigh Richardson and her four siblings, life has changed beyond belief since their mum Sarah died with Covid in October, aged 42. ""Mum was our everything, then all of a sudden she was gone,"" she says. Faced with the loss of their only parent, the 21-year-old went from big sister to the sole carer of her younger brothers and sisters - Kala-Jai, 19, Jayden, 17, Preston-James, 14, and seven-year-old Bobbee-Mae -overnight. Chelsea was determined the five of them would not be split up, so she became the glue to hold them together. She says: ""I pulled my big girl knickers up and said to myself: 'Come on Chels, you can do this. Be brave.'"" You can read Chelsea's story here. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The Swiss government says there will be no relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions for at least another four weeks. There had been tentative plans to allow bars and restaurants to open their outdoor terraces next week, and to allow small cultural events - but today the government has said the situation remains too risky. Cases have been rising again over the past two weeks, and at least 80% of all new cases are the more infectious B117 (UK) variant. The government says the limit on private gatherings will be raised from five to 10, but is warning families to follow strict distancing and hygiene rules, and to enjoy Easter outside if possible. It also advises people to take advantage of the new mass testing system, which is free to all, before meeting friends and relatives. The government believes the criteria for relaxation of restrictions must include not just falling cases, hospitalisations, and R value, but that all risk groups are vaccinated. Switzerland has so far vaccinated about 12% of its population of 8.6 million. A blind woman who was sent a shielding letter she could not read has won ""promising"" commitments from the government after a legal challenge. Sarah Leadbetter, from Narborough in Leicestershire, is classed as clinically extremely vulnerable. However, government correspondence advising her to shield was not sent in a format she could access - which she argued was discrimination. The government has agreed to review its communication with disabled people. Leadbetter, 45, who is registered blind, says she is ""very proud"" of the results of her legal challenge.

The so-called Kent variant is now the most commonly found strain  in the UK and it's more easily spread than the first variant, which arrived in Spring 2020. Scientists are looking at tweaking the coronavirus vaccines to make sure they continue to be highly effective. But where are these variants coming from? What are these new variants?

"Ms Sturgeon gave evidence to the inquiry in a marathon eight-hour session earlier this month A majority of MSPs on the Alex Salmond committee have said Nicola Sturgeon misled their inquiry, sources have told the BBC. It is understood MSPs on the committee voted by five to four that the SNP leader had given them an inaccurate account. The committee's final report is expected to be published next Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon has insisted she stands by all of the evidence she gave to the committee earlier this month. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross has called for the first minister to resign. However, Ms Sturgeon told Sky News: ""What has been clear is that opposition members of this committee made their minds up before I uttered a single word of evidence. Their public comments have made that clear. Laura Kuenssberg: 'More than Nicola Sturgeon's future' ""So this very partisan leak tonight before they've actually finalised the report is not that surprising. ""Let's wait and see the final report, but more importantly the question of whether or not I breached the ministerial code is being considered independently by James Hamilton and I hope and expect he will publish that report soon."" Mr Hamilton, a senior Irish lawyer, has been specifically examining whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code, which says that any minister who knowingly misleads parliament would be ""expected to offer their resignation"". His inquiry is separate from the committee and is also expected to publish its report in the coming days. What is the Salmond and Sturgeon row all about? Could Alex Salmond bring down Nicola Sturgeon? Watch - Panorama: Salmond V Sturgeon The cross-party committee includes four SNP MSPs, two Conservatives, one Labour, one Liberal Democrat and independent Andy Wightman. A spokesman for the Scottish Parliament said the committee was still finalising its report, and it would not make any comment until it was published. Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond - her predecessor as first minister and SNP leader - have both taken part  in lengthy evidence sessions in front of the committee in recent weeks. Mr Salmond claimed to have been the victim of a ""malicious scheme"" drawn up by figures within the SNP who are close to Ms Sturgeon. Mr Salmond was Ms Sturgeon's political mentor, but the pair have been embroiled in an increasingly bitter war of words But Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that any suggestion there had been conspiracy were ""absurd"", and insisted she had not been out to ""get"" Mr Salmond. She told the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that Mr Salmond and his ""cronies"" In the ""old boys' club"" had been spinning ""conspiracy theories"" which opposition politicians had bought into. It came after Conservative MP David Davis - a longstanding friend of Mr Salmond - used parliamentary privilege in the House of Commons to read out messages that he suggested showed a ""concerted effort by senior members of the SNP to encourage complaints"" against the former first minister. Nicola Sturgeon did not intervene in the investigation into harassment complaints against Alex Salmond. The dispute is about whether or not she was ever prepared to. Alex Salmond claims she was and is backed up in that by his lawyer, Duncan Hamilton who went with him to see Nicola Sturgeon on 2 April 2018. Nicola Sturgeon claims she made clear an intervention would not be possible, although she has also acknowledged that in trying to let Mr Salmond down gently she may not have been blunt enough. Her testimony is understood to be supported by written evidence from one of her colleagues, shared with the committee in private. The opposition majority appears to have found Team Salmond's evidence more persuasive. SNP members refuse to accept Team Sturgeon has given a misleading account.

"Ms Sturgeon gave evidence to the inquiry in a marathon eight-hour session earlier this month A majority of MSPs on the Alex Salmond committee have said Nicola Sturgeon misled their inquiry, sources have told the BBC. It is understood MSPs on the committee voted by five to four that the SNP leader had given them an inaccurate account. The committee's final report is expected to be published next Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon has insisted she stands by all of the evidence she gave to the committee earlier this month. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross has called for the first minister to resign. However, Ms Sturgeon told Sky News: ""What has been clear is that opposition members of this committee made their minds up before I uttered a single word of evidence. Their public comments have made that clear. Laura Kuenssberg: 'More than Nicola Sturgeon's future' ""So this very partisan leak tonight before they've actually finalised the report is not that surprising. ""Let's wait and see the final report, but more importantly the question of whether or not I breached the ministerial code is being considered independently by James Hamilton and I hope and expect he will publish that report soon."" Mr Hamilton, a senior Irish lawyer, has been specifically examining whether Ms Sturgeon breached the ministerial code, which says that any minister who knowingly misleads parliament would be ""expected to offer their resignation"". His inquiry is separate from the committee and is also expected to publish its report in the coming days. What is the Salmond and Sturgeon row all about? Could Alex Salmond bring down Nicola Sturgeon? Watch - Panorama: Salmond V Sturgeon The cross-party committee includes four SNP MSPs, two Conservatives, one Labour, one Liberal Democrat and independent Andy Wightman. A spokesman for the Scottish Parliament said the committee was still finalising its report, and it would not make any comment until it was published. Ms Sturgeon and Mr Salmond - her predecessor as first minister and SNP leader - have both taken part  in lengthy evidence sessions in front of the committee in recent weeks. Mr Salmond claimed to have been the victim of a ""malicious scheme"" drawn up by figures within the SNP who are close to Ms Sturgeon. Mr Salmond was Ms Sturgeon's political mentor, but the pair have been embroiled in an increasingly bitter war of words But Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that any suggestion there had been conspiracy were ""absurd"", and insisted she had not been out to ""get"" Mr Salmond. She told the Scottish Parliament on Thursday that Mr Salmond and his ""cronies"" In the ""old boys' club"" had been spinning ""conspiracy theories"" which opposition politicians had bought into. It came after Conservative MP David Davis - a longstanding friend of Mr Salmond - used parliamentary privilege in the House of Commons to read out messages that he suggested showed a ""concerted effort by senior members of the SNP to encourage complaints"" against the former first minister. Nicola Sturgeon did not intervene in the investigation into harassment complaints against Alex Salmond. The dispute is about whether or not she was ever prepared to. Alex Salmond claims she was and is backed up in that by his lawyer, Duncan Hamilton who went with him to see Nicola Sturgeon on 2 April 2018. Nicola Sturgeon claims she made clear an intervention would not be possible, although she has also acknowledged that in trying to let Mr Salmond down gently she may not have been blunt enough. Her testimony is understood to be supported by written evidence from one of her colleagues, shared with the committee in private. The opposition majority appears to have found Team Salmond's evidence more persuasive. SNP members refuse to accept Team Sturgeon has given a misleading account. With the committee divided along party lines over the first minister's conduct, the conclusions of James Hamilton - the Irish lawyer who's independently examining the evidence - gain ever greater importance. Some MSPs on the committee - including the SNP MSP who chairs it - have accused the government of attempting to frustrate its work Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""All the evidence points to the fact that Nicola Sturgeon misled parliament, misled the people of Scotland and has to resign.

"Government borrowing levels continued to set new records last month, reflecting the cost of supporting the UK's economy during the pandemic. The government borrowed Â£19.1bn in February, the highest figure for that month since records began in 1993. Measures such as furlough payments have hit government finances hard. However, February's borrowing figure - the difference between spending and tax income - was not as high as some economists had forecast. Borrowing for the financial year to date - between April and February - has now reached Â£278.8bn,the Office for National Statistics said,external, a record for that period. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said: ""Coronavirus has caused one of the largest economic shocks this country has ever faced, which is why we responded with our Â£352bn package of support to protect lives and livelihoods. ""This was the fiscally responsible thing to do and the best way to support the public finances in the medium term."" Christine Jardine, Treasury spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said that while the latest figures showed scale of the challenge posed by the pandemic, ""they can not be used as an excuse by the government to end support prematurely, and leave behind people and businesses struggling across the UK"". ""Thousands of small businesses are due to stay closed for months to come, and millions of people are still worried about their jobs. Yet the chancellor failed to provide them with long-term certainty and direct support in the Budget."" The latest ONS figures showed the government spent Â£3.9bn last month on job support measures alone. They also revealed a fall in tax income, notably from lower VAT, business rates and fuel duty, although they also showed money coming in from self-employed tax payments rose by Â£900m from last year. Where does the government borrow billions from? Total public sector debt has risen to Â£2.13 trillion, according to the ONS. The figure almost exceeds the size of the UK's economy, with debt having reached 97.5% of annual economic output. Debt levels as high as this have not been seen since the early 1960s. Ultimately, if it's consistently spending much more than it has in the past, the state has to raise more money in taxes. But the key word there is ""ultimately"". There is no urgency to repaying the government's debt. More urgent are the debts of small businesses and poorer households. Ordinary households rightly fear getting into too much debt because if interest rates rise, lenders can close in and deploy lawyers and bailiffs with all the attendant unpleasantness. But it is profoundly wrong and misleading to infer that it's like that for governments who issue their own sovereign currency. Unlike households, governments controlling their own currency can borrow without limit money that they have freshly created. They therefore can't go bankrupt. Because almost all of the money borrowed by the government in this financial year (by issuing gilts) will be owed to another public sector body, the Bank of England, it's nothing like a household borrowing from a bank. And in fact, as the government tacitly acknowledged in its recent Budget, it makes sense in the midst of an economic contraction for the government to spend more, not less - not least because other parts of the economy (households and businesses) aren't spending anything like what they normally would. Without the additional government spending the economic contraction would, without a shadow of a doubt, be worse. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said that despite the high level of borrowing, the government's increased spending was the only sensible course at this time. ""Today's figures are pretty terrible but it is important to take in to account the economy as well. The chancellor is doing the right thing in continuing to support the economy,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""His action in the Budgetto extend many of the existing schemes means the rug will not pulled out from under the feet of households and businesses. ""If we can limit the damage to the economy now, when the crisis ends it means the country will be stronger amore able to cope with that debt."" Separately, the government said it would receive Â£1.1bn from selling part of its stake in NatWest Group. The sale will cut the size of the government's stake in the bank - which was previously called Royal Bank of Scotland - from almost 62% to 59.8%. The government bought shares in the bank to help keep it afloat during the 2008 financial crisis. The value of those shares has since fallen, meaning the government has made an overall loss of Â£1.84bn excluding dividend payments. The Treasury said ""its ambition is to return the bank to private ownership once the original goal of preserving financial stability has been achieved"". How does the government borrow money?

"This video can not be played Blinken: We will discuss ""our deep concerns with actions by China"" US and Chinese officials have exchanged sharp rebukes in the first high-level talks between the Biden administration and China, taking place in Alaska. Chinese officials accused the US of inciting countries ""to attack China"", while the US said China had ""arrived intent on grandstanding"". Relations between the two superpowers are at their most strained for years. The US pledged to raise contentious issues such as Beijing's treatment of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang. Who are the Uighurs? The ill-tempered talks in Anchorage involved Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on the US side, facing off with China's most senior foreign policy official, Yang Jiechi, and foreign minister Wang Yi. However, a US official said the subsequent talks behind closed doors had been ""substantive, serious and direct"" and ran over the planned two hours. Are the US and China in a new 'Cold War'? Details released of Biden's first call with Xi In a blunt opening statement before the talks in private, Mr Blinken said the US would ""discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion of our allies"". ""Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability,"" he said. This video can not be played Yang Jiechi: US not qualified to ""speak from a position of strength"" when criticising China In response, Mr Yang accused Washington of using its military might and financial supremacy to suppress other countries. ""It abuses so-called notions of national security to obstruct normal trade exchanges, and incite some countries to attack China,"" he added. Mr Yang said human rights in the US were at a low point, with black Americans being ""slaughtered"". Mr Sullivan hit back, saying Washington did not seek a conflict with China, but added: ""We will always stand up for our principles for our people, and for our friends."" Can the US and China work together? The exchange, which took place in front of the world's media, went on for more than an hour. It came at the start of three sessions, which are due to end on Friday morning. It is the first high-level meeting between the US and China since last June - during the administration of the previous US President, Donald Trump. It was an unusually undiplomatic sparring match, especially for a meeting called to take stock of the US-China relationship under a new American administration. Beforehand the Biden team had been blunt in public criticism of Beijing. So the Chinese knew what to expect and seemed to have come prepared to hit back. They were particularly angry that Washington had imposed sanctions on them the day before the talks, over a crackdown on pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong. There may have been a certain amount of posturing involved, as a US official said the private conversation that followed was substantive and serious. The Biden administration has said it will be tough on issues of concern, but willing to work with Beijing on matters of interest. However, it has described the relationship as a geopolitical competition between democracy and autocracy. And the Chinese have refused to compromise on what they say are matters of national sovereignty and security. Whether or not they can find pragmatic points of co-operation will be the measure of how the relationship moves forward. Afterwards, the US delegation accused China of violating the agreed protocol of two minutes of opening remarks by each side. ""The Chinese delegation... seems to have arrived intent on grandstanding, focused on public theatrics and dramatics over substance,"" a senior administration official said. The official said the US would continue with the talks as planned, adding that ""exaggerated diplomatic presentations often are aimed at a domestic audience"". In later remarks via state media, Chinese officials said it had been the US, not China, that had violated protocol by exceeding the agreed time in opening remarks. They accused the US of making a ""groundless attack on China's domestic and foreign policies"". On a more positive note, it quoted Mr Yang as saying that ""serious difficulties in China-US relations in the past should not continue"". The BBC's Barbara Plett Usher says the talks are the first chance for the Biden administration to show how it intends to deal with what Mr Blinken has called ""the biggest geopolitical test of the 21st Century"". China is looking for a reset after relations hit rock bottom under the Trump administration, our correspondent adds. Mr Wang has said that Beijing is ready to reopen ""constructive dialogue."" Quite a lot. Trade for instance. The US accuses China of unfair practices, such as subsidising industries, stealing intellectual property, keeping its currency low and putting up barriers to trade. For its part, China wants the big trade tariffs introduced by the Trump administration on Chinese goods eliminated. It also accuses the US of ""suppressing"" successful Chinese tech companies, such as Huawei. Human rights and democracy. The US accuses China of genocide against the Uighur population in the province of Xinjiang, and trampling on democratic rights in Hong Kong with a recently introduced security law. What the US really wants from the China talks But China calls on the US to stop interfering in what Beijing considers its internal affairs and accuses the US of ""smearing"" the ruling Communist Party. China is also pushing back against what it sees as US naval encroachment in the South China Sea, which Beijing considers Chinese territory. Why is the South China Sea contentious?
