"This video can not be played Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib: ""I'm dealing with the biggest bully I've ever had to deal with"" The ongoing row between US President Donald Trump and four non-white Democratic congresswomen has continued to escalate following a controversial campaign rally. During a speech in North Carolina, Mr Trump took aim at Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Ayanna Pressley as well as Ilhan Omar, a Somali-born lawmaker who he focused much of his criticism on. His rhetoric prompted a chant of ""send her back"" from his supporters, which Mr Trump on Thursday claimed he disagreed with. The rally fallout follows debate over a series of vitriolic tweets and statements by the president that have been widely condemned as racist. All the women are US citizens. So what else do we know of the lawmakers known as ""the Squad""? All four were elected to the House of Representatives in last November's mid-term elections, each making history as a result. Known to be progressive, they have clashed in recent weeks with the more pragmatic Speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi - divisions with racial overtones that Mr Trump has tried to exploit with his tweets. Ms Omar speaks at a news conference in Washington DC in June First-term congresswoman Ilhan Omar won a Minnesota seat in the House of Representatives last November, becoming the first Somali-American legislator in the US. Her family first came to the US as refugees from Somalia, settling in Minneapolis in 1997 after fleeing the country's civil war. She became a citizen in 2000. The 37-year-old mother of three is one of the first two Muslim women ever elected to the US Congress. Before her election to Congress, she served in Minnesota's state legislature, making her the then highest elected Somali-American public official in the US. Ms Omar's precedent-setting tenure has earned both adoration and criticism. Shortly after her election, she drew praise for fighting to change a 181-year ban on headwear in the House, allowing her to wear a hijab for her oath of office. But Ms Omar has also faced repeated accusations of anti-Semitism. She was forced to apologise for a series of tweets in February that suggested that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (Aipac) was buying influence for pro-Israel policies. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle said the tweets stoked anti-Semitic tropes about Jews and money. Ms Omar later released a statement ""unequivocally"" apologising for her tweets. ""Anti-Semitism is real and I am grateful for Jewish allies and colleagues who are educating me on the painful history of anti-Semitic tropes,"" Ms Omar wrote. This video can not be played Ilhan Omar on her journey to becoming the first Somali-American lawmaker in the US She came under fire from conservatives again in April for comments on 9/11 that Democrats said were taken out of context. A clip of Ms Omar apparently describing 9/11 as ""some people did something"" began circulating online, and the president tweeted a video showing footage of the terrorist attacks spliced with Ms Omar's speech. The quote was from a speech Ms Omar gave to a civil rights group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), in March. The comments in Mr Trump's video were taken from a point she made about the treatment of US Muslims in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks: ""For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. Cair was founded after 9/11 because they recognised that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties."" The 9/11 row embroiling a US congresswoman In recent weeks, Mr Trump has focused his attacks on Ms Omar saying she ""hates Israel"" and ""hates Jews"", and suggesting she supports the jihadist group al-Qaeda. US media reported that Mr Trump's accusations probably reference a 2013 interview where Ms Omar was discussing a college terrorism class. She did not praise al-Quaeda in the interview. Ms Omar remarked that a professor said the names of terrorist groups with a different kind of ""intensity"" compared with the tone he used when he said ""America"" or ""England"". Ms Ocasio-Cortez and Ms Tlaib at a House Oversight and Reform Committee hearing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, often referred to as AOC, made waves in the Democratic Party last June when she defeated political veteran and establishment favourite Joe Crowley in their party's primary in a new York district. The 29-year-old went on to beat Republican candidate Anthony Pappas in the November mid-terms, becoming the youngest ever US congresswoman. The freshman lawmaker was born in the Bronx, New York to parents of Puerto Rican descent. She has a degree in economics and international relations from Boston University, and worked as a community organiser, educator and bartender before deciding to run for office. Trump to congresswomen of colour: Leave the US Ocasio-Cortez: 'No question' Trump racist Since her election, the self-described democratic socialist has become a lightning rod for the political right. Ms Ocasio-Cortez has not shied away from the spotlight, frequently taking to social media to hit back at Republicans, members of the media and other critics on a range of issues including immigration, poverty and race. This video can not be played Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on detained migrants: 'The women were told to drink out of a toilet bowl' She has earned a reputation for her impassioned testimonies at congressional hearings, which are often re-circulated among her nearly five million Twitter followers. She has been particularly vocal in her push for environmental policy, serving as one of the sponsors of the Green New Deal resolution, which calls upon the US to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions along with other goals. Ms Ocasio-Cortez has also been outspoken in her criticism of the president, saying there is ""no question"" that Mr Trump is racist. And she recently accused Ms Pelosi of ""singling out"" new congresswomen of colour following a number of clashes over their policy stances. Social media savvy, Ms Ocasio-Cortez inadvertently coined the term ""the squad"" after suggesting they hashtag a photoshoot image of the four of them #squadgoals. Ms Tlaib and Ms Omar talk before Mr Trump's second State of the Union address Much like the other congresswomen, Rashida Tlaib's election this November made history. The Michigan Democrat is the first Palestinian-American woman to serve in Congress. Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Ms Tlaib is the daughter of Palestinian immigrant parents. Her grandmother still lives in the West Bank. Palestinian dress worn in new US Congress How women are changing the face of Congress She was sworn into office wearing a traditional Palestinian garment stitched by her mother. Ms Tlaib also joined Ms Omar as one of the first two Muslim women ever elected to serve in Congress. The eldest of 14 siblings, Ms Tlaib became the first member of her family to graduate from high school, and then from college and law school. Since assuming office, Ms Tlaib has been an outspoken critic of the president. She courted controversy when she used explicit language when calling for the president's impeachment.

Ms Tlaib was unapologetic about the furore incited by her remark, tweeting that she would ""always speak truth to power"". After his twitter storm, she said Mr Trump was ""biggest bully I've ever had to deal with in my lifetime"", and said his attacks were a ""distraction"" from her job of representing people in her congressional district. Ms Pressley at a House Financial Services Committee hearing Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley, 45, is the first African-American woman to be elected to the US Congress from Massachusetts. Born in Cincinnati and raised in Ohio, Ms Pressley is the only child of a single mother. After attending Boston University, she served as a senior aide to Congressman Joseph P Kennedy II, and worked for Senator John Kerry for 13 years. Times when Americans were told to 'go back' Trump steps up attack on 'US-hating' congresswomen Her own political career began in 2009 when she waged a successful bid for a seat on Boston City Council, becoming the first woman of colour elected to the council in its 100-year history. Similar to Ms Ocasio-Cortez, Ms Pressley's election to the US Congress involved a major political upset: she unseated 10-term Democratic congressman Michael Capuano in their party's primary. Since assuming office in January, Ms Pressley has been a vocal advocate of abortion rights, pushing to repeal an amendment that prevents Medicaid from covering abortions for low-income Americans. A survivor of sexual violence, Ms Pressley has also spoken up for better protections for assault victims, writing on her website that ""the people closest to the pain should be closest to the power"". She said she could not call Mr Trump the president, only the ""occupant"" of the White House. ""He does not embody the principles, the responsibility, the grace, the integrity of a true president,"" she told CBS.

"Boris Johnson (l) and Jeremy Hunt (r) made the comments during a head-to-head debate run by The Sun newspaper Both candidates to be the UK's next PM have condemned tweets by Donald Trump which called on four Democratic congresswomen of colour to ""go back"". During a head-to-head debate run by The Sun, Jeremy Hunt called the remarks ""totally offensive"", while Boris Johnson said they were ""unacceptable"". But neither would go as far as branding the US president's comments racist. Mr Trump said the women ""originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe"". He faced a backlash for the series of tweets on Sunday aimed at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley - who were all born in the US - and Ilhan Omar - who went to the US as a child refugee when she was 12. His remarks were widely condemned as racist, and as having gone beyond previous statements and actions by the president that drew allegations of racism. But Mr Trump doubled down on his comments on Monday, accusing the congresswomen of ""hating our country"". Earlier, he also launched another Twitter tirade, calling on the women themselves to apologise. All the women called the president racist and were backed by members of the Democratic Party. Times when people were told to 'go back' home Trump steps up attack on 'US-hating' congresswomen Theresa May condemns Trump's 'go back' remark Asked about the tweets during the debate, Mr Hunt - who is married to a Chinese woman - said he would be ""utterly appalled"" if someone said the same thing to their three children, who were born in the UK. ""It is totally un-British to do that, so I hope that would never happen,"" he added. Mr Johnson said: ""If you are the leader of a great, multi-racial, multi-cultural society, you simply cannot use that kind of language about sending people back to where they came from. ""That went out decades and decades ago and thank heavens for that."" He alsoechoed comments made by outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May, who earlier called the tweets ""completely unacceptable"". Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (left), Rashida Tlaib (centre) and Ayanna Pressley (right) accused the president of racism But asked by The Sun's political editor, Tom Newton-Dunn, if they thought the comments were racist, neither candidate would say. Mr Hunt said: ""Look, I'm foreign secretary, this is a president of a country which happens to be our closest ally, and so it is not going to help the situation to use that kind of language about the president of the United States. ""I can understand how many people in this country would want politicians like me to use those words and would feel that sentiment, but...I hope I have made absolutely clear how totally offensive it is to me that people are still saying that kind of thing."" Mr Johnson said: ""I simply can't understand how a leader of that country can come to say it."" Pressed again, he added: ""You can take from what I said what I think about President Trump's words."" This video can not be played President Trump defends racially charged tweets The candidates were also questioned about the possibility of a future trade deal with the US. Mr Hunt said whenever he had met with the US president and his administration, they had ""stressed how enthusiastic"" they were to do a deal. But he admitted that Mr Trump would be a ""very tough and crude"" negotiator. Mr Johnson agreed, calling the administration ""ruthless"" and saying the country would put ""tough conditions"" on any agreement with the UK. But he added that this did not mean it was ""impossible to do a good deal"".

"A legal action taken by MoneySavingExpert founder Martin Lewis is behind the tool Scammers are being targeted by a new tool for UK Facebook users that allows the reporting of fake adverts. The feature came about after Martin Lewis, founder of the MoneySavingExpert website, sued over his name and photo being used on fake Facebook adverts. In return for dropping the legal action, Facebook agreed to donate Â£3m to set up an anti-scam programme. That money has been handed over to Citizens Advice to build a new service to help victims of online fraudsters. The charity has set up a telephone helpline for any type of online scam - not just ones involving fake ads. Face-to-face consultations will even be offered to serious cases - where someone falls into debt or mortgage arrears, for example. Citizens Advice says it expects to help 20,000 people in the first year of the new service, and warned anyone can be scammed. There is no typical profile of victims, the charity said, and scams are becoming more and more sophisticated. Some common red flags include: something which seems too good to be true - or much cheaper than it should be being asked to pay quickly, or in an unusual way - maybe through money transfer or through vouchers someone contacting you out of the blue being asked for personal information such as a password or Pin an advert using celebrity images or endorsements that seem fake or unlikely Inside Facebook, a specially-trained team has been set up to investigate adverts reported through the new tool. From Tuesday, Facebook users in the UK should be able to click the three dots in the top corner of every advert to see more options. On top of the usual ones, there will now be the option to ""send a detailed scam report"" after choosing to ""report ad"" and selecting ""misleading or scam ad"" as the reason. ""Scam ads are an industry-wide problem caused by criminals and have no place on Facebook,"" said the company's vice-president for Northern Europe, Steve Hatch. A few years after her husband of 30 years died, Amanda - not her real name - joined an online dating site at the urging of a friend. After a while, she started exchanging emails with someone who seemed interesting. A few weeks later, ""he asked if I could send him some money"", she said. ""He had not been paid and needed to travel back home from Ireland. I never thought much of it and transferred him the money."" The pair continued to build up ""a nice friendship over the months"" - and he asked for some money on a few other occasions. But something did not feel right - and Amanda decided not to message him any more. A few weeks later she got a new message from the dating site â with the same picture, but a different name and location. ""That's when I realised that the person I had been speaking to was probably not the one on the picture,"" Amanda said. Over the course of a few months, she had transferred around Â£2,500 to whoever was really on the other end of those emails. ""I think that maybe some of the men join the site knowing that there will be women like me who genuinely want a friendship and use that and take advantage of our loss,"" she said. Two women lose Â£105k in 'romance scams' Benefit scam pushed on social media Fake BBC page promotes Bitcoin scheme The tool - and the dedicated team to examine the reports - are unique to the UK as a result of the lawsuit taken by Mr Lewis. The journalist and TV presenter took the legal action against Facebook after a series of ads ran with his face and name, claiming he backed questionable investment schemes. His website recommends what it believes are the best-value financial products for different purposes. Mr Lewis claimed the fake adverts on Facebook damaged his reputation. His defamation case, he said, was ""bizarrely the only law I could find to try to make big tech firms understand the damage their negligent behaviour has caused"". The faked ads implied Mr Lewis backed some of the schemes being advertised ""Millions of people know a scam when they see it, and millions of others don't. So now, I'd ask all who recognise them to use the new Facebook reporting tool, to help protect those who don't,"" he said.

" By Rachael Buchanan It’s the rarest form of a rare condition - conjoined twins, fused at the head. The BBC has been granted exclusive access to a ground-breaking series of operations in a British hospital to separate two sisters. There is a crowd in the operating theatre. But the team of nearly 20 works as one. Moving smoothly, every motion calculated. No signs of stress or tension, just hands methodically performing tasks. But this is no routine operation. The shrouded shape of two small girls is picked out by the bright theatre lights. Safa and Marwa are joined at the head. Their brains are exposed as the surgeons work to separate a labyrinth of shared blood vessels. But then the calm and peace of the theatre disappears, as anaesthetists raise the alarm. The blood from Safa’s brain isn’t draining properly and she is shunting blood to her sister. This puts strain on Marwa’s heart and she becomes dangerously unstable.  The anaesthetists call out commands, report vital signs and busy themselves trying to stabilise the girls. ""I think we need to shock,"" says one of them. Pads are attached to Marwa’s chest in preparation. The lead surgeon raises both hands so they can be clearly seen, and steps back. Then everyone waits. If they lose her, they may also lose Safa.     Zainab Bibi has already given birth to seven children - all of them at home. So when she becomes pregnant with twins, the plan is to do the same thing. But after an ultrasound scan picks up a complication, she is advised to have them delivered in hospital. It’s a difficult time for the family. Two months before the birth, Zainab’s husband died of a heart attack. She is also told by the maternity team that the twins might be joined together. But there has been no mention of where on their bodies the join might be. No-one, it seems, realises the full extent of the complications to come.   On 7 January 2017, the twins are delivered by Caesarean section at Hayatabad hospital in Peshawar, some 31 miles (50km) from her home in northern Pakistan. The family are told that the girls are healthy. But Zainab doesn’t meet the newborns immediately, because she needs to recover from the surgery. It is the twins' grandfather Mohammad Sadat Hussain who finds out the truth first - the girls are what is called craniopagus twins, which means they are joined at the head. It is the rarest form of what is already a rare condition. Their grandfather arrives on the maternity ward bearing the traditional gift of sweets for the nurses. Still in mourning for the loss of his son, meeting his granddaughters is a bittersweet moment: “I was happy to see them, but I was thinking what am I going to do with them because of their joined heads?” It is five days before Zainab is well enough to be introduced to her daughters, and she is given a photo of the twins to prepare her. She says she instantly fell in love. “They were very beautiful and they had nice hair with white skin. I didn’t even think about the fact they were joined. They are God-given.” They are named Safa and Marwa, after the twin hills in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, that play a central role in the Islamic ritual pilgrimage of Hajj.   After a month, the twins are discharged from hospital and the family agree that if it can be done, they should be separated. A military hospital offers to perform the surgery but warns that one of the twins is likely to die. It is a risk their mother is unwilling to take. Other options are explored, and when the twins are three months old, the family are put in touch with Owase Jeelani, a paediatric neurosurgeon at one of the world's leading children's hospitals, Great Ormond Street in London (GOSH). By coincidence, he was born in the nearby region of Kashmir and immediately establishes a rapport with them. After seeing scans of the girls, the surgeon is convinced they can be safely separated, but he wants to do it before they reach 12 months old, to get the best outcome. The clock is ticking. It is August 2018. The visas for the UK have already come through, but funding for the operations has not. This is not something the NHS in the UK would fund and Jeelani has raised only a small amount of the money needed to pay for the hospital care. The girls are now 19 months old, well beyond the age that the GOSH team would like to operate. Any further delay might mean the separation becomes more dangerous, recovery more limited. Jeelani urges the family to come to England immediately.  He remembers the moment they arrived: “They turned up in early August and at this point we only had a small amount of the money we needed. The kids were here and I must say I was really stressed. At this stage it felt like a personal responsibility.” The twins’ uncle Mohammad Idrees and their grandfather are put up in a flat near the hospital. But Zainab will not be parted from her daughters, and prefers to sleep in their room. Despite being joined, the twins have distinct personalities, according to their mother. Safa, is “smart, happy and talks a lot”. Marwa, on the other hand, is shy. “She sometimes talked to herself but when we spoke to her she didn’t always reply,” says Zainab. Shortly after their arrival, while Jeelani is having lunch with a lawyer friend, a moment of pure serendipity changes everything. After he tells her the story of the twins, the lawyer picks up her mobile phone and makes a call. The surgeon is asked to tell the person on the line about the girls. He is speaking to a wealthy Pakistani businessman, Murtaza Lakhani. Within a few minutes, an offer has been made to meet the costs of their treatment. “The twins are from Pakistan which is where I am from originally,” says Lakhani. “However, the true reason for me helping them was because it was an operation that was going to save the lives of two children. For me it was an easy decision, it’s how you build the future.”    Conjoined twins develop from one fertilised egg and so are always identical. There are two theories about why they are fused together - either the split into two embryos happens later than usual, and the twins only partially divide, or, following the split, parts of the embryos remain in contact and those body parts merge as they grow. When it occurs, twins are more commonly connected at the chest, abdomen or pelvis. Safa and Marwa’s particular commingled physiology presents a unique set of challenges for the GOSH team. The girls are joined at the top of their heads - crown to crown - facing opposite directions. They have never seen each other’s faces. Their skull is like a stove pipe, a long straight tube. Scans show that the girls have two distinct brains but these are misshapen. The right hemisphere of each brain is sticking up 90 degrees, projecting into the other twin's brain cavity. This distorted shape will need correcting if the girls are to have near normal-shaped heads. The surgical team's biggest concern is how to separate the complex shared network of veins and arteries. Each twin supplies the other with blood. Severing these connections carries a risk of starving the brain of nourishment and causing a stroke. There are no official figures for the prevalence of craniopagus conjoined twins, but one estimate puts it at one in every 2.5 million births. Most do not survive beyond 24 hours. Each case is unique, and separations of craniopagus twins have only been reported about 60 times since the first attempt in 1952. Jeelani believes there could be up to six sets of craniopagus twins born worldwide each year who might be successfully separated. Great Ormond Street Hospital is a world leader in this kind of surgery. Safa and Marwa will be their third set of craniopagus twins, more than any other centre. The team knows from experience that the best outcomes happen when the separation is staged over several operations, to allow for recovery in between. As well as surgeons and nurses, the 100-strong team at GOSH involved with the care and separation of the twins includes bio-engineers, 3D modellers and a virtual reality designer.  Owase Jeelani and Prof David Dunaway Owase Jeelani and Prof David Dunaway Jeelani will take the lead in separating the girls' brains and blood vessels, but it will be plastic surgeon Prof David Dunaway who will be responsible for rebuilding the girls' heads, and giving each of them a top to their skulls.  It's 08:00 on Monday 15 October 2018, and a team of nearly 20 gathers in theatre 10 at GOSH. Each member of staff identifies themselves and what their role will be. ""We have one case for the list today. Safa and Marwa. Two kids, one case,"" says Jeelani. The twins’ slow journey to independence is about to begin. The aim of this surgery - the first of three major operations - is to separate the twins' shared arteries. Jeelani works his way through the plan one last time but everyone knows what they have to do. The team has been preparing for this day for months. ""We have been through everything in fine detail - rehearsed it repeatedly. This is the moment of truth and everything has to be perfect,"" says Dunaway. Meanwhile on Bumblebee ward, the twins are being readied for theatre. Wearing identical surgical gowns, Safa and Marwa cry and twist restlessly.  Separating conjoined twins carries huge risks. One or both could die during surgery or be left with brain damage. The family understand the dangers, and have complete trust in the team. “It is clearly very difficult to go through life when you are joined together like that, so it does make a persuasive case in favour of attempting the separation and the family are very clear on that,” says Jeelani. Dunaway says the team has carefully assessed the ethical issues. “Clearly I think life being separate is better than being joined together. If we felt there wasn't a very high chance that we could do it safely, we would think hard about whether we should do it at all. The whole team feels there's an excellent likelihood of a successful separation here.” As the twins’ trolley arrives at the theatre doors Zainab kisses her daughters. She knows the coming months will be hard on them and the emotion of parting is overwhelming. In tears, she is comforted by one of the many nurses she has come to look on as family. ""I am hopeful that everything will be okay and I have full trust in the doctors. I always look to God - he will make everything great,"" she says. In theatre, the first task is to remove three large segments of skull. Jeelani is wearing surgical loupes, glasses fitted with magnifying scopes. He follows the marks he traced on the girls' shared skull, now shaved, and cuts through skin and bone. Once the brains are exposed he swaps his surgical loupes for something far more powerful. Standing 7ft high, the operating microscope dominates the theatre. It allows the neurosurgeon to examine the microstructure of the twins’ blood vessels. It's now 14:30 and Jeelani announces: ""The artery from Safa going to supply Marwa's brain has been clamped. Now we wait."" It’s a dangerous moment. Every time a connection is cut, there is a risk of brain damage. After five minutes the surgeon says the brain ""doesn't look like it is too bothered"", and carries on. This painstaking procedure continues for several more hours as the shared arteries carrying oxygenated blood from one twin to the other are clamped and sealed. Meanwhile, a second team, led by Dunaway, has set up shop a few feet from the main action. Their task is to create a rigid frame from the three sections of skull, which can be detached in subsequent operations.  The curved bone pieces are held together with a network of metal mesh and screws. Dunaway says this is a particular challenge given the twins' age: “Being older they are pretty active and so whatever we do has to be strong enough to resist the twisting and bending forces they will be putting on their heads."" As the team patiently tease Safa’s and Marwa's brains apart, they feed in a sheet of soft medical plastic to stop them reconnecting in between operations. A pulley system has been secured to the plastic to counteract the way a part of each brain sticks up into the other twin's skull. This will gradually ease the brains back into place. Once the shared arteries are separated, the skull frame is re-attached. The operation has lasted 15 hours. The girls are taken to intensive care.  After two days, they are sent back to their usual home on Bumblebee ward - things are looking good. Jeelani and Dunaway were both involved in the separation of craniopagus twins at GOSH in 2006 and 2011.The latter involved Rital and Ritaj Gaboura, twin girls from Sudan who were 11 months old. Rital and Ritaj Gaboura Rital and Ritaj Gaboura Dunaway says the separation of Safa and Marwa is by far the hardest, not least because of their distorted brain shape.""The first two cases were much more straightforward and we were lucky. But with this set we underestimated the complexity of the oblique brain joining. Also, they are older and I think older is really bad news.""The surgeons believe the ideal time for separating craniopagus twins is when they are between six and 12 months old.""We put these twins through a lot,"" says Jeelani. ""Younger brains and younger circulations have better regeneration potential.""Dunaway agrees: ""Everything is easier. The skin stretches and heals better and the bone grows in better.""Safa and Marwa are nearly two, but while their age is against them, the team does have some elements working in their favour. Imaging and modelling technology have advanced significantly in the past eight years, which has helped them plan the separation in greater detail than ever before.In a narrow, cramped office dominated by a huge curved computer screen, sits craniofacial plastic surgeon Juling Ong. He is heading the modelling team for Safa and Marwa’s separation and demonstrates some of the cutting-edge systems they now have at their disposal.""These are really unique cases and it's not something that we get taught in medical school,” he says. “With this software, we can make a realistic computer model to look at the extraordinary anatomy of these children and plan our surgeries beforehand.""On the screen he displays some stunning 3D models of the girls’ skin, skulls and interlocked brains that have been made from traditional scans. ""It allows us to try out different strategies for operating, and the likely danger areas given the twins’ unique anatomical structures.”But these computer models don’t just stay on a screen, they can also take on a physical shape thanks to a 3D printer.Forty-eight hours later, the hospital’s 3D technician Kok Yean Chooi pulls out a shapeless looking lump of soft plastic. As he scrapes and washes the excess material away, a likeness emerges of one twin's skull cavity and skin envelope. This replica is to help plan how the layer of skin between the girls' shared skull will be divided.Many of these 3D models have been created, allowing the surgeons to explore the twins' unique anatomy, long before scalpel touches skin. ""To be able to see and visualise this and play with these models before the surgery makes an enormous difference to how we plan and do this operation,” says Jeelani.  “What we need to achieve is, in effect, to sort of untwist the brains. And that's pretty difficult to do just in your head."" Dunaway agrees: ""We've spent a lot of time just sitting looking at these models and going through the ‘what ifs’"".  But the team has gone beyond physical models. Wearing a virtual reality visor and gripping a pair of controllers, Jeelani sits in front of a computer screen, rocking from side to side. He keeps repeating the same word: ""Incredible."" The surgeon has been transported into a virtual world which allows him to explore the twins' intermingled vascular system. “This is clearly the way of the future,” he enthuses. “We are blessed here [at GOSH] in terms of the engineers and the software specialists - the skill sets they bring to the equation are skills that we as doctors with our medical training don't have.”   The second operation takes place one month after the first. While the first surgery sealed off the twins’ arterial connections, today's task is to divide the shared veins that drain blood from the girls' brains. Every severed connection runs the risk of causing a stroke in one of the twins. This time things are not going smoothly. As soon as the skull frame is detached, the girls start to bleed. Since the last operation clots have formed in Safa's neck veins. They are restricting drainage of blood from her brain so she is constantly shunting blood to Marwa instead. One twin’s blood pressure goes sky high, while the other’s dips dangerously low. The anaesthetists are struggling to keep them stable.That's when Marwa's heart rate plummets and they fear she may die on the table.There is suddenly quiet and stillness around the operating table as all eyes are on the instrument screens. The only sounds are the accelerated beeps of the heart monitors.The crisis passes, but not without serious consequences.It is clear to the surgical team that Marwa is the weaker twin. So they decide to give her a key shared vein. It will increase her chances of survival.It is a hugely difficult decision. Jeelani knows that it may have a serious impact on Safa, until now the stronger twin.But the team agrees that it is the right thing to do. The operation lasts more than 20 hours. Jeelani is exhausted and hands over to plastic surgeon Juling Ong to close.""I am relieved. We thought we might lose Marwa at one point,” he says. “But if they wake up as we hope they will, it's gone well.""The surgeons leave theatre at 06:30 the next morning. In the late afternoon, Jeelani telephones the hospital from home to check on the girls. He is told that Safa is in trouble, making no effort to breathe and her skin is mottled. ""I thought, ‘Safa is dead’,"" he says, and recounts how, emotionally exhausted and sleep-deprived, he collapsed on his kitchen floor and started to cry. ""My poor wife had never seen me like that before. She gave me my phone and said: 'Call David'. “You're invested so heavily in the twins and also so physically tired at this stage, you have very little reserves left,” he explains. “So it becomes much harder to deal with, with emotional ups and downs and complications."" Both surgeons return to intensive care and examine a CT scan of Safa's brain. What they feared has happened. She has had a stroke in the area of the brain where they gave the key vein to Marwa. Over the next two days, Safa is in a critical condition. Zainab, her brother and father-in-law, pray by the twins' bedside. Eventually, Safa shows signs of recovery. Both twins are weaned off ventilators and are able to breathe on their own.  The surgeons begin to relax. Nonetheless, as a result of the stroke Safa has some weakness in her left arm and leg. This weighs heavily on Jeelani’s conscience. ""For me the big moment is going to be when she walks and when she uses her left arm properly, because I know I've given her that weakness and for me that's a hard thing.""  Creating two round heads from the girls’ shared tubular anatomy presents a particular challenge. There isn’t enough surface area to cover the top of two heads once they have been split apart. It’s January 2019, just weeks from the final separation. Plastic surgeons David Dunaway and Juling Ong are by the twins’ bedside, trying to solve one part of the problem - the lack of skin to cover their heads when separated. Two weeks earlier, they had inserted four small plastic sacs under the skin of their foreheads and at the back of their shared skull, and these areas now look strangely lumpy.  The sacs are tissue expanders, and their role is to encourage skin growth. “They have a tiny little port attached to them through which we can inject saline,” explains Dunaway. “The idea is that we will gradually inject the tissue expanders and they will blow up like a balloon and the skin over the top of them will stretch.” They hope six weeks of skin expansion will give them enough extra surface to cover the tops of the girls’ heads. Dunaway admits that the last couple of months haven’t been easy. “It’s been a stormy time for Safa and Marwa,” he says. “They've had ups and downs with infections and temperatures, and Marwa's heart is having to work quite hard for both of them. That's causing her a few challenges. But they're hanging in there and are both reasonably well.”  David Dunaway fills the skin expanders with saline David Dunaway fills the skin expanders with saline Next for the girls will be the separation. For the first time in their lives they will be able to see each other. The day of separation is brought forward by four weeks because Marwa’s heart is still struggling. It’s February 2019 - four months since the first surgery. This is what the months of planning and preparation have been building towards. The twins have already endured 35 hours of surgery from the two previous operations. Over the next seven hours, the remaining connections of bone, brain and tissue are severed, until just one piece of dura, the membrane around the brain, links the sisters. Then, the final connection is cut. Several members of the surgical team step in to gently lift the two fragile bodies apart. Twins still, conjoined no more. “Fantastic,” says Dunaway. For the first time in their two years of life, the survival of each sister is no longer dependent on the other. That will make it easier for the two anaesthetic teams to regulate their heart rates, blood pressure and other vital signs. But separation is only the opening act of today’s surgery. The team now has to shape a rounded head for each child, from the remnants of their shared tubular skull, and hope the extra skin they managed to grow will cover them. Each twin now needs their own operating theatre.  Half of the surgical team will stay with Marwa under the guidance of Jeelani and Ong, while Dunaway will head up a second team next door to reconstruct Safa’s skull. Plastic film is used to wrap the top of her exposed head so she can be safely moved. As the parallel operating rooms are prepped for the final stage, the two lead surgeons, smiling broadly, shake hands in the corridor outside. “It was a very emotional moment,” says Dunaway. “We've been working a long time to get them here - they've been through so many operations and now it's worked.” Jeelani adds:  “We have taken the twins apart, but now we have to reconstruct their heads, and put each of them back together.” The separation could not have gone ahead if the twins’ brains had remained misshapen. By applying gentle pressure over the past four months, the surgeons have largely corrected the distortion, although the girls’ heads will always be slightly taller at the back. All that remains is to push the putty-like brains the last couple of centimetres into the newly divided skull cavities.  “Team Safa” and “Team Marwa” begin the painstaking task of skull reconstruction. “A piece for me, piece for you, piece for me, piece for you,"" says Dunaway, a veteran of 23 years in plastic and cranio-facial surgery, making two piles of skull fragments. To have enough skull to cover both heads, each fragment must be divided in two. “The skull is usefully designed in three layers: the inner and outer layers are very thick tough bone, but in between is like a honeycomb so you can split it. It is half the thickness but it means we should be able to cover nearly all the head with bone,” says Dunaway. With the girls’ brains enclosed in the watertight casing of dura, the skull fragments are jigsawed over the top of their now spherical heads. The individual pieces are secured in place with a lattice of disposable stitches, creating an archipelago of bone fragments. The gaps have been seeded with bone cells, and in the coming months these should slowly close up leaving each sister with a complete skull. The final task is to stretch the skin over the reconstructed skulls. There is just enough to make the join. Dunaway shakes his head in wonder. ""Pretty amazing day isn't it?” he says. At 01:30, after 17 hours in theatre, there is an emotional meeting between the two lead surgeons and the girls' family, who have been waiting in the hospital all day for news. Speaking in Urdu, Jeelani tells Zainab that her daughters are finally separate. Overcome, she kisses his hands and those of Dunaway.    While Safa and Marwa are slowly recovering in hospital in London, Jeelani and Dunaway take a trip to Ireland to visit Rital and Ritaj Gaboura, the craniopagus twins they separated in 2011, aged 11 months. They are excited about seeing the girls, who will be nine in September, for the first time, at the family home in Cavan. Their father Abdel-Majeed Gaboura is a doctor at a local hospital. His wife, Enas, trained as a psychiatrist in Sudan. A slight asymmetry in their head shape is the only evidence that their skulls were once joined together. The Gaboura sisters have had one of the most successful outcomes of any separated craniopagus twins. Born in 2010 in Sudan, the girls shared one long skull, but unlike Safa and Marwa their brains were not misshapen. They arrived at GOSH aged seven months in a very poor condition. Rital’s heart was failing because it was being overworked, supplying blood to much of her sister’s brain as well as her own.  Both twins would have died without surgery. Their four-stage separation took place over three months, and within a few weeks they were recovering well. Rital is on the autistic spectrum and goes to a special school, whereas Ritaj is showing typical development for her age and is in mainstream education. The twins have a strong relationship. Ritaj is “the boss” according to their parents, who say they often ask for her help when Rital is being unco-operative. Abdel-Majeed, says with pride: “I can’t even express my feelings that we are sitting here with two healthy twins,  just as I had hoped at that time.” Enas is pregnant again. “It’s just one child, not twins,” she says with a smile. “It was very different when I was pregnant before. I didn’t know if they would be born alive or dead.” For the two surgeons it is an emotional meeting. “To visit the girls in their own home, settled in the community here, going to school, seeing their enjoyment in life and the family - that's a really very special reward. It tells us something about the value of this very rare surgery,” says Dunaway. Rital and Ritaj are evidence of what can be achieved for craniopagus twins, if the surgery is done at a young age when the body’s regenerative powers are strongest. But the surgery is hugely expensive and that often means a delay in getting funding, which is what happened with Safa and Marwa. Jeelani first spoke to their family when the girls were just three months old, but it took another 16 months to find a donor. He is convinced that delay affected the outcome. “Had we been able to do them sooner, the results would have been better,” he says. “They will have some long-term deficits, we envision that they will have problems with movement and intellectual function possibly. But we take the cue from the mother. She is delighted that we are where we are. She feels that they would have had no life had we not given them the chance.”  When carrying out such unusual operations, surgeons will always reflect on whether they did the right thing. But Dunaway knows life would have been arduous for the twins if they hadn’t been separated. “It may have been difficult to provide the care to keep them fit and healthy. Clearly they are going to face some challenges but I think overall, it's a positive outcome for them. They have a chance of leading happy lives now.” The two surgeons have set up a charity namedGemini Untwinedto collate research and information on conjoined twins and help raise money for future operations. “What we would like to see is that we don't have this potentially damaging delay in treating children, and a research arm giving us much more information,” says Dunaway. “There is so much we don't know about conjoined twins, we think we're doing it the right way but we really need to understand that in a scientific way.”  The day of discharge has finally arrived for Safa and Marwa. It is nearly five months since they were separated and it’s been a long, slow recovery for the girls. Both needed skin grafts on the back of their heads. And they have been receiving daily physiotherapy to help them reach some basic milestones - learning to roll, sit and hold their heads up. Their mum has dressed them in eye-catching red-and-gold outfits to celebrate the occasion. While Zainab packs up the last of their things, Marwa giggles and squirms on the bed as her grandfather tickles her. Safa plays copycat with her uncle, taking turns to bang on a drum. There is still a long way to go but they are making progress and starting to regain their former playfulness. When the time comes to leave, there are hugs and tears from mum and the nurses and doctors who have cared for them. Dunaway pops in between cases to say a last goodbye, and Jeelani appears straight from the operating theatre just in time to walk them out. His strong bond with the family is evident and the pride he feels at seeing the girls recovered enough to be discharged is written on his face. Safa, Marwa and their family will stay in London for the next six months at least, while the girls have more physiotherapy and checkups but their plan is to return home to Pakistan in early 2020. As they leave the hospital that has been their home for the past 11 months, Zainab is clear that separating the girls was the right thing to do. “I am very happy. With God's grace I am able to hold one for an hour and then the other one. God has answered our prayers.”    Authors:Rachael Buchanan, Fergus Walsh Graphics:Joanne McDonald, Gerry Fletcher Videos and photography:Tony Fallshaw, Julius Peacock, Rob Magee Additional photos:Bibi family, Gaboura family, Alamy Producer:James Percy Editor:Kathryn Westcott Publication date: 15 July 2019",Positive,0.99992085
" By Rachael Buchanan It’s the rarest form of a rare condition - conjoined twins, fused at the head. The BBC has been granted exclusive access to a ground-breaking series of operations in a British hospital to separate two sisters. There is a crowd in the operating theatre. But the team of nearly 20 works as one. Moving smoothly, every motion calculated. No signs of stress or tension, just hands methodically performing tasks. But this is no routine operation. The shrouded shape of two small girls is picked out by the bright theatre lights. Safa and Marwa are joined at the head. Their brains are exposed as the surgeons work to separate a labyrinth of shared blood vessels. But then the calm and peace of the theatre disappears, as anaesthetists raise the alarm. The blood from Safa’s brain isn’t draining properly and she is shunting blood to her sister. This puts strain on Marwa’s heart and she becomes dangerously unstable.  The anaesthetists call out commands, report vital signs and busy themselves trying to stabilise the girls. ""I think we need to shock,"" says one of them. Pads are attached to Marwa’s chest in preparation. The lead surgeon raises both hands so they can be clearly seen, and steps back. Then everyone waits. If they lose her, they may also lose Safa.     Zainab Bibi has already given birth to seven children - all of them at home. So when she becomes pregnant with twins, the plan is to do the same thing. But after an ultrasound scan picks up a complication, she is advised to have them delivered in hospital. It’s a difficult time for the family. Two months before the birth, Zainab’s husband died of a heart attack. She is also told by the maternity team that the twins might be joined together. But there has been no mention of where on their bodies the join might be. No-one, it seems, realises the full extent of the complications to come.   On 7 January 2017, the twins are delivered by Caesarean section at Hayatabad hospital in Peshawar, some 31 miles (50km) from her home in northern Pakistan. The family are told that the girls are healthy. But Zainab doesn’t meet the newborns immediately, because she needs to recover from the surgery. It is the twins' grandfather Mohammad Sadat Hussain who finds out the truth first - the girls are what is called craniopagus twins, which means they are joined at the head. It is the rarest form of what is already a rare condition. Their grandfather arrives on the maternity ward bearing the traditional gift of sweets for the nurses. Still in mourning for the loss of his son, meeting his granddaughters is a bittersweet moment: “I was happy to see them, but I was thinking what am I going to do with them because of their joined heads?” It is five days before Zainab is well enough to be introduced to her daughters, and she is given a photo of the twins to prepare her. She says she instantly fell in love. “They were very beautiful and they had nice hair with white skin. I didn’t even think about the fact they were joined. They are God-given.” They are named Safa and Marwa, after the twin hills in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, that play a central role in the Islamic ritual pilgrimage of Hajj.   After a month, the twins are discharged from hospital and the family agree that if it can be done, they should be separated. A military hospital offers to perform the surgery but warns that one of the twins is likely to die. It is a risk their mother is unwilling to take. Other options are explored, and when the twins are three months old, the family are put in touch with Owase Jeelani, a paediatric neurosurgeon at one of the world's leading children's hospitals, Great Ormond Street in London (GOSH). By coincidence, he was born in the nearby region of Kashmir and immediately establishes a rapport with them. After seeing scans of the girls, the surgeon is convinced they can be safely separated, but he wants to do it before they reach 12 months old, to get the best outcome. The clock is ticking. It is August 2018. The visas for the UK have already come through, but funding for the operations has not. This is not something the NHS in the UK would fund and Jeelani has raised only a small amount of the money needed to pay for the hospital care. The girls are now 19 months old, well beyond the age that the GOSH team would like to operate. Any further delay might mean the separation becomes more dangerous, recovery more limited. Jeelani urges the family to come to England immediately.  He remembers the moment they arrived: “They turned up in early August and at this point we only had a small amount of the money we needed. The kids were here and I must say I was really stressed. At this stage it felt like a personal responsibility.” The twins’ uncle Mohammad Idrees and their grandfather are put up in a flat near the hospital. But Zainab will not be parted from her daughters, and prefers to sleep in their room. Despite being joined, the twins have distinct personalities, according to their mother. Safa, is “smart, happy and talks a lot”. Marwa, on the other hand, is shy. “She sometimes talked to herself but when we spoke to her she didn’t always reply,” says Zainab. Shortly after their arrival, while Jeelani is having lunch with a lawyer friend, a moment of pure serendipity changes everything. After he tells her the story of the twins, the lawyer picks up her mobile phone and makes a call. The surgeon is asked to tell the person on the line about the girls. He is speaking to a wealthy Pakistani businessman, Murtaza Lakhani. Within a few minutes, an offer has been made to meet the costs of their treatment. “The twins are from Pakistan which is where I am from originally,” says Lakhani. “However, the true reason for me helping them was because it was an operation that was going to save the lives of two children. For me it was an easy decision, it’s how you build the future.”    Conjoined twins develop from one fertilised egg and so are always identical. There are two theories about why they are fused together - either the split into two embryos happens later than usual, and the twins only partially divide, or, following the split, parts of the embryos remain in contact and those body parts merge as they grow. When it occurs, twins are more commonly connected at the chest, abdomen or pelvis. Safa and Marwa’s particular commingled physiology presents a unique set of challenges for the GOSH team. The girls are joined at the top of their heads - crown to crown - facing opposite directions. They have never seen each other’s faces. Their skull is like a stove pipe, a long straight tube. Scans show that the girls have two distinct brains but these are misshapen. The right hemisphere of each brain is sticking up 90 degrees, projecting into the other twin's brain cavity. This distorted shape will need correcting if the girls are to have near normal-shaped heads. The surgical team's biggest concern is how to separate the complex shared network of veins and arteries. Each twin supplies the other with blood. Severing these connections carries a risk of starving the brain of nourishment and causing a stroke. There are no official figures for the prevalence of craniopagus conjoined twins, but one estimate puts it at one in every 2.5 million births. Most do not survive beyond 24 hours. Each case is unique, and separations of craniopagus twins have only been reported about 60 times since the first attempt in 1952. Jeelani believes there could be up to six sets of craniopagus twins born worldwide each year who might be successfully separated. Great Ormond Street Hospital is a world leader in this kind of surgery. Safa and Marwa will be their third set of craniopagus twins, more than any other centre. The team knows from experience that the best outcomes happen when the separation is staged over several operations, to allow for recovery in between. As well as surgeons and nurses, the 100-strong team at GOSH involved with the care and separation of the twins includes bio-engineers, 3D modellers and a virtual reality designer.  Owase Jeelani and Prof David Dunaway Owase Jeelani and Prof David Dunaway Jeelani will take the lead in separating the girls' brains and blood vessels, but it will be plastic surgeon Prof David Dunaway who will be responsible for rebuilding the girls' heads, and giving each of them a top to their skulls.  It's 08:00 on Monday 15 October 2018, and a team of nearly 20 gathers in theatre 10 at GOSH. Each member of staff identifies themselves and what their role will be. ""We have one case for the list today. Safa and Marwa. Two kids, one case,"" says Jeelani. The twins’ slow journey to independence is about to begin. The aim of this surgery - the first of three major operations - is to separate the twins' shared arteries. Jeelani works his way through the plan one last time but everyone knows what they have to do. The team has been preparing for this day for months. ""We have been through everything in fine detail - rehearsed it repeatedly. This is the moment of truth and everything has to be perfect,"" says Dunaway. Meanwhile on Bumblebee ward, the twins are being readied for theatre. Wearing identical surgical gowns, Safa and Marwa cry and twist restlessly.  Separating conjoined twins carries huge risks. One or both could die during surgery or be left with brain damage. The family understand the dangers, and have complete trust in the team. “It is clearly very difficult to go through life when you are joined together like that, so it does make a persuasive case in favour of attempting the separation and the family are very clear on that,” says Jeelani. Dunaway says the team has carefully assessed the ethical issues. “Clearly I think life being separate is better than being joined together. If we felt there wasn't a very high chance that we could do it safely, we would think hard about whether we should do it at all. The whole team feels there's an excellent likelihood of a successful separation here.” As the twins’ trolley arrives at the theatre doors Zainab kisses her daughters. She knows the coming months will be hard on them and the emotion of parting is overwhelming. In tears, she is comforted by one of the many nurses she has come to look on as family. ""I am hopeful that everything will be okay and I have full trust in the doctors. I always look to God - he will make everything great,"" she says. In theatre, the first task is to remove three large segments of skull. Jeelani is wearing surgical loupes, glasses fitted with magnifying scopes. He follows the marks he traced on the girls' shared skull, now shaved, and cuts through skin and bone. Once the brains are exposed he swaps his surgical loupes for something far more powerful. Standing 7ft high, the operating microscope dominates the theatre. It allows the neurosurgeon to examine the microstructure of the twins’ blood vessels. It's now 14:30 and Jeelani announces: ""The artery from Safa going to supply Marwa's brain has been clamped. Now we wait."" It’s a dangerous moment. Every time a connection is cut, there is a risk of brain damage. After five minutes the surgeon says the brain ""doesn't look like it is too bothered"", and carries on. This painstaking procedure continues for several more hours as the shared arteries carrying oxygenated blood from one twin to the other are clamped and sealed. Meanwhile, a second team, led by Dunaway, has set up shop a few feet from the main action. Their task is to create a rigid frame from the three sections of skull, which can be detached in subsequent operations.  The curved bone pieces are held together with a network of metal mesh and screws. Dunaway says this is a particular challenge given the twins' age: “Being older they are pretty active and so whatever we do has to be strong enough to resist the twisting and bending forces they will be putting on their heads."" As the team patiently tease Safa’s and Marwa's brains apart, they feed in a sheet of soft medical plastic to stop them reconnecting in between operations. A pulley system has been secured to the plastic to counteract the way a part of each brain sticks up into the other twin's skull. This will gradually ease the brains back into place. Once the shared arteries are separated, the skull frame is re-attached. The operation has lasted 15 hours. The girls are taken to intensive care.  After two days, they are sent back to their usual home on Bumblebee ward - things are looking good. Jeelani and Dunaway were both involved in the separation of craniopagus twins at GOSH in 2006 and 2011.The latter involved Rital and Ritaj Gaboura, twin girls from Sudan who were 11 months old. Rital and Ritaj Gaboura Rital and Ritaj Gaboura Dunaway says the separation of Safa and Marwa is by far the hardest, not least because of their distorted brain shape.""The first two cases were much more straightforward and we were lucky. But with this set we underestimated the complexity of the oblique brain joining. Also, they are older and I think older is really bad news.""The surgeons believe the ideal time for separating craniopagus twins is when they are between six and 12 months old.""We put these twins through a lot,"" says Jeelani. ""Younger brains and younger circulations have better regeneration potential.""Dunaway agrees: ""Everything is easier. The skin stretches and heals better and the bone grows in better.""Safa and Marwa are nearly two, but while their age is against them, the team does have some elements working in their favour. Imaging and modelling technology have advanced significantly in the past eight years, which has helped them plan the separation in greater detail than ever before.In a narrow, cramped office dominated by a huge curved computer screen, sits craniofacial plastic surgeon Juling Ong. He is heading the modelling team for Safa and Marwa’s separation and demonstrates some of the cutting-edge systems they now have at their disposal.""These are really unique cases and it's not something that we get taught in medical school,” he says. “With this software, we can make a realistic computer model to look at the extraordinary anatomy of these children and plan our surgeries beforehand.""On the screen he displays some stunning 3D models of the girls’ skin, skulls and interlocked brains that have been made from traditional scans. ""It allows us to try out different strategies for operating, and the likely danger areas given the twins’ unique anatomical structures.”But these computer models don’t just stay on a screen, they can also take on a physical shape thanks to a 3D printer.Forty-eight hours later, the hospital’s 3D technician Kok Yean Chooi pulls out a shapeless looking lump of soft plastic. As he scrapes and washes the excess material away, a likeness emerges of one twin's skull cavity and skin envelope. This replica is to help plan how the layer of skin between the girls' shared skull will be divided.Many of these 3D models have been created, allowing the surgeons to explore the twins' unique anatomy, long before scalpel touches skin. ""To be able to see and visualise this and play with these models before the surgery makes an enormous difference to how we plan and do this operation,” says Jeelani.  “What we need to achieve is, in effect, to sort of untwist the brains. And that's pretty difficult to do just in your head."" Dunaway agrees: ""We've spent a lot of time just sitting looking at these models and going through the ‘what ifs’"".  But the team has gone beyond physical models. Wearing a virtual reality visor and gripping a pair of controllers, Jeelani sits in front of a computer screen, rocking from side to side. He keeps repeating the same word: ""Incredible."" The surgeon has been transported into a virtual world which allows him to explore the twins' intermingled vascular system. “This is clearly the way of the future,” he enthuses. “We are blessed here [at GOSH] in terms of the engineers and the software specialists - the skill sets they bring to the equation are skills that we as doctors with our medical training don't have.”   The second operation takes place one month after the first. While the first surgery sealed off the twins’ arterial connections, today's task is to divide the shared veins that drain blood from the girls' brains. Every severed connection runs the risk of causing a stroke in one of the twins. This time things are not going smoothly. As soon as the skull frame is detached, the girls start to bleed. Since the last operation clots have formed in Safa's neck veins. They are restricting drainage of blood from her brain so she is constantly shunting blood to Marwa instead. One twin’s blood pressure goes sky high, while the other’s dips dangerously low. The anaesthetists are struggling to keep them stable.That's when Marwa's heart rate plummets and they fear she may die on the table.There is suddenly quiet and stillness around the operating table as all eyes are on the instrument screens. The only sounds are the accelerated beeps of the heart monitors.The crisis passes, but not without serious consequences.It is clear to the surgical team that Marwa is the weaker twin. So they decide to give her a key shared vein. It will increase her chances of survival.It is a hugely difficult decision. Jeelani knows that it may have a serious impact on Safa, until now the stronger twin.But the team agrees that it is the right thing to do. The operation lasts more than 20 hours. Jeelani is exhausted and hands over to plastic surgeon Juling Ong to close.""I am relieved. We thought we might lose Marwa at one point,” he says. “But if they wake up as we hope they will, it's gone well.""The surgeons leave theatre at 06:30 the next morning. In the late afternoon, Jeelani telephones the hospital from home to check on the girls. He is told that Safa is in trouble, making no effort to breathe and her skin is mottled. ""I thought, ‘Safa is dead’,"" he says, and recounts how, emotionally exhausted and sleep-deprived, he collapsed on his kitchen floor and started to cry. ""My poor wife had never seen me like that before. She gave me my phone and said: 'Call David'. “You're invested so heavily in the twins and also so physically tired at this stage, you have very little reserves left,” he explains. “So it becomes much harder to deal with, with emotional ups and downs and complications."" Both surgeons return to intensive care and examine a CT scan of Safa's brain. What they feared has happened. She has had a stroke in the area of the brain where they gave the key vein to Marwa. Over the next two days, Safa is in a critical condition. Zainab, her brother and father-in-law, pray by the twins' bedside. Eventually, Safa shows signs of recovery. Both twins are weaned off ventilators and are able to breathe on their own.  The surgeons begin to relax. Nonetheless, as a result of the stroke Safa has some weakness in her left arm and leg. This weighs heavily on Jeelani’s conscience. ""For me the big moment is going to be when she walks and when she uses her left arm properly, because I know I've given her that weakness and for me that's a hard thing.""  Creating two round heads from the girls’ shared tubular anatomy presents a particular challenge. There isn’t enough surface area to cover the top of two heads once they have been split apart. It’s January 2019, just weeks from the final separation. Plastic surgeons David Dunaway and Juling Ong are by the twins’ bedside, trying to solve one part of the problem - the lack of skin to cover their heads when separated. Two weeks earlier, they had inserted four small plastic sacs under the skin of their foreheads and at the back of their shared skull, and these areas now look strangely lumpy.  The sacs are tissue expanders, and their role is to encourage skin growth. “They have a tiny little port attached to them through which we can inject saline,” explains Dunaway. “The idea is that we will gradually inject the tissue expanders and they will blow up like a balloon and the skin over the top of them will stretch.” They hope six weeks of skin expansion will give them enough extra surface to cover the tops of the girls’ heads. Dunaway admits that the last couple of months haven’t been easy. “It’s been a stormy time for Safa and Marwa,” he says. “They've had ups and downs with infections and temperatures, and Marwa's heart is having to work quite hard for both of them. That's causing her a few challenges. But they're hanging in there and are both reasonably well.”  David Dunaway fills the skin expanders with saline David Dunaway fills the skin expanders with saline Next for the girls will be the separation. For the first time in their lives they will be able to see each other. The day of separation is brought forward by four weeks because Marwa’s heart is still struggling. It’s February 2019 - four months since the first surgery. This is what the months of planning and preparation have been building towards. The twins have already endured 35 hours of surgery from the two previous operations. Over the next seven hours, the remaining connections of bone, brain and tissue are severed, until just one piece of dura, the membrane around the brain, links the sisters. Then, the final connection is cut. Several members of the surgical team step in to gently lift the two fragile bodies apart. Twins still, conjoined no more. “Fantastic,” says Dunaway. For the first time in their two years of life, the survival of each sister is no longer dependent on the other. That will make it easier for the two anaesthetic teams to regulate their heart rates, blood pressure and other vital signs. But separation is only the opening act of today’s surgery. The team now has to shape a rounded head for each child, from the remnants of their shared tubular skull, and hope the extra skin they managed to grow will cover them. Each twin now needs their own operating theatre.  Half of the surgical team will stay with Marwa under the guidance of Jeelani and Ong, while Dunaway will head up a second team next door to reconstruct Safa’s skull. Plastic film is used to wrap the top of her exposed head so she can be safely moved. As the parallel operating rooms are prepped for the final stage, the two lead surgeons, smiling broadly, shake hands in the corridor outside. “It was a very emotional moment,” says Dunaway. “We've been working a long time to get them here - they've been through so many operations and now it's worked.” Jeelani adds:  “We have taken the twins apart, but now we have to reconstruct their heads, and put each of them back together.” The separation could not have gone ahead if the twins’ brains had remained misshapen. By applying gentle pressure over the past four months, the surgeons have largely corrected the distortion, although the girls’ heads will always be slightly taller at the back. All that remains is to push the putty-like brains the last couple of centimetres into the newly divided skull cavities.  “Team Safa” and “Team Marwa” begin the painstaking task of skull reconstruction. “A piece for me, piece for you, piece for me, piece for you,"" says Dunaway, a veteran of 23 years in plastic and cranio-facial surgery, making two piles of skull fragments. To have enough skull to cover both heads, each fragment must be divided in two. “The skull is usefully designed in three layers: the inner and outer layers are very thick tough bone, but in between is like a honeycomb so you can split it. It is half the thickness but it means we should be able to cover nearly all the head with bone,” says Dunaway. With the girls’ brains enclosed in the watertight casing of dura, the skull fragments are jigsawed over the top of their now spherical heads. The individual pieces are secured in place with a lattice of disposable stitches, creating an archipelago of bone fragments. The gaps have been seeded with bone cells, and in the coming months these should slowly close up leaving each sister with a complete skull. The final task is to stretch the skin over the reconstructed skulls. There is just enough to make the join. Dunaway shakes his head in wonder. ""Pretty amazing day isn't it?” he says. At 01:30, after 17 hours in theatre, there is an emotional meeting between the two lead surgeons and the girls' family, who have been waiting in the hospital all day for news. Speaking in Urdu, Jeelani tells Zainab that her daughters are finally separate. Overcome, she kisses his hands and those of Dunaway.    While Safa and Marwa are slowly recovering in hospital in London, Jeelani and Dunaway take a trip to Ireland to visit Rital and Ritaj Gaboura, the craniopagus twins they separated in 2011, aged 11 months. They are excited about seeing the girls, who will be nine in September, for the first time, at the family home in Cavan. Their father Abdel-Majeed Gaboura is a doctor at a local hospital. His wife, Enas, trained as a psychiatrist in Sudan. A slight asymmetry in their head shape is the only evidence that their skulls were once joined together. The Gaboura sisters have had one of the most successful outcomes of any separated craniopagus twins. Born in 2010 in Sudan, the girls shared one long skull, but unlike Safa and Marwa their brains were not misshapen. They arrived at GOSH aged seven months in a very poor condition. Rital’s heart was failing because it was being overworked, supplying blood to much of her sister’s brain as well as her own.  Both twins would have died without surgery. Their four-stage separation took place over three months, and within a few weeks they were recovering well. Rital is on the autistic spectrum and goes to a special school, whereas Ritaj is showing typical development for her age and is in mainstream education. The twins have a strong relationship. Ritaj is “the boss” according to their parents, who say they often ask for her help when Rital is being unco-operative. Abdel-Majeed, says with pride: “I can’t even express my feelings that we are sitting here with two healthy twins,  just as I had hoped at that time.” Enas is pregnant again. “It’s just one child, not twins,” she says with a smile. “It was very different when I was pregnant before. I didn’t know if they would be born alive or dead.” For the two surgeons it is an emotional meeting. “To visit the girls in their own home, settled in the community here, going to school, seeing their enjoyment in life and the family - that's a really very special reward. It tells us something about the value of this very rare surgery,” says Dunaway. Rital and Ritaj are evidence of what can be achieved for craniopagus twins, if the surgery is done at a young age when the body’s regenerative powers are strongest. But the surgery is hugely expensive and that often means a delay in getting funding, which is what happened with Safa and Marwa. Jeelani first spoke to their family when the girls were just three months old, but it took another 16 months to find a donor. He is convinced that delay affected the outcome. “Had we been able to do them sooner, the results would have been better,” he says. “They will have some long-term deficits, we envision that they will have problems with movement and intellectual function possibly. But we take the cue from the mother. She is delighted that we are where we are. She feels that they would have had no life had we not given them the chance.”  When carrying out such unusual operations, surgeons will always reflect on whether they did the right thing. But Dunaway knows life would have been arduous for the twins if they hadn’t been separated. “It may have been difficult to provide the care to keep them fit and healthy. Clearly they are going to face some challenges but I think overall, it's a positive outcome for them. They have a chance of leading happy lives now.” The two surgeons have set up a charity namedGemini Untwinedto collate research and information on conjoined twins and help raise money for future operations. “What we would like to see is that we don't have this potentially damaging delay in treating children, and a research arm giving us much more information,” says Dunaway. “There is so much we don't know about conjoined twins, we think we're doing it the right way but we really need to understand that in a scientific way.”  The day of discharge has finally arrived for Safa and Marwa. It is nearly five months since they were separated and it’s been a long, slow recovery for the girls. Both needed skin grafts on the back of their heads. And they have been receiving daily physiotherapy to help them reach some basic milestones - learning to roll, sit and hold their heads up. Their mum has dressed them in eye-catching red-and-gold outfits to celebrate the occasion. While Zainab packs up the last of their things, Marwa giggles and squirms on the bed as her grandfather tickles her. Safa plays copycat with her uncle, taking turns to bang on a drum. There is still a long way to go but they are making progress and starting to regain their former playfulness. When the time comes to leave, there are hugs and tears from mum and the nurses and doctors who have cared for them. Dunaway pops in between cases to say a last goodbye, and Jeelani appears straight from the operating theatre just in time to walk them out. His strong bond with the family is evident and the pride he feels at seeing the girls recovered enough to be discharged is written on his face. Safa, Marwa and their family will stay in London for the next six months at least, while the girls have more physiotherapy and checkups but their plan is to return home to Pakistan in early 2020. As they leave the hospital that has been their home for the past 11 months, Zainab is clear that separating the girls was the right thing to do. “I am very happy. With God's grace I am able to hold one for an hour and then the other one. God has answered our prayers.”    Authors:Rachael Buchanan, Fergus Walsh Graphics:Joanne McDonald, Gerry Fletcher Videos and photography:Tony Fallshaw, Julius Peacock, Rob Magee Additional photos:Bibi family, Gaboura family, Alamy Producer:James Percy Editor:Kathryn Westcott Publication date: 15 July 2019",Positive,1.0
"This video can not be played President Trump defends racially charged tweets US President Donald Trump has redoubled his attack on four Democratic congresswomen, accusing them of ""hating our country"". ""If you are not happy, if you are complaining all the time, you can leave,"" he told a heated news conference outside the White House. On Sunday Mr Trump called on the women, who are from ethnically diverse backgrounds, to ""go back"". He was widely accused of racism and xenophobia, which he denied. Mr Trump first sparked a furore in a series of tweets on Sunday in which he said the women ""originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe"". ""Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how,"" he wrote. He did not explicitly name the women, but the context made a clear link. The four - US-born Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley, and Ilhan Omar, who came to the US as a refugee aged 12 - all called the president racist and were backed by members of the Democratic Party. Ms Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx in New York, about 12 miles (19km) away from the Queens hospital where Mr Trump was born. ""These are people that in my opinion hate our country,"" President Trump told reporters on Monday. ""As far as I'm concerned if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave. You can leave right now. I don't know who's going to miss 'em,"" he said, to applause from some in the audience. Times when Americans were told to 'go home' The women tangled in Trump's racially charged row PM candidates condemn Trump 'go back' tweets Asked by a reporter if he was concerned that his tweets had been seen by some as racist, Mr Trump said he was not. ""It doesn't concern me because many people agree with me,"" he added. This video can not be played African Americans in New Orleans reflect on race relations Mr Trump lashed out particularly at Ms Omar, saying she ""hates Israel"" and ""hates Jews"", as well as suggesting she supported the jihadist group al-Qaeda. ""I don't know, I never met her, I hear the way she talks about al-Qaeda,"" Mr Trump said. ""Al-Qaeda has killed many Americans. She said, 'you can hold your chest out, when I think of America, when I think of al-Qaeda, I can hold my chest out.'"" US media reported that Mr Trump's accusations probably reference a 2013 interview where Ms Omar was discussing a college terrorism class. She did not praise al-Qaeda in the interview. Ms Omar instead recalled a class in which ""every time the professor said 'al-Qaeda', his shoulders went up"". Ms Omar went on to point out that you do not say ""America"" or ""England"" with that same intensity, adding ""but you say these names [of terrorist groups] because you want the word to carry weight. You want it to be something"". Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (left), Rashida Tlaib (centre) and Ayanna Pressley (right) accused the president of racism On Monday, Republican Senator Susan Collins said in a statement the tweets were ""way over the line"" and should be removed, while  Republican Congressman Will Hurd, who is African American, described the comments as ""racist and xenophobic"". But Republican Congressman Andy Harris defended Mr Trump,telling WBAL radio,external: ""Clearly it's not a racist comment. He could have meant go back to the district they came from, the neighbourhood they came from."" Analysis byGary O'Donoghue, BBC WashingtonCorrespondent Telling people of colour to go back to where they came from cannot be regarded as anything other than a blatant evocation of a well-worn trope of racist language and sentiment that's as old as the hills. But usually politicians who want to play the race card reach for the ""dog whistle"" - a political nudge and a wink that tells their supporters that they share their views that cannot easily be voiced in a liberal democracy without alienating people whose support they will need. President Trump, however, has pushed the boundaries on racially charged language ever since he became a candidate. Remember how Mexicans were Rapists and Drug dealers, how there were ""good people"" on both sides of the argument when white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, and how the President didn't see why America should allow more people in from ""shithole"" countries in Africa. So what is his strategy? Keeping his core support fired up is unquestionably part of it. And exploiting divisions within Democratic ranks which have had racial overtones in recent days is another reason for his actions. But in many ways, we should not be surprised by this President ratcheting up the political heat in this particular way. After all, it's a short intellectual step from the economic nationalism encapsulated in the idea of America First, to a more thorough-going nationalism that sees a threat from the enemy within. Follow Gary O'Donoghue on Twitter,external Despite criticism, President Trump launched another Twitter tirade on Monday morning, calling on the women themselves to apologise - to him and ""the people of Israel"". Mr Trump has also accused Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi of racism, after she said the president's campaign slogan, Make America Great Again, was ""about making America white again"". ""That's a very racist statement,"" Mr Trump said. ""I'm surprised she'd say that."" Nancy Pelosi says a resolution condemning the president's comments is forthcoming In a letter to Democrats on Monday, Mrs Pelosi announced a resolution in the House to condemn the ""disgusting attacks"". And on the Senate floor, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer called out conservatives, saying: ""My Republican friends, he's not backing off. Where are you?"" Also on Monday, Mr Trump's attorney general William Barr delivered remarks at a Department of Justice forum on battling anti-Semitism, where he condemned ""identity politics"" and said he was ""deeply concerned about the rise in hate crimes and political violence"" in the last decade. In his initial Twitter thread, Mr Trump did not specifically mention a link to recent news events, but immigration at the southern border was a dominant topic in US news at the weekend. On Friday, Ms Ocasio-Cortez, Ms Tlaib and Ms Pressley testified to a House committee about conditions in a migrant detention centre they had visited. They expressed horror about alleged mistreatment happening ""under American flags"". The president replied by tweeting that children's detention centres had had ""great reviews"" and the adult male areas were ""loaded up with a big percentage of criminals"". This is not the first time Mr Trump has been accused of racism. For years, he made false claims that former President Barack Obama was not born in the US - propagating the racist ""birther"" conspiracy. Mr Trump and his father Fred Trump were sued by the Department of Justice in 1973 for discrimination against African Americans in their renting practices. They settled the case without admitting guilt in 1975 but were accused again by the justice department in 1978 of an ""underlying pattern of discrimination"" against black tenants.

"The system is supposed to force websites to verify the age of UK users Digital Minister Margot James has apologised for the six-month delay on the so-called ""porn block"", which had been due to take effect on Monday. It is designed to force pornography websites to verify users are over 18. But the law has been delayed twice- most recently because the UK government failed to properly notify European regulators. ""I'm extremely sorry that there has been a delay,"" Ms James told the BBC. ""I know it sounds incompetent."" She added: ""Mistakes do happen, and I'm terribly sorry that it happened in such an important area,"" Under the proposed rules, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) would supervise the compulsory age checks. Websites which fail to comply would be blocked by internet service providers. Only websites where more than a third of content is pornographic are covered - which excludes social media sites. But critics say how exactly the scheme will work is still unclear. Some options include uploading copies of a passport or driving licence, or buying vouchers from local shops. It was originally supposed to take effect in April 2018, but was delayed to provide time to ""get it right"". Does pornography still drive the internet? The UK wants to stop under 18s watching porn Porn check critics fear data breach ""I think it's outrageous,"" said Sarah Wollaston, chairwoman of the Health and Social Care Committee ""It's another example of the government failing to protect children and young people. I'm afraid everything in this place is being kicked down the road because of the delays caused by the leadership election and the Brexit process."" Dr Wollaston was a party colleague of Ms James until she resigned from the Conservatives in February. She is now an independent. Some have also questioned whether one of the main providers of age verification software has a potential conflict of interest. Mindgeek, the largest such company, also owns some of the world's largest pornography sites, including Pornhub. Dr Wollaston said it was the equivalent of ""putting a fox in charge of the hen house"". ""I think Mindgeek's intention is to own the market and make all the money,"" said Jim Killock, executive director of digital rights group Open Rights. ""I don't see that it's got much other motivation, at the end of the day."" The company strongly refutes such suggestions. ""It's not in our or our advertisers' interests to have children visiting our sites - so there's no conflict of interest,"" it said, stressing that its sites ""neither aim to market to nor target minors on any level"". Ms James said such a conflict would only be a problem if the firm had a monopoly on age verification. Digital Minister Margot James said the potential conflicts of interest were acceptable ""I agree they're the largest player in it, but there are other age verification providers.... so I think that we feel like that's acceptable,"" Ms James said. But Mr Killock warned that the company's involvement had other potential impacts. ""Pornhub and Mindgeek are going to be able to get a birds-eye view of the whole industry, of all of the adult users,"" he said. This could allow them to ""see exactly what kind of content they should be selling next, which websites they might want to buy"". ""That level of market intelligence and market power and personal information has been handed to them on a plate by the UK government, because it has refused to regulate what these tools should be, how they should work,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Some of the protesters have glued themselves around the boat Climate protesters have blocked a key city centre road in Cardiff, with commuters warned to expect disruption. A number of members of Extinction Rebellion are outside Cardiff Castle and have parked a green boat in the middle of the street. The group want to raise awareness about climate change but there have been calls for them to end the protest. Motorists have been warned to avoid the city centre as police expect disruption to last into the evening on Monday. Cardiff Bus said it experienced severe delays to services and commuters also faced delays during the morning rush hour. Police have closed the road to vehicles from the junction with Queen Street to Westgate Street. A boat has been placed in the middle of the busy road Cardiff is one of ""five centres of disruption"" planned by the group, with others due to take place in Leeds, Glasgow, London and Bristol during the ""five-day national campaign"" of protests.

"Boris Johnson (l) and Jeremy Hunt (r) made the comments during a head-to-head debate run by The Sun newspaper Both candidates to be the UK's next PM have condemned tweets by Donald Trump which called on four Democratic congresswomen of colour to ""go back"". During a head-to-head debate run by The Sun, Jeremy Hunt called the remarks ""totally offensive"", while Boris Johnson said they were ""unacceptable"". But neither would go as far as branding the US president's comments racist. Mr Trump said the women ""originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe"". He faced a backlash for the series of tweets on Sunday aimed at Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley - who were all born in the US - and Ilhan Omar - who went to the US as a child refugee when she was 12. His remarks were widely condemned as racist, and as having gone beyond previous statements and actions by the president that drew allegations of racism. But Mr Trump doubled down on his comments on Monday, accusing the congresswomen of ""hating our country"". Earlier, he also launched another Twitter tirade, calling on the women themselves to apologise. All the women called the president racist and were backed by members of the Democratic Party. Times when people were told to 'go back' home Trump steps up attack on 'US-hating' congresswomen Theresa May condemns Trump's 'go back' remark Asked about the tweets during the debate, Mr Hunt - who is married to a Chinese woman - said he would be ""utterly appalled"" if someone said the same thing to their three children, who were born in the UK. ""It is totally un-British to do that, so I hope that would never happen,"" he added. Mr Johnson said: ""If you are the leader of a great, multi-racial, multi-cultural society, you simply cannot use that kind of language about sending people back to where they came from. ""That went out decades and decades ago and thank heavens for that."" He alsoechoed comments made by outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May, who earlier called the tweets ""completely unacceptable"". Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (left), Rashida Tlaib (centre) and Ayanna Pressley (right) accused the president of racism But asked by The Sun's political editor, Tom Newton-Dunn, if they thought the comments were racist, neither candidate would say. Mr Hunt said: ""Look, I'm foreign secretary, this is a president of a country which happens to be our closest ally, and so it is not going to help the situation to use that kind of language about the president of the United States. ""I can understand how many people in this country would want politicians like me to use those words and would feel that sentiment, but...I hope I have made absolutely clear how totally offensive it is to me that people are still saying that kind of thing."" Mr Johnson said: ""I simply can't understand how a leader of that country can come to say it."" Pressed again, he added: ""You can take from what I said what I think about President Trump's words."" This video can not be played President Trump defends racially charged tweets The candidates were also questioned about the possibility of a future trade deal with the US. Mr Hunt said whenever he had met with the US president and his administration, they had ""stressed how enthusiastic"" they were to do a deal. But he admitted that Mr Trump would be a ""very tough and crude"" negotiator. Mr Johnson agreed, calling the administration ""ruthless"" and saying the country would put ""tough conditions"" on any agreement with the UK.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt hopes to find way to save the Iran nuclear deal Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was a ""small window"" to save the Iran nuclear deal, as he launched a fresh bid to ease tensions in the Gulf. Mr Hunt has been meeting EU foreign ministers to raise concerns about Iran breaching some of its commitments. The deal, which involves Iran limiting nuclear activities in return for the easing of economic sanctions, is under pressure after the US withdrew in 2018. The summit comes amid heightened tensions between the UK and Iran. The UK seized an Iranian oil tanker earlier this month and, in response, Iranthreatened to detain a British oil tanker. However, Mr Hunt said on Saturday the tanker, Grace 1,could be released if the UK is guaranteed the oil it was carrying is not bound for Syria. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Watch: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal French-Iranian academic 'arrested in Iran' Speaking on his way into the meeting in Brussels, Mr Hunt said the Iran nuclear deal was not dead ""yet"", but he warned that if Iran acquired nuclear weapons it would become ""a very, very toxic and dangerous situation"". He added: ""Iran is still a good year away from developing a nuclear weapon. We think there is still a closing, but small, window to keep the deal alive."" Mr Hunt said he would work with the European partners of the deal - France and Germany - to find a way to ""preserve"" the agreement. Allow Twitter content?

In a joint statement,externalissued ahead of the meeting, Britain, France and Germany reiterated their support for the deal. But they said they were ""deeply troubled"" by recent events in the Gulf and ""concerned"" over US-Iran relations. The statement added that all stakeholders should ""pause and consider the possible consequences of their actions"". Earlier this month Iran said it would bebreaching the deal by breaking a limit set on uranium enrichment. Even if Iran does not actually build a nuclear warhead, it only has to reach the point at which it COULD produce one for its nervous neighbours to decide this is too much of a risk. They will want their own one too - as a deterrent. Statements from Saudi Arabia, Iran's Middle East rival, have made it clear the country would not accept a nuclear-armed Iran. So then, as stated by diplomats in Brussels, we are into a nuclear arms race. What does that mean in practice? In all probability Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt would all want to become nuclear weapons powers, with the potential to obliterate entire cities. This would be in a part of the world that has seen almost continuous conflict in places for the last 71 years. Finally, there is the risk that should Iran ever go nuclear some fear it could pass on a warhead to a non-state militia like Hezbollah. This is why the Iran nuclear deal matters, even if you don't live anywhere near the Gulf. In 2015, Iran signed up to a long-term deal - called theJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action,external- after the international community expressed concerns they were trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran, which insisted its nuclear programme was entirely peaceful, agreed to limit some nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors. This video can not be played Inside Iran: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal In return, the other signatories - UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - agreed to lift some of the crippling economic sanctions placed on Iran. Speaking ahead of Monday's meeting, Mr Hunt said: ""The Middle East is already one of the most unstable regions in the world, but if the different parties were armed with nuclear weapons it would represent an existential threat to mankind."" Iran nuclear deal: Key details In 2018, Donald Trump saidhe would unilaterally withdraw the US from the agreementwhich was signed under the Barack Obama administration. The other parties criticised Mr Trump's decision and said they remained committed to the deal. This video can not be played What's behind the rising tensions between the US and Iran? The Mail on Sundaypublished a leaked memo from the UK's ambassador in Washington which said Mr Trump abandoned the nuclear dealto spite Mr Obama. Earlier this month, the International Atomic Energy Agencyconfirmed that Iran had breached the deal's capon stockpiling of low-enriched uranium. Why do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter? Iran said it was responding to sanctions reinstated by the US after Mr Trump abandoned the deal. Last week it confirmed itwill break another of the limitsimposed by the deal. Deputy foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said Iran still wanted to salvage the deal but blamed European countries for failing to live up to their own commitments. Tensions between the UK and Iran flared up earlier this month when Royal Marines seized an Iranian tanker which was suspected of breaking EU sanctions. The UK suspected Grace 1, detained on 4 July near Gibraltar, was carrying oil bound for Syria. Iran denied it was headed for Syria and claimed the seizure of the ship was ""piracy"". The oil tanker was suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria In a phone call with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday,Mr Hunt sought to reassure his counterpartthat the detainment ""was nothing to do with the oil being Iranian"". Mr Zarif also wanted to resolve the issue and was ""not seeking to escalate"" the situation, Mr Hunt said. In response to the seizure, Iranthreatened to seize a British oil tanker. On 9 July, the UKraised the threat to British shipping in Iranian waters in the Gulf to ""critical""- the highest level. A day later, Iranian boats attempted to impede a British oil tanker in the region, before being warned off by a Royal Navy ship, according to the MoD. Iran denied any attempted seizure, with Mr Zarif quoted as saying the UK made the claims ""for creating tension"". Analysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins Britain, France and Germany have made a strongly worded intervention to try to prevent the crisis in relations with Iran deteriorating into something far worse: armed conflict. The focus of their joint statement is on the need to try to preserve the 2015 nuclear deal which President Trump abandoned in favour of increasing sanctions against Iran. It's a deal which Iran now says it is breaching because it is not delivering the promised economic benefits. But Theresa May, Emanuel Macron and Angela Merkel have said they are concerned by the risk that the nuclear agreement ""further unravels"" under the strain of US sanctions and Iran's decision to no longer implement key parts of the deal. They went on to urge all countries ""to pause and consider the possible consequences of their actions."" That's likely to infuriate the White House, seeming to equate aspects of United States hard-line policies with those of Iran.

"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (left), Rashida Tlaib (centre) and Ayanna Pressley (right) UK Prime Minister Theresa May has criticised US President Donald Trump for calling on several Democratic congresswomen of colour to ""go back"". The outgoing PM called Mr Trump's words ""completely unacceptable"", according to her spokesperson. Mr Trump said the women ""originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe"". He was referring to four congresswomen - three who were born in the US and one who came as a child refugee. His remarks were widely condemned as racist, and as having gone beyond previous statements and actions by the president that drew allegations of racism. Prospective Democratic presidential candidates denounced Mr Trump's tweets as racist and divisive. Republican Party representatives largely kept quiet. Times when Americans were told to 'go home' Despite the criticism, President Trump launched another Twitter tirade on Monday morning, calling on the women themselves to apologise. The women - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley, and Ilhan Omar, who came to the US as a refugee aged 12 - all called the president racist and were backed by members of the Democratic Party. Ms Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx in New York, approximately 12 miles away from the Queens hospital where Mr Trump was born. Mrs May resigned as leader of the UK's governing Conservative Party in June after being unable to get a Brexit deal through parliament. Two candidates are currently vying to replace her as prime minister. In Sunday's three-tweet thread, Mr Trumpaccused the congresswomen of ""viciously"" criticising him and the US,external. The president did not explicitly name the women, but the context - and references to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - made a clear link. He said Ms Pelosi would happily organise for them to leave the country. A week ago, Ms Pelosi clashed with the four women - sometimes nicknamed ""the squad"" - but she has since come to their defence following his tweets. The president wrote: ""So interesting to see 'progressive' Democrat congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Trump scrapped Iran deal 'to spite Obama' The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Trump retreats on census citizenship question ""Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done. ""These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!"" President Trump has been accused of racism and white nationalism There have been internal feuds among Democrats over a border funding package, with Ms Pelosi arguing in favour of the package, and the four women - all newcomers to Congress with a progressive agenda - voting against. Last week, Ms Ocasio-Cortez accused Ms Pelosi of singling out these women of colour for criticism. On Monday,Mr Trump lashed out again in two tweets,external. ""When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologise to our country, the people of Israel and even to the office of the President, for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them and their horrible and disgusting actions,"" he said. ""If Democrats want to unite around the foul language and racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular and unrepresentative Congresswomen, it will be interesting to see how it plays out. I can tell you that they have made Israel feel abandoned by the US."" Mr Trump was referring to a prior row with Ms Omar, who has faced accusations of anti-Semitism over comments she made about Israel and pro-Israel lobbyists earlier this year. Ms Tlaib, the other Muslim serving in Congress, has also had to defend herself from calls of anti-Semitism from Republicans after she discussed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on a Yahoo News Podcast in May. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signalled his dislike of Mr Trump's comments, saying on Monday: ""That is not how we do things in Canada."" ""I think Canadians and indeed people around the world know exactly what I think about those particular comments,"" he said, adding: ""A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian"". Ms Pelosi quoted Mr Trump's tweets and described them as ""xenophobic"". ""When @realDonaldTrump tells four American congresswomen to go back to their countries, he reaffirms his plan to 'Make America Great Again' has always been about making America white again. Our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power,"" she wrote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Friday, Ms Ocasio-Cortez, Ms Tlaib and Ms Pressley testified to a House committee about conditions in a migrant detention centre they had visited.

Mr Trump has been accused of racism before in connection with different incidents. For years, he made false claims that former President Barack Obama was not born in the US - propagating the racist ""birther"" conspiracy. He has also made numerous slurs against Central American migrants, calling them criminals and rapists. In 2018, he faced criticism from both Democrats and Republicans after reports said that during a meeting at the White House he called African nations ""shitholes"".

"Used cooking oil from Asia is being imported into Europe to make biodiesel Imports of a ""green fuel"" source may be inadvertently increasing deforestation and the demand for new palm oil, a study says. Experts say there has been a recent boom in the amount of used cooking oil imported into the UK from Asia. This waste oil is the basis for biodiesel, which produces far less CO2 than fossil fuels in cars. Butthis report,externalis concerned that the used oil is being replaced across Asia with palm oil from deforested areas. One woman's fight to save rainforest Coffee waste 'could replace palm oil' How sustainable is supermarket palm oil? Cutting carbon emissions from transport has proved very difficult for governments all over the world. Many have given incentives to speed up the replacement of fossil-based petrol and diesel with fuels made from crops such as soya or rapeseed. These growing plants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and so liquid fuel made from these sources, while not carbon-neutral, is a big improvement on simply burning regular petrol or diesel. In this light, used cooking (UCO) oil has become a key ingredient of biodiesel in the UK and the rest of Europe. Between 2011 and 2016 there was a 360% increase in use of used cooking oil as the basis for biodiesel. Because UCO is classed as a waste product within the EU, UK fuel producers are given double carbon credits for using it in their fuels. This has sparked a boom in demand for used cooking oil that is so great it is being met in part with imports from Asia. In the UK, the most common feedstock source of biodiesel between April and December 2018 was Chinese UCO, totalling 93 million litres. In the same period, used cooking oil from UK sources was used to produce 76 million litres of of fuel. Now a new study, from international bioeconomy consultants NNFCC, suggests that these imports may inadvertently be making climate change worse by increasing deforestation and the demand for palm oil. The problem arises because used cooking oil in some parts of Asia is not classed as a waste product and is considered safe for consumption by animals. The report's authors are concerned that since it is more profitable to sell Asian UCO to Europe for fuel rather than feed it to animals, it is likely being replaced by virgin palm oil which is cheaper to buy. ""Although correlation does not necessarily equate to causation, the available evidence indicates that palm oil imports into China are increasing, in line with their increasing exports of used cooking oils,"" the report states. Between 2016 and 2018, palm oil imports into China rose by 1 million tonnes, an increase of more than 20%. ""As soon as that point is reached where you can sell used cooking oil for more than you can buy palm oil, it's a no brainer,"" said Dr Jeremy Tomkinson who co-authored the report forNNFCC,external. ""What you are going to do if you're in Asia, you're going to sell as much UCO as you can to the EU and buy palm oil and pocket the difference."" Demand for palm oil has led to large-scale deforestation and the loss of natural habitats across Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Between 2010 and 2015, Indonesia alone lost 3 million hectares of forest to continued expansion of palm oil cultivation. Each hectare of forest that's converted to palm oil releases large amounts of carbon dioxide, equivalent to 530 people flying economy class from Geneva to New Yorkaccording to a recent study,external. Most of the used cooking oil that's already imported is made from palm. But it's the extra demand from Europe, say the authors, that is likely to be fuelling deforestation. ""It's irrelevant if the virgin palm is going into the biodiesel or into the animals,"" said Dr Tomkinson. ""If we weren't pulling that resource out of the market, no new resource would be falling into it."" The UK government rejects the idea that imports are increasing demand for palm oil. The Department for Transport says that there is no evidence showing a causative link between policies on waste-derived biofuels and increased use of virgin oils. The department argues that they have worked hard to ensure that such indirect effects do not happen. ""Biofuels are a key way of achieving the emission reductions the UK needs and we have long been at the forefront of action to address the indirect effects of their production, including pushing the EU to address the impact of land use change,"" a spokesperson said. ""Last year alone biofuels reduced CO2 emissions by 2.7 million tonnes - the equivalent of taking around 1.2 million cars off the road."" One of the key elements that's making used cooking oil so valuable is the fact that producers in the EU are given double the number of carbon credits for using the waste material. While the EU allows all countries to ""double count"" carbon credits for UCO, the UK is one of the few countries to put this into practice. Palm oil imports into China have boomed in the past two years Oil importers say the ""double counting"" is vital in preventing even more palm oil from entering the European market. ""Biodiesel made from waste oil is more expensive to produce; it has higher production costs,"" said Angel Alvarez Alberdi from the European Waste-to-Advanced Biofuels Association. ""If we don't have a policy incentive of double counting then under normal market conditions you will have the cheapest available option and that is conventional palm based biodiesel that would still be able to reach the EU."" However, the report authors say that the policy has other dangers, not just because it may be driving up demand for palm oil in Asia but because it may also be stymieing development among other alternative fuel producers, such as ethanol in the UK. The authors want the government to review the practice and perhaps end the double credit for imported oil Palm oil has been linked to increased deforestation in parts of Indonesia ""If it comes from outside of the EU don't let it double count unless you put in increased levels of scrutiny to verify it's not having an impact on land use,"" said Dr Tomkinson from NNFCC. ""If you don't do that then you only get a single credit for that used cooking oil."" Environmental groups are also concerned about the potential impact that UK and EU imports of UCO are having. ""Making biodiesel from imported UCO is no longer the environmental good it was once perceived to be,"" said Greg Archer, UK director of the environmental group Transport and Environment. ""There are real concerns some of these oils may not be genuinely 'used' or they may be indirectly causing deforestation. Governments need to scrutinise the source of UCO far more closely and require organisations certifying biofuel feedstocks to undertake far more rigorous and extensive checks.""

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt hopes to find way to save the Iran nuclear deal Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was a ""small window"" to save the Iran nuclear deal, as he launched a fresh bid to ease tensions in the Gulf. Mr Hunt has been meeting EU foreign ministers to raise concerns about Iran breaching some of its commitments. The deal, which involves Iran limiting nuclear activities in return for the easing of economic sanctions, is under pressure after the US withdrew in 2018. The summit comes amid heightened tensions between the UK and Iran. The UK seized an Iranian oil tanker earlier this month and, in response, Iranthreatened to detain a British oil tanker. However, Mr Hunt said on Saturday the tanker, Grace 1,could be released if the UK is guaranteed the oil it was carrying is not bound for Syria. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Watch: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal French-Iranian academic 'arrested in Iran' Speaking on his way into the meeting in Brussels, Mr Hunt said the Iran nuclear deal was not dead ""yet"", but he warned that if Iran acquired nuclear weapons it would become ""a very, very toxic and dangerous situation"". He added: ""Iran is still a good year away from developing a nuclear weapon. We think there is still a closing, but small, window to keep the deal alive."" Mr Hunt said he would work with the European partners of the deal - France and Germany - to find a way to ""preserve"" the agreement. Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. In a joint statement,externalissued ahead of the meeting, Britain, France and Germany reiterated their support for the deal. But they said they were ""deeply troubled"" by recent events in the Gulf and ""concerned"" over US-Iran relations. The statement added that all stakeholders should ""pause and consider the possible consequences of their actions"". Earlier this month Iran said it would bebreaching the deal by breaking a limit set on uranium enrichment. Even if Iran does not actually build a nuclear warhead, it only has to reach the point at which it COULD produce one for its nervous neighbours to decide this is too much of a risk. They will want their own one too - as a deterrent. Statements from Saudi Arabia, Iran's Middle East rival, have made it clear the country would not accept a nuclear-armed Iran. So then, as stated by diplomats in Brussels, we are into a nuclear arms race. What does that mean in practice? In all probability Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt would all want to become nuclear weapons powers, with the potential to obliterate entire cities. This would be in a part of the world that has seen almost continuous conflict in places for the last 71 years. Finally, there is the risk that should Iran ever go nuclear some fear it could pass on a warhead to a non-state militia like Hezbollah. This is why the Iran nuclear deal matters, even if you don't live anywhere near the Gulf. In 2015, Iran signed up to a long-term deal - called theJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action,external- after the international community expressed concerns they were trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran, which insisted its nuclear programme was entirely peaceful, agreed to limit some nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors. This video can not be played Inside Iran: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal In return, the other signatories - UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - agreed to lift some of the crippling economic sanctions placed on Iran. Speaking ahead of Monday's meeting, Mr Hunt said: ""The Middle East is already one of the most unstable regions in the world, but if the different parties were armed with nuclear weapons it would represent an existential threat to mankind."" Iran nuclear deal: Key details In 2018, Donald Trump saidhe would unilaterally withdraw the US from the agreementwhich was signed under the Barack Obama administration. The other parties criticised Mr Trump's decision and said they remained committed to the deal. This video can not be played What's behind the rising tensions between the US and Iran? The Mail on Sundaypublished a leaked memo from the UK's ambassador in Washington which said Mr Trump abandoned the nuclear dealto spite Mr Obama. Earlier this month, the International Atomic Energy Agencyconfirmed that Iran had breached the deal's capon stockpiling of low-enriched uranium. Why do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter? Iran said it was responding to sanctions reinstated by the US after Mr Trump abandoned the deal. Last week it confirmed itwill break another of the limitsimposed by the deal. Deputy foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said Iran still wanted to salvage the deal but blamed European countries for failing to live up to their own commitments. Tensions between the UK and Iran flared up earlier this month when Royal Marines seized an Iranian tanker which was suspected of breaking EU sanctions. The UK suspected Grace 1, detained on 4 July near Gibraltar, was carrying oil bound for Syria. Iran denied it was headed for Syria and claimed the seizure of the ship was ""piracy"". The oil tanker was suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria In a phone call with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday,Mr Hunt sought to reassure his counterpartthat the detainment ""was nothing to do with the oil being Iranian"". Mr Zarif also wanted to resolve the issue and was ""not seeking to escalate"" the situation, Mr Hunt said. In response to the seizure, Iranthreatened to seize a British oil tanker. On 9 July, the UKraised the threat to British shipping in Iranian waters in the Gulf to ""critical""- the highest level. A day later, Iranian boats attempted to impede a British oil tanker in the region, before being warned off by a Royal Navy ship, according to the MoD. Iran denied any attempted seizure, with Mr Zarif quoted as saying the UK made the claims ""for creating tension"". Analysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins Britain, France and Germany have made a strongly worded intervention to try to prevent the crisis in relations with Iran deteriorating into something far worse: armed conflict. The focus of their joint statement is on the need to try to preserve the 2015 nuclear deal which President Trump abandoned in favour of increasing sanctions against Iran. It's a deal which Iran now says it is breaching because it is not delivering the promised economic benefits. But Theresa May, Emanuel Macron and Angela Merkel have said they are concerned by the risk that the nuclear agreement ""further unravels"" under the strain of US sanctions and Iran's decision to no longer implement key parts of the deal. They went on to urge all countries ""to pause and consider the possible consequences of their actions."" That's likely to infuriate the White House, seeming to equate aspects of United States hard-line policies with those of Iran.

"The system is supposed to force websites to verify the age of UK users Digital Minister Margot James has apologised for the six-month delay on the so-called ""porn block"", which had been due to take effect on Monday. It is designed to force pornography websites to verify users are over 18. But the law has been delayed twice- most recently because the UK government failed to properly notify European regulators. ""I'm extremely sorry that there has been a delay,"" Ms James told the BBC. ""I know it sounds incompetent."" She added: ""Mistakes do happen, and I'm terribly sorry that it happened in such an important area,"" Under the proposed rules, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) would supervise the compulsory age checks. Websites which fail to comply would be blocked by internet service providers. Only websites where more than a third of content is pornographic are covered - which excludes social media sites.

"Abortion and same-sex marriage votes made headlines last week History will probably mark last week as a game-changing political moment in Northern Ireland. If the Stormont assembly is not restored by 21 October, same-sex marriage is set to be legalised and abortion laws liberalised. Rarely do devolved issues make it on to the House of Commons floor for debate. Even rarer do devolved issues get an overwhelming backing from MPs during votes. Gay marriage vote for NI 'breaches devolution' What does vote on Northern Ireland bill mean? But two-and-a-half-years since the government at Stormont collapsed, are the tectonic plates of Northern Ireland politics now shifting? The move by Labour MPs Conor McGinn and Stella Creasy to take two divisive, devolved matters and put them into Westminster's hands has received its fair share of praise and criticism. There is a sense from many MPs that on social issues they would like Northern Ireland's laws brought into line with the rest of the UK - and have a duty to act in the absence of Stormont. But others attacked the decision to tack on the amendments to the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation and Exercise of Functions) Bill, as its main purpose is to keep public services running and delay another assembly election. This video can not be played The DUP's Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Sinn FÃ©in's Conor Murphy have opposing views on the Westminster move Whichever view you hold, there is no doubt it has paved the way for Parliament possibly taking on other issues for Northern Ireland in the absence of Stormont. The bill is continuing its fast-track journey through the House of Lords. England and Wales legalised same-sex marriage inJuly 2013, with the change coming into force inMarch 2014 Scotland legislated for same-sex marriage inFebruary 2014and it came into effect inDecember that year The Republic of Ireland legalised same-sex marriage in a referendum inMay 2015, becoming the only country in the world to do so by popular vote Ireland's first same-sex marriagetook place in November 2015 It will be debated again on Monday afternoon, when we might see the return of attempts by some pro-Remain peers to halt a no-deal Brexit. Peers from Northern Ireland have also had their own take on the legislation, such as former Ulster Unionist leader Lord Trimble, who surprised some when he revealed his daughter had married her girlfriend during the debate in the Lords on Wednesday. ""I have found myself taking a particular position with regard to same-sex marriage, which was forced upon me when my elder daughter got married to her girlfriend,"" he said. ""I cannot change that, and I cannot now go around saying that I am opposed to it because I acquiesced to it. There we are."" Lord Trimble had voted against the Civil Partnerships Bill in 2004 and in previous years the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) was opposed to same-sex marriage. Although in the last Stormont mandate, the UUP gave their members a free vote on both it and abortion. It is just one example of how some might argue there is a shift happening. Lord Trimble had voted against the Civil Partnerships Bill in 2004 When it comes to the amendment on abortion law in Northern Ireland, however, things are less clear cut. Campaigners who advocate for abortion law coming into line with the rest of the UK say it is about giving women a choice, while those opposed argue it is unfair for Westminster to legislate over the heads of voters in Northern Ireland. On Sunday,a letter jointly written by Baroness Nuala O'Loan and Church of Ireland Archbishop Lord Eameswas handed out at Catholic church services, describing the move to liberalise abortion laws as treating the ""people of Northern Ireland with contempt"". Northern Ireland's attorney general John Larkin intervened in the debate last week and saidthe amendment passed by MPs had not been ""drafted clearly or consistently"" with human rights laws,external. It should be pointed out Parliament has voted on other matters for Northern Ireland since devolution collapsed in January 2017. MPs have had to approve two budgets, while legislation to reduce payments to claimants of a flawed green energy scheme, known as the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI),had to be fast-tracked through Parliament as well. But the events of the past seven days seem bigger than that. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks at the history of Northern Ireland's same-sex marriage debate Some people have being asking: ""What is the point of having devolved government when Westminster can legislate on behalf of people in Northern Ireland?"" The argument is that if decisions are at least being taken somewhere it's better than holding on to hope for progress at Stormont. There are calls for MPs to take action on other stalled matters for Northern Ireland. The next piece of legislation we might see coming to the Commons would allow the government to proceed with compensation for victims of Historical Institutional Abuse (HIA) -although that is unlikely to go before MPs until the autumn. This video can not be played The law on abortion in Northern Ireland explained Few expect talks at Stormont aimed at restoring devolution to lead to a breakthrough before the end of October, given the potentially huge law changes waiting in the wings. After decades of campaigning, some will welcome the move. Others will worry that, in these rapidly changing times, Stormont has become more irrelevant than ever.

"This video can not be played Some of the protesters have glued themselves around the boat Climate protesters have blocked a key city centre road in Cardiff, with commuters warned to expect disruption. A number of members of Extinction Rebellion are outside Cardiff Castle and have parked a green boat in the middle of the street. The group want to raise awareness about climate change but there have been calls for them to end the protest. Motorists have been warned to avoid the city centre as police expect disruption to last into the evening on Monday. Cardiff Bus said it experienced severe delays to services and commuters also faced delays during the morning rush hour. Police have closed the road to vehicles from the junction with Queen Street to Westgate Street. A boat has been placed in the middle of the busy road Cardiff is one of ""five centres of disruption"" planned by the group, with others due to take place in Leeds, Glasgow, London and Bristol during the ""five-day national campaign"" of protests.

"This video can not be played 'No woman should be locked up in a pen' US officials are investigating a secret Facebook group where border patrol members allegedly posted racist and sexist jokes about migrants and others. The private group had about 9,500 members, including former and current border patrol agents,ProPublica reported,external. Some posts mocked migrant deaths, while others targeted Latino members of Congress, ProPublica said. The Border Patrol chief has called the posts ""completely inappropriate"". ""Any employees found to have violated our standards of conduct will be held accountable,"" Carla Provost said. 'I left without telling my mum' The agony over an American dream The group was called ""I'm 10-15"", ProPublica said - 10-15 being Border Patrol code for ""aliens in custody"". According to ProPublica, members of the group mocked Latino members of Congress who visited migrant detention centres in Texas on Monday. Democrats Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Veronica Escobar were among those said to have been called ""hoes"" and ""scum buckets"" in the private postings. In one post, a member reportedly suggested throwing burritos at them, while another shared a doctored image depicting Ms Ocasio-Cortez performing a sex act on President Donald Trump. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus were heckled as they visited detention facilities The BBC was not able to independently verify the existence of the private group, which is not publicly accessible on Facebook. Matthew Klein, an assistant commissioner at the CBP, said the Department of Homeland Security had launched a code-of-conduct investigation into the group. He said a number of CBP agents may be members of the group. Ms Ocasio-Cortez said the posts did not surprise her, and that they were ""indicative"" of what she had seen while visiting the migrant detention centre on Monday. ""I see why CBP officers were being so physically and sexually threatening towards me,"" she tweeted after the trip. On Twitter, Ms Ocasio-Cortez said that border patrol officers had told women in cells to ""drink out of the toilets"". She added that during the visit, she ""forced"" herself into a cramped cell where the women inside ""described their treatment at the hands of officers as 'psychological warfare'"".

Senator Cory Booker, a Democratic presidential candidate, said on Tuesday that he was introducing a plan to ""virtually eliminate migrant detention"". He called the facilities ""for-profit prison that should not exist"", and said that as president, he would improve the facilities and close any that do not meet his standard. Since taking office in 2017, President Trump had adopted tougher policies in an attempt to reduce the number of undocumented migrants. But officials say his administration's crackdown, and the recent increase in Central American migrant arrivals, has led to a strain on enforcement resources.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt hopes to find way to save the Iran nuclear deal Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was a ""small window"" to save the Iran nuclear deal, as he launched a fresh bid to ease tensions in the Gulf. Mr Hunt has been meeting EU foreign ministers to raise concerns about Iran breaching some of its commitments. The deal, which involves Iran limiting nuclear activities in return for the easing of economic sanctions, is under pressure after the US withdrew in 2018. The summit comes amid heightened tensions between the UK and Iran. The UK seized an Iranian oil tanker earlier this month and, in response, Iranthreatened to detain a British oil tanker. However, Mr Hunt said on Saturday the tanker, Grace 1,could be released if the UK is guaranteed the oil it was carrying is not bound for Syria. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Watch: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal French-Iranian academic 'arrested in Iran' Speaking on his way into the meeting in Brussels, Mr Hunt said the Iran nuclear deal was not dead ""yet"", but he warned that if Iran acquired nuclear weapons it would become ""a very, very toxic and dangerous situation"". He added: ""Iran is still a good year away from developing a nuclear weapon. We think there is still a closing, but small, window to keep the deal alive."" Mr Hunt said he would work with the European partners of the deal - France and Germany - to find a way to ""preserve"" the agreement. Allow Twitter content?

In a joint statement,externalissued ahead of the meeting, Britain, France and Germany reiterated their support for the deal. But they said they were ""deeply troubled"" by recent events in the Gulf and ""concerned"" over US-Iran relations. The statement added that all stakeholders should ""pause and consider the possible consequences of their actions"". Earlier this month Iran said it would bebreaching the deal by breaking a limit set on uranium enrichment. Even if Iran does not actually build a nuclear warhead, it only has to reach the point at which it COULD produce one for its nervous neighbours to decide this is too much of a risk. They will want their own one too - as a deterrent. Statements from Saudi Arabia, Iran's Middle East rival, have made it clear the country would not accept a nuclear-armed Iran. So then, as stated by diplomats in Brussels, we are into a nuclear arms race. What does that mean in practice? In all probability Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt would all want to become nuclear weapons powers, with the potential to obliterate entire cities. This would be in a part of the world that has seen almost continuous conflict in places for the last 71 years. Finally, there is the risk that should Iran ever go nuclear some fear it could pass on a warhead to a non-state militia like Hezbollah. This is why the Iran nuclear deal matters, even if you don't live anywhere near the Gulf. In 2015, Iran signed up to a long-term deal - called theJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action,external- after the international community expressed concerns they were trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran, which insisted its nuclear programme was entirely peaceful, agreed to limit some nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors. This video can not be played Inside Iran: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal In return, the other signatories - UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - agreed to lift some of the crippling economic sanctions placed on Iran. Speaking ahead of Monday's meeting, Mr Hunt said: ""The Middle East is already one of the most unstable regions in the world, but if the different parties were armed with nuclear weapons it would represent an existential threat to mankind."" Iran nuclear deal: Key details In 2018, Donald Trump saidhe would unilaterally withdraw the US from the agreementwhich was signed under the Barack Obama administration. The other parties criticised Mr Trump's decision and said they remained committed to the deal. This video can not be played What's behind the rising tensions between the US and Iran? The Mail on Sundaypublished a leaked memo from the UK's ambassador in Washington which said Mr Trump abandoned the nuclear dealto spite Mr Obama. Earlier this month, the International Atomic Energy Agencyconfirmed that Iran had breached the deal's capon stockpiling of low-enriched uranium. Why do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter? Iran said it was responding to sanctions reinstated by the US after Mr Trump abandoned the deal. Last week it confirmed itwill break another of the limitsimposed by the deal. Deputy foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said Iran still wanted to salvage the deal but blamed European countries for failing to live up to their own commitments. Tensions between the UK and Iran flared up earlier this month when Royal Marines seized an Iranian tanker which was suspected of breaking EU sanctions. The UK suspected Grace 1, detained on 4 July near Gibraltar, was carrying oil bound for Syria. Iran denied it was headed for Syria and claimed the seizure of the ship was ""piracy"". The oil tanker was suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria In a phone call with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday,Mr Hunt sought to reassure his counterpartthat the detainment ""was nothing to do with the oil being Iranian"". Mr Zarif also wanted to resolve the issue and was ""not seeking to escalate"" the situation, Mr Hunt said. In response to the seizure, Iranthreatened to seize a British oil tanker. On 9 July, the UKraised the threat to British shipping in Iranian waters in the Gulf to ""critical""- the highest level. A day later, Iranian boats attempted to impede a British oil tanker in the region, before being warned off by a Royal Navy ship, according to the MoD. Iran denied any attempted seizure, with Mr Zarif quoted as saying the UK made the claims ""for creating tension"". Analysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins Britain, France and Germany have made a strongly worded intervention to try to prevent the crisis in relations with Iran deteriorating into something far worse: armed conflict. The focus of their joint statement is on the need to try to preserve the 2015 nuclear deal which President Trump abandoned in favour of increasing sanctions against Iran. It's a deal which Iran now says it is breaching because it is not delivering the promised economic benefits. But Theresa May, Emanuel Macron and Angela Merkel have said they are concerned by the risk that the nuclear agreement ""further unravels"" under the strain of US sanctions and Iran's decision to no longer implement key parts of the deal. They went on to urge all countries ""to pause and consider the possible consequences of their actions."" That's likely to infuriate the White House, seeming to equate aspects of United States hard-line policies with those of Iran.

"This video can not be played Jacob Zuma: I have been vilified South Africa's former President Jacob Zuma has told a judge-led inquiry that allegations of corruption against him were a ""conspiracy"" aimed at removing him from the political scene. He was appearing for the first time at the inquiry, which is investigating allegations that he oversaw a web of corruption during his term in office. His supporters cheered when he entered the building. Mr Zuma, 77, was forced to resign as president in February 2018. He was replaced by his then deputy Cyril Ramaphosa, who promised to tackle corruption in South Africa. Mr Ramaphosa described Mr Zuma's nine years in office as ""wasted"". Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories Zuma, the Guptas, and the sale of South Africa Who are the Guptas? The allegations against Mr Zuma focus on his relationship with the controversial Gupta family, which was accused of influencing cabinet appointments and winning lucrative state tenders through corruption. He has also been accused of taking bribes from logistics firm Bosasa, run by the Watson family. They all deny allegations of wrongdoing. ""I have been vilified, alleged to be the king of corrupt people,"" Mr Zuma told the inquiry led by Judge Ray Zondo. ""I have been given every other name and I have never responded to those issues,"" he added. He lashed out, in detail - and with fury - at what he said was a decades-long conspiracy against him. He implied that the UK and US had been - and still were - part of an elaborate plot to discredit him, even as he tried to bring about political and economic change in South Africa. Some of Mr Zuma's supporters came to the inquiry dressed in military uniforms Mr Zuma alleged that former government minister Ngoako Ramatlhodi, who gave damning evidence against him, was part of the plot. Other foreign trained agents had tried to poison him, Mr Zuma said, without naming them. In an interview with South Africa's privately owned News24 website,Mr Ramatlhodi denied being a spy,external. He was prepared to undergo a lie detector test, and would challenge Mr Zuma to do likewise. On the eve of the hearing Mr Zuma was in a good mood. He tweeted a video of himself laughing at the chant ""Zuma must fall!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He said he found the Indian-born family ""very friendly"". ""I never did anything with them unlawfully. They just remained friends, as they were friends to everybody else,"" Mr Zuma said, adding that they had also been friends of  former presidents Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki. He objected to allegations that he had allowed the state to be ""captured"" by the family, and had auctioned the country. ""Did I auction Table Mountain? Did I auction Johannesburg?"" he said. One thing is clear from Mr Zuma's testimony so far - if he is to go down, he will not do so alone. He painted a picture of an alleged conspiracy dating back more than two decades to destroy him. ""I have been provoked,"" he said, as he threatened to name alleged spies who betrayed the struggle for the freedom of black people in South Africa, and who were allegedly still conspiring against him. Mr Zuma was once the intelligence chief of the African National National Congress (ANC), the former liberation movement which has been in power since the end of white minority rule in 1994. So if he honours his threat to tell all, it will send shockwaves across South Africa, and lead to bitter recriminations in the ANC. But once the dust settles, South Africans will still want to know whether he betrayed his oath of office after he became president in 2009 by being involved in corruption on a grand scale. That is what the commission is trying to find out - and Mr Zuma is in a fight for his political survival. Many of the revelations from the inquiry concern the relationship between two families - the Zumas, centred on the former president, and the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who moved to South Africa after the fall of apartheid. The two families became so closely linked that a joint term was coined for them - the ""Zuptas"". The Guptas owned a portfolio of companies that enjoyed lucrative contracts with South African government departments and state-owned conglomerates. They also employed several Zuma family members - including the president's son, Duduzane - in senior positions. According to testimony heard at the inquiry, the Guptas went to great lengths to influence their most important client, the South African state. Public officials responsible for various state bodies say they were directly instructed by the Guptas to take decisions that would advance the brothers' business interests. It is alleged that compliance was rewarded with money and promotion, while disobedience was punished with dismissal. Zuma, the Guptas, and the sale of South Africa Who are the Guptas?

"Representative Ilhan Omar is at the centre of the row about comments she made about 9/11 A Democratic congresswoman says she will not be silenced after facing a barrage of criticism over comments she made about the 9/11 attacks - including from Donald Trump. The US president tweeted ""WE WILL NEVER FORGET"",externalalongside a video showing footage of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks spliced with a speech by Representative Ilhan Omar. ""Some people did something,"" she is seen saying, in between footage of planes hitting the Twin Towers and people fleeing the buildings. Republicans have accused her of downplaying the attacks, but Democrats have largely rallied to her defence, saying she had been quoted out of context and some accusing Mr Trump of inciting violence against her and Muslims. Here is how the row developed. Ms Omar won a Minnesota seat in the House of Representatives last November, becoming one of the first two Muslim women ever elected to the US Congress. Her family originally came to the US as refugees from Somalia and she is the first congresswoman to wear the hijab. This video can not be played The women who made history in the mid-terms Despite being a newcomer to Washington, this is not the first time Ms Omar has made headlines. Who is US Congresswoman Ilhan Omar? 'I'm a Muslim who voted for Donald Trump' She has been accused of anti-Semitism over comments she made about Israel and pro-Israel lobbyists. After being rebuked last month, including by Democrats, she apologised and said she was ""listening and learning"". The congresswoman has also raised the alarm about anti-Muslim rhetoric surrounding her, in response to a Republican poster that showed her alongside the Twin Towers. Allow Twitter content?

Just last week, police arrested a 55-year-old man in New York state for allegedly calling her office with a graphic death threat in which he reportedly labelled her a ""terrorist"". The ""some people did something"" quote was from a speech Ms Omar gave to a civil rights group, the Council on American-Islamic Relations (Cair), on 23 March. In the 20-minute speech she discussed issues affecting the community like Islamophobia and the recent mosque attack in New Zealand. The comments in Mr Trump's video were taken from a point she made about the treatment of US Muslims in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks: ""Here's the truth. For far too long we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen and, frankly, I'm tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. Cair was founded after 9/11 because they recognized thatsome people did somethingand that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties."" After the Washington Post fact-checked the statement to clarify Cair was actually founded in 1994,external, a spokesman for Ms Omar told the paper that she misspoke and meant to say the organisation's size had doubled after the attacks. Her speech began getting attention on 9 April, whena clip was shared by Texas Republican Representative Dan Crenshaw,external, who described her phrasing as ""unbelievable"". Conservative media outlets, including Fox News, then started discussing it in-depth. Ronna McDaniel, chair of the Republican National Committee, described the congresswoman as ""anti-American"".

It is currently pinned to the top of his account and has been shared tens of thousands of times. Many social media users responded by using #IStandWithIlhan - which trended worldwide on Twitter on Friday. CNN showed the clip in discussions, but then presenter Chris Cuomo apologised for airing it. MSNBC host Joy Reid also refused to show it.

"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (left), Rashida Tlaib (centre) and Ayanna Pressley (right) UK Prime Minister Theresa May has criticised US President Donald Trump for calling on several Democratic congresswomen of colour to ""go back"". The outgoing PM called Mr Trump's words ""completely unacceptable"", according to her spokesperson. Mr Trump said the women ""originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe"". He was referring to four congresswomen - three who were born in the US and one who came as a child refugee. His remarks were widely condemned as racist, and as having gone beyond previous statements and actions by the president that drew allegations of racism. Prospective Democratic presidential candidates denounced Mr Trump's tweets as racist and divisive. Republican Party representatives largely kept quiet. Times when Americans were told to 'go home' Despite the criticism, President Trump launched another Twitter tirade on Monday morning, calling on the women themselves to apologise. The women - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley, and Ilhan Omar, who came to the US as a refugee aged 12 - all called the president racist and were backed by members of the Democratic Party. Ms Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx in New York, approximately 12 miles away from the Queens hospital where Mr Trump was born. Mrs May resigned as leader of the UK's governing Conservative Party in June after being unable to get a Brexit deal through parliament. Two candidates are currently vying to replace her as prime minister. In Sunday's three-tweet thread, Mr Trumpaccused the congresswomen of ""viciously"" criticising him and the US,external. The president did not explicitly name the women, but the context - and references to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - made a clear link. He said Ms Pelosi would happily organise for them to leave the country. A week ago, Ms Pelosi clashed with the four women - sometimes nicknamed ""the squad"" - but she has since come to their defence following his tweets. The president wrote: ""So interesting to see 'progressive' Democrat congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Trump scrapped Iran deal 'to spite Obama' The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Trump retreats on census citizenship question ""Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done. ""These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!"" President Trump has been accused of racism and white nationalism There have been internal feuds among Democrats over a border funding package, with Ms Pelosi arguing in favour of the package, and the four women - all newcomers to Congress with a progressive agenda - voting against. Last week, Ms Ocasio-Cortez accused Ms Pelosi of singling out these women of colour for criticism. On Monday,Mr Trump lashed out again in two tweets,external. ""When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologise to our country, the people of Israel and even to the office of the President, for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them and their horrible and disgusting actions,"" he said. ""If Democrats want to unite around the foul language and racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular and unrepresentative Congresswomen, it will be interesting to see how it plays out. I can tell you that they have made Israel feel abandoned by the US."" Mr Trump was referring to a prior row with Ms Omar, who has faced accusations of anti-Semitism over comments she made about Israel and pro-Israel lobbyists earlier this year. Ms Tlaib, the other Muslim serving in Congress, has also had to defend herself from calls of anti-Semitism from Republicans after she discussed the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on a Yahoo News Podcast in May. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau signalled his dislike of Mr Trump's comments, saying on Monday: ""That is not how we do things in Canada."" ""I think Canadians and indeed people around the world know exactly what I think about those particular comments,"" he said, adding: ""A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian"". Ms Pelosi quoted Mr Trump's tweets and described them as ""xenophobic"". ""When @realDonaldTrump tells four American congresswomen to go back to their countries, he reaffirms his plan to 'Make America Great Again' has always been about making America white again. Our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power,"" she wrote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Iran insists that it is not seeking to overturn the nuclear deal It has taken just a little over a year since the Trump administration abandoned the international nuclear deal with Iran, known as the JCPOA, for Tehran itself to challenge the agreement. Its decision to intentionally breach the 300kg ceiling for the stock of low-enriched uranium that it can hold is but the first step of several that it is threatening. However, Tehran insists it is not seeking to overturn the nuclear deal itself. It just wants to be treated fairly under its terms. Iran's case is that it has, all along, abided by the terms of the agreement. And Iran's ""good behaviour"" has been independently verified by the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But now Iran is saying enough is enough. It has stuck to its side of the bargain but the Americans have not only walked away from the deal, they have re-imposed sanctions and are trying to make it as difficult as possible for anyone to trade with Tehran. Iran nuclear breach tests world powers What would a US-Iran conflict look like? This policy of ""maximum pressure"" is acknowledged by the Trump administration. Its goal, its spokesmen insist, is to force Iran to the table to negotiate what in US terms would be a ""better"" deal. But Mr Trump's critics argue that what his administration wants is more capitulation rather than negotiation. There is a strong whiff of regime change about some of Mr Trump's key advisers. Iran - if you accept that it was behind recent attacks in the Gulf as the Americans insist - has already sought to push back against US pressure. It has many ways of doing so. And the fear is that the potential breakdown of the nuclear deal will not only encourage Iran to resume worrying nuclear activities, but it may also risk some kind of conflict in the Gulf, intentional or otherwise. So the stakes surrounding the nuclear deal are huge. And this is going to condition many countries' responses to what is happening. There are already differences between Washington and its key European allies - Britain, France and Germany - who remain strong supporters of the nuclear deal and want to see it continue. Certainly they worry about many of Iran's regional activities and they share the Trump administration's concerns about Iran's active missile programmes. But they believe that the JCPOA, whatever faults it may have had, contained one essential benefit. It took the nuclear issue out of the game at least for the immediate future. It ""kicked the can down the road"". It did not resolve the disputes over Iran's past activities or place permanent restrictions on what it could do in this field. But it averted a crisis. Remember, before the deal was agreed in 2015, there were real fears of a possible US or Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear infrastructure. Britain, France and Germany remain strong supporters of the nuclear deal So what happens now? Iran is making a point. It says that breaching the low-enriched uranium threshold is not in contravention of the JCPOA deal. Indeed its text, at Iran's insistence, does contain wording to the effect that if others breach the deal's terms then Iran will feel able to do the same. That of course may not be how the other signatories see things. They may argue you are either in the agreement or - like the United States - you choose to leave it. Iran's pressure tactic is intended to push the Europeans in particular to do more to relieve the US economic pressure that is building up. The EU has developed a special payments system - dubbed in Euro-speak  INSTEX - to try to help facilitate trade in humanitarian supplies, which in any case are not covered by the sanctions. Deals here have been made more difficult because of many banks' reluctance to risk US action. But INSTEX will not help with the key sectors of Iran's economy that are suffering the greatest pain, like the oil industry. Most independent experts say that INSTEX has been slow to get going and is unlikely to make a significant difference. It is largely about the Europeans sending diplomatic signals to Tehran. But this may no longer be enough. At the end of the day it is, after all, individual companies that must decide to trade with Iran, not governments And if they have business in the US they are going to be wary of trading with Tehran. Russia and China are also deeply uneasy about the US position and would prefer the nuclear deal to remain in place. So the US does not have many friends here beyond Saudi Arabia and Israel, which have their own issues with Tehran. President Hassan Rouhani stressed that Iran was not pulling out of the nuclear deal The next high stakes moment may come in just under a week when Iran is threatening to take further actions to breach the terms of the agreement. It has suggested that one of these might be to increase the level of enrichment from the current 3.67% to around 20%. This will be a much bigger drama. Uranium enrichment is all about stripping away atoms of one type of uranium to boost the concentration of another type, or isotope, which can power a nuclear chain reaction. If you take this enrichment to a 20% level you are in fact about 90% of the way to having material suitable for a bomb. There are many other things Iran could do to up the stakes but taking enrichment levels to 20% would send alarm bells around the world and would make it very difficult for the Europeans to keep supporting the nuclear deal. The JCPOA has long been described as being on life-support. So a serious shock to the system could sweep it away with uncertain consequences. That spark could come from the Iranians effectively overturning it themselves or it could come from the Middle East, where Iran or its proxy forces and the US military operate, sometimes in close proximity. The Syrian front too is a factor. Israel is engaged there in an air campaign against the Iranian military build-up in the country. There have been some unusually intense Israeli air attacks recently near Homs and Damascus. Anything that goes wrong, any increase in tension could feed back into the nuclear debate and vice-versa. Iran clearly believes the pressure can be relieved in some way. But it may be mistaken. President Trump is doing everything he can to ensure the JCPOA's demise. The Iran nuclear deal is facing its most fundamental challenge yet and what Iran does over the next week or so could well seal its fate.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt hopes to find way to save the Iran nuclear deal Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was a ""small window"" to save the Iran nuclear deal, as he launched a fresh bid to ease tensions in the Gulf. Mr Hunt has been meeting EU foreign ministers to raise concerns about Iran breaching some of its commitments. The deal, which involves Iran limiting nuclear activities in return for the easing of economic sanctions, is under pressure after the US withdrew in 2018. The summit comes amid heightened tensions between the UK and Iran. The UK seized an Iranian oil tanker earlier this month and, in response, Iranthreatened to detain a British oil tanker. However, Mr Hunt said on Saturday the tanker, Grace 1,could be released if the UK is guaranteed the oil it was carrying is not bound for Syria. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Watch: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal French-Iranian academic 'arrested in Iran' Speaking on his way into the meeting in Brussels, Mr Hunt said the Iran nuclear deal was not dead ""yet"", but he warned that if Iran acquired nuclear weapons it would become ""a very, very toxic and dangerous situation"". He added: ""Iran is still a good year away from developing a nuclear weapon. We think there is still a closing, but small, window to keep the deal alive."" Mr Hunt said he would work with the European partners of the deal - France and Germany - to find a way to ""preserve"" the agreement. Allow Twitter content?

In a joint statement,externalissued ahead of the meeting, Britain, France and Germany reiterated their support for the deal. But they said they were ""deeply troubled"" by recent events in the Gulf and ""concerned"" over US-Iran relations. The statement added that all stakeholders should ""pause and consider the possible consequences of their actions"". Earlier this month Iran said it would bebreaching the deal by breaking a limit set on uranium enrichment. Even if Iran does not actually build a nuclear warhead, it only has to reach the point at which it COULD produce one for its nervous neighbours to decide this is too much of a risk. They will want their own one too - as a deterrent. Statements from Saudi Arabia, Iran's Middle East rival, have made it clear the country would not accept a nuclear-armed Iran. So then, as stated by diplomats in Brussels, we are into a nuclear arms race. What does that mean in practice? In all probability Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt would all want to become nuclear weapons powers, with the potential to obliterate entire cities. This would be in a part of the world that has seen almost continuous conflict in places for the last 71 years. Finally, there is the risk that should Iran ever go nuclear some fear it could pass on a warhead to a non-state militia like Hezbollah. This is why the Iran nuclear deal matters, even if you don't live anywhere near the Gulf. In 2015, Iran signed up to a long-term deal - called theJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action,external- after the international community expressed concerns they were trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran, which insisted its nuclear programme was entirely peaceful, agreed to limit some nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors. This video can not be played Inside Iran: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal In return, the other signatories - UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - agreed to lift some of the crippling economic sanctions placed on Iran. Speaking ahead of Monday's meeting, Mr Hunt said: ""The Middle East is already one of the most unstable regions in the world, but if the different parties were armed with nuclear weapons it would represent an existential threat to mankind."" Iran nuclear deal: Key details In 2018, Donald Trump saidhe would unilaterally withdraw the US from the agreementwhich was signed under the Barack Obama administration. The other parties criticised Mr Trump's decision and said they remained committed to the deal. This video can not be played What's behind the rising tensions between the US and Iran? The Mail on Sundaypublished a leaked memo from the UK's ambassador in Washington which said Mr Trump abandoned the nuclear dealto spite Mr Obama. Earlier this month, the International Atomic Energy Agencyconfirmed that Iran had breached the deal's capon stockpiling of low-enriched uranium. Why do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter? Iran said it was responding to sanctions reinstated by the US after Mr Trump abandoned the deal. Last week it confirmed itwill break another of the limitsimposed by the deal. Deputy foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said Iran still wanted to salvage the deal but blamed European countries for failing to live up to their own commitments. Tensions between the UK and Iran flared up earlier this month when Royal Marines seized an Iranian tanker which was suspected of breaking EU sanctions. The UK suspected Grace 1, detained on 4 July near Gibraltar, was carrying oil bound for Syria. Iran denied it was headed for Syria and claimed the seizure of the ship was ""piracy"". The oil tanker was suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria In a phone call with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday,Mr Hunt sought to reassure his counterpartthat the detainment ""was nothing to do with the oil being Iranian"". Mr Zarif also wanted to resolve the issue and was ""not seeking to escalate"" the situation, Mr Hunt said. In response to the seizure, Iranthreatened to seize a British oil tanker. On 9 July, the UKraised the threat to British shipping in Iranian waters in the Gulf to ""critical""- the highest level. A day later, Iranian boats attempted to impede a British oil tanker in the region, before being warned off by a Royal Navy ship, according to the MoD. Iran denied any attempted seizure, with Mr Zarif quoted as saying the UK made the claims ""for creating tension"". Analysis by BBC diplomatic correspondent James Robbins Britain, France and Germany have made a strongly worded intervention to try to prevent the crisis in relations with Iran deteriorating into something far worse: armed conflict. The focus of their joint statement is on the need to try to preserve the 2015 nuclear deal which President Trump abandoned in favour of increasing sanctions against Iran. It's a deal which Iran now says it is breaching because it is not delivering the promised economic benefits. But Theresa May, Emanuel Macron and Angela Merkel have said they are concerned by the risk that the nuclear agreement ""further unravels"" under the strain of US sanctions and Iran's decision to no longer implement key parts of the deal. They went on to urge all countries ""to pause and consider the possible consequences of their actions."" That's likely to infuriate the White House, seeming to equate aspects of United States hard-line policies with those of Iran.

"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (left), Rashida Tlaib (centre) and Ayanna Pressley (right) US President Donald Trump has been accused of racism after posting tweets attacking Democratic congresswomen. He claimed the women ""originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe"", before suggesting they ""go back"". The tweet was directed at a group of four congresswomen of colour; three were born and raised in the US while the fourth moved to the US as a child. Republican Party representatives kept quiet amid a wave of criticism. The congresswomen - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley, and Ilhan Omar, who came to the US as a refugee aged 12 - have all called the president racist, and have been backed by members of the Democratic Party. Ms Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx in New York, approximately 12 miles away from the Queens hospital where Mr Trump was born. The British Prime Minister, Theresa May said President Trump's remarks were ""completely unacceptable"". In a three-tweet thread, Mr Trumpaccused the congresswomen of ""viciously"" criticising him and the US,external. The president did not explicitly name the women he was talking about, but the context - and references to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - made a clear link. He said Ms Pelosi would happily organise for them to leave the country. A week ago, Ms Pelosi clashed with the four women - sometimes nicknamed ""the squad"" - but she has since come to their defence following his tweets. The president wrote: ""So interesting to see 'progressive' Democrat congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Trump scrapped Iran deal 'to spite Obama' The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Trump retreats on census citizenship question ""Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done. ""These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!"" President Trump has been accused of racism and white nationalism There have been internal feuds among Democrats over a border funding package, with Ms Pelosi arguing in favour of the package, and the four women - all newcomers to Congress with a progressive agenda - voting against. Last week, Ms Ocasio-Cortez accused Ms Pelosi of singling out women of colour for criticism. Ms Pelosi quoted Mr Trump's tweets and described them as ""xenophobic"". ""When @realDonaldTrump tells four American congresswomen to go back to their countries, he reaffirms his plan to 'Make America Great Again' has always been about making America white again. Our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power,"" she wrote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump has tweeted since, further criticising ""people who speak so badly of our country"". Mr Trump did not specifically mention a link to recent news events, but immigration at the southern border was a dominant topic in US news at the weekend. On Friday, Ms Ocasio-Cortez, Ms Tlaib and Ms Pressley testified to a House committee about conditions in a migrant detention centre they had visited. They expressed horror about alleged mistreatment happening ""under American flags"". Ms Ocasio-Cortez said migrants told her they had drunk water from toilets because sinks were broken.

He said everyone was being ""well cared for"". The president tweeted that children's detention centres had had ""great reviews"" and the adult male areas were ""loaded up with a big percentage of criminals"". Mr Trump has been accused of racism many times in connection with different incidents. For years, he made false claims thatformer President Barack Obama was not born in the US- propagating the racist ""birther"" conspiracy. He has also made numerous slurs against Central American migrants, calling them criminals and rapists. In 2018, he faced criticism from both Democrats and Republicans after reports said that during a meeting at the White House he called African nations ""shitholes"".

"This video can not be played China's economic slowdown explained China's economy grew at its slowest pace since the early 1990s in the second quarter, official figures showed. In the three months to June, the economy grew 6.2% from a year earlier. The result was in line with forecasts. China has moved to stimulate its economy this year by boosting spending and delivering tax cuts. The country is also fighting a trade war with the US which has hurt businesses and weighed on growth. The data released on Monday showed China's economic growth rate slowedfrom 6.4% in the first three months of the year. US President Donald Trump tweeted that US trade tariffs were having ""a major effect"" on the Chinese economy. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

China's national statistics bureau said,externalthe figures pointed to a ""complex environment"" both at home and abroad. It said the economy had ""performed within the reasonable range"" in the first half of 2019, but that it faced ""new downward pressure"". Andrew Walker, business correspondent The figures do show some impact from the trade conflict with the US. Growth has probably slowed a little more than it would have done had China been facing a more tranquil international commercial environment. The longer-term picture, though, is one of an economy continuing a reasonably orderly and intended slowdown in growth. The average growth rate over the three decades to 2010 was 10%. The Chinese leadership - and every economist I have ever heard expressing a view on this - did not regard that as sustainable for the long term. The aim was to see the economy less dependent on investment and exports and an increased role for spending by consumers. There has been some progress, though the rates of saving and investment remain very high. There are dangers, however, notably the high level of company debt. The authorities encouraged strong credit growth in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. That has helped prevent a more rapid and potentially disruptive slowdown, but at the price of creating additional financial risks. While China-watchers advise caution with Beijing's official gross domestic product numbers, the data is seen as a useful indicator of the country's growth trajectory. Other data showed some signs of improvement in the world's second-largest economy. Industrial production rose 6.3% in June from a year earlier, while retail sales rose 9.8% year-on-year - both above forecasts in Reuters polls. Slowing growth in China has raised concerns about the potential knock-on effect on the global economy. Earlier this year Beijingannounced plans to boost spendingand cut billions of dollars in taxes in an effort to support the economy. It has also moved to provide a liquidity boost by reducing the amount of cashbanks must hold in reserve. Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said the latest economic data ""shows the slowdown remains intact and markets should expect further stimulus"" from China's central bank later this year. The US-led trade war is another factor weighing on growth. ""The trade war is having a huge impact on the Chinese economy, and with no end sight as trade negotiations struggle for meaningful progress, we are probably not near the bottom for China's economy,"" he said. US-China trade war in 300 words While both sidesagreed to resume trade talksat a recent G20 summit in Japan, they have already placed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods, hurting businesses and casting a shadow over the world economy.

His supporters cheered when he entered the building. Mr Zuma, 77, was forced to resign as president in February 2018.

He said he found the Indian-born family ""very friendly"". ""I never did anything with them unlawfully.

He objected to allegations that he had allowed the state to be ""captured"" by the family, and had auctioned the country. ""Did I auction Table Mountain? Did I auction Johannesburg?"" he said. One thing is clear from Mr Zuma's testimony so far - if he is to go down, he will not do so alone. He painted a picture of an alleged conspiracy dating back more than two decades to destroy him. ""I have been provoked,"" he said, as he threatened to name alleged spies who betrayed the struggle for the freedom of black people in South Africa, and who were allegedly still conspiring against him. Mr Zuma was once the intelligence chief of the African National National Congress (ANC), the former liberation movement which has been in power since the end of white minority rule in 1994. So if he honours his threat to tell all, it will send shockwaves across South Africa, and lead to bitter recriminations in the ANC. But once the dust settles, South Africans will still want to know whether he betrayed his oath of office after he became president in 2009 by being involved in corruption on a grand scale. That is what the commission is trying to find out - and Mr Zuma is in a fight for his political survival. Many of the revelations from the inquiry concern the relationship between two families - the Zumas, centred on the former president, and the Guptas, three Indian-born brothers who moved to South Africa after the fall of apartheid. The two families became so closely linked that a joint term was coined for them - the ""Zuptas"". The Guptas owned a portfolio of companies that enjoyed lucrative contracts with South African government departments and state-owned conglomerates. They also employed several Zuma family members - including the president's son, Duduzane - in senior positions. According to testimony heard at the inquiry, the Guptas went to great lengths to influence their most important client, the South African state. Public officials responsible for various state bodies say they were directly instructed by the Guptas to take decisions that would advance the brothers' business interests.

"Cash use is falling, with predictions that fewer than one in 10 transactions will be completed with notes and coins in 10 years' time. Ten years ago, cash was used in six out of 10 payments, but it has been overtaken in popularity by debit cards, driven by the use of contactless technology. A review of payments, published by banking trade body UK Finance on Thursday, said cash washere to stay, but would play a less important role in the future. The most recent figures show cash payments are still common, but declining - down 16% from 2017 to 2018, while debit card use is rising. Contactless payments on debit cards were once used primarily by young adults, but older consumers have adopted the technology, with some of the biggest rises in the last year among pensioners. The use of contactless was given a massive leg-up a few years ago, when it was adopted by the London Underground. Now, however, other regions have caught up with - or overtaken - London in terms of the proportion of adults who make contactless payments. Who is worst hit by the decline in cash? Cash or no cash - where do you stand? The Swedes rebelling against a cashless society Theories about the lower take-up in the North West of England include an ageing population in coastal towns sticking with cash, plus the lack of digital access owing to a lack of connectivity in areas such as the Lake District. Overall, this means that debit cards are used more than any other form of payments in our monthly outgoings, but cash is far from dead.

"Used cooking oil from Asia is being imported into Europe to make biodiesel Imports of a ""green fuel"" source may be inadvertently increasing deforestation and the demand for new palm oil, a study says. Experts say there has been a recent boom in the amount of used cooking oil imported into the UK from Asia. This waste oil is the basis for biodiesel, which produces far less CO2 than fossil fuels in cars. Butthis report,externalis concerned that the used oil is being replaced across Asia with palm oil from deforested areas. One woman's fight to save rainforest Coffee waste 'could replace palm oil' How sustainable is supermarket palm oil? Cutting carbon emissions from transport has proved very difficult for governments all over the world. Many have given incentives to speed up the replacement of fossil-based petrol and diesel with fuels made from crops such as soya or rapeseed. These growing plants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and so liquid fuel made from these sources, while not carbon-neutral, is a big improvement on simply burning regular petrol or diesel. In this light, used cooking (UCO) oil has become a key ingredient of biodiesel in the UK and the rest of Europe. Between 2011 and 2016 there was a 360% increase in use of used cooking oil as the basis for biodiesel. Because UCO is classed as a waste product within the EU, UK fuel producers are given double carbon credits for using it in their fuels. This has sparked a boom in demand for used cooking oil that is so great it is being met in part with imports from Asia. In the UK, the most common feedstock source of biodiesel between April and December 2018 was Chinese UCO, totalling 93 million litres. In the same period, used cooking oil from UK sources was used to produce 76 million litres of of fuel. Now a new study, from international bioeconomy consultants NNFCC, suggests that these imports may inadvertently be making climate change worse by increasing deforestation and the demand for palm oil. The problem arises because used cooking oil in some parts of Asia is not classed as a waste product and is considered safe for consumption by animals. The report's authors are concerned that since it is more profitable to sell Asian UCO to Europe for fuel rather than feed it to animals, it is likely being replaced by virgin palm oil which is cheaper to buy. ""Although correlation does not necessarily equate to causation, the available evidence indicates that palm oil imports into China are increasing, in line with their increasing exports of used cooking oils,"" the report states. Between 2016 and 2018, palm oil imports into China rose by 1 million tonnes, an increase of more than 20%. ""As soon as that point is reached where you can sell used cooking oil for more than you can buy palm oil, it's a no brainer,"" said Dr Jeremy Tomkinson who co-authored the report forNNFCC,external. ""What you are going to do if you're in Asia, you're going to sell as much UCO as you can to the EU and buy palm oil and pocket the difference."" Demand for palm oil has led to large-scale deforestation and the loss of natural habitats across Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Between 2010 and 2015, Indonesia alone lost 3 million hectares of forest to continued expansion of palm oil cultivation. Each hectare of forest that's converted to palm oil releases large amounts of carbon dioxide, equivalent to 530 people flying economy class from Geneva to New Yorkaccording to a recent study,external. Most of the used cooking oil that's already imported is made from palm. But it's the extra demand from Europe, say the authors, that is likely to be fuelling deforestation. ""It's irrelevant if the virgin palm is going into the biodiesel or into the animals,"" said Dr Tomkinson. ""If we weren't pulling that resource out of the market, no new resource would be falling into it."" The UK government rejects the idea that imports are increasing demand for palm oil. The Department for Transport says that there is no evidence showing a causative link between policies on waste-derived biofuels and increased use of virgin oils. The department argues that they have worked hard to ensure that such indirect effects do not happen. ""Biofuels are a key way of achieving the emission reductions the UK needs and we have long been at the forefront of action to address the indirect effects of their production, including pushing the EU to address the impact of land use change,"" a spokesperson said. ""Last year alone biofuels reduced CO2 emissions by 2.7 million tonnes - the equivalent of taking around 1.2 million cars off the road."" One of the key elements that's making used cooking oil so valuable is the fact that producers in the EU are given double the number of carbon credits for using the waste material. While the EU allows all countries to ""double count"" carbon credits for UCO, the UK is one of the few countries to put this into practice. Palm oil imports into China have boomed in the past two years Oil importers say the ""double counting"" is vital in preventing even more palm oil from entering the European market. ""Biodiesel made from waste oil is more expensive to produce; it has higher production costs,"" said Angel Alvarez Alberdi from the European Waste-to-Advanced Biofuels Association. ""If we don't have a policy incentive of double counting then under normal market conditions you will have the cheapest available option and that is conventional palm based biodiesel that would still be able to reach the EU."" However, the report authors say that the policy has other dangers, not just because it may be driving up demand for palm oil in Asia but because it may also be stymieing development among other alternative fuel producers, such as ethanol in the UK. The authors want the government to review the practice and perhaps end the double credit for imported oil Palm oil has been linked to increased deforestation in parts of Indonesia ""If it comes from outside of the EU don't let it double count unless you put in increased levels of scrutiny to verify it's not having an impact on land use,"" said Dr Tomkinson from NNFCC. ""If you don't do that then you only get a single credit for that used cooking oil."" Environmental groups are also concerned about the potential impact that UK and EU imports of UCO are having. ""Making biodiesel from imported UCO is no longer the environmental good it was once perceived to be,"" said Greg Archer, UK director of the environmental group Transport and Environment. ""There are real concerns some of these oils may not be genuinely 'used' or they may be indirectly causing deforestation. Governments need to scrutinise the source of UCO far more closely and require organisations certifying biofuel feedstocks to undertake far more rigorous and extensive checks.""

"The life and achievements of Alan Turing - the mathematician, codebreaker, computer pioneer, artificial intelligence theoretician, and gay/cultural icon - are being celebrated to mark what would have been his 100th birthday on 23 June. To mark the occasion the BBC has commissioned a series of essays to run across the week, starting with this overview of Turing's legacy by Vint Cerf. This video can not be played Rory Cellan-Jones gets a sneak preview of an exhibition dedicated to the life of work of scientists and computer pioneer Alan Turing. I've worked in computing, and more specifically computer networking, nearly all my life. It's an industry in a constant state of innovation, always pushing beyond the limits of current capability. It is sometimes said that ""broadband"" is whatever network speed you don't have, yet! Things we take for granted today were, not that long ago, huge technological breakthroughs. Although I've been lucky enough in my career to be involved in the development of the internet, I've never lost sight of the role played by my predecessors, without whose pioneering labour, so much would not have been accomplished. Turing studied mathematics at King's College, Cambridge before obtaining a PhD from Princeton University in the US This year, in the centenary of his birth, there is one man in particular who is deservedly the focus of attention: Alan Turing. Turing was born into a world that was very different, culturally and technologically, yet his contribution has never been more important. His is a story of astounding highs and devastating lows. A story of a genius whose mathematical insights helped save thousands of lives, yet who was unable to save himself from social condemnation, with tragic results. Ultimately though, it's a story of a legacy that laid the foundations for the modern computer age. In 1936, while at King's College, Cambridge, Turing published a seminal paper On Computable Numbers which introduced two key concepts - ""algorithms"" and ""computing machines"" - that continue to play a central role in our industry today. He is remembered most vividly for his work on cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park during World War II, developing in 1940 the so-called electro-mechanical Bombe used to determine the correct rotor and plugboard settings of the German Enigma encryptor to decrypt intercepted messages. It would be hard to overstate the importance of this work for the Allies in their conduct of the war. After the war, Turing worked on the design of of the Automatic Computing Engine (Ace) at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) and in 1946, he delivered a paper on the design of a stored program computer. His work was contemporary with another giant in computer science, John von Neumann, who worked on the Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer (Edvac). Ace and Edvac were binary machines and both broke new conceptual ground with the notion of a program stored in memory that drove the operation of the machine. Storing a program in the computer's memory meant that the program could alter itself, opening up remarkable new computing vistas. The bombe decryption machine - based on Turing's designs - was used to work out the daily settings of the German's Enigma machine in World War II Remarkably, the Ace designs found their way into the Bendix Corporation's G-15 computer by way of Harry Huskey who had spent 1947 working on the Ace project at NPL. The first Bendix G-15 ran in 1954, the year that Alan Turing tragically died. In 1949, Turing became the deputy director of the Computing Laboratory at the University of Manchester where he focused on the software needed to drive the Manchester Mark 1 stored program computer. In 1950, he published a paper entitled Computing Machinery and Intelligence, in which he explored the notion of artificial intelligence. In this paper, he posed the so-called Turing Test in which an artificial intelligence would be judged intelligent if another human could not tell the difference between the responses of a human and the artificially intelligent machine. While this too-short and incomplete summary does not do justice to Alan Turing's immense contributions to the birth of computer science and computing, it has great personal resonance for me. As it happens, I share the same birth date with Turing - mine is June 23 1943, when his code cracking was at a peak. Even more coincidental, the first computer I ever got to programme was a Bendix G-15 at UCLA that my best friend, Stephen Crocker, was able to obtain access to in 1960 when we were both in our teens. The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) calls its highest award the Alan M Turing Award which includes a $250,000 (Â£160,000) prize that is partly subsidised by Google. My colleague Robert Kahn and I were so honoured in 2004 with this recognition for our work on the internet. Turing's legacy continues to evolve, astonish, challenge and excite. His insights and fearless approach to daunting problems set benchmarks for decades to come. His clarity of thought and creative genius infused those with whom he worked. His conceptual notions, such as the Universal Turing Machine, provided the basis for serious analysis of computability and decidability. His practical realisations of computing engines, special systems like the bombe and general purpose ones such as Ace, shed bright light on the feasibility of purposeful computing and lit the way towards the computing rich environment we find in the 21st Century. Had he lived to see 2012, one wonders what his thoughts might be and what new ideas he would challenge us to think about. As my own journey into computing and networking continues to unfold, I find myself wondering and wishing that Turing were still around to consult. When plans to build Turing's Ace leaked the press dubbed the proposed computer a ""giant brain"" His fresh way of articulating problems would surely cast new light on solutions. In addition to working towards higher speeds and more parallelism in computing and communications, I have spent some serious time thinking about and helping to formulate methods for communication across the long distances of the solar system. My colleagues and I have had to re-think the basic communication paradigms for large scale networking owing to the slow nature of light speed propagation (eg 20 minutes one way from Earth to Mars) and disruption caused by planetary motion. The problems only get worse when thinking about interstellar communication. Yet, these ideas must inevitably be confronted and solved as the human race continues its drive to expand beyond the planet of our origin. Mortality is an affliction that limits our ability to explore our galaxy. Turing's ideas for artificial intelligence make one wonder whether the legacy of the human race will be intelligent robots that might be maintained in perpetuity to serve as our surrogates in a migration to the stars. Turing is a hero to so many Google engineers, and we are deeply gratified to help commemorate and preserve his legacy. Last year Google helped Bletchley Park raise funds to purchase Turing's papers so they could be preserved for public display in their museum. London's Science Museum will host an exhibition exploring Turing's life until June 2013 More recently, we've funded and collaborated with the London Science Museum as they put together their stunning new exhibition ""Codebreaker: celebrating the life and legacy of Alan Turing"". They've gathered an amazing collection of artefacts - including items loaned by GCHQ, the government intelligence agency, that have never before been on public display. But the most impressive part isn't the items on show, but the way they're woven together to tell a story not just of his scientific achievements, but of the man himself. It illuminates Turing, the man, and explains what he contributed in a profoundly moving way that anyone can understand. I hope it will help make Turing a hero and household name beyond the technical community that reveres his memory. Indeed, 2012 has been dubbed the ""Alan Turing year"" by the scientific community, with a series of events and lectures taking place all over the world. I'm personally taking part in several. To celebrate his birthday (and mine!) I will be speaking at the Turing Centenary Conference in Manchester about his legacy in the networked world. I hope you'll join me - whether in person, or in spirit - in commemorating the life and work of this truly remarkable genius. <italic>Vint Cerf is a computer scientist who co-designed the TCP/IP protocols used to create the internet's underlying architecture.

"Shares in Mike Ashley's Sport Direct have fallen sharply after it delayed its results, citing uncertainty about trading its House of Fraser chain. The company, whose results were due on Thursday, added the delay was also due to its auditor, Grant Thornton, facing increased scrutiny of its work for Sports Direct. Sports Direct also indicated that it may not achieve its profits forecast. The firm's results will now be released between 26 July and 23 August. In December, when Sports Direct published its half-year results, it said that, excluding House of Fraser, operating profits were expected to grow by between 5% and 15%. But in its latest update,,externalthe company said: ""There are a number of key areas to conclude on which could materially affect the guidance given in Sports Direct announcement of 13 December"". Around that time, Mr Ashley had described trading as ""unbelievably bad"". Mike Ashley - thwarted saviour of Debenhams or serial sinner? Trading has continued to be difficult for retailers. The British Retail Consortium said on Monday that there had been a ""summer slump"", with footfall on High Streets in June dropping 2.9%. News of the delay in Sports Direct's results sent its shares down 15% at one stage to a seven-year low, although they ended the day almost 10% lower. Mike Ashley owns huge swathes of the High Street, although not all through Sports Direct in which he owns a 62% stake. As well as buying House of Fraser for Â£90m last year - saying he wanted to turn it into the ""Harrods of the High Street"" - he has also bought Evans Cycles and owns several sportswear brands, the upmarket clothing outlets Flannels and Cruise, as well as lingerie firm Agent Provocateur. His expansion efforts continued on Monday whenSports Direct also announced it was close to taking control of Game Digital.,external But his ambitions are not always achieved.  Earlier this year, he had tried to have himself installed as chief executive of Debenhams, but instead hadhis stake in the chain wiped out when the retailer was rescued by its lenders. Mr Ashley has alsofailed to take over music retailer HMVandpulled out of the bidding for Patisserie Valerie. Goals Soccer Centres, the five-a-side football operator in which Sports Direct has an 18% stake,has had accounting issues and issued profits warnings. Analysts at the stockbroker Peel Hunt are concerned the acquisition spree is putting too much pressure on management. ""Let's be clear: we think Mike Ashley is a genius when it comes to sports retail. No doubt about it,"" they say in a research note. ""However, to make an analogy, he's trying to coach the England football team whilst running the netball, the tennis and the chess team as well. ""Unfortunately for him, his key lieutenants are starting to jump ship: Karen Byers, who has been instrumental in the growth of the core business, has left and that is another savage blow,"" they added. Cameron Olsen, company secretary, who worked for Mike Ashley for 15 years, is also leaving, according to reports. ""House of Fraser is clearly in a degree of disarray, it would appear that the finance department is under-staffed to cope with the array of acquisitions, and we are also concerned about the direction of the core business,"" the Peel Hunt analysts said. Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb described the announcement from Sports Direct about the delay to its results as ""devastating"". ""The company hasn't updated the City since its interims in December and House of Fraser is clearly a disaster area, so this is a serious situation,"" he said. As well as citing the ""complexities of integration into the company of House of Fraser"", as one the factors behind the delay to its results, Sports Direct also pointed to ""increased regulatory scrutiny of auditors"". Sports Direct said that other companies' audits were also taking longer, and Mr Bubb noted that Superdry has delayed its results earlier this month due to complexities in the figures. The accounting regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, had looked into Grant Thornton's audit of Sports Direct's 2018 results as part of its annual review process. The regulator found that, overall, 50% of Grant Thornton's audits were below the acceptable standard. ""These factors have led to a need for the company to compile more information than in previous years,"" Sports Direct said. ""Sports Direct would note that its core principles in regards to its financial statement are be conservative, consistent and simple,"" it added.

"As MPs and peers call for an overhaul of laws surrounding whistleblowing, a former private school teacher explains why she took the difficult decision to speak out. ""We both lost our jobs, it was absolutely horrendous,"" says Katherine. ""I was completely clueless and didn't even know I was a whistle-blower."" She and her husband had taught at a boarding school in the south of England for more than two decades until they were forced out for exposing what she calls ""systematic exam malpractice"". Teachers had been completing assessed coursework for students, allowing them to continue working past exam time, and encouraging them to ""tinker"" with their papers until the marking date, she said. ""Morally I knew it was right,"" she told the BBC. ""They're a leading school and I thought it was unfair on other students, especially when we had more resources."" Katherine, not her real name, is one of more than 400 people who gave evidence to theAll Party Parliamentary Group for Whistleblowing,externaldetailing cases including child sex abuse, financial fraud, bullying, unlawful discrimination and sexual harassment. The parliamentary group is calling for an ""urgent radical overhaul"" of whistleblowing law as they say it is failing to adequately protect victims who come forward. UK universities in 'gagging order' row MPs call for ban on 'gagging clauses' EU gives 'high-level' protection to whistleblowers' ThePublic Interest Disclosure Act,externalwas established in 1998 but the group say the law is now ""no longer fit for purpose"" as it is too complicated and does not protect all citizens. Stephen Kerr, the Conservative MP for Stirling who chairs the group, said whistle-blowers must be ""treasured"" as they are the ""first line of defence against crime, corruption and cover-up"". His group wants an Office for the Whistleblower created to independently investigate complaints, crackdown on corrupt companies and individuals by issuing penalties, and to support people who speak out by offering counselling, free legal advice and job protection. It also wants the definition of whistleblowing to be revised to include ""any harmful violation of integrity and ethics, even when not criminal or illegal"" and for protection to be extended to people such as foster-carers, volunteers, councillors, and members of the clergy and army who are currently excluded. Katherine told MPs she was ""discouraged"" from making a formal complaint under the schools' whistleblowing procedure and, when she flagged the malpractice with the relevant exam board, she was told that only disclosures to watchdog Ofqual were protected by law. She and her husband have remained anonymous as they were both ""threatened"" into signing non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) in exchange for compensation for losing their jobs. Her NDA, seen by BBC News, asks her to waive her rights to making a protected whistleblowing disclosure and to cease further contact with charity, school and child safety regulators. ""We had no choice because we had to support our kids and had no income,"" she said. ""It's been devastating for all of us... I felt suicidal and my husband later took a new job miles and miles away, splitting up the family."" Katherine said that if it had been mandatory for the school to investigate her complaint or raise it with an independent body, rather than ""brush it under the carpet"", and she had received better legal advice and aid, she would not have felt so ""alone and unprotected"". This video can not be played Anahid Kassabian said she felt ""bullied"" out of her job when she got cancer - and she broke her NDA to encourage others to speak out And earlier this year Anahid Kassabian, a former music professor at Liverpool university,broke her NDA during a BBC investigation to speak outabout alleged disability discrimination. Only 3% of the 1,369 employment tribunal cases brought between 2017 and 2018 were successful, government figures show. The All Party Parliamentary Group said that too often whistle-blowers were faced with either ""inaction or retaliation"" with more than three-quarters of people who gave evidence saying they had faced bullying, demotions, pay reductions, suspensions or forced dismissals for speaking out. The group was set up last summer in the wake of theGosport Memorial Hospital scandal. ""Not a week goes by when whistleblowing is not making headlines around the world exposing one major tragedy or scandal after another... Cambridge Analytica or the Rotherham grooming gangs,"" they said. Just last week ex-Labour party staff broke their NDAs as part of aBBC Panorama investigationto whistleblow on senior figures they claim interfered in the disciplinary process of anti-Semitism cases. Georgina Halford-Hall, chief executive of the support network WhistleblowersUK, said people who spoke out were being ""priced out of justice"". A former whistleblower, she had helped to expose allegations of systematic abuse, bullying and self-harm at her son's boarding school. ""I would advise anyone thinking of whistleblowing to keep a record of all conversations and supporting paperwork and emails, to use a confidential reporting line if possible, and if the issue is a crime, not to delay reporting it to the police,"" she said. Under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, whistleblowing is an employee raising a concern about an alleged wrongdoing including corrupt, illegal or unethical behaviours in a public or private sector organisation. It must be in the ""public interest"" to reveal the information, which means it must affect others and not be for private gain. A confidentiality or ""gagging clause"" in a settlement agreement, sometimes called an ""NDA"", is ""unenforceable"" if you are a whistleblower. As a whistleblower you should not be treated unfairly or lose your job for speaking out. The act must ""tend to show past, present or likely future wrongdoing"" - including criminal offences, failure to comply with legal obligations, miscarriages of justice, endangering people's health, damaging the environment or covering up any form of wrongdoing. A government spokesman said: ""Sunlight is the best disinfectant and the government believes whistle-blowers must be able to come forward with wrongdoing, without fear of recrimination. ""Over recent years we have improved the whistleblowing framework, including providing new guidance on how workers can make disclosures while retaining their employment protections.""

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt hopes to find way to save the Iran nuclear deal Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was a ""small window"" to save the Iran nuclear deal, as he launched a fresh bid to ease tensions in the Gulf. Mr Hunt has been meeting EU foreign ministers to raise concerns about Iran breaching some of its commitments. The deal, which involves Iran limiting nuclear activities in return for the easing of economic sanctions, is under pressure after the US withdrew in 2018. The summit comes amid heightened tensions between the UK and Iran. The UK seized an Iranian oil tanker earlier this month and, in response, Iranthreatened to detain a British oil tanker. However, Mr Hunt said on Saturday the tanker, Grace 1,could be released if the UK is guaranteed the oil it was carrying is not bound for Syria. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Watch: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal French-Iranian academic 'arrested in Iran' Speaking on his way into the meeting in Brussels, Mr Hunt said the Iran nuclear deal was not dead ""yet"", but he warned that if Iran acquired nuclear weapons it would become ""a very, very toxic and dangerous situation"". He added: ""Iran is still a good year away from developing a nuclear weapon. We think there is still a closing, but small, window to keep the deal alive."" Mr Hunt said he would work with the European partners of the deal - France and Germany - to find a way to ""preserve"" the agreement. Allow Twitter content?

In a joint statement,externalissued ahead of the meeting, Britain, France and Germany reiterated their support for the deal. But they said they were ""deeply troubled"" by recent events in the Gulf and ""concerned"" over US-Iran relations. The statement added that all stakeholders should ""pause and consider the possible consequences of their actions"". Earlier this month Iran said it would bebreaching the deal by breaking a limit set on uranium enrichment. Even if Iran does not actually build a nuclear warhead, it only has to reach the point at which it COULD produce one for its nervous neighbours to decide this is too much of a risk. They will want their own one too - as a deterrent. Statements from Saudi Arabia, Iran's Middle East rival, have made it clear the country would not accept a nuclear-armed Iran. So then, as stated by diplomats in Brussels, we are into a nuclear arms race. What does that mean in practice? In all probability Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt would all want to become nuclear weapons powers, with the potential to obliterate entire cities. This would be in a part of the world that has seen almost continuous conflict in places for the last 71 years. Finally, there is the risk that should Iran ever go nuclear some fear it could pass on a warhead to a non-state militia like Hezbollah. This is why the Iran nuclear deal matters, even if you don't live anywhere near the Gulf. In 2015, Iran signed up to a long-term deal - called theJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action,external- after the international community expressed concerns they were trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran, which insisted its nuclear programme was entirely peaceful, agreed to limit some nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors. This video can not be played Inside Iran: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal In return, the other signatories - UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - agreed to lift some of the crippling economic sanctions placed on Iran. Speaking ahead of Monday's meeting, Mr Hunt said: ""The Middle East is already one of the most unstable regions in the world, but if the different parties were armed with nuclear weapons it would represent an existential threat to mankind."" Iran nuclear deal: Key details In 2018, Donald Trump saidhe would unilaterally withdraw the US from the agreementwhich was signed under the Barack Obama administration. The other parties criticised Mr Trump's decision and said they remained committed to the deal. This video can not be played What's behind the rising tensions between the US and Iran? The Mail on Sundaypublished a leaked memo from the UK's ambassador in Washington which said Mr Trump abandoned the nuclear dealto spite Mr Obama. Earlier this month, the International Atomic Energy Agencyconfirmed that Iran had breached the deal's capon stockpiling of low-enriched uranium. Why do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter? Iran said it was responding to sanctions reinstated by the US after Mr Trump abandoned the deal. Last week it confirmed itwill break another of the limitsimposed by the deal. Deputy foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said Iran still wanted to salvage the deal but blamed European countries for failing to live up to their own commitments. Tensions between the UK and Iran flared up earlier this month when Royal Marines seized an Iranian tanker which was suspected of breaking EU sanctions. The UK suspected Grace 1, detained on 4 July near Gibraltar, was carrying oil bound for Syria. Iran denied it was headed for Syria and claimed the seizure of the ship was ""piracy"". The oil tanker was suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria In a phone call with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday,Mr Hunt sought to reassure his counterpartthat the detainment ""was nothing to do with the oil being Iranian"". Mr Zarif also wanted to resolve the issue and was ""not seeking to escalate"" the situation, Mr Hunt said. In response to the seizure, Iranthreatened to seize a British oil tanker.

"This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt hopes to find way to save the Iran nuclear deal Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was a ""small window"" to save the Iran nuclear deal, as he launched a fresh bid to ease tensions in the Gulf. Mr Hunt has been meeting EU foreign ministers to raise concerns about Iran breaching some of its commitments. The deal, which involves Iran limiting nuclear activities in return for the easing of economic sanctions, is under pressure after the US withdrew in 2018. The summit comes amid heightened tensions between the UK and Iran. The UK seized an Iranian oil tanker earlier this month and, in response, Iranthreatened to detain a British oil tanker. However, Mr Hunt said on Saturday the tanker, Grace 1,could be released if the UK is guaranteed the oil it was carrying is not bound for Syria. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Watch: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal French-Iranian academic 'arrested in Iran' Speaking on his way into the meeting in Brussels, Mr Hunt said the Iran nuclear deal was not dead ""yet"", but he warned that if Iran acquired nuclear weapons it would become ""a very, very toxic and dangerous situation"". He added: ""Iran is still a good year away from developing a nuclear weapon. We think there is still a closing, but small, window to keep the deal alive."" Mr Hunt said he would work with the European partners of the deal - France and Germany - to find a way to ""preserve"" the agreement. Allow Twitter content?

In a joint statement,externalissued ahead of the meeting, Britain, France and Germany reiterated their support for the deal. But they said they were ""deeply troubled"" by recent events in the Gulf and ""concerned"" over US-Iran relations. The statement added that all stakeholders should ""pause and consider the possible consequences of their actions"". Earlier this month Iran said it would bebreaching the deal by breaking a limit set on uranium enrichment. Even if Iran does not actually build a nuclear warhead, it only has to reach the point at which it COULD produce one for its nervous neighbours to decide this is too much of a risk. They will want their own one too - as a deterrent. Statements from Saudi Arabia, Iran's Middle East rival, have made it clear the country would not accept a nuclear-armed Iran. So then, as stated by diplomats in Brussels, we are into a nuclear arms race. What does that mean in practice? In all probability Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt would all want to become nuclear weapons powers, with the potential to obliterate entire cities. This would be in a part of the world that has seen almost continuous conflict in places for the last 71 years. Finally, there is the risk that should Iran ever go nuclear some fear it could pass on a warhead to a non-state militia like Hezbollah. This is why the Iran nuclear deal matters, even if you don't live anywhere near the Gulf. In 2015, Iran signed up to a long-term deal - called theJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action,external- after the international community expressed concerns they were trying to develop nuclear weapons. Iran, which insisted its nuclear programme was entirely peaceful, agreed to limit some nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors. This video can not be played Inside Iran: Iranians on Trump and the nuclear deal In return, the other signatories - UK, France, Germany, China and Russia - agreed to lift some of the crippling economic sanctions placed on Iran. Speaking ahead of Monday's meeting, Mr Hunt said: ""The Middle East is already one of the most unstable regions in the world, but if the different parties were armed with nuclear weapons it would represent an existential threat to mankind."" Iran nuclear deal: Key details In 2018, Donald Trump saidhe would unilaterally withdraw the US from the agreementwhich was signed under the Barack Obama administration. The other parties criticised Mr Trump's decision and said they remained committed to the deal. This video can not be played What's behind the rising tensions between the US and Iran? The Mail on Sundaypublished a leaked memo from the UK's ambassador in Washington which said Mr Trump abandoned the nuclear dealto spite Mr Obama. Earlier this month, the International Atomic Energy Agencyconfirmed that Iran had breached the deal's capon stockpiling of low-enriched uranium. Why do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter? Iran said it was responding to sanctions reinstated by the US after Mr Trump abandoned the deal. Last week it confirmed itwill break another of the limitsimposed by the deal. Deputy foreign minister Abbas Araqchi said Iran still wanted to salvage the deal but blamed European countries for failing to live up to their own commitments. Tensions between the UK and Iran flared up earlier this month when Royal Marines seized an Iranian tanker which was suspected of breaking EU sanctions. The UK suspected Grace 1, detained on 4 July near Gibraltar, was carrying oil bound for Syria. Iran denied it was headed for Syria and claimed the seizure of the ship was ""piracy"". The oil tanker was suspected of carrying crude oil to Syria In a phone call with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif on Saturday,Mr Hunt sought to reassure his counterpartthat the detainment ""was nothing to do with the oil being Iranian"". Mr Zarif also wanted to resolve the issue and was ""not seeking to escalate"" the situation, Mr Hunt said. In response to the seizure, Iranthreatened to seize a British oil tanker. On 9 July, the UKraised the threat to British shipping in Iranian waters in the Gulf to ""critical""- the highest level. A day later, Iranian boats attempted to impede a British oil tanker in the region, before being warned off by a Royal Navy ship, according to the MoD.

"The coins dated between 153BC and AD61 A hoard of Roman coins found in a field may have been hidden there during the Boudiccan revolt, an expert has said. The trove of 60 denarii, dating between 153BC and AD60-61, was found in a field near Cookley, in Suffolk, by a metal detectorist. Dr Anna Booth, who examined the find, said there ""might be a link with the Boudiccan revolt"" and the coins. Queen Boudicca led the Iceni tribe against the Romans in AD61 which led to the destruction of Colchester. Most of the coins dated from the Republic era, pre-27BC, but there were also denarii minted during the reigns of emperors Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula and Nero. Boudicca led her Iceni tribe in a revolt against the Romans Dr Booth said: ""This hoard is interesting because the latest coin dated to the reign of Nero in AD60-61. The final coin is often an indication of when a hoard is likely to have been deposited. ""There might be a link with the Boudiccan revolt which took place in AD61 in this region.""

"Liam Fox wants to recruit a new generation of professional negotiators for trade talks A new generation of UK trade negotiators is to be recruited in an open-access scheme launched by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox. It follows warnings of a shortage of experienced UK trade negotiators during the Brexit process. The training scheme is open to applicants from all backgrounds and levels of qualifications - with the first recruits ready in two years. The Liberal Democrats dismissed it as a ""last-minute scramble"". Labour's Barry Gardiner said ""only now is the secretary of state realising that the UK needs trained negotiation staff"". At a launch event at the Harris Westminster Sixth Form school in London, the international trade secretary said being a professional negotiator was a ""career option that hasn't really existed for two generations"" - as deal-making has been carried out by the European Union. The training project, with an initial 12 places, is meant to begin filling the gap, to provide enough home-grown professional negotiators for trade talks for the Brexit process and beyond. Chief trade negotiation adviser, Crawford Falconer (L), launched the recruitment drive with Liam Fox Mr Fox rejected the suggestion that this recruitment drive should have happened earlier - saying his department has been expanding and building capacity. He said the new recruits would learn the practical skills of international trade talks, including spending time abroad, and would be paid about Â£30,000 while training. 'We have no trade negotiators' What trade deals has the UK done so far? Fox blames MPs over Canada trade deal delay ""Young people can actually see what global trade looks like, that it's not a cold negotiating room, it's how we get market access, how we are helping exporters to get into markets,"" said Mr Fox. ""There is no substitute for international experience."" A project at the London sixth form created a simulation of a trading negotiation Mr Fox said he wanted to ""broaden the base"" of those seeing trade negotiations as a career, with no limits or qualifications required for anyone wanting to apply. ""I think the wider we cast the net the better,"" he said, launching a project separate from conventional graduate recruitment schemes. Mr Fox said it was open to ""as many of those youngsters who have the aptitude, the enthusiasm and who've got the intuition to make a success of it"". Two years ago the international trade secretary had claimed that negotiations for a free trade agreement with the European Union ""should be one of the easiest in human history"". But he now describes trade negotiations as a ""complicated business"" - and says the recruits will be given the intensive training they need. Recruits will get two years of training in trade talks, including an overseas posting The department's chief trade negotiation adviser, Crawford Falconer, said he wanted to ""demystify"" the process of trade negotiations and ""get rid of the jargon"". Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said it was ""another case of too little, too late"" and a ""complete failure in office to prepare the UK for what happens next"". Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on international trade, said those who might be hired as negotiators were being ""set an impossible task"".

"Europe's satellite-navigation system, Galileo, remains offline. The network suffered an outage on Friday due to what has been described as a ""technical incident related to its ground infrastructure"". Engineers worked around the clock over the weekend but there is no update yet on when the service will resume. The problem means all receivers, such as the latest smartphone models, will not be picking up any useable timing or positional information. These devices will be relying instead on the data coming from the American Global Positioning System (GPS). And depending on the sat-nav chip they have installed, cell phones and other devices might also be making connections with the Russian (Glonass) and Chinese (Beidou) networks. Galileo is still in a roll-out, or pilot phase, meaning it would not yet be expected to lead critical applications. ""People should remember that we are still in the 'initial services' phase; we're not in full operation yet,"" a spokesperson for the European GNSS Agency (GSA) told BBC News. ""This is something that can happen while we build the robustness into the system. We have recovery and monitoring actions, and we are implementing them, and we are working 24/7 to fix this as soon as possible."" Money released for 'UK sat-nav' study EC seeks to boost space spending QE Engineering Prize lauds GPS pioneers The GSA issued a notification on Thursday warning users that Galileo's signals might become unreliable. An update was then sent out at 01:50 Central European Time on Friday to say that the service was out of use until further notice. The search and rescue function on Galileo satellites that picks up the distress beacon messages from those at sea or up high mountains is said to be unaffected by the outage. A project of the European Commission and the European Space Agency 24 satellites constitute a full system but it will also have spares in orbit 24 spacecraft are in orbit today; two more will launch next year Original budget was â¬3bn but will now cost more than three times that Works alongside the US GPS, Chinese Beidou and Russian Glonass systems Promises eventual real-time positioning down to a metre or less Galileo is a multi-billion-euro project of the European Union and the European Space Agency. The EU owns the system, and Esa acts as the technical and procurement agent. There are currently 22 operational satellites in orbit (another two are in space but in testing), with a further 12 under construction with industry. In addition to the spacecraft, Galileo relies on a complex ground infrastructure to control the network and monitor its performance. Europe's alternative to GPS went ""live"" with initial services in December 2016 after 17 years of development. The European Commission promotes Galileo as more than just a back-up service; it is touted also as being more accurate and more robust. An outage across the entire network is therefore a matter of significant concern and no little embarrassment. Since its launch in 1978, GPS has become integral to the functioning of all modern economies. Usage goes far beyond just finding one's way through an unfamiliar city. The system's timing function has now become ubiquitous in many fields, including in the synchronisation of global financial transactions, telecommunications and energy networks.

"This video can not be played China's economic slowdown explained China's economy grew at its slowest pace since the early 1990s in the second quarter, official figures showed. In the three months to June, the economy grew 6.2% from a year earlier. The result was in line with forecasts. China has moved to stimulate its economy this year by boosting spending and delivering tax cuts. The country is also fighting a trade war with the US which has hurt businesses and weighed on growth. The data released on Monday showed China's economic growth rate slowedfrom 6.4% in the first three months of the year. US President Donald Trump tweeted that US trade tariffs were having ""a major effect"" on the Chinese economy. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

China's national statistics bureau said,externalthe figures pointed to a ""complex environment"" both at home and abroad. It said the economy had ""performed within the reasonable range"" in the first half of 2019, but that it faced ""new downward pressure"". Andrew Walker, business correspondent The figures do show some impact from the trade conflict with the US. Growth has probably slowed a little more than it would have done had China been facing a more tranquil international commercial environment. The longer-term picture, though, is one of an economy continuing a reasonably orderly and intended slowdown in growth. The average growth rate over the three decades to 2010 was 10%. The Chinese leadership - and every economist I have ever heard expressing a view on this - did not regard that as sustainable for the long term. The aim was to see the economy less dependent on investment and exports and an increased role for spending by consumers. There has been some progress, though the rates of saving and investment remain very high. There are dangers, however, notably the high level of company debt. The authorities encouraged strong credit growth in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. That has helped prevent a more rapid and potentially disruptive slowdown, but at the price of creating additional financial risks. While China-watchers advise caution with Beijing's official gross domestic product numbers, the data is seen as a useful indicator of the country's growth trajectory. Other data showed some signs of improvement in the world's second-largest economy. Industrial production rose 6.3% in June from a year earlier, while retail sales rose 9.8% year-on-year - both above forecasts in Reuters polls. Slowing growth in China has raised concerns about the potential knock-on effect on the global economy. Earlier this year Beijingannounced plans to boost spendingand cut billions of dollars in taxes in an effort to support the economy. It has also moved to provide a liquidity boost by reducing the amount of cashbanks must hold in reserve. Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said the latest economic data ""shows the slowdown remains intact and markets should expect further stimulus"" from China's central bank later this year. The US-led trade war is another factor weighing on growth. ""The trade war is having a huge impact on the Chinese economy, and with no end sight as trade negotiations struggle for meaningful progress, we are probably not near the bottom for China's economy,"" he said. US-China trade war in 300 words While both sidesagreed to resume trade talksat a recent G20 summit in Japan, they have already placed tariffs on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods, hurting businesses and casting a shadow over the world economy.

"Iran insists that it is not seeking to overturn the nuclear deal It has taken just a little over a year since the Trump administration abandoned the international nuclear deal with Iran, known as the JCPOA, for Tehran itself to challenge the agreement. Its decision to intentionally breach the 300kg ceiling for the stock of low-enriched uranium that it can hold is but the first step of several that it is threatening. However, Tehran insists it is not seeking to overturn the nuclear deal itself. It just wants to be treated fairly under its terms. Iran's case is that it has, all along, abided by the terms of the agreement. And Iran's ""good behaviour"" has been independently verified by the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But now Iran is saying enough is enough. It has stuck to its side of the bargain but the Americans have not only walked away from the deal, they have re-imposed sanctions and are trying to make it as difficult as possible for anyone to trade with Tehran. Iran nuclear breach tests world powers What would a US-Iran conflict look like? This policy of ""maximum pressure"" is acknowledged by the Trump administration. Its goal, its spokesmen insist, is to force Iran to the table to negotiate what in US terms would be a ""better"" deal. But Mr Trump's critics argue that what his administration wants is more capitulation rather than negotiation. There is a strong whiff of regime change about some of Mr Trump's key advisers. Iran - if you accept that it was behind recent attacks in the Gulf as the Americans insist - has already sought to push back against US pressure. It has many ways of doing so. And the fear is that the potential breakdown of the nuclear deal will not only encourage Iran to resume worrying nuclear activities, but it may also risk some kind of conflict in the Gulf, intentional or otherwise. So the stakes surrounding the nuclear deal are huge. And this is going to condition many countries' responses to what is happening. There are already differences between Washington and its key European allies - Britain, France and Germany - who remain strong supporters of the nuclear deal and want to see it continue. Certainly they worry about many of Iran's regional activities and they share the Trump administration's concerns about Iran's active missile programmes. But they believe that the JCPOA, whatever faults it may have had, contained one essential benefit. It took the nuclear issue out of the game at least for the immediate future. It ""kicked the can down the road"". It did not resolve the disputes over Iran's past activities or place permanent restrictions on what it could do in this field. But it averted a crisis. Remember, before the deal was agreed in 2015, there were real fears of a possible US or Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear infrastructure. Britain, France and Germany remain strong supporters of the nuclear deal So what happens now? Iran is making a point. It says that breaching the low-enriched uranium threshold is not in contravention of the JCPOA deal. Indeed its text, at Iran's insistence, does contain wording to the effect that if others breach the deal's terms then Iran will feel able to do the same. That of course may not be how the other signatories see things. They may argue you are either in the agreement or - like the United States - you choose to leave it. Iran's pressure tactic is intended to push the Europeans in particular to do more to relieve the US economic pressure that is building up. The EU has developed a special payments system - dubbed in Euro-speak  INSTEX - to try to help facilitate trade in humanitarian supplies, which in any case are not covered by the sanctions. Deals here have been made more difficult because of many banks' reluctance to risk US action. But INSTEX will not help with the key sectors of Iran's economy that are suffering the greatest pain, like the oil industry. Most independent experts say that INSTEX has been slow to get going and is unlikely to make a significant difference. It is largely about the Europeans sending diplomatic signals to Tehran. But this may no longer be enough. At the end of the day it is, after all, individual companies that must decide to trade with Iran, not governments And if they have business in the US they are going to be wary of trading with Tehran. Russia and China are also deeply uneasy about the US position and would prefer the nuclear deal to remain in place. So the US does not have many friends here beyond Saudi Arabia and Israel, which have their own issues with Tehran. President Hassan Rouhani stressed that Iran was not pulling out of the nuclear deal The next high stakes moment may come in just under a week when Iran is threatening to take further actions to breach the terms of the agreement. It has suggested that one of these might be to increase the level of enrichment from the current 3.67% to around 20%. This will be a much bigger drama. Uranium enrichment is all about stripping away atoms of one type of uranium to boost the concentration of another type, or isotope, which can power a nuclear chain reaction. If you take this enrichment to a 20% level you are in fact about 90% of the way to having material suitable for a bomb. There are many other things Iran could do to up the stakes but taking enrichment levels to 20% would send alarm bells around the world and would make it very difficult for the Europeans to keep supporting the nuclear deal. The JCPOA has long been described as being on life-support. So a serious shock to the system could sweep it away with uncertain consequences. That spark could come from the Iranians effectively overturning it themselves or it could come from the Middle East, where Iran or its proxy forces and the US military operate, sometimes in close proximity. The Syrian front too is a factor. Israel is engaged there in an air campaign against the Iranian military build-up in the country. There have been some unusually intense Israeli air attacks recently near Homs and Damascus. Anything that goes wrong, any increase in tension could feed back into the nuclear debate and vice-versa. Iran clearly believes the pressure can be relieved in some way. But it may be mistaken. President Trump is doing everything he can to ensure the JCPOA's demise. The Iran nuclear deal is facing its most fundamental challenge yet and what Iran does over the next week or so could well seal its fate.

"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (left), Rashida Tlaib (centre) and Ayanna Pressley (right) US President Donald Trump has been accused of racism after posting tweets attacking Democratic congresswomen. He claimed the women ""originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe"", before suggesting they ""go back"". The tweet was directed at a group of four congresswomen of colour; three were born and raised in the US while the fourth moved to the US as a child. Republican Party representatives kept quiet amid a wave of criticism. The congresswomen - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ayanna Pressley, and Ilhan Omar, who came to the US as a refugee aged 12 - have all called the president racist, and have been backed by members of the Democratic Party. Ms Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx in New York, approximately 12 miles away from the Queens hospital where Mr Trump was born. The British Prime Minister, Theresa May said President Trump's remarks were ""completely unacceptable"". In a three-tweet thread, Mr Trumpaccused the congresswomen of ""viciously"" criticising him and the US,external. The president did not explicitly name the women he was talking about, but the context - and references to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi - made a clear link. He said Ms Pelosi would happily organise for them to leave the country. A week ago, Ms Pelosi clashed with the four women - sometimes nicknamed ""the squad"" - but she has since come to their defence following his tweets. The president wrote: ""So interesting to see 'progressive' Democrat congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Trump scrapped Iran deal 'to spite Obama' The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Trump retreats on census citizenship question ""Why don't they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done. ""These places need your help badly, you can't leave fast enough. I'm sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!"" President Trump has been accused of racism and white nationalism There have been internal feuds among Democrats over a border funding package, with Ms Pelosi arguing in favour of the package, and the four women - all newcomers to Congress with a progressive agenda - voting against. Last week, Ms Ocasio-Cortez accused Ms Pelosi of singling out women of colour for criticism. Ms Pelosi quoted Mr Trump's tweets and described them as ""xenophobic"". ""When @realDonaldTrump tells four American congresswomen to go back to their countries, he reaffirms his plan to 'Make America Great Again' has always been about making America white again. Our diversity is our strength and our unity is our power,"" she wrote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Trump has tweeted since, further criticising ""people who speak so badly of our country"". Mr Trump did not specifically mention a link to recent news events, but immigration at the southern border was a dominant topic in US news at the weekend. On Friday, Ms Ocasio-Cortez, Ms Tlaib and Ms Pressley testified to a House committee about conditions in a migrant detention centre they had visited. They expressed horror about alleged mistreatment happening ""under American flags"". Ms Ocasio-Cortez said migrants told her they had drunk water from toilets because sinks were broken.

He said everyone was being ""well cared for"". The president tweeted that children's detention centres had had ""great reviews"" and the adult male areas were ""loaded up with a big percentage of criminals"". Mr Trump has been accused of racism many times in connection with different incidents. For years, he made false claims thatformer President Barack Obama was not born in the US- propagating the racist ""birther"" conspiracy. He has also made numerous slurs against Central American migrants, calling them criminals and rapists. In 2018, he faced criticism from both Democrats and Republicans after reports said that during a meeting at the White House he called African nations ""shitholes"". When white supremacists marched in Charlottesville, Virginia, resulting in the death of 32-year-old counter protester Heather Heyer, the president said there were ""good people on both sides"". Mr Trump and his father Fred Trump were sued by the Department of Justice in 1973 for discrimination against African Americans in their renting practices. They settled the case without admitting guilt in 1975 but were accused again by the justice department in 1978 of an ""underlying pattern of discrimination"" against black tenants.

"Liam Fox wants to recruit a new generation of professional negotiators for trade talks A new generation of UK trade negotiators is to be recruited in an open-access scheme launched by International Trade Secretary Liam Fox. It follows warnings of a shortage of experienced UK trade negotiators during the Brexit process. The training scheme is open to applicants from all backgrounds and levels of qualifications - with the first recruits ready in two years. The Liberal Democrats dismissed it as a ""last-minute scramble"". Labour's Barry Gardiner said ""only now is the secretary of state realising that the UK needs trained negotiation staff"". At a launch event at the Harris Westminster Sixth Form school in London, the international trade secretary said being a professional negotiator was a ""career option that hasn't really existed for two generations"" - as deal-making has been carried out by the European Union. The training project, with an initial 12 places, is meant to begin filling the gap, to provide enough home-grown professional negotiators for trade talks for the Brexit process and beyond. Chief trade negotiation adviser, Crawford Falconer (L), launched the recruitment drive with Liam Fox Mr Fox rejected the suggestion that this recruitment drive should have happened earlier - saying his department has been expanding and building capacity. He said the new recruits would learn the practical skills of international trade talks, including spending time abroad, and would be paid about Â£30,000 while training. 'We have no trade negotiators' What trade deals has the UK done so far? Fox blames MPs over Canada trade deal delay ""Young people can actually see what global trade looks like, that it's not a cold negotiating room, it's how we get market access, how we are helping exporters to get into markets,"" said Mr Fox. ""There is no substitute for international experience."" A project at the London sixth form created a simulation of a trading negotiation Mr Fox said he wanted to ""broaden the base"" of those seeing trade negotiations as a career, with no limits or qualifications required for anyone wanting to apply. ""I think the wider we cast the net the better,"" he said, launching a project separate from conventional graduate recruitment schemes. Mr Fox said it was open to ""as many of those youngsters who have the aptitude, the enthusiasm and who've got the intuition to make a success of it"". Two years ago the international trade secretary had claimed that negotiations for a free trade agreement with the European Union ""should be one of the easiest in human history"". But he now describes trade negotiations as a ""complicated business"" - and says the recruits will be given the intensive training they need. Recruits will get two years of training in trade talks, including an overseas posting The department's chief trade negotiation adviser, Crawford Falconer, said he wanted to ""demystify"" the process of trade negotiations and ""get rid of the jargon"". Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said it was ""another case of too little, too late"" and a ""complete failure in office to prepare the UK for what happens next"". Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on international trade, said those who might be hired as negotiators were being ""set an impossible task"". He said that Mr Fox had ""failed to secure the substantial post-Brexit trade deals he promised"" - and the UK was at risk of missing out on the EU's trade agreements with Japan and Canada.
