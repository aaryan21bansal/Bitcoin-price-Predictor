"This video can not be played WATCH: Sir Nick Clegg defends Instagram over suicide images New Facebook vice-president Sir Nick Clegg has told the BBC the firm will do ""whatever it takes"" to make its social media platforms safer for young people. Sir Nick was responding to the case of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after viewing distressing self-harm images on Instagram. He added that some experts say it is wise to keep certain images up because they can also help people find support. He admitted he would not let his own children view some graphic examples. Molly Russell took her own life in 2017. When her family looked into her Instagram account they found distressing material about depression and suicide. Her father sayshe believes Instagram is partly responsible for his daughter's death. ""I can tell you firstly we're going to look at this from top to bottom, change everything we're doing if necessary, to get it right,"" Sir Nick said. ""We're already taking steps soon to blur images, block a number of hashtags that have come to light, and thirdly to continue to work... with the Samaritans and other organisations."" However he added that the advice of these experts is not to ban all content of this nature. ""... I know this sounds counter-intuitive, but they do say that in some instances it's better to keep some of the distressing images up if that helps people make a cry for help and then get the support they need,"" he said. The former UK deputy prime minister also talked about tax, saying Facebook should pay more outside the US, at his first public appearance as the tech giant's head of communications. It was ""unbalanced"" that most of Facebook's $4bn [Â£3bn] tax bill was paid in the US ""even though the vast majority of Facebook's users are outside the United States"", he said. ""That is what needs to change,"" Sir Nick said, adding the onus was on governments to come up with ""a better way to tax companies like Facebook"". Sir Nick Clegg also addressed an audience at the Solvay Library in Brussels Following his interview with BBC media editor Amol Rajan, Sir Nick gave his first public speech since his surprise appointment, announcing the creation of an external body to help Facebook users challenge decisions made about flagged content. He said he supported tech sector regulation and agreed with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's view that ""Facebook should not make so many important decisions about free expression and safety on its own"". In the wide-ranging speech, Sir Nick also acknowledged the platform had a responsibility to limit the potential for political damage caused by the spread of fake news. But he defended Facebook's business model - of using personal data to sell targeted advertising, rather than charging users a subscription, which some would be unable to afford. The collection and sharing of personal data, such as users' location, shopping habits and holiday plans, was now ""routine"" among many private companies and public sector organisations, Sir Nick said. ""The data-driven economy is here to stay and we have to find ways of managing its harms while preserving its benefits,"" he said. ""It is, for better or worse, how the internet works. ""Underlying a lot of the criticisms of Facebook's business model is the assumption that advertising is inherently exploitative. ""I don't share that view. There is such a thing as responsible advertising."" Sir Nick added he had seen ""many changes"" at Facebook since he joined in October 2018. There was surprise at his appointment, especially as he had written negatively about the social network in the past. ""As the internet has evolved, so have the norms and standards that apply to it,"" he said in his speech. Why Sir Nick Clegg is joining Facebook Facebook job not lobbying - Clegg.

"Amber Peat ""always had a sad face"", according to a former class teacher A 13-year-old girl was found hanged after she went missing from home following an argument about chores, an inquest has heard. Amber Peat's body was found in bushes three days after she walked out of her home in Mansfield on 30 May 2015. She left at about 17:10 GMT and was reported missing almost eight hours later, at 00:56 on 31 May. Amber ""always had a sad face"" and ""felt very put upon"" at home, her former teacher told the inquest. Joanne Holt told Nottinghamshire Coroner's Court: ""She had lots of jobs to do that her siblings perhaps weren't expected to do in the same way. ""She didn't feel she was treated fairly in comparison to her siblings. ""She felt her siblings perhaps got away with things that she perhaps didn't get away with."" Amber's body was found in Westfield Lane, about a mile from her home in Bosworth Street Amber lived with her mother Kelly Peat and stepfather Daniel Peat, while her biological father Adrian Cook lived in Scotland. Mrs Holt was Amber's class teacher at John Davies Primary in Huthwaite for just over a term, from January 2013 onwards, until the teenager moved schools during the summer term. The inquest heard how Amber went to many different schools as she had moved house ""no less than 11 times"", according to assistant coroner Laurinda Bower. The coroner asked Mrs Holt to tell her what she remembered about Amber. Amber's mother and stepfather appealed for information when she went missing Mrs Holt said: ""I remember she was quite an unhappy child. That's what stands out mostly in my head. ""She never really seemed happy. She was usually alone. She always had a sad face."" Mrs Holt said she had tried to talk to Amber's mother about her problems ""on a number of occasions"" after school. ""I think on two occasions we had a meeting with mum but couldn't get much response from her,"" she said. ""I didn't feel that anything was acted upon or really acknowledged that there was a problem."" Floral tributes and messages to Amber Peat were left near where her body was found Det Con Tina Gilfoyle, who investigated Amber's death for Nottinghamshire Police, said she had been ""troubled quite a lot"" while on a family holiday to Cornwall in the week before her death. Family members told police ""there had been arguments"" and Amber ""had been prevented from going to the beach,"" the detective said. While there, Amber and her cousin wrote a ""Run Away List"" containing items such as a torch and a wig, but her cousin apparently thought it was a joke. Amber's stepfather allegedly threatened to hit her if she continued scowling at him while on the drive home from holiday, the court heard. That is what one of Amber's siblings told police, but Mr Peat has not yet given his evidence and has not been questioned about the allegation. Volunteers from the community helped police search for Amber Posters were put in the windows of shops and houses as the public joined the search for Amber Amber was apparently made to clear the car out when they arrived home from holiday, and on the day she died she had been asked to clean a cool box. ""She wasn't happy about it,"" Det Con Gilfoyle said. ""She is reported as complaining and trying to get mum's attention, and so mum shuts the door leaving Amber alone in the hallway. A short while later the door slams and Amber is gone."" The officer said Amber's family went to look for her, but also went to Tesco and did some shopping before finally reporting her missing.

"This video can not be played Desperate Venezuelan women are selling their hair at the border The US has imposed sanctions on Venezuela's state-owned oil firm PDVSA and urged the country's military to accept a peaceful transfer of power. National Security Adviser John Bolton said President NicolÃ¡s Maduro and his allies could ""no longer loot the assets of the Venezuelan people"". Efforts by the opposition to unseat Mr Maduro have increased in recent days. The US and more than 20 countries have recognised opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ as interim president. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the proceeds of the purchase of Venezuelan oil would now be withheld from Mr Maduro's government, but the company could avoid sanctions by recognising Mr GuaidÃ³. Venezuela is heavily reliant on the US for its oil revenue - sending 41% of its oil exports there - while it remains in the top four crude oil suppliers to the US. Mr Maduro later announced he had told PDVSA to launch ""political and legal action, in US and international courts"" to protect its US subsidiary Citgo. Why Venezuela's military is backing Maduro Venezuela crisis - in seven charts What's behind Venezuela's political crisis? In other developments: Mr GuaidÃ³ says he is ordering Venezuela's Congress to name new heads of the PDVSA and Citgo, as he aims to take control of the country's assets The government has devalued its currency, the bolivar, by almost 35% to align it with the black market exchange rate Mr Bolton and Mr Mnuchin said the sanctions were intended to prevent Mr Maduro's government from taking funds from the state oil company. ""We have continued to expose the corruption of Maduro and his cronies and today's action ensures they can no longer loot the assets of the Venezuelan people,"" Mr Bolton said. Mr Maduro is accused of human rights abuses and rigging elections The US action blocks all PDVSA property and interests subject to US jurisdiction, and prohibits US citizens from engaging in transactions with them. But Mr Mnuchin said US-based subsidiary Citgo could continue operations if its earnings were deposited in a blocked account in the US. Mr Bolton also urged Venezuela's military to ""accept the peaceful, democratic and constitutional transfer of power"". As Mr Bolton was announcing the sanctions at a Washington news conference, observers spotted a handwritten message on his notepad. It read ""5,000 troops to Colombia"", though it is unclear what this means. One observer suggested the apparent gaffe may be an infringement of operational security. Allow Twitter content?

At the press conference Mr Bolton declined to rule out military involvement in Venezuela. A White House spokesperson later said: ""As the president has said, all options are on the table."" However, one US official anonymously told AFP news agency ""we are not seeing anything that would support"" a possible troop deployment to Colombia. Earlier in the day a state television broadcast showed Mr Maduro welcoming home diplomats recalled from Washington DC. The meeting with the diplomats was broadcast on national television Venezuela broke off relations with the US last week in response its recognition of Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim leader and ordered all US diplomats to leave the country. However, on Saturday Venezuela's foreign minister announced it would allow 30 days for the two sides to set up ""interest offices"" in each other's countries. By Natalie Sherman, BBC News, New York The US decision to impose sanctions on Venezuela's state-owned oil company was aimed at ratcheting up pressure on the Maduro government. Still, it's hard to predict how much of an impact the move will have, especially since US refineries had reduced orders in recent months in anticipation of this step, according to Mr Mnuchin. The Maduro government has proven resilient, despite an economy in crisis, an already sharp contraction in oil production and other US efforts to isolate it. If countries such as China and Russia continue to support Venezuela, the government may be able to appeal to them for additional help. Ivan Briscoe, the International Crisis Group's programme director for Latin America, told me on Friday he thought Mr Maduro could survive additional sanctions. Meanwhile, he warned that the situation for Venezuelans would get worse should the US, China and Russia continue to treat the country as a ""football in a bigger political game"". Russia, China, Mexico and Turkey have publicly backed Mr Maduro. At a UN Security Council meeting on Saturday, Russia accused Washington of plotting a coup. This video can not be played Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains However, more than a dozen Latin American countries and Canada have backed Mr GuaidÃ³ as president. And on Saturday, several European countries including Spain, Germany, France and the UK said they would recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as president if elections were not called within eight days. Venezuela is in economic crisis - hyperinflation and shortages of basic essentials have hit its population hard and caused millions to flee.

How Venezuelans stave off hunger Fury at Maduro's Salt Bae feast He was re-elected to a second term last year - but the elections were controversial, with many opposition candidates barred from running or jailed.

"Jack Shepherd appeared in an extradition hearing in the Georgian capital Tbilisi last week Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd's British lawyer, Richard Egan, has received a death threat amidst torrents of abuse. The letter, which tells him to ""remember Jo Cox"", the Labour MP murdered by far right extremist Thomas Mair, has been passed to the police. It talks of stabbing, bombing, features a swastika and the words ""Heil Hitler"". Former Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, says the letter represents an attack on the rule of law. As a defence solicitor representing Shepherd, Mr Egan has received a steady stream of abusive and threatening letters, emails and texts accusing him, among other things, of having blood on his hands. He did not take them especially seriously until he received a letter, sent to his office, which warned him he had 48 hours to state that he was ""no longer supporting or providing legal aid"" to Shepherd and saying, ""remember Jo Cox?"" ""You have been followed - nice house!  Now, accidents happen, people get stabbed in London, pets get poisoned, children run over. ""Be warned we (EDF) will petrol bomb your nice office."" It also contained a swastika, SS sign and the words ""Heil Hitler 88"". Mr Egan says this was of a ""different order"". ""It threatens my family.  It suggests that I have been followed and that the writer knows where I live and where I work. ""There is a specific threat to firebomb my firm, endangering the lives of my colleagues."" The letter has been passed to the police who are investigating. Solicitor Richard Egan believes the role of defence solicitors has been misrepresented Mr Egan believes some press coverage of the case has misrepresented the role of defence solicitors, legal aid and the wider justice system and he says this has led to a climate of hate towards the defence team. In his 25 years acting in some of the most high-profile cases before the criminal courts, Mr Egan says he has never known a reaction as fevered as the one in Shepherd's case. ""Defence lawyers have a role to play. Our system is based on the principle that all those accused by the state are entitled to legal representation. That is all I provide. ""The jury, directed by the judge, decides whether someone is guilty or not. In this case there seems to have been an attack on the role of the defence lawyer itself,"" he says. Jack Shepherd to stay in Georgian prison Sister condemns speedboat killer's 'arrogance' Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd hands himself in to police Last July, Shepherd, now 31, was convicted in his absence at the Old Bailey and sentenced to six years for the gross negligence manslaughter of 24-year-old Charlotte Brown. She died following a speedboat crash while on a date with Shepherd on the River Thames in December 2015. The two met on the dating site OkCupid. Shepherd spent Â£150 on wine and food at a restaurant in The Shard before taking her on a speedboat he claimed he owned. Ms Brown and Shepherd were thrown from the boat when it hit branches in the water near Wandsworth Bridge at about midnight. Charlotte Brown, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, died after plunging into the icy waters of the River Thames in December 2015 Shepherd was found clinging to the hull and Ms Brown, from Clacton in Essex, was pulled from the water unconscious and unresponsive. A post-mortem examination found she died from cold water immersion. Shepherd had been in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi since March and was absent throughout his trial. He handed himself in to Georgian police last week and, following an initial hearing, has been remanded in custody pending a full extradition hearing. His Georgian lawyers have indicated that there are grounds to fight extradition. Despite having gone on the run, Shepherd won the right to appeal against his conviction. Everyone charged with a criminal offence by the state is entitled to legal representation. Those who meet the criteria are entitled to have that representation paid for by the state through legal aid. Barristers operate on what is known as ""the cab rank rule"", meaning that, if they are available, they must represent anyone who asks them, however, solicitors can refuse to take on a client. Barristers and solicitors are bound by professional obligations once they take on a client. These include acting when a convicted defendant seeks leave to appeal their conviction. The defence lawyer's duty to represent a defendant does not fall away because they abscond. Jack Shepherd's legal team did not know his whereabouts during the trial or appeal application In Shepherd's case the court, Crown Prosecution Service and police were informed he had absconded. The CPS had an option to adjourn the trial until he was found and brought to court, or to proceed in his absence. It chose to go ahead and the judge agreed. Mr Egan says the intensity of the news coverage and the abuse and threats increased when Shepherd was granted the right to appeal. The legal team did not know Shepherd's whereabouts during the trial or appeal application. The decision by the Legal Aid Agency,externalto grant Shepherd legal aid drew particular anger, with many people concerned that his appeal would be funded by legal aid while he was on the run. Officials are reviewing what has been described as a ""loophole"" in the legal aid system. But lawyers stress it is part of our fair trial system that a defendant has the right to seek an appeal if they believe something has gone wrong in the trial. That is why legal aid extends to cover an application to appeal. That application is determined by a single judge. Mr Egan points out that an appeal is not a retrial of the evidence, it is restricted to errors of law. About 90% of applications for an appeal fail, so the fact that Shepherd's succeeded indicates that there were sufficient grounds to argue that his conviction was unsafe. Mr Egan makes the point that in our system, appeals are not earned by good behaviour nor denied to those who are disliked. Only the barrister gets paid from legal aid for an appeal, but in this case Stephen Vullo QC has taken the unusual step of writing to the Court of Appeal to say that he will act for no fee. ""Richard received a death threat which I thought was credible and quite frankly appalling,"" he says. ""He has been misrepresented in the press as somebody acting for the purposes of obtaining money. ""In fact he would receive no fee for the appeal.  Only I would receive a fee.  So I decided, against his wishes, to say I won't claim my fee so therefore, the defence cost in legal aid will be zero."" Barrister Stephen Vullo QC has waived his fee Lord Thomas is clear that: ""You simply can't have a fair trial without a lawyer who is prepared to put the defendant's case. ""What is essential is that we do nothing to undermine the position of such lawyers. In fact this case has gone far further than I have ever seen, namely making a death threat. ""That is not merely a crime in itself but a fundamental attack on our values as a society and hence the rule of law."" And Law Society president Christina Blacklaws said: ""Lost in the media frenzy surrounding the Jack Shepherd case is a fundamental principle of British justice, that regardless of the crime, the accused is entitled to legal representation, and the government has a statutory obligation to ensure this happens where required. ""If a client maintains their innocence, it is absolutely essential that a defence representative can challenge a case brought by the state.""

"Tesco has announced it will close food counters in 90 of its stores as part of a wider cost-cutting plan that will affect 9,000 staff. The UK's largest supermarket said its remaining fish, meat and deli counters in 700 stores will be run on a full-time or flexible basis. It confirmed it will no longer offer a hot food service at its canteens and that head office staff will be cut. It said up to 9,000 workers will be affected but half could be redeployed. More than 10,000 jobs have been cut at Tesco since the current chief executive, Dave Lewis, took over in 2014. The UK's biggest grocer is in the midst of trying to save Â£1.5bn as the competition between supermarkets intensifies. Supermarkets battle over price cuts Tesco shares slump after profits disappoint Christmas retail winners and losers Tesco said: ""Not only are customers shopping in different ways, but we know that they have less time available to shop too - which means they are using our counters less frequently. ""We will be making changes to the counters in our large stores to ensure that we have the right offer for customers."" For a company which makes more than a billion pounds a year in profit, and saw strong Christmas trading, Tesco seems remarkably keen to cut costs. Yet the reasons are pretty plain. Competition between supermarkets is intense. The German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which arrived on these shores in the 1990s, are now big enough to make a real impact. They're steadily eroding the market share of established players, including Tesco, and forcing them to lower their own prices. And if competition regulators allow Sainsbury's to take control of Asda, then Tesco will lose its market dominance - and be faced with a rival just as powerful as itself, with as much bargaining power among suppliers. That could place further pressure on pricing - and profit margins. In-store butchers and delicatessens may look pretty and please more discerning customers, but they need to be staffed; and staff cost money. Tesco insists the number of people using them is falling as shopping habits change. Seen in that light, getting rid of a few looks like an easy way to save a bit of cash. But Tesco needs to be careful. Removing the things that make it different from the discounters may help it to cut costs - but it risks alienating existing consumers and eroding its brand value. After all, if there is nothing to differentiate the traditional supermarkets from the discounters, won't customers simply go to whichever is cheapest - trapping everyone in an endless cycle of cost cutting and ever-decreasing margins? Pauline Foulkes, national officer at the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw), said: ""Staff at Tesco are shocked and dismayed by the scale of yet another round of potential job losses, which clearly demonstrates the pressure retailers are under in the current very difficult and uncertain economic climate, as the cost cutting continues. ""This is devastating news for staff, who have played a crucial role in Tesco's turnaround project, contributing to 12 successive quarters of growth, solid Christmas trading and over a billion pounds of profit."" As well as reducing its counters, Tesco said that after completing a detailed review: ""We're talking to colleagues about changes in some of our head office teams, moving to a simpler and leaner structure, which will allow us to focus on supporting our customers."" It also said that it made changes to the way it manages its stock which will mean ""a significantly reduced workload, with fewer hours needed to complete the routines"". Meanwhile, people who work for third party caterers that provide hot food services at some Tesco stores are also facing an uncertain future. Tesco said it will introduce self-service kitchen areas which will affect people employed by caterers. ""We are working with them to provide as much support as we can,"" said Tesco.

"Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson (right) The family of missing Cardiff City footballer Emiliano Sala are planning an underwater search. Family spokesman David Mearns told a press conference that a private search of the English Channel, paid for by fundraisers, also included fishing boats and other vessels. The underwater search is expected to begin on Sunday. Meanwhile the family has been taken on a plane to see the area that rescuers have been searching. They left Guernsey Airport at about 09:30 GMT on a chartered flight with harbourmaster David Barker. Sala's sister Romina and mother Mercedes arrived on the island on Sunday and a family spokesman said they were struggling for answers. The family travelled on a twin-engine Dornier 228-212 plane which flew from Guernsey and circled the island of Alderney. The family's flight leaving Guernsey Airport Mr Mearns told a press conference on Monday: ""We would like to thank all the people and all the companies that have offered their help,"" he said. ""We have been planning an underwater search as a next phase... there are still boats on the water... and people are still looking."" Speaking of Sala and the football community's reaction, Mr Mearns added: ""He's a really friendly person that people loved - from both clubs and any other clubs, and that's where you see the breath of the football community coming together in an extraordinarily short period of time to raise this type of money. ""So, obviously the family appreciate that, but their minds have been in a different place this week."" The family was shown the search area which included Burhou Island near Alderney An official search for 28-year-old Sala and pilot David Ibbotson, 59, of Crowle, Lincolnshire, was called off on Thursday, with Mr Barker saying the chance of them being alive was ""extremely remote"". But, after a plea from his sister not to give up, more than Â£290,000 was raised for a private search to continue - which is being led by Mr Mearns, said to be a renowned shipwreck hunter. High-profile donors to the GoFundMe page include France and PSG forward Kylian Mbappe, former West Ham midfielder Dimitri Payet and Leicester City winger Demarai Gray. More than 4,000 people have donated to the page. Cardiff to honour Sala with daffodils Argentina president backs Sala search call Agent reveals Sala flight text messages Ms Sala said of her brother: ""He's a fighter, he started his football career from very little...

Even now I can't get my head round the situation,"" he said. ""When I look at Romina and the family, it's such a difficult time. I keep looking at my own children and thinking what I would be doing now, as well."" Mr Warnock added he believed he had also been flown by Mr Ibbotson. ""I'd been on a couple of planes like that, but I think the ones I'd be on might have had two engines. ""But I'd been over the top to Nantes a couple of times, and I do think I had that pilot - who I thought was a fabulous pilot. ""So I just can't comprehend it."" Emiliano Sala was on board a plane bound for Cardiff from Nantes when it disappeared from radar Argentine striker Salasigned for the Bluebirds from Nantes on Saturday, 19 Januaryand was flying back to Wales from France when the plane disappeared from radar last Monday evening. At 19:15 GMT, Mr Ibbotson made a request to descend before losing contact with Jersey air traffic control. Mr Mearns said they had travelled to Guernsey to be near where the plane was last located and to find out about the investigation and what happens next. He said: ""This is a family that has come from Argentina with this huge shock out of nowhere and is struggling with very, very few answers about an unexplained loss."" He added the family ""still have some hope"", saying: ""They're looking at this as a missing person, a missing plane and until they are satisfied, that's the mode that we are in."" Sala's family arrived at Guernsey Airport on Sunday Romina Sala visited Cardiff last week and said she believes both Emiliano and the pilot are alive Mr Mearns said the private search would entail ""more investigative technical searches underwater"" at some point. The family have also thanked donors for their ""exceptional generosity"" after money was raised to pay for a private search. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch has begun an investigation which will look at ""all operational aspects,"" including licensing and flight plans.

"This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall US President Donald Trump says he is sceptical a deal can be reached on border security before government funding expires again next month. He spoke tothe Wall Street Journal,externalas 800,000 federal employees returned to work after the longest ever closure of federal agencies, lasting 35 days. The Republican president said he doubts he would lower the sum he is prepared to accept for a US-Mexico border wall. Congress must agree a new bill by 15 February to avoid another shutdown. The US economy lost $3bn (Â£2.2bn) from the closure of federal agencies, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office on Monday. Its analysis said the economy overall shed about $11bn during the five-week period, but about $8bn would be recouped as employees receive back pay. A committee of lawmakers from both parties is poised to negotiate, but Mr Trump told the Journal the chances of a political breakthrough are ""less than 50-50"". US shutdown cost $3bn, says budget office How Trump's own book explains his battle for the wall Asked if he would accept less than the $5.7bn he wants to build a border barrier, he said: ""I doubt it."" ""I have to do it right,"" he added, noting that he has not ruled out a second shutdown in as many months to accomplish his signature campaign pledge. The president also sounded unwilling to make any significant concession to strike a grand bargain with Democrats. Mr Trump said he doubted he would back citizenship for immigrants who entered the US without documentation as children. Eighteen ways the US shutdown is hurting Trump's border wall - in seven charts On Friday, the president bowed to mounting pressure to end the crippling shutdown of about a quarter of the US government. But while Congress quickly passed a bill to fund federal agencies, Mr Trump again came away without a dollar of taxpayers' money for his long-promised border wall. His perceived retreat provoked a welter of conservative criticism, prompting him unusually to lash out at his favourite cable show, Fox News.

"This video can not be played Sabine Weyand: Risk of a 'crash out' is high There is a high risk of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal by accident, the EU's deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand has said. She said there was ""full ownership of what was agreed"" in the EU, but ""no ownership"" of it in the UK Parliament. And it was a challenge to see how a majority for any deal could be built among MPs, she added. The EU side were agreed that a time-limit to the Irish backstop defeated the purpose of having one, she added. It comes as Theresa May addressed a meeting of Tory MPs, the day before all MPs vote on a series of amendments to the PM's plans that could shape the future direction of Brexit. BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said numerous sources at the meeting revealed the government would be whipping its MPs to vote for one amendment that proposes the backstop be replaced by ""alternative arrangements"". The Irish backstop - the ""insurance policy"" in the withdrawal deal - has been the controversial sticking point. It is intended to ensure that whatever else happens, there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU. Both the UK and the EU believe that bringing back border checks could put the peace process at risk. But the current wording of the backstop plan has proved unpopular with many Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs who are concerned that it could tie the UK to many EU rules indefinitely. Brexit: A really simple guide A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Kuenssberg: Is Parliament's Brexit fog about to clear? No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' Speaking at an event in Brussels, Ms Weyand - deputy to the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier - said other options for the Irish border had been extensively discussed and referred to the months-long negotiations with her UK counterparts. She said that a lot of the discussion of the withdrawal agreement in the UK was ""uninhibited by any knowledge"" of what it actually contained. EU leaders were concerned about extending the two-year Article 50 process, she said, because Brexit was ""eating up the political energy"" for solving other issues. She added that Mrs May's secrecy and reliance on a small group of people had been a ""handicap"" in getting support for the deal. She said: ""There is a very high risk of a crash-out, not by design, but by accident... ""The crash-out is the only scenario that does not require anyone to take any action or take any decisions."" By Adam Fleming, BBC Brussels correspondent In Brussels, Sabine Weyand is known for her cheerful bluntness. Now the public have seen it too. She lobbed a series of truth bombs at Westminster, saying MPs are criticising an agreement many of them haven't read and the cabinet's failure to ""own"" the deal is making it harder to approve. And she contrasted her style of regular consultations with EU leaders and the European Parliament with Theresa May's reliance on a small circle of advisors - ""a big handicap."" She will be accused in the UK of being undiplomatic, but many of her colleagues on the EU side of the negotiations feel equally fed up. And maybe she was also trying to tell her ultimate bosses - EU leaders - that things are not looking good. Meanwhile, Mrs May is being urged to secure changes from the EU to the Northern Irish backstop as part of her Brexit deal to get it past Parliament. Ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson says winning a ""freedom clause"" would be ""unadulterated good Brexit news"". But the Irish deputy PM Simon Coveney says changes to the backstop - aimed at preventing a hard border - would not be acceptable. The DUP's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson called on the government to ""be tough"" and ""face down the stubbornness of Dublin and Brussels"". ""It's time for the Irish to work constructively and advocate for a sensible trading arrangement with their biggest market in Great Britain,"" he said. Is Parliament, finally, at long last, really on the verge of giving a clear signal about what it wants to do about Brexit? As much as I can feel your pain, don't bet on it. You've probably heard a lot of noise about the amendments that MPs will be voting on tomorrow night, not least from me. But there is no guarantee at all that any of them will pass. First, some Tory MPs are coming round to the government's deal, if they can cut out the bit they don't like (yes, of course, the backstop.) A lot of them have signed up to a way of making that clear, by supporting Sir Graham Brady's amendment. And if enough of them get on board it would allow the prime minister, in theory, to go back to the EU and say, tah dah! Look! I can get this deal through apart from this really pesky part, which might, as we've been reporting in the last few days, move things forward, despite the very strong warnings from Dublin that it can't happen. But, I wouldn't bet very much that Brexiteers will switch to back it in a coherent and decisive way. Read more from Laura After Mrs May's deal was rejected in the Commons on 15 January by 432 votes to 202, opposition and backbench MPs have been tabling amendments to the plans. While MPs will not deliver their final verdict on the deal on Tuesday, they will vote on the amendments and, if one is passed, show the PM what changes to the deal might be enough to get a modified version of the deal through Parliament. The prime minister's official spokesman said it will be followed ""as soon as possible"" by a second meaningful vote on whatever deal has been secured with Brussels. ""The prime minister is absolutely committed to leaving the EU with a deal, but clearly if we are to obtain parliamentary support for that deal some changes are going to have to be made,"" the spokesman said. One amendment that has the backing of senior Tory Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, calls for the backstop to be replaced by ""alternative arrangements"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Graham said: ""I'm hoping that the way in which the amendment is crafted, it can attract that very broad support. And if we can win the vote on my amendment I think it gives the prime minister enormous firepower."" He said the looming exit date is helping to ""focus minds"", adding: ""I think we've already seen across the European Union a little bit more flexibility and a little creativity creeping in."" A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Brexiteers say if the non-binding amendment is passed it will give the PM more leeway to win concessions from the EU. But the European Research Group, a group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs headed by Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, has said it would not back the amendment from Sir Graham on Tuesday. Is Rees-Mogg ready to compromise? Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson suggested,externalMrs May could get the EU to change the text of her agreement to include an expiry date for the backstop, or include a mechanism allowing the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it. Mr Johnson said: ""If the PM secures that change - a proper UK-sized perforation in the fabric of the backstop itself - I have no doubt that she will have the whole country full-throatedly behind her."" This video can not be played ""If we leave without a deal we will be less safe... than remaining part of the EU""  former head of the Security Service MI5 tells The World at One One of the architects of the Good Friday Agreement, Lord Bew, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the backstop must be made ""explicitly temporary and in legally binding terms"" in order to avoid undermining the Agreement. He said: ""There is a conflict, the backstop advertises itself as defending the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects. ""But you only have to look at what it says about agricultureâ¦ and you will see that you have a totally different top-down approach to dealing with matters of agriculture concern north and south to that in the Good Friday Agreement, where incidentally it's the very top item for co-operation."" Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop No change to backstop, Ireland insists Reiteratingearlier comments that the EU would not ratify a deal without the backstop being included, the Irish Republic's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Simon Coveney said:  ""Even in a no-deal Brexit situation every party and every MP in the UK will have a responsibility to ensure there is no return to a hard border and Northern Ireland is protected."" He added: ""The EU has been clear that the backstop is an integral part of the withdrawal agreement."" And European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas reiterated that the withdrawal agreement had been agreed with the UK government, was endorsed by EU leaders and was ""not open for renegotiation"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, and the prime minister has faced repeated calls to rule out the prospect of leaving without a deal if her agreement does not win approval. It is also possible that MPs will back amendments on Tuesday which call on Mrs May to rule out no deal or to delay the UK's departure from the EU. An amendment tabled by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Conservative MP Nick Boles could extend Article 50 - which triggers the UK's withdrawal from the EU - by nine months, unless the prime minister can secure a deal by the end of February. Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Ms Cooper said she was not seeking to ""block Brexit"", adding that the bill would be amendable - meaning MPs could vote on how long any extension would be. Mr Boles told the Today programme that Tuesday's vote would be ""very, very close"", adding: ""We are going to need support from all sides of the house. Jeremy Corbyn has made some warm noises."" Mr Boles, who said he would support Sir Graham's amendment if it is selected, said MPs must ""seize the moment"" at the vote, as it offers ""probably the only motion of its kind that's going to be amendable"". Meanwhile, areport from MPs on the Exiting the EU Committee,externalsays the government must rule out a no-deal Brexit. Committee chairman Hilary Benn said: ""The suggestion that the UK might opt for a no-deal outcome but assume that the EU will continue to act in a co-operative manner to avoid disruption, cannot seriously constitute the policy of any responsible government."" However, a Tory member of the committee, Craig Mackinlay, said he ""disowned"" the report findings as  ""just more Project Fear from a group of MPs who have never wanted the UK to leave the EU"".

"The government will support a backbench amendment to the Brexit deal that calls for the planned Irish backstop to be replaced by ""alternative arrangements"". Tory MPs will be told to vote for Sir Graham Brady's proposal when the Commons votes on a series of amendments to Theresa May's plan on Tuesday. The government will also order its MPs to vote against a move which could delay Brexit by up to nine months. But Commons Speaker John Bercow will decide which amendments get voted on. Senior EU representatives have repeatedly ruled out re-opening negotiations with the UK over Brexit, and insisted the backstop - the insurance policy against a return of a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - must be included in any deal. Meanwhile, the governmentannounced its plans for EU citizens coming to the UK,externalin the case of a no-deal Brexit, saying it would ""seek to end free movement as soon as possible"". The Home Office said that for a ""transitional period"" after Brexit - set for 29 March - EU citizens will be able to enter the UK to visit, work or study as they do now, but after three months they would need to apply for ""European Temporary Leave to Remain"", which would last three years. Home Secretary Sajid Javid said it was a ""practical approach"" and would ""minimise disruption to ensure the UK stays open for business"". Brexit: A really simple guide A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Kuenssberg: Is Parliament's Brexit fog about to clear? No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' MPs have been tabling amendments to the government's plans to try to influence the direction of Brexit since Mrs May lost the vote on her original deal earlier this month. After Mr Bercow decides on Tuesday which ones are put forward, voting will take place on them from 19:00 GMT. The prime minister's official spokesman said it will be followed ""as soon as possible"" by a second meaningful vote on whatever deal has been secured with Brussels. Mrs May addressed a meeting of her backbench MPs on Monday night and numerous sources told the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson that she would be backing what is known as the ""Brady amendment"" -  a measure put forward by Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 committee of Conservative MPs. Sir Graham wants to see the Irish backstop replaced by what he calls ""alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border"", but would otherwise support the prime minister's deal. As a result of government support, Tory MPs John Baron and Andrew Murrison have dropped their amendments - which proposed a time limit to the backstop and the ability to leave the arrangement at a time of the UK's choosing.

The prime minister appealed to her MPs to give her something to take back to Brussels for further discussions, saying ""don't just talk about it - you have to vote for it"". Speaking to BBC News, Sir Graham said he hoped the backing from the government would see the DUP - who Mrs May relies on for support in Parliament - get behind his amendment. And some Labour MPs had already expressed their support to him as well. ""This is a sensible way of reaching some compromise and trying to move things on in the national interest,"" he added. But Eurosceptic Tories have already said they will not back the amendment. The European Research Group, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, said they want the government to table its own amendment that would commit to reopening the withdrawal agreement - the part of Mrs May's deal that lays out how the UK will leave the EU - to remove the backstop. By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent Behind closed doors, Theresa May made an impassioned plea to her own MPs to send a clear message to Brussels - backing the amendment from the chairman of the Conservative backbench committee Sir Graham Brady would signal that Parliament could pass her deal, if the EU was wiling to make changes to the backstop. While Conservative MPs will be instructed to give the amendment their backing, long-standing Leave campaigners in the European Research Group have announced they won't support it. They are insisting on specific legal changes to the 585-page withdrawal agreement. And the pro-Leave DUP has yet to declare how its MPs will vote. Tory MPs are also being told they should vote against an amendment which would delay Brexit unless a deal is agreed in the next month - with some ministers pressing for a free vote. But for all the talk, it will not be until Tuesday night that we see the amendments they can support or reject. Mrs May has also faced calls from Labour, and a number of other MPs, to rule out the scenario in which the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal. A number of Remain-backing MPs are supporting an amendment by Labour MP Yvette Cooper that would create a bill enabling Article 50 - the mechanism by which the UK leaves the EU on 29 March - to be delayed by up to nine months if the government does not have a plan agreed in Parliament by the end of February. Some, including Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, had called for a free vote on such an amendment, allowing them to give it their backing. And in an interview with BBC's Newsnight last week, Ms Rudd said she would not rule out resigning over the issue. Justice Secretary David Gauke also said MPs should be able to vote according to their personal views. But Mrs May told the meeting that the government would be whipping against it - meaning it would not be a free vote. Mrs May took the deal she had negotiated with the EU to Parliament on 15 January for a ""meaningful vote"" - having delayed it from December - but MPs rejected it by 432 votes to 202. The main sticking point was the backstop - the ""insurance policy"" intended to ensure that whatever else happens, there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after Brexit. Both the UK and the EU believe that bringing back border checks could put the peace process at risk, but critics of the plan say the backstop could tie the UK to many EU rules indefinitely. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But the Irish deputy PM Simon Coveney has said changes to the backstop proposal would not be acceptable. This video can not be played Sabine Weyand: Risk of a 'crash out' is high The EU's deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand also said on Monday that there was a high risk of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal by accident and that other options for the Irish border had been extensively discussed with her UK counterparts during negotiations. She said there was ""full ownership of what was agreed"" in the EU, but ""no ownership"" of it in the UK Parliament. And she added that the EU side were agreed that a time-limit to the Irish backstop defeated the purpose of having one. Ms Weyand said: ""There is a very high risk of a crash-out, not by design, but by accident... ""The crash-out is the only scenario that does not require anyone to take any action or take any decisions."" A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules.

"Is Parliament, finally, at long last, really on the verge of giving a clear signal about what it wants to do about Brexit? As much as I can feel your pain, don't bet on it. You've probably heard a lot of noise about the amendments that MPs will be voting on tomorrow night, not least from me. But there is no guarantee at all that any of them will pass. First, some Tory MPs are coming round to the government's deal, if they can cut out the bit they don't like (yes, of course, the backstop.) A lot of them have signed up to a way of making that clear, by supporting Sir Graham Brady's amendment. And if enough of them get on board it would allow the prime minister, in theory, to go back to the EU and say, tah dah! Look! I can get this deal through apart from this really pesky part, which might, as we've been reporting in the last few days, move things forward, despite the very strong warnings from Dublin that it can't happen. But, I wouldn't bet very much that Brexiteers will switch to back it in a coherent and decisive way. Brexit: A really simple guide May urged to secure backstop concessions No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' As I wrote last week, some Tory insiders are pushing for the prime minister to put her own amendment forward to say what she really wants. And if she doesn't, well, she may well be simply stuck in the same predicament. By the end of today it will be clearer where the numbers might lie. Iain Duncan Smith, the influential Brexiteer, has just told me: ""The government should now place its own amendment setting out what it wants to achieve in the negotiations. This is the time when the PM must make clear her intentions in the negotiation, to seek support. We need more than back bench amendments with nods and winks from the government, we need clarity and purpose."" In other words, if the PM is willing to front-up and say she will go and demand Brussels changes the backstop, they might play ball. But if she doesn't, don't expect the Brexiteer votes she needs to be suddenly forthcoming. But the government has an additional dilemma. If they try to stop MPs voting for the Brady plan (you can read more about it and the other amendments here) there's likely to be a rebellion against that attempt too. On the other side, there are MPs trying to create and take control of a set of brakes to stop the government from heading towards leaving the EU without a formal deal. Labour's Yvette Cooper's attempt is the most prominent and would be the most significant because it would commit to changing the law in a bill that would put Parliament in charge if the government can't get things sorted out by the end of February. But it doesn't have much of a hope of passing if Labour's frontbench team don't get behind it. They have made supportive noises about it, because their priority is to remove the possibility of a 'no deal' Brexit. But they have reservations about potentially delaying Brexit until Christmas, and indeed, just like the Tories, if they try to get MPs to vote for it officially by whipping the vote, they too would face their own rebellion because some MPs are implacably opposed. Again, by this evening we should have more sense of where the decisions might land. You wouldn't be blamed for thinking that all seems like Parliamentary fog. But until we see the numbers in the votes tomorrow, this week may not be the occasion when Parliament's view on Brexit becomes that much clearer.  (Sorry!)

"Protests against the potential return of a hard border have been taking place on the island of Ireland The backstop element of the Brexit plan is ""not going to change"", Ireland's deputy prime minister has said. The proposal - aimed at preventing a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - played a major part in Theresa May's deal being voted down by a historic margin last week. But Simon Coveney told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the EU would not ratify a deal without it. Health Secretary Matt Hancock called the comments a ""negotiating position"". Mr Hancock also denied reports that the government was ""specifically"" planning for martial law if the UK left without a deal  - but he did not rule it out. He said that the government ""looks at all the options in all circumstances,"" but when pressed by Andrew Marr, the health secretary added: ""It remains on the statute book, but it isn't the focus of our attention."" Martial law involves the suspension of normal law, and temporary rule by the military. It can include measures such as curfews and travel restrictions. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Reality Check: Red lines on the Irish border Could EU offer an extra 'couple of weeks'? The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March, with or without a deal. If a hard border comes about, people and goods passing between Ireland and the UK will need to be checked. Meanwhile,a leaked diplomatic note seen by the Guardian,externalclaims that the president of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, has told Mrs May that to revisit the backstop issue she would need to agree a permanent customs union with the EU. A customs union would mean that no tariffs would be put on goods travelling between the UK and the 27 member states of the EU, but that the UK could not negotiate its own trade agreements with other countries. The comments come ahead of a crunch week in Parliament. Mrs May will return to the Commons on Tuesday for a vote on her deal, which includes the withdrawal agreement - the so-called ""divorce deal"" on how the UK leaves the EU - and the political declaration - a statement on the future relationship. It was voted down by 432 to 202 votes last week, with hard-line Brexiteers in her own party and members of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - on whom Mrs May relies for votes in Parliament - citing the backstop as their main reason for voting against it. A number of MPs have been tabling amendmentsin a bid to force the government to change direction. One amendment, put forward by Labour's Yvette Cooper, seeks to introduce a bill that would allow the government to extend Article 50 - the mechanism by which the UK leaves the EU - by up to nine months in order to get a deal agreed in Westminster. Yvette Cooper has the support of a number of MPs, including Conservative Remainers Also appearing on Andrew Marr, Ms Cooper said she was not seeking to ""block Brexit"" and said the bill would be amendable - meaning MPs could vote on how long any extension would be. She appealed for the support of the prime minister and MPs, as well as for the backing of her own party leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying: ""We can't keep waiting for other people to sort this out."" ""We can't carry on with a kind of game of chicken,"" she said. ""In the end, someone has to take some responsibility and say, 'if the prime minister runs out of time, she may need some more time'. ""That is not about blocking Brexit, that is about being responsible and making sure you can get a Brexit deal."" Please upgrade your browser The UK is allowed to scrap Article 50 altogether - and halt Brexit - but to extend it, it would need the approval of the EU. Mr Coveney said Ireland ""won't be an obstacle"" if the UK wanted to go down the route of extending Article 50, adding: ""Ireland wants to help in this process."" ""Britain and Ireland are two islands next to each other,"" he said. ""We have to work out these things together andstop talking about games of chicken."" But Mr Hancock said delaying Brexit would not help solve the arguments between MPs. ""You can't just vote for delay,"" he said. ""You've got to vote positively for a deal"". Allow Twitter content?

Other amendments being put forward ahead of Tuesday's vote include a plan for putting a time limit on the backstop and another for scrapping it altogether. These are in answer to critics who dislike the backstop because they believe it keeps the UK too closely aligned to the EU and fear that it could become permanent. However, Mr Coveney said: ""The European Parliament will not ratify a Withdrawal Agreement that doesn't have a backstop in it. It's as simple as that. ""The backstop is already a compromise. It is a series of compromises. It was designed around British red lines."" The former chief constable of the police in Northern Ireland (PSNI) echoed previous warnings that the return of a hard border between the two countries would become a target for dissident republicans. Speaking to RTE, Sir Hugh Orde said there would be no way to avoid security patrols if the UK left without a deal, and security officers would be ""at risk"". This video can not be played Reality Check unpacks the basics of the backstop. Across Sunday's newspapers and political TV programmes, politicians clashed over whether leaving the EU without a deal should remain an option for the government or not. Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom wrote in the Sunday Times that trying to rule out a no deal was a ""thinly veiled attempt to stop Brexit"". But despite his colleague's words, defence minister Tobias Ellwood wrote: ""It is simply wrong for government and business to invest any more time and money in a no deal outcome that will make us poorer, weaker and smaller in the eyes of the world. ""It is now time to rule out the very possibility of no deal."" Mr Ellwood also said members of his own party seeking to ""crash out"" without a deal ""risk inflaming a dangerous battle for the soul of the Conservative Party"" - saying it could determine the outcome of the next election. But Education Secretary Damian Hinds told Sky News no deal needed to remain on the table, although it would ""not be a good outcome"". This video can not be played What happens in the event of no deal? In other developments,the government is going to consult Parliament on whether to work extra hoursand lose their February half-term break in order to get Brexit delivered by 29 March. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the government's demand was a way of Mrs May sending a signal to MPs that she intends to stick to the planned March departure.

"Amber the red panda is back in the zoo after her brief escape A rare red panda which escaped from Belfast Zoo has been found ""safe and well"". Amber was discovered in a garden in Collinbridge, Newtownabbey, less than a mile from the zoo. She had escaped from her enclosure on Sunday afternoon and was first sighted later that day at 17:30 GMT. The cub, which was born in June and is now almost an adult size, was found on Monday after a spot of sightseeing in the city. Exotic beasts that roamed Belfast's streets ""We are pleased to report that Amber has been safely returned to Belfast Zoo after a short time exploring the local area,"" said the zoo's manager, Alyn Cairns. ""We would like to thank all of those involved in the search for our missing red panda. We received several calls from local residents who reported sightings which helped the search team to track its location."" Red pandas are an endangered species and slightly larger than a domestic cat. Belfast Zoo has a family of four red pandas and the escapee received a full health check by the zoo vet as soon as she returned home. ""Amber is in good health but continues to be observed,"" the zoo's statement said. The family of four red pandas at Belfast Zoo The zoo's manager added that staff discovered ""a power fault"" in an electric fence in red panda habitat shortly after Amber went missing.

"Letting a toddler spend lots of time using screens may delay their development of skills such as language and sociability, according to a large Canadian study. The research, which tracked nearly 2,500 two-year-olds, is the latest piece of evidence in the debate about how much screen time is safe for kids. In Canada and the US, experts say children should not use screens before they are at least 18 months old. ButUK guidelines  set no such limit.,external The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health says there is not enough evidence, even when you include this new study, for a ""direct toxic effect"". Why did child screen advice not go further? UK could ban social media over suicide images How to limit excessive screen time Parents 'struggle to get children off devices' Mums were surveyed (between 2011 and 2016) about screen use, and filled out questionnaires about their child's skills and development at ages two, three and five. Screen time included watching TV programmes, films or videos, gaming, and using a computer, tablet, phone or any other screen-based device. At the age of two, the children were clocking up around 17 hours of screen time per week. This increased to around 25 hours a week by the age of three but dropped to around 11 hours a week at the age of five, when the children started primary school. The findings,published in the JAMA Paediatrics,,externalsuggest increased viewing begins before any delay in development can be seen, rather than children with poor developmental performance then going on to have more screen time. But it is not clear whether screen time - including how much or what type - is directly to blame. Screen use might just go hand-in-hand with other things linked to delayed development, such as upbringing and how a child's remaining leisure time is spent. When young children are observing screens, they may be missing important opportunities to practise and master other important skills. In theory, it could get in the way of social interactions and may limit how much time young children spend running, climbing and practising other physical skills - although they may still eventually catch up. Even without solid proof of harm, Dr Sheri Madigan and colleagues say it still makes sense to moderate children's screen time and make sure it doesn't interfere with ""face-to-face interactions or family time"". They also said that, with hindsight, perhaps they should have followed the children from an even younger age because it is becoming increasingly common for 12-month-old babies to be watching and using screens. It is a good question, without a satisfactory answer. The new study does not make any recommendation about how much is too much. Some of the two-year-olds were getting more than four hours a day or 28 hours a week of screen use, according to their mums. TheAmerican Association of Paediatrics' (AAP) guidelines,externalon screen time say: For children younger than 18 months, avoid use of screen media other than video-chatting Parents of children 18 to 24 months of age who want to introduce digital media should choose high-quality programming, and watch it with their children to help them understand what they are seeing For children ages two to five years, limit screen use to one hour per day of high-quality programmes. Again, parents should be watching it with their children. For children ages six and older, place consistent limits, making sure screen time does not get in the way of sleep and physical activity. The Canadian Paediatric Society goes further,,externalsaying screen time for children younger than two is not recommended. Data for the UK shows internet use among children has increased in recent years The UK's Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) put out guidelines earlier this year, but sets no limit. It says ""evidence is weak for a threshold to guide children and parents to the appropriate level of screen time, and we are unable to recommend a cut-off for children's screen time overall"". Instead, it advises families to ask themselves: Is screen time in your household controlled? Does screen use interfere with what your family want to do? Does screen use interfere with sleep? Are you able to control snacking during screen time? If a family can ask themselves these questions, and are satisfied with the answers, then they can be reassured that they are ""likely to be doing as well as they can with this tricky issue"", says the RCPCH. The AAP advises families to designate media-free times together, such as dinner or driving, as well as media-free locations at home, such as bedrooms. The RCPCH says adults should consider their own use of screens and set a good example. Most experts also advise that children are not exposed to screens for an hour before bed, so that their brains have time to wind down for sleep. These statistics are for the UK, based on data for 2017 Dr Bernadka Dubicka, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""We still need more research to tell us which children are most vulnerable to the harms of screen use and the impact it may have on a child's mental health. ""We also need to look at the effects of different content as there are also many positive ways of using screens."" How much screen time is 'too much'?

"The Department for Education hopes it can convince new recruits to stay in the classroom with cash incentives Cash incentives and a better work-life balance are part of a new attempt to solve England's teacher shortage. Plans published on Monday by ministers will offer some young secondary teachers Â£5,000 in their third and fifth years in the classroom - on top of initial Â£20,000 training bursaries. Young teachers could also have some protected time for extra training. Head teachers' unions said more help for young recruits was essential to tackle the crisis in teacher numbers. Currently, teachers in subjects with shortages, such as physics, chemistry, and languages,can receive a bursary of up to Â£26,000,external, but there are no further payments. The so-called ""early career payment"" scheme, which rewards teachers for staying in the classroom, has already been trialled for maths teachers. Labour has criticised the plan, saying the plan will not reverse ""six consecutive years"" of missed teacher recruitment targets. By 2025 the number of secondary school pupils in England will have gone up by 15%. For several years England has had an unfolding teacher crisis, with too few starting to train and too many leaving. In 2018/19 the number starting training as secondary school teachers was 17% below target. Subjects such as physics, chemistry and computing face the largest shortfalls. This has led to a growing proportion of lessons in some secondary schools being taught by teachers who are not specialists. And there has been growing concern that young teachers are leaving because they feel overworked, burnt out and disillusioned. Of those that started in 2012, a third were not teaching five years later. This video can not be played Why we quit teaching Research has consistently shown workload as a bigger factor than pay, even though teachers have also fallen behind other graduate professions. Even so the government accepted the advice this year from independent advisers to allow a pay rise of up to 3.5% for many teachers. A teacher's minimum starting salary in England is Â£22,917 rising to Â£28,660 in inner London according to their pay review body. Estimates of other graduate starting salaries are about Â£30,000 to Â£45,000 in sectors such as banking, which also seek to recruit maths and science graduates. The plans published on Monday are firmly aimed at not just recruiting but also keeping more young teachers in their jobs. For the first couple of years in work they are being promised more support in training, and a reduced timetable of teaching. That could mean an hour or two a week of protected time, around 5% of the timetable, for teachers in their second year. Education Secretary Damian Hinds says he also wants to reduce the mounds of paperwork that leave teachers demoralised. ""I think teachers work too many hours - aggravated by unnecessary tasks like excessive marking and data entry, spending more than half their time on non-teaching tasks,"" he says. That will depend on the school inspectorate Ofsted delivering on its recent promise to not ask for so much data to be collected. Minsters want head teachers to push back against Ofsted if they think demands for paperwork are unreasonable. Now that more than half of secondary schools are academies, Mr Hinds has little direct control over how they organise workload. As we reported last year, some schools are already turning their back on excessive marking. This video can not be played The primary school that abolished marking For many young teachers it's when they start to think about having their own family that work-life balance becomes critical. Teaching is a largely female profession, but it is notoriously difficult to work part-time as a secondary school teacher. The education secretary is promising a matching service for teachers looking for job shares. In practice, a culture change among head teachers may also be required to make it work as they draw up the timetables. The plan also contains financial incentives to keep young teachers in their jobs. A lot of taxpayers' cash has been spent in recent years on bursaries toattract graduates in shortage subjects such as maths, physics, chemistry, and languages.,external That added up to Â£191m in 2016/17 in England. They've been criticised as poor value for money, with some trainees taking the one-off tax-free lump sums of up to Â£26,000 and still leaving teaching a few years later. So the government has already been piloting what it calls early career payments for trainee maths teachers. Under these schemes, there are also payments of Â£5,000 in the third and fifth year of teaching - on top of a one-off Â£20,000 bursary at the beginning of training. This approach will now be tried more widely - but it is not known for which subjects. Over the coming years a sizeable proportion of the money spent on bursaries to train could be shifted to incentives to keeping teachers in the profession. Teachers working in more challenging schools might receive more. But previous attempts to tackle the shortage of teachers in England have faltered. The government abandoned the idea of a national teaching service which was meant to parachute teachers into schools in deprived areas. Plans to recruit ex-servicemen and women were also widely described as a flop because so few qualified. The government has been criticised in the past for failing to get a grip on the problem, or even acknowledge how serious it is for schools. After the 2015 election, the schools minister Nick Gibb insisted there was no crisis in teacher recruitment, despite the strong anecdotal evidence from head teachers to the contrary. The newly-announced plan is bigger, and it's trying to tackle several of the key issues at the same time. That's one reason, perhaps, why Geoff Barton, from the secondary head teachers' union ASCL, says this could be a ""game changer"". Carole Willis, chief executive of the National Foundation for Education Research, welcomed the plan but questioned whether ""the pace of implementation proposed is fast enough to deliver what is needed as pupil numbers in secondary schools continue to rise"". Labour Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner said: ""Teacher recruitment targets have been missed for six consecutive years and teachers are leaving the profession in record numbers. ""Nothing in this strategy will reverse years of real terms pay cuts and the huge cuts to school budgets that have made it impossible for schools to recruit the staff they need.""

"A no-deal Brexit threatens the UK's food security and will lead to higher prices and empty shelves in the short-term, retailers are warning. Sainsbury's, Asda and McDonald's are among those warning stockpiling fresh food is impossible and that the UK is very reliant on the EU for produce. The warning comes in a letter from the British Retail Consortium and is signed by several of the major food retailers. It comes ahead of crucial votes in Parliament on Tuesday. Retailers have told me that they fear shelves would be left empty if there were significant disruptions to supplies. The letter from the retailers, and seen by the BBC, says there will be ""significant risks"" to maintaining the choice, quality and shelf life of food. ""We are extremely concerned that our customers will be among the first to experience the realities of a no deal Brexit,"" the letter says. Brexit: A really simple guide A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Is Parliament's Brexit fog about to clear? MPs will consider a series of amendments to Theresa May's plans that could shape the future direction of Brexit. While it will not be MPs' final verdict on the deal, they will vote on the amendments and, if one is passed, it will illustrate what changes to the deal might be enough to get a modified version of the deal through Parliament. Retailers have been reluctant to intervene in the Brexit debate but are doing so now as the UK's departure date from the EU approaches. In the letter, they urge MPs to work together ""urgently to find a solution that avoids the shock of a no-deal Brexit"". A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. The letter uses the government's own estimate that freight through Calais may fall 87% from current levels, threatening the availability and shelf life of many products. It expresses worry over tariffs, with only 10% of the UK's food imports currently subject to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. If the UK were to revert to WTO rules, the retailers warn that would ""greatly increase import costs that would in turn put upward pressure on food prices"". The other signatories to the letter include the chief executives of M&S, KFC, Co-Op, and Lidl. The letter spells out the UK's food relationship with Europe, with nearly one third of the food in the UK coming from the EU. ""In March, the situation becomes more acute as UK produce is out of season,"" the letter says. At that time of year, 90% of lettuces, 80% of tomatoes and 70% of soft fruit sold in the UK is grown in the EU, the letter says. ""As this produce is fresh and perishable, it needs to be moved quickly from farms to our stores,"" the retailers say. Their letter says that stockpiling fresh food is impossible and that the complex, just-in-time supply chain through which food is imported into the UK will be ""significantly disrupted"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It adds it is difficult to stockpile any more produce as ""all frozen and chilled storage is already been used"". ""While we have been working closely with our suppliers on contingency plans, it is not possible to mitigate all the risks to our supply chains and we fear significant disruption as a result if there is no Brexit deal,"" the retailers say in the letter to MPs. The retailers say that while they are looking for alternate supply routes, there are limited options and not enough ferries. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a high level of food security built upon a diverse range of sources including strong domestic production and imports from other countries. This will continue to be the case whether we leave the EU with or without a deal."" They added the government had ""well established"" ways of working with the food industry to prevent disruption. The letter comes after a report from MPs on the Exiting the EU Committee said the government must rule out a no-deal Brexit. Committee chairman Hilary Benn said: ""The suggestion that the UK might opt for a no-deal outcome but assume that the EU will continue to act in a co-operative manner to avoid disruption, cannot seriously constitute the policy of any responsible government."" However, a Tory member of the committee, Craig Mackinlay, said he ""disowned"" the report findings as ""just more Project Fear from a group of MPs who have never wanted the UK to leave the EU"". A number of amendments are being voted on by MPs on Tuesday - although the Irish deputy PM says changes to the backstop - aimed at preventing a hard border - would not be acceptable. The backstop is the ""insurance policy"" in the withdrawal deal, intended to ensure there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU.

"Protests against the potential return of a hard border have been taking place on the island of Ireland The backstop element of the Brexit plan is ""not going to change"", Ireland's deputy prime minister has said. The proposal - aimed at preventing a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland - played a major part in Theresa May's deal being voted down by a historic margin last week. But Simon Coveney told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the EU would not ratify a deal without it. Health Secretary Matt Hancock called the comments a ""negotiating position"". Mr Hancock also denied reports that the government was ""specifically"" planning for martial law if the UK left without a deal  - but he did not rule it out. He said that the government ""looks at all the options in all circumstances,"" but when pressed by Andrew Marr, the health secretary added: ""It remains on the statute book, but it isn't the focus of our attention."" Martial law involves the suspension of normal law, and temporary rule by the military. It can include measures such as curfews and travel restrictions. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Reality Check: Red lines on the Irish border Could EU offer an extra 'couple of weeks'? The UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March, with or without a deal. If a hard border comes about, people and goods passing between Ireland and the UK will need to be checked. Meanwhile,a leaked diplomatic note seen by the Guardian,externalclaims that the president of the European Commission, Jean Claude Juncker, has told Mrs May that to revisit the backstop issue she would need to agree a permanent customs union with the EU. A customs union would mean that no tariffs would be put on goods travelling between the UK and the 27 member states of the EU, but that the UK could not negotiate its own trade agreements with other countries. The comments come ahead of a crunch week in Parliament. Mrs May will return to the Commons on Tuesday for a vote on her deal, which includes the withdrawal agreement - the so-called ""divorce deal"" on how the UK leaves the EU - and the political declaration - a statement on the future relationship. It was voted down by 432 to 202 votes last week, with hard-line Brexiteers in her own party and members of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - on whom Mrs May relies for votes in Parliament - citing the backstop as their main reason for voting against it. A number of MPs have been tabling amendmentsin a bid to force the government to change direction. One amendment, put forward by Labour's Yvette Cooper, seeks to introduce a bill that would allow the government to extend Article 50 - the mechanism by which the UK leaves the EU - by up to nine months in order to get a deal agreed in Westminster. Yvette Cooper has the support of a number of MPs, including Conservative Remainers Also appearing on Andrew Marr, Ms Cooper said she was not seeking to ""block Brexit"" and said the bill would be amendable - meaning MPs could vote on how long any extension would be. She appealed for the support of the prime minister and MPs, as well as for the backing of her own party leader Jeremy Corbyn, saying: ""We can't keep waiting for other people to sort this out."" ""We can't carry on with a kind of game of chicken,"" she said. ""In the end, someone has to take some responsibility and say, 'if the prime minister runs out of time, she may need some more time'. ""That is not about blocking Brexit, that is about being responsible and making sure you can get a Brexit deal."" Please upgrade your browser The UK is allowed to scrap Article 50 altogether - and halt Brexit - but to extend it, it would need the approval of the EU. Mr Coveney said Ireland ""won't be an obstacle"" if the UK wanted to go down the route of extending Article 50, adding: ""Ireland wants to help in this process."" ""Britain and Ireland are two islands next to each other,"" he said. ""We have to work out these things together andstop talking about games of chicken."" But Mr Hancock said delaying Brexit would not help solve the arguments between MPs. ""You can't just vote for delay,"" he said. ""You've got to vote positively for a deal"". Allow Twitter content?

Other amendments being put forward ahead of Tuesday's vote include a plan for putting a time limit on the backstop and another for scrapping it altogether. These are in answer to critics who dislike the backstop because they believe it keeps the UK too closely aligned to the EU and fear that it could become permanent. However, Mr Coveney said: ""The European Parliament will not ratify a Withdrawal Agreement that doesn't have a backstop in it. It's as simple as that. ""The backstop is already a compromise. It is a series of compromises. It was designed around British red lines."" The former chief constable of the police in Northern Ireland (PSNI) echoed previous warnings that the return of a hard border between the two countries would become a target for dissident republicans. Speaking to RTE, Sir Hugh Orde said there would be no way to avoid security patrols if the UK left without a deal, and security officers would be ""at risk"". This video can not be played Reality Check unpacks the basics of the backstop. Across Sunday's newspapers and political TV programmes, politicians clashed over whether leaving the EU without a deal should remain an option for the government or not. Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom wrote in the Sunday Times that trying to rule out a no deal was a ""thinly veiled attempt to stop Brexit"". But despite his colleague's words, defence minister Tobias Ellwood wrote: ""It is simply wrong for government and business to invest any more time and money in a no deal outcome that will make us poorer, weaker and smaller in the eyes of the world. ""It is now time to rule out the very possibility of no deal."" Mr Ellwood also said members of his own party seeking to ""crash out"" without a deal ""risk inflaming a dangerous battle for the soul of the Conservative Party"" - saying it could determine the outcome of the next election. But Education Secretary Damian Hinds told Sky News no deal needed to remain on the table, although it would ""not be a good outcome"". This video can not be played What happens in the event of no deal? In other developments,the government is going to consult Parliament on whether to work extra hoursand lose their February half-term break in order to get Brexit delivered by 29 March. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the government's demand was a way of Mrs May sending a signal to MPs that she intends to stick to the planned March departure.

"This video can not be played WATCH: Sir Nick Clegg defends Instagram over suicide images New Facebook vice-president Sir Nick Clegg has told the BBC the firm will do ""whatever it takes"" to make its social media platforms safer for young people. Sir Nick was responding to the case of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life after viewing distressing self-harm images on Instagram. He added that some experts say it is wise to keep certain images up because they can also help people find support. He admitted he would not let his own children view some graphic examples. Molly Russell took her own life in 2017. When her family looked into her Instagram account they found distressing material about depression and suicide. Her father sayshe believes Instagram is partly responsible for his daughter's death. ""I can tell you firstly we're going to look at this from top to bottom, change everything we're doing if necessary, to get it right,"" Sir Nick said. ""We're already taking steps soon to blur images, block a number of hashtags that have come to light, and thirdly to continue to work... with the Samaritans and other organisations."" However he added that the advice of these experts is not to ban all content of this nature. ""... I know this sounds counter-intuitive, but they do say that in some instances it's better to keep some of the distressing images up if that helps people make a cry for help and then get the support they need,"" he said. The former UK deputy prime minister also talked about tax, saying Facebook should pay more outside the US, at his first public appearance as the tech giant's head of communications. It was ""unbalanced"" that most of Facebook's $4bn [Â£3bn] tax bill was paid in the US ""even though the vast majority of Facebook's users are outside the United States"", he said. ""That is what needs to change,"" Sir Nick said, adding the onus was on governments to come up with ""a better way to tax companies like Facebook"". Sir Nick Clegg also addressed an audience at the Solvay Library in Brussels Following his interview with BBC media editor Amol Rajan, Sir Nick gave his first public speech since his surprise appointment, announcing the creation of an external body to help Facebook users challenge decisions made about flagged content. He said he supported tech sector regulation and agreed with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's view that ""Facebook should not make so many important decisions about free expression and safety on its own"". In the wide-ranging speech, Sir Nick also acknowledged the platform had a responsibility to limit the potential for political damage caused by the spread of fake news. But he defended Facebook's business model - of using personal data to sell targeted advertising, rather than charging users a subscription, which some would be unable to afford. The collection and sharing of personal data, such as users' location, shopping habits and holiday plans, was now ""routine"" among many private companies and public sector organisations, Sir Nick said. ""The data-driven economy is here to stay and we have to find ways of managing its harms while preserving its benefits,"" he said. ""It is, for better or worse, how the internet works. ""Underlying a lot of the criticisms of Facebook's business model is the assumption that advertising is inherently exploitative. ""I don't share that view. There is such a thing as responsible advertising."" Sir Nick added he had seen ""many changes"" at Facebook since he joined in October 2018. There was surprise at his appointment, especially as he had written negatively about the social network in the past. ""As the internet has evolved, so have the norms and standards that apply to it,"" he said in his speech. Why Sir Nick Clegg is joining Facebook Facebook job not lobbying - Clegg.

"This video can not be played Thieves hack into a car's security system using computerised unlocking technology Hundreds of popular cars - including four of the five best-selling models in the UK - are susceptible to ""keyless theft"", new research claims. Consumer group Which? found the Ford Fiesta, Volkswagen Golf, Nissan Qashqai and Ford Focus were all at risk. Thieves are increasingly thought to be using technology to bypass entry systems on keyless cars. But industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders (SMMT) said ""new cars are more secure than ever"". Which? analysed data on keyless - or ""relay"" - attacks from the General German Automobile Club (ADAC), a roadside recovery organisation. ADAC tested 237 keyless cars and found that all but three were susceptible. The latest models of the Discovery and Range Rover, and the 2018 Jaguar i-Pace, all made by Jaguar Land Rover, were found to be secure. Of the top-selling cars in the UK, only the Vauxhall Corsa was deemed safe because it is not available with keyless entry and ignition. Driver baffled by steering wheel theft Keyless cars causing dozens of deaths ""Thieves have been using keyless theft for several years, but manufacturers continue to make new models that can be stolen in this way, meaning there is an ever-larger pool of vehicles for thieves to target,"" Which? said in a statement. Cars are increasingly sold with keyless entry and ignition systems Harry Rose, editor of Which? Magazine, said manufacturers needed ""to up their game"". A growing number of new cars are made with keyless entry systems, allowing owners to open them with the brush of a hand, as long as their actual key is nearby - for instance in their pocket. However, thieves can fool these systems with special devices, allowing them to enter the vehicle and drive away. Car theft is much lower than it was in the 1990s but has been rising, with keyless technology thought to be partly to blame. In the year to March 2018, more than 106,000 offences of theft of or unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle were reported to police in England and Wales - the highest annual total since 2009. Mike Hawes, head of the SMMT, said: ""Industry takes vehicle crime extremely seriously and any claims otherwise are categorically untrue. ""New cars are more secure than ever, and the latest technology has helped bring down theft dramatically with, on average, less than 0.3% of the cars on our roads stolen. ""Criminals will always look for new ways to steal cars; it's an ongoing battle and why manufacturers continue to invest billions in ever more sophisticated security features - ahead of any regulation. ""However, technology can only do so much and we continue to call for action to stop the open sale of equipment with no legal purpose that helps criminals steal cars.""

"Letting a toddler spend lots of time using screens may delay their development of skills such as language and sociability, according to a large Canadian study. The research, which tracked nearly 2,500 two-year-olds, is the latest piece of evidence in the debate about how much screen time is safe for kids. In Canada and the US, experts say children should not use screens before they are at least 18 months old. ButUK guidelines  set no such limit.,external The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health says there is not enough evidence, even when you include this new study, for a ""direct toxic effect"". Why did child screen advice not go further? UK could ban social media over suicide images How to limit excessive screen time Parents 'struggle to get children off devices' Mums were surveyed (between 2011 and 2016) about screen use, and filled out questionnaires about their child's skills and development at ages two, three and five. Screen time included watching TV programmes, films or videos, gaming, and using a computer, tablet, phone or any other screen-based device. At the age of two, the children were clocking up around 17 hours of screen time per week. This increased to around 25 hours a week by the age of three but dropped to around 11 hours a week at the age of five, when the children started primary school. The findings,published in the JAMA Paediatrics,,externalsuggest increased viewing begins before any delay in development can be seen, rather than children with poor developmental performance then going on to have more screen time. But it is not clear whether screen time - including how much or what type - is directly to blame. Screen use might just go hand-in-hand with other things linked to delayed development, such as upbringing and how a child's remaining leisure time is spent. When young children are observing screens, they may be missing important opportunities to practise and master other important skills. In theory, it could get in the way of social interactions and may limit how much time young children spend running, climbing and practising other physical skills - although they may still eventually catch up. Even without solid proof of harm, Dr Sheri Madigan and colleagues say it still makes sense to moderate children's screen time and make sure it doesn't interfere with ""face-to-face interactions or family time"". They also said that, with hindsight, perhaps they should have followed the children from an even younger age because it is becoming increasingly common for 12-month-old babies to be watching and using screens. It is a good question, without a satisfactory answer. The new study does not make any recommendation about how much is too much. Some of the two-year-olds were getting more than four hours a day or 28 hours a week of screen use, according to their mums. TheAmerican Association of Paediatrics' (AAP) guidelines,externalon screen time say: For children younger than 18 months, avoid use of screen media other than video-chatting Parents of children 18 to 24 months of age who want to introduce digital media should choose high-quality programming, and watch it with their children to help them understand what they are seeing For children ages two to five years, limit screen use to one hour per day of high-quality programmes. Again, parents should be watching it with their children. For children ages six and older, place consistent limits, making sure screen time does not get in the way of sleep and physical activity. The Canadian Paediatric Society goes further,,externalsaying screen time for children younger than two is not recommended. Data for the UK shows internet use among children has increased in recent years The UK's Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) put out guidelines earlier this year, but sets no limit. It says ""evidence is weak for a threshold to guide children and parents to the appropriate level of screen time, and we are unable to recommend a cut-off for children's screen time overall"". Instead, it advises families to ask themselves: Is screen time in your household controlled? Does screen use interfere with what your family want to do? Does screen use interfere with sleep? Are you able to control snacking during screen time? If a family can ask themselves these questions, and are satisfied with the answers, then they can be reassured that they are ""likely to be doing as well as they can with this tricky issue"", says the RCPCH. The AAP advises families to designate media-free times together, such as dinner or driving, as well as media-free locations at home, such as bedrooms. The RCPCH says adults should consider their own use of screens and set a good example. Most experts also advise that children are not exposed to screens for an hour before bed, so that their brains have time to wind down for sleep. These statistics are for the UK, based on data for 2017 Dr Bernadka Dubicka, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ""We still need more research to tell us which children are most vulnerable to the harms of screen use and the impact it may have on a child's mental health. ""We also need to look at the effects of different content as there are also many positive ways of using screens."" How much screen time is 'too much'?

"Ocado shares rose as much as 6.7% after a report suggested it may agree a deal with Marks and Spencer to deliver its food and drink. M&S could buy distribution centres and vans from Ocado, the Mail on Sunday reported. It has been exploring options for food delivery online in a bid to catch up with rivals such as Sainsbury's. Both companies declined to comment. Analysts suggested Ocado could stock M&S food or run its website. Ocado currently has a deal with southern England-focused Waitrose, which is due to come to an end in September 2020. M&S has been experimenting with home delivery since 2017, when it opened a trial in north London to offer a small range of ready meals. Its website already offers wedding cakes, party food and alcoholic drinks for collection, but it lacks a delivery network the likes of Tesco, Morrison, Sainsbury's or Asda have. After those earlier gains, Ocado shares settled to stand 3% higher at 975p. Marks and Spencer shares rose 2% to 295p. M&S, founded in 1884, has been struggling in recent years to keep up online in both food and clothing. It said in November that sales excluding newer stores, were down 2.2% for the six months to the end of September. Food sales were down 2.9% and clothing and home sales slid 1.1%. A deal of any kind is not certain,the newspaper reported,external. If talks progress, there are two broad ways the two companies could work together, said Laith Khalaf, of stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown. Ocado could take over running M&S's food website, handling logistics, payment and deliveries. This would be a similar deal to the one Ocado has with Morrisons. ""The challenge there is the economics of delivering basket sizes,"" says Mr Khalaf. M&S shoppers might buy a day or two's worth of food rather than a weekly shop, which makes the cost of delivery proportionately more expensive. The other option is for Ocado to carry M&S food, similar to its deal with Waitrose. This option is ""more economically viable"", he said, since it would mean less upfront expenditure from M&S. Falling food sales hit Marks & Spencer How would Instagram stars save M&S? How can M&S get back in fashion?

"B&Q says it has taken action after being told that it exposed details of suspected store thieves to the net without password protection. The matter was brought to light bya security researcher last week.,external He said the DIY chain had taken the data offline, but was unable to get a response from the company himself. ""We have closed the issue down and are continuing to investigate how it occurred,"" a B&Q spokeswoman told the BBC on Monday. According to Lee Johnstone, chief executive of Ctrlbox Information Security, the exposed records included 70,000 offender and incident logs. He blogged that these included: the first and last names of individuals caught or suspected of stealing goods from stores descriptions of the people involved, their vehicles and other incident-related information the product codes of the goods involved the value of the associated loss One example of the details logged read: ""Offender ran out of the fire exit with Nest thermostats. The male on this occasion got away. There is no CCTV footage covering this area.""

"Mandy Mahoney, who has incurable breast cancer, says she is not ""brave"" or ""inspirational"" Fighter, warrior, hero - some of the terms you might see used to describe people with cancer. But according to a new survey, for some with the illness the words are seen as inappropriate rather than uplifting. The UK poll by Macmillan Cancer Support of 2,000 people who have or had cancer found ""cancer-stricken"" and ""victim"" were also among the least-liked terms. The charity said it showed how ""divisive"" simple descriptions of cancer can be. How do you talk about dying to someone who is dying? Cancers 'rising around the world' Sugary supplement could help fight cancer Calling a person's cancer diagnosis a ""war"" or a ""battle"" and saying they had ""lost their battle"" or ""lost their fight"" when they died, were other unpopular descriptions, according to the poll carried out by YouGov. Articles in the media and posts on social networks were found to be the worst offenders for using such language. The survey found a preference for factual words to describe people with cancer, their diagnosis, and when someone with the illness dies. Mandy Mahoney, 47, has incurable metastatic breast cancer. The outreach support worker, from London, was initially diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011 and it has since returned five times. She said: ""I think cancer-speak can be quite negatively loaded - the brave, fighter, warrior and survivor standard descriptors put an awful lot of pressure on the newly diagnosed."" Mandy said she also objected to describing people as ""losing their battle"" with cancer. ""That confers that you didn't fight or gave up,"" she said. Instead, she prefers ""clear, factual language"" and describes herself simply as ""living with incurable cancer"". ""I'm not brave or inspirational, I'm just trying to live the life I have left well,"" she added. Craig Toley said he had found words like ""fight"" and ""struggle"" to be empowering, but recognised others might feel differently However, Craig Toley, who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2016 and is now in remission, said he thought some of the more positive terms could be empowering. The 31-year-old, who is a powerlifter in his spare time, says: ""Language like 'fight', 'struggle', 'warrior' and 'battle' will be interpreted differently by different people. ""Personally, I found those words helped empower me a lot and made me think of my cancer as a challenge I needed to fight. ""Everyone likes the story of a fighter."" Karen Roberts, chief nursing officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ""These results show just how divisive and 'Marmite' simple words and descriptions can be. ""Cancer throws all kinds of things your way, and struggling to find the words, and the emotional turmoil caused when our friends and family don't get it 'right' only makes lives feel even more upended. ""By drawing attention to this we want to encourage more people to talk about the words they prefer to hear, and stop the damage that can be caused to people's wellbeing and relationships."" Mandy said it was not necessary for people to ""swallow a textbook and come up with all of the key phrases"" to talk to someone with cancer, and it is fine to not always know what to say. ""If you tell me it's awkward and you don't know what to say I will find a way to make that right for you, and actually on some occasions I might say 'we don't have to talk about it'. ""But just be real."" Macmillan Cancer Support,externalhas launched a campaign to highlight the challenges posed by a cancer diagnosis and the support available.

"Unions are calling for urgent talks with Tesco amid fears that the supermarket could cut 15,000 jobs. Unite's national officer for retail distribution, Adrian Jones, said this was a ""worrying time"" for members, while Usdaw said it was ""distressing"". Tesco has told staff in an internal memo that restructuring was ""still being finalised"" after the Mail on Sunday reported that jobs could go. Reports say this could include closing some fresh food counters and bakeries. Tesco is the UK's biggest grocery chain and employs 324,000 in the UK and Ireland. It is trying to save Â£1.5bn. Mr Jones said: ""What is required very quickly from Tesco is clarity on its intentions going forward. ""Our top priority this week is to arrange a meeting with Tesco's management to get a clear picture of what the supermarket is planning."" Tesco warns of 'changes' amid reports of jobs cuts ""While the reports centre on job losses in store, such as the bakeries and deli counters, we still need to know what this could mean for our members,"" he added. Unite represents around 1,000 workers in four Tesco distribution centres. The main union representing Tesco staff, Usdaw, said the reports of job cuts were ""distressing"" for staff. The chain's chief operating officer Tony Hogett wrote to staff on Sunday to say that the ""changes are still being finalised"". Usdaw has also said it is seeking an urgent meeting with the company to clarify the situation. Analysts at financial firm Bernstein said that 15,000  jobs cuts - if that proved to the number - was the equivalent of around 20 staff per store. This would amount to Â£250m of cost savings if it was full-time rather than part-time workers, the analysts said. While expressing caution about the actual number of jobs that might go, they said: ""The obvious question will be whether that will impact Tesco's quality perception and customer loyalty"". ""Presumably Tesco will have strong evidence from trials about what such a move does to customer behaviour,"" the Bernstein analysts said.

"This video can not be played Sabine Weyand: Risk of a 'crash out' is high There is a high risk of the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal by accident, the EU's deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand has said. She said there was ""full ownership of what was agreed"" in the EU, but ""no ownership"" of it in the UK Parliament. And it was a challenge to see how a majority for any deal could be built among MPs, she added. The EU side were agreed that a time-limit to the Irish backstop defeated the purpose of having one, she added. It comes as Theresa May addressed a meeting of Tory MPs, the day before all MPs vote on a series of amendments to the PM's plans that could shape the future direction of Brexit. BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said numerous sources at the meeting revealed the government would be whipping its MPs to vote for one amendment that proposes the backstop be replaced by ""alternative arrangements"". The Irish backstop - the ""insurance policy"" in the withdrawal deal - has been the controversial sticking point. It is intended to ensure that whatever else happens, there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU. Both the UK and the EU believe that bringing back border checks could put the peace process at risk. But the current wording of the backstop plan has proved unpopular with many Brexit-supporting Conservative MPs who are concerned that it could tie the UK to many EU rules indefinitely. Brexit: A really simple guide A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Kuenssberg: Is Parliament's Brexit fog about to clear? No-deal Brexit 'to leave shelves empty' Speaking at an event in Brussels, Ms Weyand - deputy to the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier - said other options for the Irish border had been extensively discussed and referred to the months-long negotiations with her UK counterparts. She said that a lot of the discussion of the withdrawal agreement in the UK was ""uninhibited by any knowledge"" of what it actually contained. EU leaders were concerned about extending the two-year Article 50 process, she said, because Brexit was ""eating up the political energy"" for solving other issues. She added that Mrs May's secrecy and reliance on a small group of people had been a ""handicap"" in getting support for the deal. She said: ""There is a very high risk of a crash-out, not by design, but by accident... ""The crash-out is the only scenario that does not require anyone to take any action or take any decisions."" By Adam Fleming, BBC Brussels correspondent In Brussels, Sabine Weyand is known for her cheerful bluntness. Now the public have seen it too. She lobbed a series of truth bombs at Westminster, saying MPs are criticising an agreement many of them haven't read and the cabinet's failure to ""own"" the deal is making it harder to approve. And she contrasted her style of regular consultations with EU leaders and the European Parliament with Theresa May's reliance on a small circle of advisors - ""a big handicap."" She will be accused in the UK of being undiplomatic, but many of her colleagues on the EU side of the negotiations feel equally fed up. And maybe she was also trying to tell her ultimate bosses - EU leaders - that things are not looking good. Meanwhile, Mrs May is being urged to secure changes from the EU to the Northern Irish backstop as part of her Brexit deal to get it past Parliament. Ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson says winning a ""freedom clause"" would be ""unadulterated good Brexit news"". But the Irish deputy PM Simon Coveney says changes to the backstop - aimed at preventing a hard border - would not be acceptable. The DUP's Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson called on the government to ""be tough"" and ""face down the stubbornness of Dublin and Brussels"". ""It's time for the Irish to work constructively and advocate for a sensible trading arrangement with their biggest market in Great Britain,"" he said. Is Parliament, finally, at long last, really on the verge of giving a clear signal about what it wants to do about Brexit? As much as I can feel your pain, don't bet on it. You've probably heard a lot of noise about the amendments that MPs will be voting on tomorrow night, not least from me. But there is no guarantee at all that any of them will pass. First, some Tory MPs are coming round to the government's deal, if they can cut out the bit they don't like (yes, of course, the backstop.) A lot of them have signed up to a way of making that clear, by supporting Sir Graham Brady's amendment. And if enough of them get on board it would allow the prime minister, in theory, to go back to the EU and say, tah dah! Look! I can get this deal through apart from this really pesky part, which might, as we've been reporting in the last few days, move things forward, despite the very strong warnings from Dublin that it can't happen. But, I wouldn't bet very much that Brexiteers will switch to back it in a coherent and decisive way. Read more from Laura After Mrs May's deal was rejected in the Commons on 15 January by 432 votes to 202, opposition and backbench MPs have been tabling amendments to the plans. While MPs will not deliver their final verdict on the deal on Tuesday, they will vote on the amendments and, if one is passed, show the PM what changes to the deal might be enough to get a modified version of the deal through Parliament. The prime minister's official spokesman said it will be followed ""as soon as possible"" by a second meaningful vote on whatever deal has been secured with Brussels. ""The prime minister is absolutely committed to leaving the EU with a deal, but clearly if we are to obtain parliamentary support for that deal some changes are going to have to be made,"" the spokesman said. One amendment that has the backing of senior Tory Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, calls for the backstop to be replaced by ""alternative arrangements"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Graham said: ""I'm hoping that the way in which the amendment is crafted, it can attract that very broad support. And if we can win the vote on my amendment I think it gives the prime minister enormous firepower."" He said the looming exit date is helping to ""focus minds"", adding: ""I think we've already seen across the European Union a little bit more flexibility and a little creativity creeping in."" A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. Brexiteers say if the non-binding amendment is passed it will give the PM more leeway to win concessions from the EU. But the European Research Group, a group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs headed by Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, has said it would not back the amendment from Sir Graham on Tuesday. Is Rees-Mogg ready to compromise? Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Mr Johnson suggested,externalMrs May could get the EU to change the text of her agreement to include an expiry date for the backstop, or include a mechanism allowing the UK to unilaterally withdraw from it. Mr Johnson said: ""If the PM secures that change - a proper UK-sized perforation in the fabric of the backstop itself - I have no doubt that she will have the whole country full-throatedly behind her."" This video can not be played ""If we leave without a deal we will be less safe... than remaining part of the EU""  former head of the Security Service MI5 tells The World at One One of the architects of the Good Friday Agreement, Lord Bew, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the backstop must be made ""explicitly temporary and in legally binding terms"" in order to avoid undermining the Agreement. He said: ""There is a conflict, the backstop advertises itself as defending the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects. ""But you only have to look at what it says about agricultureâ¦ and you will see that you have a totally different top-down approach to dealing with matters of agriculture concern north and south to that in the Good Friday Agreement, where incidentally it's the very top item for co-operation."" Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop No change to backstop, Ireland insists Reiteratingearlier comments that the EU would not ratify a deal without the backstop being included, the Irish Republic's deputy prime minister and foreign minister Simon Coveney said:  ""Even in a no-deal Brexit situation every party and every MP in the UK will have a responsibility to ensure there is no return to a hard border and Northern Ireland is protected."" He added: ""The EU has been clear that the backstop is an integral part of the withdrawal agreement."" And European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas reiterated that the withdrawal agreement had been agreed with the UK government, was endorsed by EU leaders and was ""not open for renegotiation"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, and the prime minister has faced repeated calls to rule out the prospect of leaving without a deal if her agreement does not win approval. It is also possible that MPs will back amendments on Tuesday which call on Mrs May to rule out no deal or to delay the UK's departure from the EU. An amendment tabled by Labour MP Yvette Cooper and Conservative MP Nick Boles could extend Article 50 - which triggers the UK's withdrawal from the EU - by nine months, unless the prime minister can secure a deal by the end of February. Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Ms Cooper said she was not seeking to ""block Brexit"", adding that the bill would be amendable - meaning MPs could vote on how long any extension would be. Mr Boles told the Today programme that Tuesday's vote would be ""very, very close"", adding: ""We are going to need support from all sides of the house. Jeremy Corbyn has made some warm noises."" Mr Boles, who said he would support Sir Graham's amendment if it is selected, said MPs must ""seize the moment"" at the vote, as it offers ""probably the only motion of its kind that's going to be amendable"". Meanwhile, areport from MPs on the Exiting the EU Committee,externalsays the government must rule out a no-deal Brexit. Committee chairman Hilary Benn said: ""The suggestion that the UK might opt for a no-deal outcome but assume that the EU will continue to act in a co-operative manner to avoid disruption, cannot seriously constitute the policy of any responsible government."" However, a Tory member of the committee, Craig Mackinlay, said he ""disowned"" the report findings as  ""just more Project Fear from a group of MPs who have never wanted the UK to leave the EU"".

Instructed the government to rule out a ""disastrous no deal"" scenario (this optionwas supported by some Brexiteers but many MPs feared it would cause chaos at ports and disruption for businesses) and allowed Parliament to consider - and vote on - options including: An alternative Brexit deal involvingLabour's plan for a permanent customs unionwith Brussels and a version of the EU's single market Legislating to hold a public vote on either a deal or a proposition that has MPs' support Called for an extension of Article 50 Ruled out a no-deal Brexit Emphasised the role of the UK nations in the Brexit process Forced the government to make time for MPs to discuss a range of alternatives to the prime minister's Brexit plan on six full days in the Commons before 26 March. MPs would have been able to table amendments to be voted on at the end of the debate, which could have included alternative Brexit options such as Labour's plan, a second referendum,no dealand theNorway-style relationshippreferred by some MPs. This had the backing of some Labour backbenchers, as well as the SNP's Philippa Whitford, Lib Dem Tom Brake, Plaid Cymru's Jonathan Edwards and Caroline Lucas, of the Greens. Attempted to rule out the UK leaving the EUwithout a formal dealby allowing Parliament time to pass a new law. The bill to bring in the new law would have required Theresa May to seek to postpone Brexit day (currently 29 March) until 31 December, if MPs did not approve her deal by 26 February. The prime minister would have had to do this by asking the EU to agree to extend the two-year limit on Article 50 - the mechanism paving the way for the UK to leave the EU. It had the backing of senior Conservative backbenchers such as Nicky Morgan and Oliver Letwin, former Lib Dem health minister Norman Lamb and Plaid Cymru's Ben Lake. The Labour leadership had also decided to get behind this amendment and ordered Labour MPs to vote for it. But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn said he backed limiting any extension to a ""short window"" of three months to allow time for renegotiation. Required the government to ask the EU to postpone Brexit day (without specifying for how long). Seeks to prevent a""no-deal"" Brexitby adding to the PM's motion that Parliament ""rejects the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without aWithdrawal Agreementand aFramework for the Future Relationship"". The two MPs are in neighbouring constituencies and have raised concerns over local manufacturing supply chains. Calls for Parliament to require the backstop to be replaced with ""alternative arrangements to avoid a hard border"" but otherwise supports the prime minister's deal. Theresa May ordered Conservative MPs to vote for this amendment. Some Conservative rebels, who voted against the prime minister two weeks ago, said it was too vague and did not address their other concerns about her deal. Others, such as former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, said they would support it if Mrs May indicated that she would press the EU to re-open the withdrawal agreement to make changes to the backstop that would be legally binding - something she has told MPs that she will do. Northern Ireland's DUP, which keeps Mrs May in power, also indicated they would back the Brady amendment. Neither of the Spelman nor the Brady amendments are binding on the government, although support for them puts political pressure on Theresa May to follow their direction. Theresa May has already said she will return to Brussels to reopen negotiations on legally-binding alternatives to the ""backstop"".

"A no-deal Brexit threatens the UK's food security and will lead to higher prices and empty shelves in the short-term, retailers are warning. Sainsbury's, Asda and McDonald's are among those warning stockpiling fresh food is impossible and that the UK is very reliant on the EU for produce. The warning comes in a letter from the British Retail Consortium and is signed by several of the major food retailers. It comes ahead of crucial votes in Parliament on Tuesday. Retailers have told me that they fear shelves would be left empty if there were significant disruptions to supplies. The letter from the retailers, and seen by the BBC, says there will be ""significant risks"" to maintaining the choice, quality and shelf life of food. ""We are extremely concerned that our customers will be among the first to experience the realities of a no deal Brexit,"" the letter says. Brexit: A really simple guide A guide to MPs' Brexit amendments Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Is Parliament's Brexit fog about to clear? MPs will consider a series of amendments to Theresa May's plans that could shape the future direction of Brexit. While it will not be MPs' final verdict on the deal, they will vote on the amendments and, if one is passed, it will illustrate what changes to the deal might be enough to get a modified version of the deal through Parliament. Retailers have been reluctant to intervene in the Brexit debate but are doing so now as the UK's departure date from the EU approaches. In the letter, they urge MPs to work together ""urgently to find a solution that avoids the shock of a no-deal Brexit"". A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. The letter uses the government's own estimate that freight through Calais may fall 87% from current levels, threatening the availability and shelf life of many products. It expresses worry over tariffs, with only 10% of the UK's food imports currently subject to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. If the UK were to revert to WTO rules, the retailers warn that would ""greatly increase import costs that would in turn put upward pressure on food prices"". The other signatories to the letter include the chief executives of M&S, KFC, Co-Op, and Lidl. The letter spells out the UK's food relationship with Europe, with nearly one third of the food in the UK coming from the EU. ""In March, the situation becomes more acute as UK produce is out of season,"" the letter says. At that time of year, 90% of lettuces, 80% of tomatoes and 70% of soft fruit sold in the UK is grown in the EU, the letter says. ""As this produce is fresh and perishable, it needs to be moved quickly from farms to our stores,"" the retailers say. Their letter says that stockpiling fresh food is impossible and that the complex, just-in-time supply chain through which food is imported into the UK will be ""significantly disrupted"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It adds it is difficult to stockpile any more produce as ""all frozen and chilled storage is already been used"". ""While we have been working closely with our suppliers on contingency plans, it is not possible to mitigate all the risks to our supply chains and we fear significant disruption as a result if there is no Brexit deal,"" the retailers say in the letter to MPs. The retailers say that while they are looking for alternate supply routes, there are limited options and not enough ferries. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: ""The UK has a high level of food security built upon a diverse range of sources including strong domestic production and imports from other countries. This will continue to be the case whether we leave the EU with or without a deal."" They added the government had ""well established"" ways of working with the food industry to prevent disruption. The letter comes after a report from MPs on the Exiting the EU Committee said the government must rule out a no-deal Brexit. Committee chairman Hilary Benn said: ""The suggestion that the UK might opt for a no-deal outcome but assume that the EU will continue to act in a co-operative manner to avoid disruption, cannot seriously constitute the policy of any responsible government."" However, a Tory member of the committee, Craig Mackinlay, said he ""disowned"" the report findings as ""just more Project Fear from a group of MPs who have never wanted the UK to leave the EU"". A number of amendments are being voted on by MPs on Tuesday - although the Irish deputy PM says changes to the backstop - aimed at preventing a hard border - would not be acceptable. The backstop is the ""insurance policy"" in the withdrawal deal, intended to ensure there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU.

"This video can not be played Thieves hack into a car's security system using computerised unlocking technology Hundreds of popular cars - including four of the five best-selling models in the UK - are susceptible to ""keyless theft"", new research claims. Consumer group Which? found the Ford Fiesta, Volkswagen Golf, Nissan Qashqai and Ford Focus were all at risk. Thieves are increasingly thought to be using technology to bypass entry systems on keyless cars. But industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders (SMMT) said ""new cars are more secure than ever"". Which? analysed data on keyless - or ""relay"" - attacks from the General German Automobile Club (ADAC), a roadside recovery organisation. ADAC tested 237 keyless cars and found that all but three were susceptible. The latest models of the Discovery and Range Rover, and the 2018 Jaguar i-Pace, all made by Jaguar Land Rover, were found to be secure. Of the top-selling cars in the UK, only the Vauxhall Corsa was deemed safe because it is not available with keyless entry and ignition. Driver baffled by steering wheel theft Keyless cars causing dozens of deaths ""Thieves have been using keyless theft for several years, but manufacturers continue to make new models that can be stolen in this way, meaning there is an ever-larger pool of vehicles for thieves to target,"" Which? said in a statement. Cars are increasingly sold with keyless entry and ignition systems Harry Rose, editor of Which? Magazine, said manufacturers needed ""to up their game"". A growing number of new cars are made with keyless entry systems, allowing owners to open them with the brush of a hand, as long as their actual key is nearby - for instance in their pocket. However, thieves can fool these systems with special devices, allowing them to enter the vehicle and drive away. Car theft is much lower than it was in the 1990s but has been rising, with keyless technology thought to be partly to blame. In the year to March 2018, more than 106,000 offences of theft of or unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle were reported to police in England and Wales - the highest annual total since 2009. Mike Hawes, head of the SMMT, said: ""Industry takes vehicle crime extremely seriously and any claims otherwise are categorically untrue. ""New cars are more secure than ever, and the latest technology has helped bring down theft dramatically with, on average, less than 0.3% of the cars on our roads stolen. ""Criminals will always look for new ways to steal cars; it's an ongoing battle and why manufacturers continue to invest billions in ever more sophisticated security features - ahead of any regulation. ""However, technology can only do so much and we continue to call for action to stop the open sale of equipment with no legal purpose that helps criminals steal cars.""

"The course attracts students from a wide range of backgrounds A US university professor has been removed as director of a graduate programme, amid a furore over an email she sent urging students not to speak Chinese. Megan Neely, an assistant professor at Duke University in North Carolina, said in an email to students that two unnamed faculty members of the biostatistics Masters programme had complained to her about students speaking Chinese in public areas in the department. She said that not speaking English could lead to ""unintended consequences"" for international students. Her email went viral on Twitter and Chinese social media, while Duke's medical faculty has promised to review its biostatistics programme. Many have criticised Dr Neely's email as racist or insensitive, and raised concerns that faculty members were discriminating against international students. However, some ethnic minority students on the Masters programme told the BBC they supported Dr Neely, describing her as a supportive programme director and ""definitely not a racist, not even close"". The controversy erupted after screenshots of Dr Neely's email to biostatistics students began circulating online over the weekend. Duke University confirmed to US media that the screenshots were genuine. Dr Neely said that two faculty members had asked her if she had photos of students on the Masters programme, before picking out a number of first-year students ""who they observed speaking Chinese (in their words, VERY LOUDLY), in the student lounge/study areas"". Dr Neely said that the faculty members told her ""they wanted to write down the names so they could remember them if the students ever interviewed for an internship or asked to work with them for a masters project. They were disappointed that these students were not taking the opportunity to improve their English and were being so impolite as to have a conversation that not everyone on the floor could understand. ""To international students,"" she continued, ""PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE keep these unintended consequences in mind when you choose to speak in Chinese in the building."" She added that she respected international students for learning ""in a non-native language"", but ""I encourage you to commit to using English 100% of the time when you are in Hock [the faculty building] or any other professional setting"". The petition was signed by 2,000 people by Sunday The email went viral after it was leaked online andreported in the student paper The Chronicle,external.  Many found the language in the email patronising, while others wondered if the students had been targeted because they spoke Chinese, rather than another foreign language. For many, however, the most concerning part of the email was the allegation that two faculty members appeared ready to discriminate against students based on what language they spoke with their friends. Australia universities caught in China row 'Say My Name': The Chinese students fighting racism Chinese students slam 'racist' uni email A group calling themselves Concerned Duke Students said in a petition that they were ""gravely concerned"" with the implication ""that students of diverse national origin would be punished in academic and employment opportunities for speaking in their native language outside of classroom settings."" The group told the BBC that more than 2,000 people had signed their petition by Sunday, including current Duke students and alumni, as well as students from other institutions. ""We recognise that language difficulties could be aâ¦ barrier for many international students, but we think this is all the more reason why Duke should treat us with more respect and understanding,"" they said in a statement. Mary Klotman, dean of the medical school which oversees the biostatistics programme, wrote to students over the weekend, telling them: ""There is absolutely no restriction or limitation on the language you use to converse and communicate with each other. Your career opportunities and recommendations will not in any way be influenced by the language you use outside the classroom. And your privacy will always be protected. ""I have asked the university's Office of Institutional Equity to conduct a thorough review of the Master of Biostatistics Programme,"" she added. Dr Neely, who is still in post as an assistant professor, has not yet publicly commented on the controversy. As of Sunday night, millions on Weibo had viewed the hashtag ""Duke University bans speaking Chinese"", while ""Duke University professor who banned speaking Chinese resigns"" was the ninth-most trending hashtag. One Weibo user described the email as ""naked racism"", while another joked: ""Should we also chuck out any foreign exchange students who aren't speaking Chinese on campus, because they haven't taken advantage of the opportunity to learn Chinese in China?""

Meanwhile, several Twitter users began sharing Dr Neely's faculty photo or calling for her to be fired. ""This behaviour is not only hypocritical - given Duke's dependence on international students and faculty for their undergraduate and graduate programs - but also discriminatory,""the university's Asian Students Association said in a statement.,external ""People should wholeheartedly be able to speak any language they wish - to strip away this agency is demeaning, disrespectful, and wholly discriminatory,"" it added. However, others have argued that the furore has been overblown - or that Dr Neely has unfairly borne the brunt of the criticism. One Weibo user suggested that the email had revealed deeper issues on the programme. ""I think this professor's actions may have been well intentioned, instead it might be the two faculty members who asked [for names and photos] who are the real racists,"" they wrote. Three students on Duke's biostatistic masters programme, who asked not to be named, expressed support for her to the BBC. ""Dr Neely is a great instructor and definitely not a racist, not even close,"" one Chinese student said. Another Chinese student told the BBC he had found Dr Neely ""always willing to help"" students of all nationalities, and hoped the university would investigate the two unnamed faculty members mentioned in her email instead. A third student of Asian descent said: ""Megan is truly the best instructor and mentor I ever hadâ¦ She made a mistake [with her email], but we still know what was her intention and how much she cares about us. ""When some people talk loudly in foreign language, other people [in the lounge] are definitely disturbed."" The student added: ""Some of my Chinese friends also told me they are worried that if they support Megan in the public, they might be regarded as 'people who betrayed their country' by other Chinese students in the United States.""

"The US-style paper carrier bag will have handles and a similar capacity to a plastic carrier bag Morrisons is introducing a reusable 20p paper bag as part of an eight-week trial in eight of its stores. The supermarket chain will also trial increasing the cost of its reusable plastic carrier bag to 15p, in a bid to reduce the plastic used by customers. Since the plastic bag charge was introduced, supermarket customers' bag use has reduced by more than 85%. Environment Secretary Michael Gove has set up a consultation on raising the cost of plastic bags in England. The Morrisons trial will take place across stores in England, Wales, Scotland and Gibraltar. The supermarket chain said reducing plastic was their customers' top environmental concern. Reality Check: Where does the plastic bag charge go? Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem Why is plastic a problem? But some retailers have warned paper bags also come with their own environmental challenges. Waitrose said it was not currently introducing a paper bag because ""it can take three times more energy to make a paper bag than a plastic one"". The production of paper bags uses more energy and creates more CO2 emissions than the manufacture of plastic bags. But paper decomposes much more quickly, while plastic can remain part of the environment for hundreds of years, causing damage to animals and marine life. The Co-operative, Marks & Spencer, and Sainsbury's charge the minimum 5p for a carrier bag Tesco and Asda charge 10p for its cheapest reusable bag while Aldi and Lidl charge 9p for a similar product Waitrose says it is replacing its plastic fruit and veg carriers with a home compostable alternative by spring 2019, and it intends to remove its 5p carrier bags from circulation The 20p US-style paper carrier bag has handles and a similar capacity to a plastic carrier bag. In June last yearMorrisons reintroduced small paper bags for loose fruit and veg,which cut out the use of 150 million small plastic bags every year. The retailer added that removing 5p bags from its shops, and replacing them with 10p reusable carriers, reduced bag sales at the supermarket by 25% in 2018. The 5p charge for plastic bags was introduced first in Wales in 2011, then in Northern Ireland in 2013, before Scotland introduced the charge for all carrier bags in 2014, and England rolled out its plastic bag charge on 5 October 2015 All retailers in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have to charge a minimum of 5p for a plastic bag In England only retailers with more than 250 employees have to charge customers for the use of plastic bags Retailers are expected to donate the 5p charge to charitable causes In 2014 7.6 billion bags were given away to customers at England's seven largest supermarkets, the equivalent of 140 per member of the population. Between 2017 and 2018 just over a billion bags were sold at major supermarkets across the UK. A new consultation could see the charge imposed on smaller retailersby January 2020, and the minimum charge increased to 10p for one plastic bag.

"Unions are calling for urgent talks with Tesco amid fears that the supermarket could cut 15,000 jobs. Unite's national officer for retail distribution, Adrian Jones, said this was a ""worrying time"" for members, while Usdaw said it was ""distressing"". Tesco has told staff in an internal memo that restructuring was ""still being finalised"" after the Mail on Sunday reported that jobs could go. Reports say this could include closing some fresh food counters and bakeries. Tesco is the UK's biggest grocery chain and employs 324,000 in the UK and Ireland. It is trying to save Â£1.5bn. Mr Jones said: ""What is required very quickly from Tesco is clarity on its intentions going forward. ""Our top priority this week is to arrange a meeting with Tesco's management to get a clear picture of what the supermarket is planning."" Tesco warns of 'changes' amid reports of jobs cuts ""While the reports centre on job losses in store, such as the bakeries and deli counters, we still need to know what this could mean for our members,"" he added. Unite represents around 1,000 workers in four Tesco distribution centres. The main union representing Tesco staff, Usdaw, said the reports of job cuts were ""distressing"" for staff. The chain's chief operating officer Tony Hogett wrote to staff on Sunday to say that the ""changes are still being finalised"". Usdaw has also said it is seeking an urgent meeting with the company to clarify the situation. Analysts at financial firm Bernstein said that 15,000  jobs cuts - if that proved to the number - was the equivalent of around 20 staff per store. This would amount to Â£250m of cost savings if it was full-time rather than part-time workers, the analysts said. While expressing caution about the actual number of jobs that might go, they said: ""The obvious question will be whether that will impact Tesco's quality perception and customer loyalty"". ""Presumably Tesco will have strong evidence from trials about what such a move does to customer behaviour,"" the Bernstein analysts said.

"This video can not be played Thieves hack into a car's security system using computerised unlocking technology Hundreds of popular cars - including four of the five best-selling models in the UK - are susceptible to ""keyless theft"", new research claims. Consumer group Which? found the Ford Fiesta, Volkswagen Golf, Nissan Qashqai and Ford Focus were all at risk. Thieves are increasingly thought to be using technology to bypass entry systems on keyless cars. But industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders (SMMT) said ""new cars are more secure than ever"". Which? analysed data on keyless - or ""relay"" - attacks from the General German Automobile Club (ADAC), a roadside recovery organisation. ADAC tested 237 keyless cars and found that all but three were susceptible. The latest models of the Discovery and Range Rover, and the 2018 Jaguar i-Pace, all made by Jaguar Land Rover, were found to be secure. Of the top-selling cars in the UK, only the Vauxhall Corsa was deemed safe because it is not available with keyless entry and ignition. Driver baffled by steering wheel theft Keyless cars causing dozens of deaths ""Thieves have been using keyless theft for several years, but manufacturers continue to make new models that can be stolen in this way, meaning there is an ever-larger pool of vehicles for thieves to target,"" Which? said in a statement. Cars are increasingly sold with keyless entry and ignition systems Harry Rose, editor of Which? Magazine, said manufacturers needed ""to up their game"". A growing number of new cars are made with keyless entry systems, allowing owners to open them with the brush of a hand, as long as their actual key is nearby - for instance in their pocket. However, thieves can fool these systems with special devices, allowing them to enter the vehicle and drive away. Car theft is much lower than it was in the 1990s but has been rising, with keyless technology thought to be partly to blame. In the year to March 2018, more than 106,000 offences of theft of or unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle were reported to police in England and Wales - the highest annual total since 2009. Mike Hawes, head of the SMMT, said: ""Industry takes vehicle crime extremely seriously and any claims otherwise are categorically untrue. ""New cars are more secure than ever, and the latest technology has helped bring down theft dramatically with, on average, less than 0.3% of the cars on our roads stolen. ""Criminals will always look for new ways to steal cars; it's an ongoing battle and why manufacturers continue to invest billions in ever more sophisticated security features - ahead of any regulation. ""However, technology can only do so much and we continue to call for action to stop the open sale of equipment with no legal purpose that helps criminals steal cars.""

"Sir Philip Green has dropped legal action against the Daily Telegraph, which prevented the newspaper publishing details of allegations of sexual harassment and racist behaviour. Last October, the Telegraph published a story saying a prominent businessman had been accused of harassment. The Topshop boss was later named as the businessman in the House of Lords. As a result, Sir Philip said he had been the subject of ""vicious"" and ""untrue"" personal attacks in the media. The statement also said that Sir Philip is ""not guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour"". Sir Philip's representative would not say why the businessman had dropped the legal action. When the allegations first emerged,Sir Philip acknowledgedthere had ""been some banter"", but said it had ""never been offensive"". What are non-disclosure agreements? Who is Sir Philip Green? Sir Philip: Monaco, models and money At the heart of the issue are non-disclosure agreements signed by five individuals. In his statement, Sir Philip said that the Telegraph had helped break those agreements and threatened to make the information public. In doing so, the newspaper had exposed the individuals to ""significant risk and future legal action"", the statement said. It also said: ""Due to the ongoing confidentiality obligations and injunction still in place, Arcadia and Sir Philip cannot comment on the detail of any allegations, but confirm that any grievances are treated with the utmost seriousness and are investigated thoroughly in accordance with best practice."" It was Lord Hain who, last October, identified Sir Philip as the businessmen alluded to in the Telegraph article. He did so in the House of Lords which gave him protection from legal action. ""Parliamentary privilege has always been resented by the rich and powerful when it is used as I did in this case to defend human rights and justice when under attack. It is of fundamental constitutional importance as the only absolute right to free speech cemented in our law,"" Lord Hain said in a statement. Sir Philip used to be known as the king of the High Street. He built a fortune from a retail empire that included Topshop, BHS, Burton and Miss Selfridge. He sold BHS in March 2015 for Â£1, but it went into administration a year later, leaving a Â£571m hole in its pension fund. He later agreed a Â£363m cash settlement with the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap. In a report into the collapse,externalof BHS, MPs called the episode ""the unacceptable face of capitalism"". He and his wife Cristina are estimated by Forbes to be worth Â£3.8bn. What are non-disclosure agreements? Philip Green: The man behind the scandals.

"Tracey Crouch first announced the law change in 2017, when sports minister A proposed law to make it illegal for sports coaches to have sexual relations with 16 and 17-year-olds in their care has been ""bogged down in bureaucracy"", an ex-sports minister has said. Tracey Crouch, the ministerwho first announced the law change in 2017, criticised the government for failing to protect ""vulnerable people"". The NSPCC said it was ""absolutely outrageous"" the law had yet to come in. The Ministry of Justice said the law continued to be kept ""under review"". The age of consent in the UK is 16, although that is extended to 18 if a person holds a position of trust. The law currently covers teachers, hospital workers and carers, but not sports coaches. Ms Crouch - a Conservative MP who resigned as sports minister in November 2018 - told BBC Two's Victoria Derbyshire programme that if the law was not brought in soon she would look to change the legislation herself, perhaps through a backbench private members' bill. She described the law as a ""no-brainer"". ""It is about protecting vulnerable people from an abuse of power,"" she said. ""Frustratingly it seems to have got bogged down in bureaucracy at the Ministry of Justice, the department that owns the legislation."" The chief executive of the children's charity NSPCC, Peter Wanless, said it was ""absolutely outrageous"" the law had not yet been introduced. ""Government promised to extend these laws to sports coaches, but we've yet to see action and I fear they are backtracking,"" he added. Ms Crouch's comments come just days afteran inquiry found the Lawn Tennis Associationmissed repeated warnings about bullying and sexual abuse at one of the UK's top tennis centres. And according to the Offside Trust, a body set up by survivors after revelations of child sexual abuse in football,at least 80 sports coaches have been convictedof sexual abuse of children in the space of two years. It said almost half of the cases involved crimes that have been committed since 2006. The Ministry of Justice said in a statement: ""We remain absolutely committed to protecting children and young people from the horrors of sexual abuse. ""Offenders already face tough punishments and we continue to keep the law under review.""

"This video can not be played Thousands more leave Venezuela amid new crisis The US has warned Venezuela that any threats against American diplomats or opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ will be met with ""a significant response"". National Security Adviser John Bolton said any such ""intimidation"" would be ""a grave assault on the rule of law"". His warning comes days after the US and more than 20 other countries recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president. Meanwhile, Mr GuaidÃ³ has called for anti-government protests on Wednesday and Saturday. Mr GuaidÃ³, the elected leader of the opposition-held National Assembly, declared himself the interim president on 23 January. The political crisis in Venezuela now appears to be reaching boiling point amid growing efforts by the opposition to unseat President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. He was sworn in for a second term earlier this month after an election marred by an opposition boycott and allegations of vote-rigging, triggering large protests. What's behind Venezuela's political crisis? Venezuela crisis - in seven charts Will the US target Venezuelan oil? On Sunday, Venezuela's top military representative to the US, Col JosÃ© Luis Silva, defected from Mr Maduro's government, saying he recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as president instead.

Also on Twitter, Mr GuaidÃ³ called for a ""peaceful"" two-hour strike on Wednesday and a ""big national and international rally"" on Saturday. On Saturday, several European countries including Spain, Germany, France and the UK said they would recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as president if elections were not called within eight days. But Mr Maduro has rejected this, saying the ultimatum must be withdrawn. ""Venezuela is not tied to Europe. This is complete insolence,"" he told CNN Turk on Sunday. Mr Maduro added that he was ready to ""engage in comprehensive dialogue"" with those who opposed his presidency. He said he had sent Donald Trump ""many messages"", but he thought the US president ""despises us"". He later appeared at a military exercise in Venezuela's central state of Carabobo, where he called for ""union, discipline and cohesion"" to overcome what he described as an ""attempted coup d'etat"" by Mr GuaidÃ³. Mr Maduro attended military exercises in Carabobo on Sunday Mr Maduro broke off relations with the US last Thursday over the country's support for Mr GuaidÃ³, and ordered US envoys to depart Venezuela within 72 hours. However on Saturday evening, as the deadline was due to expire, Venezuela's foreign ministry said it would withdraw the expulsion order, and instead allow 30 days for the two sides to set up ""interest offices"" in each others' countries. Interest offices are used when countries do not have formal diplomatic relations, but want to have a basic level of contact to represent their interests. Washington has previously said it does not recognise Mr Maduro's authority to order its diplomats out. Meanwhile,Mr GuaidÃ³ told the Washington Post that he was in talks with ""sympathetic military"" officials,externalin Venezuela with the aim of building support for his presidency. Venezuela's army has stood by Mr Maduro throughout previous upheaval, encouraged by regular wage increases and other incentives.In July, some 16,900 soldiers were promoted as a reward for their ""loyalty"". Despite that, reports suggest the lower ranks are increasingly dissatisfied with the government, which they blame for food and medicine shortages, as well as frequent power and water cuts.

At a UN Security Council meeting on Saturday, Russia accused Washington of plotting a coup. However, more than a dozen Latin American countries and Canada have backed Mr GuaidÃ³ as president. In Europe, Greece's left-wing governing party has backed Mr Maduro.

"This video can not be played Thousands more leave Venezuela amid new crisis The US has warned Venezuela that any threats against American diplomats or opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ will be met with ""a significant response"". National Security Adviser John Bolton said any such ""intimidation"" would be ""a grave assault on the rule of law"". His warning comes days after the US and more than 20 other countries recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as interim president. Meanwhile, Mr GuaidÃ³ has called for anti-government protests on Wednesday and Saturday. Mr GuaidÃ³, the elected leader of the opposition-held National Assembly, declared himself the interim president on 23 January. The political crisis in Venezuela now appears to be reaching boiling point amid growing efforts by the opposition to unseat President NicolÃ¡s Maduro. He was sworn in for a second term earlier this month after an election marred by an opposition boycott and allegations of vote-rigging, triggering large protests. What's behind Venezuela's political crisis? Venezuela crisis - in seven charts Will the US target Venezuelan oil? On Sunday, Venezuela's top military representative to the US, Col JosÃ© Luis Silva, defected from Mr Maduro's government, saying he recognised Mr GuaidÃ³ as president instead. Later, Mr Bolton took to Twitter to reiterate Washington's position, warning others against any form of ""violence and intimidation"". Allow Twitter content?

Also on Twitter, Mr GuaidÃ³ called for a ""peaceful"" two-hour strike on Wednesday and a ""big national and international rally"" on Saturday. On Saturday, several European countries including Spain, Germany, France and the UK said they would recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as president if elections were not called within eight days. But Mr Maduro has rejected this, saying the ultimatum must be withdrawn. ""Venezuela is not tied to Europe. This is complete insolence,"" he told CNN Turk on Sunday. Mr Maduro added that he was ready to ""engage in comprehensive dialogue"" with those who opposed his presidency. He said he had sent Donald Trump ""many messages"", but he thought the US president ""despises us"". He later appeared at a military exercise in Venezuela's central state of Carabobo, where he called for ""union, discipline and cohesion"" to overcome what he described as an ""attempted coup d'etat"" by Mr GuaidÃ³. Mr Maduro attended military exercises in Carabobo on Sunday Mr Maduro broke off relations with the US last Thursday over the country's support for Mr GuaidÃ³, and ordered US envoys to depart Venezuela within 72 hours. However on Saturday evening, as the deadline was due to expire, Venezuela's foreign ministry said it would withdraw the expulsion order, and instead allow 30 days for the two sides to set up ""interest offices"" in each others' countries. Interest offices are used when countries do not have formal diplomatic relations, but want to have a basic level of contact to represent their interests. Washington has previously said it does not recognise Mr Maduro's authority to order its diplomats out. Meanwhile,Mr GuaidÃ³ told the Washington Post that he was in talks with ""sympathetic military"" officials,externalin Venezuela with the aim of building support for his presidency. Venezuela's army has stood by Mr Maduro throughout previous upheaval, encouraged by regular wage increases and other incentives.In July, some 16,900 soldiers were promoted as a reward for their ""loyalty"". Despite that, reports suggest the lower ranks are increasingly dissatisfied with the government, which they blame for food and medicine shortages, as well as frequent power and water cuts. This video can not be played Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains Russia, China, Mexico and Turkey have publicly backed Mr Maduro. At a UN Security Council meeting on Saturday, Russia accused Washington of plotting a coup. However, more than a dozen Latin American countries and Canada have backed Mr GuaidÃ³ as president. In Europe, Greece's left-wing governing party has backed Mr Maduro.

"Amber the red panda is back in the zoo after her brief escape A rare red panda which escaped from Belfast Zoo has been found ""safe and well"". Amber was discovered in a garden in Collinbridge, Newtownabbey, less than a mile from the zoo. She had escaped from her enclosure on Sunday afternoon and was first sighted later that day at 17:30 GMT. The cub, which was born in June and is now almost an adult size, was found on Monday after a spot of sightseeing in the city. Exotic beasts that roamed Belfast's streets ""We are pleased to report that Amber has been safely returned to Belfast Zoo after a short time exploring the local area,"" said the zoo's manager, Alyn Cairns. ""We would like to thank all of those involved in the search for our missing red panda. We received several calls from local residents who reported sightings which helped the search team to track its location."" Red pandas are an endangered species and slightly larger than a domestic cat. Belfast Zoo has a family of four red pandas and the escapee received a full health check by the zoo vet as soon as she returned home. ""Amber is in good health but continues to be observed,"" the zoo's statement said.

"This video can not be played Rescuers are searching for hundreds of people, missing after a dam collapse caused a huge mudslide Rescue teams searching for some 300 people missing after a dam collapsed in Brazil on Friday say the chances of finding survivors are ""very low"". No-one was rescued alive on Sunday near the south-eastern town of Brumadinho, as the number of dead rose to 58. ""We've got to have hope,"" said a woman whose 35-year-old husband was missing. The cause of the dam burst remains unclear. Brazil's largest mining company, Vale, which owns the complex, says safety procedures were followed. Search operations were suspended for hours on Sunday amid fears that a separate dam, also owned by Vale, was at risk of giving way in the area. Vale said 305 employees, contractors and residents were still missing. Some 192 people have been rescued alive. ""After 48 hours of work, the chance of finding [someone] alive is very low,"" Col Eduardo Angelo, who is leading the search operation, told relatives of the missing. ""[But] we're working with the possibility that we'll find people alive."" The dam break caused a sea of muddy sludge to bury the site's cafeteria where workers were eating lunch, before engulfing nearby houses, vehicles and roads. Access to the areas is difficult - in some places, the mud is up to 15m (49ft) deep. Search teams have been using helicopters and earth-moving machinery. A bus that was carrying employees has been found but rescuers have yet to reach a train that could contain survivors or more bodies. ""I still have hope,"" NÃ©lia Mary Fonseca told the BBC as she waited for details about her husband, Adriano, who worked as a contractor at the site. An Israeli group of engineers, doctors and members of the navy's underwater missions unit has arrived in Brazil to join the efforts. In pictures: Aftermath of dam collapse The 2015 dam disaster in Minas Gerais By Julia Carneiro, BBC News, Brumadinho Mining is the main economic activity in Brumadinho and now the cause of this unprecedented tragedy that will mark generations to come. The Paraopeba river that cuts through the town has been tinted by iron ore residue and now smells of dead fish. The first funerals were held on Sunday. Having a body to bury may turn out to be a twisted privilege in this tragedy, with hundreds of people believed to be under the mud and huge challenges to find them. At the information centre set up to assist the families, volunteers sit behind desks with the lists of those missing, and relatives queue up to check for any updates - or to enter more names of people still unaccounted for. I met a woman who was searching for her husband and son. Another man expected news from his brother. A young woman looked from her young husband. The dam burst may have broken their families, too. State prosecutors said they had frozen a total of 11bn reais ($2.9bn; Â£2.2bn) of assets belonging to Vale, Brazil's largest mining company. Brumadinho Mayor Avimar de Melo Barcelos criticised the company for being ""careless and incompetent"", blaming the firm for the dam burst and the state of Minas Gerais for poor oversight. ""This tragedy destroyed our city."" Rescue efforts have been hampered by the difficult access to areas hit In a television interview, Vale president Fabio Schvartsman said the disaster had happened even after the company followed safety recommendations by international experts. ""I'm not a mining technician. I followed the technicians' advice and you see what happened. It didn't work,"" he said. Mr Schvartsman, who took office in May 2017, promised ""to go above and beyond any national or international standards... We'll create a cushion of safety far superior to what we have today to guarantee this never happens again."" Unlike dams used for water, tailings dams - like that in Brumadinho - are used to store by-products from mining operations. There have been a number of high-profile disasters involving tailings dams in recent years - andthere have been calls, including from the UN, to institute better safety and building regulations,externalaround them. On 5 November 2015, a dam owned by Vale, along with BHP Billiton, burst in Mariana, also in Minas Gerais. It killed 19 people in what was consideredBrazil's worst environmental disasterat the time. After a lengthy court case, the companies reached a settlement worth at least 6.8bn reais ($1.8bn) with the Brazilian government. Have you been affected by the collapsed dam?

"These chickens have a human gene that enables them to lay eggs containing useful drugs Researchers have genetically modified chickens that can lay eggs that contain drugs for arthritis and some cancers. The drugs are 100 times cheaper to produce when laid than when manufactured in factories. The researchers believe that in time production can be scaled up to produce medicines in commercial quantities. The chickens do not suffer and are ""pampered"" compared to farm animals, according to Dr Lissa Herron, of Roslin Technologies in Edinburgh. ""They live in very large pens. They are fed and watered and looked after on a daily basis by highly trained technicians, and live quite a comfortable life. ""As far as the chicken knows, it's just laying a normal egg. It doesn't affect its health in any way, it's just chugging away, laying eggs as normal."" Scientists have previously shown that genetically modified goats, rabbits and chickens can be used to produce protein therapies in their milk or eggs. The researchers say their new approach is more efficient, produces better yields and is more cost-effective than these previous attempts. ""Production from chickens can cost anywhere from 10 to 100 times less than the factories. So hopefully we'll be looking at at least 10 times lower overall manufacturing cost"" said Dr Herron. Battery ""pharming"": these eggs contain drugs produced at a tenth of the cost of normal production in laboratories The biggest saving comes from the fact that chicken sheds are far cheaper to build and run than highly sterile clean rooms for factory production. Many diseases are caused because the body does not naturally produce enough of a certain chemical or protein. Such diseases can be controlled with drugs that contain the deficient protein. These drugs are synthetically produced by pharmaceutical companies and can be very expensive to manufacture. Dr Herron and her colleagues managed to reduce the costs by inserting a human gene - which normally produces the protein in humans - into the part of the chickens' DNA involved with producing the white in the chickens' eggs. After cracking the eggs and separating the white from the yolk, Dr Herron discovered that the chicken had relatively large quantities of the protein. The team has focused on two proteins that are essential to the immune system: one is IFNalpha2a, which has powerful antiviral and anti-cancer effects, and the other is macrophage-CSF, which is being developed as a therapy that stimulates damaged tissues to repair themselves. Three eggs are enough to produce a dose of the drug, and chickens can lay up to 300 eggs per year. With enough chickens, the researchers believe they can produce drugs in commercial quantities. The development of drugs for human health, and the regulatory hoops required, will take between 10 and 20 years. The researchers are hopeful of using chickens to develop drugs for animal health. These include drugs which boost the immune systems of farm animals as an alternative to antibiotics, which would reduce the risk of the development of new strains of antibiotic-resistant superbugs.  And there is the potential to use the healing properties of macrophage-CSF to treat pets, according to Dr Herron. ""For example, we could use it in regenerating the liver or the kidneys of a pet that has suffered damage to these organs. The drugs currently available are a bit too pricey so we hope that we might be able to get into that a little more,"" she explained. Professor Helen Sang, of the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, said: ""We are not yet producing medicines for people, but this study shows that chickens are commercially viable for producing proteins suitable for drug discovery studies and other applications in biotechnology."" The eggs are produced for research purposes and not on sale in supermarkets.

"Wang Quanzhang went missing in a 2015 crackdown China has sentenced prominent human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang to four and a half years in prison for state subversion. Wang, 42, had defended political campaigners and victims of land seizures, as well as followers of the banned spiritual Falun Gong movement. He was one of several lawyers and activists arrested in a 2015 crackdown, and the last to go on trial. China has intensified its prosecution of rights lawyers in recent years. Mr Wang was ""found guilty of subverting state power, sentenced to four years and six months in prison, and deprived of political rights for five years,"" the court in Tianjin said. The lawyer who simply disappeared 'My husband just vanished' The trial had been conducted behind closed doors with journalists and foreign diplomats barred from entering the courthouse. Reuters news agency reports that Wang fired his state-appointed lawyer during the proceedings. Wang's wife, Li Wenzu, was also banned from attending and confined to her home in Beijing.

After the verdict Ms Li tweeted: ""Wang Quanqi is not guilty, the public prosecution law is guilty!"" John Sudworth, BBC News, Beijing Wang Quanzhang had disappeared so completely into a legal black hole, that for much of the past three and half years, his family did not know if he was alive or dead. He was denied family visits and denied the right to appoint his own lawyer. Perhaps he'd been seriously injured, those who knew him wondered. Or perhaps, against all the odds, he was somehow managing to hold out - refusing the pressure, and perhaps the torture too, and refusing to confess. Other lawyers caught up in the same 2015 crackdown, have since been processed, convicted and sentenced. Whatever the reason for the delay in Mr Wang's case - his brief one-day trial was finally held behind closed doors over Christmas - he has been found guilty for much the same reason; his attempts to use the letter of the Chinese law to hold the authorities to account in their own Communist Party-run courts. As the Party has been making clear in recent years, it sees concepts such as constitutionalism and an independent judicial system as dangerous Western ideals. Mr Wang's fate is likely intended to reinforce that chilling message. Michael Caster, researcher and author of The People's Republic of the Disappeared, told the BBC that Wang's case was ""emblematic of Xi Jinping's assault on the human rights and legal community"". ""The rights defence and broader civil society community in China is rightly outraged. For some time now they have rallied around Wang Quanzhang and his wife Li Wenzu as symbolic of both abuse and resistance under Xi Jinping,"" he said after the sentencing. Li Wenzu holds a family picture, and her husband's detention notice Mr Caster said that ""the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has found that Wang's detention is arbitrary, which means that under international law he should never have faced a trial in the first place, and so obviously should never have faced any length of sentence"". Rights groups have condemned the trial with Amnesty International calling it a ""sham"" and the verdict ""a gross injustice"". ""It's outrageous that Wang Quanzhang is being punished for peacefully standing up for human rights in China,"" Amnesty China researcher Doriane Lau said in a statement. China's crackdown on lawyers, known as the ""709"" crackdown because it began on 9 July, has been seen by activists as a sign of a growing intolerance of dissent under President Xi Jinping. More than 200 people were detained in that sweep, with many given jail terms, suspended sentences or house arrest.

"Arif was diagnosed with pre-diabetes and joined an exercise club to lose weight The number of workers trained to prescribe social activities, like exercise groups and art classes, to GP patients who don't need pills, is set to rise, under NHS England plans. The aim is that ""link workers"" will support GPs and reduce their workload. A link worker's role is to help patients find suitable community activities to improve their health and wellbeing. The NHS says more than 1,000 will be recruited by 2020-21. In the long term, it wants link workers to handle around 900,000 patient appointments a year. It is thought that a significant number of appointments at GP surgeries are not directly related to medical conditions. Instead, many patients are anxious or lonely or need support with managing a long-term condition. Some just need encouragement to join an exercise group and lose weight. A few years ago, Arif Qureshi, 51, was told he had pre-diabetes. He knew he had to improve his lifestyle so a link worker referred him to a walking football club run by West Ham United Foundation in Newham. He says it's been a revelation, helping him to lose 2st 4lb (15kg) in four months. ""It's been a big thing for me,"" he says. ""I'm more energetic, more upbeat and people come to me for advice on health now. ""I've got a new lease of life from exercise."" But he says he wouldn't have joined the football group, or found it, if hadn't been been for the nudge from the NHS and his link worker, who keeps in touch and assesses his progress regularly. Link workers are part of NHS England's plans to personalise care for patients, so they can take greater control of their mental and physical health. James Sanderson, NHS England's director of personalised care, said 2.5 million people would benefit by 2024. ""Social prescribing is an important component of the NHS comprehensive model of personalised care and there is emerging evidence that it can lead to a range of positive health and wellbeing outcomes for people, such as improved quality of life and emotional wellbeing,"" he said. ""The aim is that social prescribing schemes lead to a substantial reduction in the use of NHS services, including GP attendances."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairwoman of the Royal College of General Practitioners, said the move was ""incredibly welcome"". She said ensuring that GPs have ""good, easy access to people who can link patients with classes or groups in the community, which could be of more benefit than any medicine..."" is something doctors have been calling for for a long time.

"This video can not be played More armed officers are needed on the frontline, a police chief says Senior police leaders have said a rise in gun crime and a looming recruitment shortfall are leaving some specialist armed officers ""stretched"". Figures have shown crimes of possessing firearms rose by 87% in England and Wales over the past five years. In 2015, the government set aside funds for 1,500 new armed officers by 2020 - but only 812 have so far been added. A police staff association leader said he had ""great concern"" that the risk to the public could be increased. Steve Hartshorn, the firearms lead for the Police Federation of England and Wales, said: ""With... fewer armed police officers to deal with armed criminality, it gives me great concern that at some point the public will be at increased risk because of lack of funding and a lack of police officers to protect them."" Home Office figures show the number of recorded possession of firearms offences in England and Wales jumped from 4,300 in 2012-13 to 8,039 in 2017-18, a rise of 87%. Only two police forces out of 44 - Avon and Somerset and South Wales - saw a fall in offences over the period, with Greater Manchester seeing the biggest rise in the actual number of offences - from 315 to 1,092, a rise of 247%. The latest figures available for firearm-related crimes, such as armed robberies, saw a rise of 24% from 5,158 in 2012-13 to about 6,300 in 2016-17. However, levels of gun crime were much higher before 2012, peaking at just over 11,000 recorded offences in March 2006. There was a long downward trend until 2014, when the number of offences started increasing again. In West Yorkshire, crimes involving a firearm rose from 253 to 439, up 74%, between 2012 and 2017. West Yorkshire Police Assistant Chief Constable Tim Kingsman said there were times when resources were stretched and he had no option but to make demands of the same people. He added: ""We're asking them at times to do 12-hour shifts, day after day after day, and that will stretch [them] physically, emotionally. ""In West Yorkshire we've seen a rise in the availability of firearms for use by criminals. ""Last year we did 896 firearms operations as West Yorkshire Police, which is quite a number. That's two or three a day."" Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman said the pressure on armed officers was ""relentless"" In 2012 there were 6,756 armed officers across England and Wales. That fell to 5,639 in 2016 before increasing to 6,459 in 2018. Deputy Chief Constable Simon Chesterman, the National Police Chiefs Council spokesman for armed policing, said cuts to police numbers had a ""big impact"" on forces' capabilities. ""The demand is increasing without a doubt. It's relentless, dealing with gun crime, with knife crime, with terrorism, with serious organised crime,"" he said. ""They are responding to a range of threats on a daily basis. They're working overtime to keep up with demand. ""I'm concerned we haven't recruited as many as we wanted within the time that we wanted to but the one thing I would say, just to reassure you, is that we are delivering the effects."" Home Office security minister Ben Wallace said: ""The government has given Â£144m uplift for armed policing. ""The police are in charge of the recruiting, training and deployment of armed officers.

"Jan Siewert (left) and Martin Warhurst A Manchester City fan from Wakefield has spoken of his surprise - after he was asked by a TV reporter whether he was becoming the new manager of Huddersfield Town Football Club. Martin Warhurst was in the crowd for the Premier League game at Huddersfield when cameras zoomed in on him, in the belief that he was Jan Siewert. A Sky reporter was shown - although not heard - asking Mr Warhurst if he was the new German manager. He said: ""I'm Martin from Wakefield."" Siewert, a coach at German team Borussia Dortmund, has been tippedto take over the job of managing Huddersfield. Charity boss Martin Warhurst had to deny suggestions he was set to become a Premier League manager Mr Warhurst told the Press Association: ""It was bizarre. Basically what happened is I was sat in the crowd and suddenly I was aware of a guy coming towards me from the right hand side. ""He said 'Are you Jan, the new manager?' I laughed and said: 'No, no, that's not me. I'm Martin from Wakefield'."" He added: ""That was all I heard of it and then suddenly everybody's phones and my phone started going crazy, saying 'I've just seen you on telly'. ""There was lots of reaction from people in the crowd - just people coming up and having selfies and people patting me on the back and wishing me luck."" Huddersfield make Siewert enquiry 'I'm not a stripper' and other mistakes Mr Warhurst acknowledged his likeness with Siewert but joked: ""I'm a much more attractive guy."" He added that he would follow the progress of his ""doppelganger"" and even offered some footballing wisdom. ""My tip, if I were the Huddersfield manager playing against a team like Manchester City, I think if they played a formation of 5-5-5 they might actually stand a chance!""

"Iceland supermarket has told the BBC that - in a bid to meet a pledge to remove palm oil from all its own-brand products - it removed its branding from some items, rather than the ingredient. The retailervowed to remove palm oil from ""100%"" of its own products by the end of 2018, saying demand for the oil was devastating rainforests in Asia. Unable to meet the deadline, it then dropped its name from 17 palm products. Iceland blamed technical issues, adding it did not want to ""mislead consumers"". The retailer said it was pushing its manufacturers ""hard"" to remove palm oil from the items that had previously been own-brand, but now had no branding. It added that it ""was not possible to remove palm oil at a manufacturing level in these products by 31 December 2018"", adding that it had been ""transparent"". Iceland still selling own-brand palm oil Palm oil banned by Iceland supermarkets Warning of palm oil threat to primates Iceland said it had ""not given up"" on the nine frozen and eight chilled lines that had not yet been reformulated, which will have their branding reinstated by April. Consumer group Ethical Consumer said: ""In the cases where they have failed to reformulate products, simply re-labelling them is counter-productive."" It added it was important for companies ""to be transparent about the ethical problems they are facing"". On Wednesday, theBBC revealed Iceland was still selling own-label palm oil products,despite promising to stop doing so by the end of 2018. Iceland blamed a ""website issue"" after the BBC was able to find 28 own-brand products for sale online containing palm oil. Many of the products online were later removed by the retailer, but own-label products containing palm oil were still available to buy in stores that day. Iceland insisted there were no own-label fresh items available that still contained palm oil. ""The Iceland no palm oil pledge is that by the end of 2018, 100% of the supermarket's own label food lines will contain no palm oil, reducing demand for palm oil by more than 500 tonnes per year."" Despite continuing to sell own-label products containing palm oil, Iceland has spent weeks telling its customers on social media that none of its products contains it, while its website states the company is ""simply saying no to palm oil"". Even before the end of 2018, Iceland tweeted one customer to say: ""There's no palm oil in our own-brand products."" When the BBC pointed out that many of its own brand products still contained palm oil, Iceland said it was old stock and it now expected there to be no more products available to buy with palm oil ""within the next few weeks"". Iceland became the first UK supermarket to announce the removal of palm oil from its products when it made the pledge last year. Palm oil cultivation can destroy habitats for orangutans Palm oil production is said to have been responsible for about 8% of the world's deforestation between 1990 and 2008 Burning large areas of forests to clear areas where oil palms can be grown has also been blamed for high levels of air pollution in South East Asia Palm oil is used in almost half the products stocked by UK supermarkets and can be found in everything from shampoos to biscuits, as well as biofuels Some experts say eating palm oil is unhealthy because it is high in saturated fat EU labelling laws were changed in 2014 so products must now state specifically if they contain palm oil Iceland still selling own-brand palm oil Palm oil banned by Iceland supermarkets Warning of palm oil threat to primates New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"The course attracts students from a wide range of backgrounds A US university professor has been removed as director of a graduate programme, amid a furore over an email she sent urging students not to speak Chinese. Megan Neely, an assistant professor at Duke University in North Carolina, said in an email to students that two unnamed faculty members of the biostatistics Masters programme had complained to her about students speaking Chinese in public areas in the department. She said that not speaking English could lead to ""unintended consequences"" for international students. Her email went viral on Twitter and Chinese social media, while Duke's medical faculty has promised to review its biostatistics programme. Many have criticised Dr Neely's email as racist or insensitive, and raised concerns that faculty members were discriminating against international students. However, some ethnic minority students on the Masters programme told the BBC they supported Dr Neely, describing her as a supportive programme director and ""definitely not a racist, not even close"". The controversy erupted after screenshots of Dr Neely's email to biostatistics students began circulating online over the weekend. Duke University confirmed to US media that the screenshots were genuine. Dr Neely said that two faculty members had asked her if she had photos of students on the Masters programme, before picking out a number of first-year students ""who they observed speaking Chinese (in their words, VERY LOUDLY), in the student lounge/study areas"". Dr Neely said that the faculty members told her ""they wanted to write down the names so they could remember them if the students ever interviewed for an internship or asked to work with them for a masters project. They were disappointed that these students were not taking the opportunity to improve their English and were being so impolite as to have a conversation that not everyone on the floor could understand. ""To international students,"" she continued, ""PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE keep these unintended consequences in mind when you choose to speak in Chinese in the building."" She added that she respected international students for learning ""in a non-native language"", but ""I encourage you to commit to using English 100% of the time when you are in Hock [the faculty building] or any other professional setting"". The petition was signed by 2,000 people by Sunday The email went viral after it was leaked online andreported in the student paper The Chronicle,external.  Many found the language in the email patronising, while others wondered if the students had been targeted because they spoke Chinese, rather than another foreign language. For many, however, the most concerning part of the email was the allegation that two faculty members appeared ready to discriminate against students based on what language they spoke with their friends. Australia universities caught in China row 'Say My Name': The Chinese students fighting racism Chinese students slam 'racist' uni email A group calling themselves Concerned Duke Students said in a petition that they were ""gravely concerned"" with the implication ""that students of diverse national origin would be punished in academic and employment opportunities for speaking in their native language outside of classroom settings."" The group told the BBC that more than 2,000 people had signed their petition by Sunday, including current Duke students and alumni, as well as students from other institutions. ""We recognise that language difficulties could be aâ¦ barrier for many international students, but we think this is all the more reason why Duke should treat us with more respect and understanding,"" they said in a statement. Mary Klotman, dean of the medical school which oversees the biostatistics programme, wrote to students over the weekend, telling them: ""There is absolutely no restriction or limitation on the language you use to converse and communicate with each other. Your career opportunities and recommendations will not in any way be influenced by the language you use outside the classroom. And your privacy will always be protected. ""I have asked the university's Office of Institutional Equity to conduct a thorough review of the Master of Biostatistics Programme,"" she added. Dr Neely, who is still in post as an assistant professor, has not yet publicly commented on the controversy. As of Sunday night, millions on Weibo had viewed the hashtag ""Duke University bans speaking Chinese"", while ""Duke University professor who banned speaking Chinese resigns"" was the ninth-most trending hashtag. One Weibo user described the email as ""naked racism"", while another joked: ""Should we also chuck out any foreign exchange students who aren't speaking Chinese on campus, because they haven't taken advantage of the opportunity to learn Chinese in China?""

Meanwhile, several Twitter users began sharing Dr Neely's faculty photo or calling for her to be fired. ""This behaviour is not only hypocritical - given Duke's dependence on international students and faculty for their undergraduate and graduate programs - but also discriminatory,""the university's Asian Students Association said in a statement.,external ""People should wholeheartedly be able to speak any language they wish - to strip away this agency is demeaning, disrespectful, and wholly discriminatory,"" it added. However, others have argued that the furore has been overblown - or that Dr Neely has unfairly borne the brunt of the criticism. One Weibo user suggested that the email had revealed deeper issues on the programme. ""I think this professor's actions may have been well intentioned, instead it might be the two faculty members who asked [for names and photos] who are the real racists,"" they wrote. Three students on Duke's biostatistic masters programme, who asked not to be named, expressed support for her to the BBC. ""Dr Neely is a great instructor and definitely not a racist, not even close,"" one Chinese student said. Another Chinese student told the BBC he had found Dr Neely ""always willing to help"" students of all nationalities, and hoped the university would investigate the two unnamed faculty members mentioned in her email instead. A third student of Asian descent said: ""Megan is truly the best instructor and mentor I ever hadâ¦ She made a mistake [with her email], but we still know what was her intention and how much she cares about us. ""When some people talk loudly in foreign language, other people [in the lounge] are definitely disturbed."" The student added: ""Some of my Chinese friends also told me they are worried that if they support Megan in the public, they might be regarded as 'people who betrayed their country' by other Chinese students in the United States.""

They are fed and watered and looked after on a daily basis by highly trained technicians, and live quite a comfortable life. ""As far as the chicken knows, it's just laying a normal egg. It doesn't affect its health in any way, it's just chugging away, laying eggs as normal."" Scientists have previously shown that genetically modified goats, rabbits and chickens can be used to produce protein therapies in their milk or eggs. The researchers say their new approach is more efficient, produces better yields and is more cost-effective than these previous attempts. ""Production from chickens can cost anywhere from 10 to 100 times less than the factories. So hopefully we'll be looking at at least 10 times lower overall manufacturing cost"" said Dr Herron. Battery ""pharming"": these eggs contain drugs produced at a tenth of the cost of normal production in laboratories The biggest saving comes from the fact that chicken sheds are far cheaper to build and run than highly sterile clean rooms for factory production. Many diseases are caused because the body does not naturally produce enough of a certain chemical or protein. Such diseases can be controlled with drugs that contain the deficient protein. These drugs are synthetically produced by pharmaceutical companies and can be very expensive to manufacture. Dr Herron and her colleagues managed to reduce the costs by inserting a human gene - which normally produces the protein in humans - into the part of the chickens' DNA involved with producing the white in the chickens' eggs. After cracking the eggs and separating the white from the yolk, Dr Herron discovered that the chicken had relatively large quantities of the protein. The team has focused on two proteins that are essential to the immune system: one is IFNalpha2a, which has powerful antiviral and anti-cancer effects, and the other is macrophage-CSF, which is being developed as a therapy that stimulates damaged tissues to repair themselves. Three eggs are enough to produce a dose of the drug, and chickens can lay up to 300 eggs per year. With enough chickens, the researchers believe they can produce drugs in commercial quantities. The development of drugs for human health, and the regulatory hoops required, will take between 10 and 20 years. The researchers are hopeful of using chickens to develop drugs for animal health. These include drugs which boost the immune systems of farm animals as an alternative to antibiotics, which would reduce the risk of the development of new strains of antibiotic-resistant superbugs.  And there is the potential to use the healing properties of macrophage-CSF to treat pets, according to Dr Herron. ""For example, we could use it in regenerating the liver or the kidneys of a pet that has suffered damage to these organs. The drugs currently available are a bit too pricey so we hope that we might be able to get into that a little more,"" she explained. Professor Helen Sang, of the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, said: ""We are not yet producing medicines for people, but this study shows that chickens are commercially viable for producing proteins suitable for drug discovery studies and other applications in biotechnology."" The eggs are produced for research purposes and not on sale in supermarkets.
