"The unusually quiet movie opened with a $50m (Â£35m) weekend at US box office A Quiet Place - a newly released horror film about sound-sensitive monsters that hunt humans - is causing cinema-goers to shun their snacks. The film centres around a family trying to stay alive by living as silently as possible.  It is directed by the star of the US version of The Office, John Krasinski, who plays a lead role alongside his real-life wife Emily Blunt. The script has very little dialogue and lots of dramatic (and quiet) tension. It has already topped the US box office, but is unlikely to be great for cinema popcorn sales, as people have been shaming other movie-goers for eating, or even breathing, too loudly during screenings. Why the horror industry is booming Could you brave an 'immersive horror' show? The BBC's Nick Grimshaw was one of those frustrated by nearby cinema snackers over the weekend. This video can not be played BBC Radio 1 presenter Nick Grimshaw rages at noisy cinema snacking during A Quiet Place Here are just some of the posts on social media complaining about others crunching and munching their way through the film.

"This video can not be played Prof Julian Dowdeswell: ""Sea-ice conditions mean we cannot guarantee to get where we want to"" A scientific expedition will next year try to find the Endurance, the ill-fated ship of Antarctic explorer Sir Ernest Shackleton. The vessel sank in 1915, crushed by sea-ice in the Weddell Sea and lost in 3,000m of water. Shackleton and his crew were forced into lifeboats to make an extraordinary and heroic escape across the Southern Ocean. UK researcher Prof Julian Dowdeswell will lead the international effort. He expects to have the cruise on station in January/February. Locating the shipwreck is not the primary goal of the expedition; the major objective is to visit and study the Larsen C Ice Shelf, which last July calvedone of the biggest icebergs ever recordedin Antarctica. But because Larsen is so close to the last known position of the Endurance, it makes sense to also have a go at finding the famous ship. ""It would be a shame not to,"" said Prof Dowdeswell, the director of theScott Polar Research Institute (SPRI) in Cambridge,external. ""In our study of Larsen, we will be operating autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). But if we can get them in range of where Endurance is thought to be, we will send them under the ice to do a survey. ""They are fitted with downward-looking multi-beam echosounders, which can map out on a grid the shape of the seafloor. You look at that for any signs of the ship and then focus in with cameras if you find something interesting."" Big increase in Antarctic snowfall New map traces Shackleton's footsteps Wreck could be sunken Athenia from WW2 Endurance just before it sank: Crushed at the stern, it went down bow first It is a very tough challenge. The sea-ice in the Weddell Sea is notoriously thick and uncooperative, as Shackleton found to his cost. Even today's technology struggles in the region. An expedition led by the British Antarctic Survey tried to get close to Larsen C earlier this year and wasthwarted by the marine floes. Prof Dowdeswell is hoping for better luck and believes the range and capabilities of the AUVs, provided by the American companyOcean Infinity,external, give the expedition the best possible chance of success. The venture is formally called the Weddell Sea Expedition 2019. It is funded byThe Flotilla Foundation,external, a charitable trust in the Netherlands. Prof Dowdeswell's team brings together a wealth of expertise from the SPRI, the Nekton Foundation, the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, as well as the University of Cape Town and the Nelson Mandela University in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Ocean Infinity's technology is currently looking for missing airliner MH370 The 45-day expedition will operate from theSA Agulhas II, a modern polar research vessel,external. Larsen C is one of the largest ice shelves in Antarctica. It is the floating extension of glaciers that have flowed off the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula and joined together to form one giant buoyant platform. Its northern neighbours, Larsen A and Larsen B, suffered catastrophic break-ups in 1995 and 2002, respectively. These failures unbound the feeding glaciers behind, allowing them to move faster and dump yet more of their ice in the ocean, raising global sea-levels. The production of a near-6,000kmÂ² berg last year now has experts wondering whether Larsen C is also being set up for a collapse. This video can not be played Dr Christine Batchelor is interested in the past positions of glacier grounding lines The Weddell Sea Expedition will try to answer this question by getting in close and making a series of geophysical measurements. The AUVs will be sent into the cavity under the shelf to map the seafloor and the overhanging ice canopy. Drill cores will also be taken from just in front of the shelf. The aim is to establish the past history of ice advance and retreat, to look for old grounding lines - the locations where Larsen's feeding glaciers have previously rested on the seafloor. Have these lines moved back and forward on a fairly regular basis, or have they only ever retreated and at what rate? ""We want to try to put the recent changes that we've seen at the peninsula into their longer-term context,"" said Dr Christine Batchelor, a SPRI fellow who will be an expedition team-member. ""We only have satellite observations for the last few decades. We want to see how those changes fit in when we look over much longer timescales - over hundreds and thousands of years. ""Is what we've been seeing typical behaviour, or something more unusual,"" she told BBC News. Dr Batchelor was speaking here at theEuropean Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly,externalin Vienna, Austria. However, the Weddell Sea expedition will be formally announced in London at theRoyal Geographical Society,external. Endurance is acknowledged to be one of the great undiscovered shipwrecks For the SPRI to be connected with the discovery of the Endurance would be fitting. The institute is, in many ways, the keeper of records for Britain's ""heroic era"" of polar exploration. In its archives are documents related to Endurance skipper, Frank Worsley. It is he, with sextant and chronometer, who calculated the vessel's sinking position on 21 November 1915 as 68Â°39'30.0"" South and 52Â°26'30.0"" West. This is roughly 100-150 nautical miles east of Larsen C. If sea-ice conditions are favourable, the SA Agulhas II is likely to have company on its voyage. The German research ship Polarstern also plans to visit the region of the newly calved iceberg. Its cruise will be led by the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven.

"The bus was reportedly carrying some 40 students when it left the road An investigation has been launched after 27 people, most of them children, died when a school bus fell into a gorge in a mountainous region of India. Most of the passengers were below the age of 10, police said. The bus driver and two teachers were also killed in the accident on Monday evening. The incident occurred in the northern state of Himachal Pradesh. Road accidents are common in India, often due to poor driving or badly maintained roads and vehicles. The reasons behind the accident are not yet clear, according to an official statement. Monday's accident, which occurred about 325km (200 miles) from the state capital, Shimla, involved a bus transporting some 40 students from Wazir Ram Singh Pathania Memorial school in Nurpur in the country's Kangra district. Can India really halve its road deaths? Suraksha Devi, a resident of Nurpur, told BBC Punjabi that four of her grandchildren died in the accident. ""All I have left are photographs of them now,"" she said. Backpacks of the children who were in the bus at the site of the accident Eyewitnesses said the vehicle skidded as it turned a corner and left the mountainous road, India's ANI news agency reported. India's National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) was called to the crash site and is continuing its efforts to reach any passengers trapped in the wreckage. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office tweeted that Mr Modi was ""anguished"" over the news of the deaths. ""My prayers and solidarity with those who lost their near and dear ones in the accident,"" he is quoted as saying in the tweet.

"Barry Gardiner called the Good Friday Agreement a ""shibboleth"" at an event in Brussels A Labour front bencher has suggested the Irish government and Sinn Fein have ""played up"" concerns that Brexit could harm the Good Friday Agreement. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said concerns about the Irish border issue was in the Irish government's ""economic interest"". Mr Gardiner's comments came to light as Northern Ireland marks the 20 years of the Good Friday Agreement. Labour's Owen Smith said the remarks were ""reckless and plain wrong"". The shadow international trade secretary made the comments at a think-tank Q&A session in Brussels last month. In a speech at the think-tank event,posted on his website,external, Mr Gardiner set out Labour's official position on Brexit and a customs union. He suggested a customs union with the EU was at least a partial solution to the problem of the Irish border. Q&A: Brexit and the Irish border Brexit: Progress check on Irish border issues Good Friday Agreement - 20 years on But in an audio recording obtained by the BBC, Mr Gardiner appears to play down the risks of failing to resolve the border issue post-Brexit, and suggests both the Irish government and Sinn Fein may be exaggerating them. ""We must also recognise there are real economic reasons why people have played up the issue of the Irish border and the need to have the shibboleth of the Good Friday Agreement,"" he said. Shibboleth means a long-standing custom, principle or way of speaking which identifies people as a member of a group - and in some modern uses it carries the implication of being outmoded or no longer important. Former Labour Prime Minister Tony Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he didn't know how anybody could say it was outdated, because the Good Friday Agreement ""is the only basis on which you are going to have peace"". Mr Gardiner later issued a statement insisting he ""absolutely"" does not believe the agreement was outdated. He said: ""I am deeply sorry that my informal remarks in a meeting last month have led to misunderstanding on that point - in particular, that my use of the word 'shibboleth' in its sense of 'pass word' or 'test of membership' gave the impression that I thought the Good Friday Agreement was in any way outdated or unimportant. I absolutely do not."" The 1998 peace deal brought an end to The Troubles in Northern Ireland In the audio recording Mr Gardiner said it was ""hugely in the Republic of Ireland's economic interest to make sure there is no tariff and no external border there"". He added the UK leaving the EU did ""not mean putting in a normal border relationship when one party is no longer in the EU will bring back paramilitary activity"". And there were ""very good political reasons"" for playing up the issue too, he said. ""Sinn Fein - who are trusted colleagues - want to see the unification of Ireland. That is a political objective of Sinn Fein. ""But that doesn't mean a normal border will bring back paramilitary activity."" He said his remarks were ""deeply unfashionable"". Reports of his remarks on Twitter over the weekend were dismissed by Mr Gardiner as ""nonsense on stilts"". Writing in the Guardian in March,external, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had made it clear that his party would seek to negotiate a new comprehensive UK-EU customs union to help avoid a hard Irish border. Ex-shadow Northern Ireland secretary Mr Smith told the BBC: ""I worked in Northern Ireland with Barry and it is remarkable that he can display so little understanding of the vital and continuing importance of the Good Friday Agreement, or of the essential need to avoid any hardening of the border in Ireland. ""Labour members will be particularly shocked, but it should concern people in every party and none that there now seems to be a substantial group of senior politicians who are prepared to sacrifice the Good Friday Agreement in order to deliver Brexit."" The 20 March event was a meeting of trade unionists and selected MEPs hosted by the Rosa Luxemburg Stifung - the think tank of Die Linke, the party to the left of Germany's SDP. A response has been sought from Mr Gardiner, and Labour did not want to comment.

Former US Senator George Mitchell, who chaired the negotiations, will join President Clinton, along with Jonathan Powell - an adviser to then prime minister Tony Blair at the time of the peace agreement - and former taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Bertie Ahern. Lord Trimble and Seamus Mallon - the former first and deputy first leaders of the Northern Ireland Assembly - will also attend.

"Ms Duckworth had both legs amputated after her helicopter crashed in Iraq US Senator Tammy Duckworth, 50, has given birth to a daughter, becoming the first sitting female US senator to give birth while in office.

Mrs Duckworth brought her firstborn daughter Abigail to the opening day of the 115th Congress last January Baby Maile - the couple's second daughter - was born in a suburban Washington DC hospital on Monday. ""Parenthood isn't just a women's issue, it's an economic issue and one that affects all parents - men and women alike,"" she said in a statement. ""As tough as juggling the demands of motherhood and being a Senator can be, I'm hardly alone or unique as a working parent, and my children only make me more committed to doing my job and standing up for hardworking families everywhere,"" she continued. Last month senators from both parties, as well as their staff, hosted a baby shower for Mrs Duckworth at the US Capitol, according to the Chicago Sun-Times newspaper, which was first to report the birth.

"Cassie Hayes (left) with her mother Tracy Hayes (centre) and sister Nadine Hayes (right) A man who murdered his ex-partner's new girlfriend by cutting her throat at her workplace has been jailed for a minimum of 26 years. Travel agent Cassie Hayes, 28, was attacked at the Tui store in Southport town centre on 13 January. Andrew Burke, 31, of St Helens, had been convicted the day before of harassing his former partner Laura Williams. The judge described Ms Hayes's death as a ""cold-blooded execution in public"". Burke pleaded guilty to murder and having an offensive weapon, namely a knife, in a public place and was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court for a minimum of 26 years on Monday. Sentencing him to life, Judge David Aubrey described the murder as ""an act of unspeakable savagery"". ""This was a cowardly act of revenge designed to kill and did kill a totally innocent person in broad daylight in front of, and witnessed by, so many,"" he added. Andrew Burke told police: ""It was either kill me or kill her, so I killed her"" Prosecutor Gordon Cole QC said the murder of Ms Hayes, who was originally from Alnwick, Northumberland, was a pre-meditated and planned attack carried out in a ""chilling and ruthless way"". ""It was essentially an execution of a young woman in her place of work,"" he added. The court heard Ms Hayes, who had a four-year-old daughter, was attending to a family at the Tui branch on a Saturday lunchtime when Burke entered with his hood up. He then told a cashier: ""I just want to apologise for what I am about to do."" After killing Ms Hayes, Burke remained at the back of the shop and made apologies by saying that nobody deserved to see what happened, the court was told. He was also heard to have made remarks to the effect that Ms Hayes ""had it coming for her what she had done to his family"". Laura Williams said Cassie Hayes (right) was ""my future wife and my forever"" A post-mortem examination found Ms Hayes died of shock and haemorrhaging due to a wound to the throat. The court heard staff and customers who witnessed the attack, including a 12-year-old girl, had suffered flashbacks of the attack, with one of Ms Hayes's colleagues saying she had become a recluse since it happened. Ms Hayes's mother told Burke he should ""rot in hell"" for taking away ""my whole world"" as she read out a victim impact statement in court. ""You are the most evil, evil monster walking on this whole earth. You do not deserve to breathe fresh air,"" Tracy Hayes added. Cassie Hayes's mother Tracy (centre) was at court with her other daughter Nadine (second from right) The court heard police officers found Burke lying on the floor in the centre of the shop with his head towards the door. He then told a firearms officer: ""I'm no threat to you, officer. I've got nothing else on me. The knife's on the table."" Mr Cole added: ""After this ruthless and chilling murder the defendant seemed to remain calm. ""He showed no emotion and remained seated whilst everybody else was reacting in one way or another to what had happened."" The court heard Burke also told police: ""It was either kill me or kill her, so I killed her."" He added: ""Can you tell the family that was in here I'm sorry, I thought I'd waited till there were no kids in there."" Andrew Burke attacked Cassie Hayes at the Tui store in Southport town centre Burke, of Vincent Street, was the ex-partner of Ms Williams, 29, who had been in a relationship with Ms Hayes since the break-up. He had been charged with harassing Ms Williams on 13 November and was bailed ahead of sentencing after being convicted of the offence on 12 January. Burke was also the subject of an allegation of harassment against Ms Hayes from May and was issued with a police information notice warning him regarding any future contact. He had been fined at court in January 2017 for making malicious communications when his mother made a statement to police about remarks he had made to her over the phone when he repeatedly threatened to kill himself or Ms Hayes because he held her responsible for the end of his relationship.

"Facebook users will see one of these two screens, informing them whether their data may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica Facebook members can discover whether they are among the 87 million potential users whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica. Every account holder is being sent one of two notices informing them whether their data was breached. The tech giant said people will also be shown what apps they use and what data those apps may have gathered. Facebook has additionally suspended a data analytics firm called Cubeyou, ahead of an investigation. The tech giant will look into whether Cubeyou collected data for academic purposes and then used it commercially, following a partnership with Cambridge University in the UK. Cubeyou denies the allegations. The investigationfollows allegations reported by CNBC,external, regarding a personality quiz called ""You Are What You Like"", which the University says was later replaced by a separate app called ""Apply Magic Sauce"". However, the website from the original quiz redirected users to the new one without any clear explanation that it was a different product, with different terms and conditions. Both the firm and Cambridge University state that the You Are What You Like app made it clear that data was for use in both academic and business purposes. How to protect your Facebook data Facebook reveals  US Congress testimony In an emailed statement received by Bloomberg, Ime Archibong, Facebook's vice-president of product partnerships, said Cubeyou's apps would all be banned from the platform if the data firm ""refuses or fails"" the audit. Cubeyou said it has always complied with Facebook's rules. The news comes as Facebook chief Mark Zuckerbergrevealed how he plans to begin two days of testimonyto Congress in Washington regarding the recent scandals. His opening remarks include a pledge to never let advertisers or developers ""take priority over"" his firm's mission to connect people. An archived version of the You Are What You Like website. The terms and conditions link did not work on this page The You Are What You Like website was created by Cubeyou in partnership with Cambridge University's Psychometric Centre. The university said that those who took part would have consented to their data being used ""for both academic and business purposes"" as it was written in the terms and conditions on the site - and added that all data was anonymised. However, onthe current terms and conditions for Apply Magic Sauce,external, the university states that the site may only be used for ""non-profit academic research"". The university says that Apply Magic Sauce is a separate product which Cubeyou had no access to. ""Cubeyou merely designed the interface for a website that used our models to give users insight on their data,"" the university said. ""We have had no contact with Cubeyou since June 2015."" This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica claims its research gave President Trump his winning edge The University was also implicated in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, as one of its academics developed the quiz which harvested the data that was acquired by Cambridge Analytica's possession. Cambridge University denied working with Cambridge Analytica or its parent company SCL and said it had never provided any data, algorithms or expertise. It is one of a number of firms set up to help businesses such as publishers and advertisers target their marketing. It is unknown whether it has also helped campaigns spread political messages, as was the case with Cambridge Analytica. On its website, data firm Cubeyou describes itself has having ""all the best consumer data sources in one place"". ""Identify consumers not only by their demographics or consumption habits but by leveraging the whole spectrum of their personalities, interests and passions,"" it says. Other Facebook developments include: Apple co-founder Steve Wozniaktold USA Today,externalthat he was leaving Facebook as he was concerned about the way many tech firms make money from personal data Facebook confirmed that it wasworking on a feature that would enable users to delete messages they had already sent,externalfrom the inbox of the recipients. However, the firm told The Verge news site that it ""may take some time"". It followed news that messages from Mark Zuckerberg had been ""unsent"" in this way If you have yet to receive one of the notices, Facebook has also provided a tool to check if your information could havebeen shared with Cambridge Analytica,external. Facebook stopped letting third-party apps examine the likes, status updates and other information shared by users' friends in 2015 - so, if you are worried about developers you have never heard of profiling you, that should already have been tackled. In addition, over the past couple of weeks, the social network has taken further steps to limit what can be learned from app users themselves, including making their religious and political views out-of-bounds. But members wanting to be more proactive about their privacy can read up on Facebook's revampedterms of service,externalanddata use policy,external, which have been rewritten to make their language clearer. Clicking into Facebook's search box reveals the option to delete records of individual past queries or, alternatively, all previous entries in one go. Users can also delve into the app's settings menu to see exactly what apps they use and what data they are sharing - although they may wish to wait a little while, as the firm haspromised to revamp the tools soon. In addition, they can take advantage of the platform's archive tool, which allows them to download a copy of all the messages, photos and other personal information thatthey have posted to the service,external. Just bear in mind, it does not include data others may have posted about them or information acquired from third-party companies to fine-tune ad targeting. Finally there's the nuclear option: the ability to delete an account via the settings menu. Update 10 April 2018: This story has been amended, following updated information supplied by Cambridge University, that the two apps, You Are What You Like and Apply Magic Sauce, are two separate products, despite web traffic from the former being automatically redirected to the latter. The University agreed to add a note to the You Are What You Like website to clarify the situation.

"A satellite image showing the T4/Tiyas airbase in central Syria The Syrian government and its ally Russia have blamed Israel for a deadly attack on a Syrian military airport. Monday's attack hit the Tiyas airbase, known as T4, near the city of Homs. Observers say 14 people were killed. Israel, which has previously hit Syrian targets, has not commented. Syria initially blamed the US for the strike. The incident comes amid international alarm over an alleged chemical attack on a Syrian rebel-held town. The US and France had threatened to respond. US President Donald Trump said there would be a ""big price to pay""for the alleged chemical attack in Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region, near the capital Damascus. He branded Syria's President Bashar al-Assad an ""animal"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said accusations that Mr Assad is behind the attack were a ""provocation"". Moscow favoured an ""honest investigation"" of such incidents but opposed apportioning blame without any proof, he added. Meanwhile, Ahmet Uzumcu, head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, expressed ""grave concern"" about the alleged attack. The OPCW is currently gathering information about the possible use of chemical weapons. Why is there a war in Syria? Syrian state news agency Sana, quoting a military source, reported that air defences had repelled an Israeli missile attack on T4, saying the missiles were fired by Israeli F15 jets in Lebanese airspace. Russia's defence ministry said that, of eight missiles, five were shot down and three reached the western part of the aerodrome. Israel rarely acknowledges carrying out strikes, but has admitted attacking targets in Syria dozens of times since 2012.Its heaviest air strike on Syria, in February this year, included targeting the T4 air base. That followed an incursion by an Iranian drone into Israel and the shooting down by Syrian air defences of an Israeli F16 fighter jet. Israel has said it will not allow Iran, its arch-foe, to set up bases in Syria or operate from there, something Israel considers a major threat. The Israeli military said Iran and its Revolutionary Guards had long been active in the T4 base, and were using it to transfer weapons, including to Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah, an enemy of Israel. They also said the drone had been launched from the base. Iran building base in Syria - claim UK-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said that fighters of various nationalities - meaning Iranians or members of Iranian-backed Shia militias - were among the 14 dead at the base. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent This attack could be part of Israel's growing effort to contain Iran's military build-up in Syria and to interrupt the supply of advanced Iranian missiles to its Lebanese Shia ally, Hezbollah. Any Israeli operation would have been closely monitored by Russian air defence radars in Syria. There is also a telephone hotline between the Israelis and the Russian headquarters in Syria. So far Moscow has done nothing to interfere with Israel's air operations. But the presence of Russia's air defences in Syria certainly complicates the strategic equation as Western governments ponder their response to the recent chemical attack. Mr Trump and France's President Emmanuel Macron issued a joint statement on Sunday vowing to ""co-ordinate a strong, joint response"" to the alleged chemical attack. Suspected Syria chemical attack kills scores But US officials said America did not launch the overnight strike. ""At this time, the Department of Defense is not conducting air strikes in Syria,"" the Pentagon said in a statement. This video can not be played A short guide to the Syrian civil war ""However, we continue to closely watch the situation and support the ongoing diplomatic efforts to hold those who use chemical weapons, in Syria and otherwise, accountable."" France also issued a denial. Sana initially called the reported missile strike on the Tiyas airfield a ""suspected US attack"", but later dropped the reference to the US. In April 2017, the US fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Syria's Shayrat military airfieldin response to a chemical weapons attack on a different rebel-held town, Khan Sheikhoun. Medical sources say dozens of people were killed on Saturday in the attack on Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region. One video, recorded by rescue workers known as the White Helmets, shows a number of men, women and children lying lifeless inside a house, many with foam at their mouths. However, it has not been possible to verify independently what actually happened, or the actual number of dead. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack The UN Security Council is expected to discuss the crisis on Monday. Both Syria and Russia deny a chemical attack took place, and have reached an evacuation deal with the Jaish al-Islam rebels who hold Douma. Moscow said military operations there had been halted. Under the deal, 100 buses are said to be moving 8,000 fighters and 40,000 of their relatives out of the battered town. Hostages who had been held by the rebels are being set free. The development means pro-government forces have now taken full control of Eastern Ghouta. Analysts say this is President Assad's biggest military success since the fall of Aleppo in 2016. It follows a weeks-long government offensive in which more than 1,600 people were killed.

"The character is voiced by Hank Azaria, who also plays Moe the bartender and Chief Wiggum The latest episode of the Simpsons has addressed controversy surrounding Indian character Apu for the first time. Indian-American comic Hari Kondabolu made a documentary last year, saying the character was founded on racial stereotypes. Sunday's episode made a nod to the accusations, but some viewers found it insufficient. Others defended the show and said all its characters were stereotypes. Shopkeeper Apu Nahasapeemapetilon has been part of the long-running animation series since 1990 and is voiced by a white actor, who puts on a heavy Indian accent. Mr Kondabolu told the BBC last year that the character was problematic because he is defined by his joband how many children he has in his arranged marriage. In his documentary, The Problem with Apu, he said Apu was one of the only representations of South Asians on US television when he was growing up and other children imitated the character to mock him. Apu: a stereotype hiding in plain sight During the new episode of The Simpsons, the characters of Marge and Lisa indirectly discuss the controversy around the characterisation. In the scene, Marge changes a bedtime story to make it more politically correct, but her daughter objects. A distressed Marge then asks her daughter what she is supposed to do. Lisa turns to the camera and says: ""It's hard to say. Something that started a long time ago decades ago, that was applauded and was inoffensive, is now politically incorrect. What can you do?"" She then signals to a photograph of Apu by her bedside, which is signed: ""Don't have a cow - Apu"". Hari Kondabolu's documentary was about Apu, and other Hollywood representations, being problematic Some people on social media said the brief reference brushed off an important debate, while others pointed out that a lot of characters in the fictional town of Springfield are based on stereotypes. Word created by The Simpsons added to dictionary Simpsons predictions that could still come true Simpsons writer pays tribute to Stephen Hawking Mr Kondabolu posted a series of tweets after the episode, expressing his disappointment at how the makers addressed the controversy.

"This video can not be played London violence: Mother of murdered teen in tears over his death Gangs that recruit children as drug couriers will be targeted by a government strategy aiming to cut violent crime in England and Wales. The home secretary said it would also focus on the online ""glamourisation"" of crime and supporting young people. Amber Rudd said there was a ""strong link"" between the illegal drugs market and rising violence. However, a leaked Home Office document linked the rise to falling police officers. It said a lack of resources and fewer people being charged may have ""encouraged"" offenders to commit crimes. But Ms Rudd said it was a ""mistake"" and a ""disservice"" to communities and families to blame police numbers alone. The new strategy comes amid concerns following thedeaths of more than 50 people in violent attacksin London since the start of the year. The names and faces of those killed in London London killings: Why are they happening? Britain's Teenage Drug Runners 'I don't agree young people have nowhere to go' Part of the government's Â£40mSerious Violence Strategy,externalwill include: Exploring the legal responsibility of social media firms Implementing more ways to flag inappropriate material online - specifically on video platforms Establishing new partnerships within the community to ensure young people get support at a local level Some will be given early access to a scheme which promotes employment and provides work experience opportunities This video can not be played âI was a teenage drug runnerâ Ms Rudd said the plans would also focus on early intervention and tougher law enforcement. The strategy, which was first outlined last year, will target so-called ""county lines"" drug distribution, where city gangs courier heroin and crack cocaine to rural or coastal towns. The gangs use children as young as 12 to traffic drugs, using dedicated mobile phones or ""lines"". ""The evidence is we're seeing a different approach to drug dealing, a different approach to using children in the most disgraceful way as drug dealers,"" Ms Rudd said. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The 114-page strategy document contains an impressive level of analysis on the way illicit drugs may be driving serious violence, an apparent shift towards younger offenders and the importance of early intervention. But there is a huge gap. There is no mention of police resources or the cuts that have left forces across England and Wales with 21,000 fewer officers and 7,000 fewer police community support officers than in 2010. The document hints at the problem - police are catching proportionately fewer robbery suspects despite rising levels of the crime - but does not say why. Given that a leaked Home Office analysis suggested that a lack of resources may have ""encouraged"" offenders to commit robbery, the assumption is that this was a deliberate omission. The result is that it undermines the credibility of the rest of the strategy. Under the plans, Â£3.6m will go to a national county-lines coordination centre to gather ""vital intelligence"" about illegal drugs markets. And Â£11m will be spent on an ""early intervention youth fund"" to help young people at risk of getting involved in violence. A new Offensive Weapons Bill includes new proposals on the carrying of knives and acid. It includes: Restrictions on online sales of knives - preventing them from being posted to residential addresses It would also become illegal to possess in private certain weapons such as zombie knives and knuckle-dusters A ban on the sale of the most dangerous corrosive products to under-18s A consultation on extending stop-and-search powers to enable the police to seize acid from people carrying it in public without good reason Making it an offence to possess a knife on a further education premises Ms Rudd emphasised the government's determination to halt the rise in violence Ms Rudd said the government would also tell social media companies to do more to remove violent gang content. She also announced a cross-party taskforce, which would involve MPs, police and local communities, to tackle serious violence, as well as hold an international symposium on what drives violent crime. The leaked document from February notes that forces have faced greater demand since 2012 due to an increase in recorded sex offences while during the same time officer numbers have fallen. It says this pressure on resources had not been the ""main driver"" for the shift but has ""likely contributed"". Is UK the 'drugs market of Europe'? Corbyn: Tories have failed on policing Violent crime rising, police figures suggest Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales The analysis added forces with the largest fall in officer numbers did not see the biggest rise in serious violence. The government dismissed the claim but said it did not comment on leaked documents. Across England and Wales, the number of police officers fell by 14%, to 121,929, between September 2010 and September 2017, according to theHome Office,external. It said that out of 43 territorial police forces in England and Wales, 25 recorded falls in police numbers in the year to 30 September. Some of the biggest falls were recorded in the West Midlands (-4.1%), Thames Valley (-2.9%) and the Metropolitan Police (-2.9%). The Met, which has more than 30,000 officers, saw officer numbers fall by 922 over the year. Reality Check: Is crime up or down? Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had ""decimated"" local services, adding that ""cuts have consequences"". Speaking at the launch of Labour's local election campaign in London, he said: ""Today's leaked documents make a nonsense, an absolute nonsense, of the Tories' repeated claims that their cuts to police numbers have had no effect."" The Local Government Association said it supported tackling crime by involving young people and communities but admitted it would be a challenge to sustain this success. ""Councils are still waiting to receive their youth justice grant allocations for 2018/19.

"The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) says investigators spent the morning at the scene A 41-year-old man has been shot dead by armed officers in east London, Metropolitan Police say. He was said to be making threats in the Collier Row area of Romford, claiming he had a gun. He was shot at a petrol station by officers at about 04:45 BST and was pronounced dead at 05:17, the Met said. The shooting has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) as well as to the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards. The IOPC said investigators had recovered a non-police firearm from the scene. Local resident Angela Dorman was heading to work when she saw a ""large police cordon"" and heard ""lots of police sirens"". ""As I got to the Esso garage I could see white tarpaulin covering something, there were also gloves and tissues lying on the ground,"" she said. ""I could see one police officer standing on the garage's concourse."" The Met Police claims the man was ""making threats"" and said he had a gun Forensics officers could be seen moving a tent on to the Esso petrol station on Collier Row Road shortly before 11:00. Tracy Green, 39, who lives about 100 yards from the station, said she was woken up by two gunshots. She said: ""I was just turning over and heard 'bang, bang' and thought 'oh that sounded like gunshots'. ""It's crazy really. It's too close to home."" The Independent Office for Police Conduct has launched its own investigation into the shooting Her neighbour Darren Buckley, 50, said he saw at least two ambulances and several police vehicles when he went outside. He added: ""I didn't hear gunshots, but seeing all the vehicles I thought it was a car crash or something, seeing all the blue lights. ""I saw an ARV (armed response vehicle) race away as well."" The IOPC is carrying out its own investigation into the fatal shooting. Gloves and tissues surrounded a tarpaulin at the scene Regional director of the IOPC, Sarah Green, said the three firearms officers who were at the scene when the man was shot had provided witness accounts and footage from their body-worn cameras. ""We have met with the man's next of kin and we will be keeping them informed as our investigation progresses,"" she said. London Ambulance Service sent two ambulance crews, two single responders and two incident responders to the scene, while the air ambulance also dispatched a road vehicle in a bid to save the man. The Met has also informed its Directorate of Professional Standards of the fatal shooting So far this year, the IOPC has begun several separate investigations into actions involving the Met Police. These include a21-year-old man who was shot at 13 times in Hackney; an officer who was filmed""striking a man during a political protest"",externaland two people who died while in police custody.

"Lord Taylor of Blackburn died nine days after he was knocked off his mobility scooter A lorry driver has been given a 24-week suspended jail sentence for knocking a Labour peer off his mobility scooter and killing him. Kul Pandey, 56, from Feltham, west London, had previously admitted causing the death by careless driving of Lord Taylor of Blackburn. The 87-year-old died nine days after being knocked off his scooter outside the House of Lords in November 2016. The great-grandfather ""fought injustice all his life"", the Old Bailey heard. Pandey's jail term was suspended for two years and he was ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work. The former Nepalese Gurkha was also disqualified from driving for three years. The peer was on a zebra crossing when the heavy goods vehicle hit him. Sentencing Pandey, Judge Anuja Dhir QC said: ""The size of the vehicle you were driving and the weather conditions on that day should have meant that you were even more careful than you would normally be. You were not."" But the judge suspended Pandey's sentence because of his ""genuine remorse"". The court heard how Pandey, who served for a decade in the Royal Gurhka Rifles, was returning to Shepperton after making a delivery when the crash happened at 18:00 GMT on 16 November. It was raining and dark as he stopped at the crossing, overshooting a give way sign. He allowed several pedestrians go but pulled out two seconds after Lord Taylor began to cross without checking his mirrors properly, the court heard. After hitting the peer, he told his assistant in the cab: ""I think I have hit someone. I think I have killed them."" Lord Taylor's son Paul Taylor said in a victim impact statement that his father ""loved to help people and fought injustice all his life"". He said he became even closer to his family since the birth of his two great-grandchildren, Samuel and Abigail. ""Of the two great-grandchildren, Samuel has taken the death of my father the hardest. He knows he won't be seeing him again."" Mitigating, Michael Rawlinson said Pandey acknowledged the ""immeasurable"" suffering and hurt of the Taylor family.

"This video can not be played Liz Thomas on Antarctica's greater snowfall: ""As things get warmer, they get wetter."" Scientists have compiled a record of snowfall in Antarctica going back 200 years. The study shows there has been a significant increase in precipitation over the period, up 10%. The effect of the extra snow locked up in Antarctica is to slightly slow a general trend in global sea-level rise. However, this mitigation is still swamped by the contribution to the height of the oceans from ice melt around the continent. Some 272 billion tonnes more snow were being dumped on the White Continent annually in the decade 2001-2010 compared with 1801-1810. This yearly extra is equivalent to twice the water volume found today in the Dead Sea. Put another way, it is the amount of water you would need to cover New Zealand to a depth of 1m. Dr Liz Thomas presented the results of the studyat the European Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly,externalhere in Vienna, Austria. Antarctica 'gives ground to the ocean' 'Boaty McBoatface' survives ice mission Space lasers to track Earth's ice Much of the extra snow has fallen on the Antarctic Peninsula The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) researcher said the work was undertaken to try to put current ice losses into a broader context. ""The idea was to get as comprehensive a view of the continent as possible,"" she told BBC News. ""There's been a lot of focus on the recent era with satellites and how much mass we've been losing from big glaciers such as Pine Island and Thwaites. But, actually, we don't have a very good understanding of how the snowfall has been changing. ""The general assumption up until now is that it hasn't really changed at all - that it's just stayed stable. Well, this study shows that's not the case.â Cores have been collected across the continent - making this the largest study of its kind Dr Thomas and colleagues examined 79 ice cores drilled from across Antarctica. These long cylinders of frozen material are essentially just years of compacted snow. By analysing the cores' chemistry, it is possible to determine not only when their snows fell but also how much precipitation came down. For example, one key marker used to differentiate one year from the next, even seasons, is hydrogen peroxide. This is a photochemical product that forms in the atmosphere when water vapour encounters sunlight. ""For us, that's perfect. Antarctica works like an on-off switch with the long 'polar nights' in winter and long periods of daylight in summer,"" Dr Thomas explained. The previous, most extensive survey of this kind assessed just 16 cores. The new study is therefore much more representative of snowfall behaviour across the entire continent. It found the greater precipitation delivered additional mass to the Antarctic ice sheet at a rate of 7 billion tonnes per decade between 1800 and 2010 and by 14 billion tonnes per decade when only the period from 1900 is considered. Most of this extra snow has fallen on the Antarctic Peninsula, which saw significant increases in temperature during the 20th Century. ""Theory predicts that, as Antarctica warms, the atmosphere should hold more moisture and that this should lead therefore to more snowfall. And what we're showing in this study is that this has already been happening,"" Dr Thomas said. Artwork: Satellites routinely map Antarctica, but their data record is only about 25 years The BAS researcher is keen to stress that the increases in snowfall do not contradict the observations of glacial retreat and thinning observed by satellites over the last 25 years. Although the extra snow since 1900 has worked to lower global sea level by about 0.04mm per decade, this is more than being countered by the ice lost to the oceans at Antarctica's margins, where warm water is melting the undersides of glaciers. Dr Anna Hogg, from Leeds University, UK, uses radar satellites to measure the shape and mass of the ice sheet. She told BBC News: ""Even with these large snowfall events, Antarctica is still losing ice mass at a faster rate than it is gaining mass from snowfall, mainly due to the regions of known ice dynamic instability, such as in the Amundsen Sea Embayment which includes Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers. ""The Antarctic 4.3mm contribution to global sea level since about 1992 is still our best estimate."" Liz Thomas' research has been published in theEGU journal Climate of the Past,external.

Indian-American comic Hari Kondabolu made a documentary last year, saying the character was founded on racial stereotypes. Sunday's episode made a nod to the accusations, but some viewers found it insufficient. Others defended the show and said all its characters were stereotypes. Shopkeeper Apu Nahasapeemapetilon has been part of the long-running animation series since 1990 and is voiced by a white actor, who puts on a heavy Indian accent. Mr Kondabolu told the BBC last year that the character was problematic because he is defined by his joband how many children he has in his arranged marriage. In his documentary, The Problem with Apu, he said Apu was one of the only representations of South Asians on US television when he was growing up and other children imitated the character to mock him. Apu: a stereotype hiding in plain sight During the new episode of The Simpsons, the characters of Marge and Lisa indirectly discuss the controversy around the characterisation. In the scene, Marge changes a bedtime story to make it more politically correct, but her daughter objects. A distressed Marge then asks her daughter what she is supposed to do. Lisa turns to the camera and says: ""It's hard to say. Something that started a long time ago decades ago, that was applauded and was inoffensive, is now politically incorrect. What can you do?"" She then signals to a photograph of Apu by her bedside, which is signed: ""Don't have a cow - Apu"". Hari Kondabolu's documentary was about Apu, and other Hollywood representations, being problematic Some people on social media said the brief reference brushed off an important debate, while others pointed out that a lot of characters in the fictional town of Springfield are based on stereotypes. Word created by The Simpsons added to dictionary Simpsons predictions that could still come true Simpsons writer pays tribute to Stephen Hawking Mr Kondabolu posted a series of tweets after the episode, expressing his disappointment at how the makers addressed the controversy.

"Facebook users will see one of these two screens, informing them whether their data may have been shared with Cambridge Analytica Facebook members can discover whether they are among the 87 million potential users whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica. Every account holder is being sent one of two notices informing them whether their data was breached. The tech giant said people will also be shown what apps they use and what data those apps may have gathered. Facebook has additionally suspended a data analytics firm called Cubeyou, ahead of an investigation. The tech giant will look into whether Cubeyou collected data for academic purposes and then used it commercially, following a partnership with Cambridge University in the UK. Cubeyou denies the allegations. The investigationfollows allegations reported by CNBC,external, regarding a personality quiz called ""You Are What You Like"", which the University says was later replaced by a separate app called ""Apply Magic Sauce"". However, the website from the original quiz redirected users to the new one without any clear explanation that it was a different product, with different terms and conditions. Both the firm and Cambridge University state that the You Are What You Like app made it clear that data was for use in both academic and business purposes. How to protect your Facebook data Facebook reveals  US Congress testimony In an emailed statement received by Bloomberg, Ime Archibong, Facebook's vice-president of product partnerships, said Cubeyou's apps would all be banned from the platform if the data firm ""refuses or fails"" the audit. Cubeyou said it has always complied with Facebook's rules. The news comes as Facebook chief Mark Zuckerbergrevealed how he plans to begin two days of testimonyto Congress in Washington regarding the recent scandals. His opening remarks include a pledge to never let advertisers or developers ""take priority over"" his firm's mission to connect people. An archived version of the You Are What You Like website. The terms and conditions link did not work on this page The You Are What You Like website was created by Cubeyou in partnership with Cambridge University's Psychometric Centre. The university said that those who took part would have consented to their data being used ""for both academic and business purposes"" as it was written in the terms and conditions on the site - and added that all data was anonymised. However, onthe current terms and conditions for Apply Magic Sauce,external, the university states that the site may only be used for ""non-profit academic research"". The university says that Apply Magic Sauce is a separate product which Cubeyou had no access to. ""Cubeyou merely designed the interface for a website that used our models to give users insight on their data,"" the university said. ""We have had no contact with Cubeyou since June 2015."" This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica claims its research gave President Trump his winning edge The University was also implicated in the Cambridge Analytica scandal, as one of its academics developed the quiz which harvested the data that was acquired by Cambridge Analytica's possession. Cambridge University denied working with Cambridge Analytica or its parent company SCL and said it had never provided any data, algorithms or expertise. It is one of a number of firms set up to help businesses such as publishers and advertisers target their marketing. It is unknown whether it has also helped campaigns spread political messages, as was the case with Cambridge Analytica. On its website, data firm Cubeyou describes itself has having ""all the best consumer data sources in one place"".

However, the firm told The Verge news site that it ""may take some time"". It followed news that messages from Mark Zuckerberg had been ""unsent"" in this way If you have yet to receive one of the notices, Facebook has also provided a tool to check if your information could havebeen shared with Cambridge Analytica,external. Facebook stopped letting third-party apps examine the likes, status updates and other information shared by users' friends in 2015 - so, if you are worried about developers you have never heard of profiling you, that should already have been tackled. In addition, over the past couple of weeks, the social network has taken further steps to limit what can be learned from app users themselves, including making their religious and political views out-of-bounds. But members wanting to be more proactive about their privacy can read up on Facebook's revampedterms of service,externalanddata use policy,external, which have been rewritten to make their language clearer. Clicking into Facebook's search box reveals the option to delete records of individual past queries or, alternatively, all previous entries in one go. Users can also delve into the app's settings menu to see exactly what apps they use and what data they are sharing - although they may wish to wait a little while, as the firm haspromised to revamp the tools soon. In addition, they can take advantage of the platform's archive tool, which allows them to download a copy of all the messages, photos and other personal information thatthey have posted to the service,external. Just bear in mind, it does not include data others may have posted about them or information acquired from third-party companies to fine-tune ad targeting. Finally there's the nuclear option: the ability to delete an account via the settings menu. Update 10 April 2018: This story has been amended, following updated information supplied by Cambridge University, that the two apps, You Are What You Like and Apply Magic Sauce, are two separate products, despite web traffic from the former being automatically redirected to the latter. The University agreed to add a note to the You Are What You Like website to clarify the situation.

"This video can not be played Liz Thomas on Antarctica's greater snowfall: ""As things get warmer, they get wetter."" Scientists have compiled a record of snowfall in Antarctica going back 200 years. The study shows there has been a significant increase in precipitation over the period, up 10%. The effect of the extra snow locked up in Antarctica is to slightly slow a general trend in global sea-level rise. However, this mitigation is still swamped by the contribution to the height of the oceans from ice melt around the continent. Some 272 billion tonnes more snow were being dumped on the White Continent annually in the decade 2001-2010 compared with 1801-1810. This yearly extra is equivalent to twice the water volume found today in the Dead Sea. Put another way, it is the amount of water you would need to cover New Zealand to a depth of 1m. Dr Liz Thomas presented the results of the studyat the European Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly,externalhere in Vienna, Austria. Antarctica 'gives ground to the ocean' 'Boaty McBoatface' survives ice mission Space lasers to track Earth's ice Much of the extra snow has fallen on the Antarctic Peninsula The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) researcher said the work was undertaken to try to put current ice losses into a broader context. ""The idea was to get as comprehensive a view of the continent as possible,"" she told BBC News. ""There's been a lot of focus on the recent era with satellites and how much mass we've been losing from big glaciers such as Pine Island and Thwaites. But, actually, we don't have a very good understanding of how the snowfall has been changing. ""The general assumption up until now is that it hasn't really changed at all - that it's just stayed stable. Well, this study shows that's not the case.â Cores have been collected across the continent - making this the largest study of its kind Dr Thomas and colleagues examined 79 ice cores drilled from across Antarctica. These long cylinders of frozen material are essentially just years of compacted snow. By analysing the cores' chemistry, it is possible to determine not only when their snows fell but also how much precipitation came down. For example, one key marker used to differentiate one year from the next, even seasons, is hydrogen peroxide. This is a photochemical product that forms in the atmosphere when water vapour encounters sunlight. ""For us, that's perfect. Antarctica works like an on-off switch with the long 'polar nights' in winter and long periods of daylight in summer,"" Dr Thomas explained. The previous, most extensive survey of this kind assessed just 16 cores. The new study is therefore much more representative of snowfall behaviour across the entire continent. It found the greater precipitation delivered additional mass to the Antarctic ice sheet at a rate of 7 billion tonnes per decade between 1800 and 2010 and by 14 billion tonnes per decade when only the period from 1900 is considered. Most of this extra snow has fallen on the Antarctic Peninsula, which saw significant increases in temperature during the 20th Century. ""Theory predicts that, as Antarctica warms, the atmosphere should hold more moisture and that this should lead therefore to more snowfall. And what we're showing in this study is that this has already been happening,"" Dr Thomas said. Artwork: Satellites routinely map Antarctica, but their data record is only about 25 years The BAS researcher is keen to stress that the increases in snowfall do not contradict the observations of glacial retreat and thinning observed by satellites over the last 25 years. Although the extra snow since 1900 has worked to lower global sea level by about 0.04mm per decade, this is more than being countered by the ice lost to the oceans at Antarctica's margins, where warm water is melting the undersides of glaciers. Dr Anna Hogg, from Leeds University, UK, uses radar satellites to measure the shape and mass of the ice sheet. She told BBC News: ""Even with these large snowfall events, Antarctica is still losing ice mass at a faster rate than it is gaining mass from snowfall, mainly due to the regions of known ice dynamic instability, such as in the Amundsen Sea Embayment which includes Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers. ""The Antarctic 4.3mm contribution to global sea level since about 1992 is still our best estimate."" Liz Thomas' research has been published in theEGU journal Climate of the Past,external.

""We further declare that any engagement in criminal acts by any individuals within our organisations will be regarded as placing those persons outside the memberships. This has been collectively agreed."" During the Troubles, the UDA was the biggest loyalist paramilitary group The statement is the result of lengthy discussions between the loyalist groups and three former Protestant church leaders. Those former leaders -  Alan Harper, former Church of Ireland Archbishop of Armagh and All-Ireland Primate, Harold Good, former Methodist President, and Norman Hamilton, former Moderator of the Presbyterian Church - took part in Monday's news conference.

""Obviously, if you see the people on the stage here with us, that's a profound difference,"" Mr McDonald replied. ""I'd like to thank, by the way, the members of the churches here today and the other members that have been with us over the many, many months it's taken to draw this statement up.

The statement, entitled A Loyalist Declaration of Transformation,  said the loyalist groups want to play a constructive role and to ""provide strong community leadership"". ""For too long we have been berated for our past and not able to imagine a better future,"" it said. ""We must challenge that outlook by no longer being apologists for conflict but advocates for change and working to create a society that is at ease with itself in its diversity and difference."" The UVF and its affiliate group, the Red Hand Commando, were blamed for over 500 deaths The loyalist groups also said they recognise the importance of a legacy process ""designed to help Northern Ireland confront the past"". But the statement does not say the groups endorse the Stormont House Agreement proposals on dealing with the past, which include a unit to investigate killings during the Troubles. UDA threat against Belfast journalist Red Hand Commando should 'go away' Red Hand Commando applies to be legalised The statement comes seven months after a new task force targeting criminal activity by all paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland became fully operational. TheParamilitary Crime Task Forceis a joint team consisting of officers from the Police Service of Northern Ireland, National Crime agency and officials from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. The Red Hand Commando applied to be legalised last year During the financial year to date, it has conducted 193 searches and made 47 arrests, of which 44 people were charged or reported to the Public Prosecution Service. The PSNI said the Task Force has seized an estimated Â£58,000 worth of drugs, retained Â£50,000 worth of cash, and that seizures of illicit tobacco products had prevented the loss of Â£1,237,462 in revenue. Chief Constable George Hamilton welcomed today's statement from the paramilitary groups but he said it was ""disappointing"" that 20 years after the Good Friday Agreement there were still statements about violence and criminality: ""Our communities do not want to live in fear of violence. The Loyalist Community Council must support people in giving information to the police."" ""There are no grey areas when it comes to the Rule of Law.""

""We will be fully investigating how this was able to happen,"" a Home Office spokesman said when contacted by BBC News. Earlier this year,five people in Scotland received strangers' passportsin the post. Chris and Tom's rings at their civil partnership ceremony - they are hoping to reside in the UK together Chris, from Taiwan, had applied for a UK residence card with his civil partner Tom as his British sponsor - the couple currently live in London. Their own application and supporting documents have yet to be returned to them. ""We received two passports, bank statements, employer letters, a Home Office letter, birth certificates, photocopies of other passports, HMRC and council tax documents and a tenancy agreement belonging to strangers on 16 March,"" Tom said. ""My parents' supporting documents are also unaccounted for. They are retired and their savings accounts might be compromised,"" he added. ""It involves four nationalities and people who might be deported without knowing. ""We need an answer about where our documents are."" He added: ""It has been three weeks and despite repeatedly asking the Home Office to collect the documents, we still have them. ""It is inconceivable that the Home Office could have mistaken these for our documents. ""We feel devastated and have been very stressed by the situation. ""The Home Office should never have made this mistake and should have contacted us all to fix it. ""It is extremely concerning that people's identities could be misdirected like this."" Tom found an employer's phone number among the documents which were sent to him and used that to track down the other family, who are also based in the UK. ""The other family has been rejected by the Home Office and seemingly not informed,"" Tom said. ""We are shocked,"" one of the passport owners told the BBC. ""How come this happened to our original, confidential documents? ""The documents belong to me and my sister and our extended family, We are trying to speak to our solicitor."" A total of 472 passports were lost during delivery in 2016,external, compared with 375 in 2015, according to official figures. In a statement to the BBC, the Home Office said: ""We take the security of customer documents very seriously and will be fully investigating how this was able to happen... the couple should return the documents to us.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May said the ""reprehensible"" attack was being urgently investigated Theresa May has said she ""utterly condemns"" the ""barbaric"" alleged chemical weapons attack in Syria. The PM said if the attack was confirmed as another example of President Bashar al-Assad's regime's brutality, ""the regime and its backers including Russia, must be held to account"". Russia has said no evidence of a chemical weapons attack in formerly rebel-held Douma has been found. The US and France threatened a ""joint, strong response"" to the alleged attack. When asked whether she would recall Parliament over Syria, Mrs May said: ""We are working urgently with our allies to assess what has happened and we are also working with our allies on what action might be necessary."" Russia: No evidence of chemical attack Why is there a war in Syria? Trump condemns Syria for 'chemical attack' on Douma Medical sources say dozens were killed in Saturday's attack, but numbers are impossible to verify. Videos shot by rescue workers showed lifeless bodies of men, women and children with foam at their mouths. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had said no evidence of a chemical weapons attack had been found, saying Russian specialists and aid workers had visited the area. Russia - a key supporter of the Syrian government - has intervened militarily in the country. It launched an air campaign in support of Mr Assad in 2015 that was crucial in turning the war in the government's favour. The United Nations Security Council met on Monday to discuss the allegations, which sawthe US and Russia trade barbs. Russian representative Vassily Nebenzia said the incident in Douma was staged and that US military action in response could have ""grave repercussions"". But US envoy Nikki Haley said Russia - a Syrian military backer - had the ""blood of Syrian children"" on its hands. On a visit to Denmark and then Sweden, Mrs May said the events in Douma fit into ""a troubling wider pattern of acts of aggression and abuse of long-standing international norms on counter proliferation and the use of chemical weapons"". She said Russia's ""repeated vetoes"" at the UN ""have enabled these rules to be broken and removed mechanisms that allow us to investigate and hold to account chemical weapons attacks in Syria"". ""This must stop,"" she said. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson spoke to acting US Secretary of State John Sullivan on Monday about the incident, agreeing that it ""bore hallmarks of previous chemical weapons attacks by the Assad regime"", a statement from the Foreign Office said. US President Donald Trump has said that the situation was being assessed and ""major decisions"" would be made within 48 hours. Former Foreign Secretary William Hague has called for Mrs May to stand alongside the US,writing in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat chemical weapons will become ""legitimised"" and used in future wars if the West fails to take military action. By John Pienaar, BBC News deputy political editor Theresa May's flying Scandinavian tour - Denmark and Sweden in less than 24 hours - was supposed to be routine. As if...! The prime minister's meetings with her counterparts in Copenhagen and Stockholm were wholly overshadowed by the alleged chemical attack in Syria: a challenge and a test not only for the Western powers and their allies, but for British global influence and for Mrs May herself. As she met the Danish leader, Lars Rasmussen, in Copenhagen, it was clear she was keen to keep in step with key allies like America. Read more from John Tom Tugendhat, Tory chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, told the BBC that the ""UK should explore all options"" and that is ""absolutely right that we respond"" to the attack in Syria. He said the evidence ""points squarely to the Assad regime"" and that the ""UK government has the legal authority"" to respond. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also condemned the use of chemical or biological weapons ""in any scenario, anywhere in the world"". ""The tragedy and the terror of people's lives in Syria can only end by a political solution,"" he said. ""That means every country in the region - every country in the region - as well as Russia and the United States coming together to ensure there is a meaningful ceasefire and there is a political process to bring about a political solution to the terror and tragedy and conflict that has wasted so many lives in Syria."" Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said: ""What has happened in Douma clearly looks to be just the latest abhorrent attack in Syria using chemical weapons, a war crime for which the Assad regime has been found responsible in the past and which we utterly condemn."" Comparing the attack in Douma to the ""similar recklessness"" seen last month with the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury, the prime minister added that together with the international community, the UK would not tolerate Russia's ""increasingly hostile behaviour"".

"This video can not be played Liz Thomas on Antarctica's greater snowfall: ""As things get warmer, they get wetter."" Scientists have compiled a record of snowfall in Antarctica going back 200 years. The study shows there has been a significant increase in precipitation over the period, up 10%. The effect of the extra snow locked up in Antarctica is to slightly slow a general trend in global sea-level rise. However, this mitigation is still swamped by the contribution to the height of the oceans from ice melt around the continent. Some 272 billion tonnes more snow were being dumped on the White Continent annually in the decade 2001-2010 compared with 1801-1810. This yearly extra is equivalent to twice the water volume found today in the Dead Sea. Put another way, it is the amount of water you would need to cover New Zealand to a depth of 1m. Dr Liz Thomas presented the results of the studyat the European Geosciences Union (EGU) General Assembly,externalhere in Vienna, Austria. Antarctica 'gives ground to the ocean' 'Boaty McBoatface' survives ice mission Space lasers to track Earth's ice Much of the extra snow has fallen on the Antarctic Peninsula The British Antarctic Survey (BAS) researcher said the work was undertaken to try to put current ice losses into a broader context. ""The idea was to get as comprehensive a view of the continent as possible,"" she told BBC News. ""There's been a lot of focus on the recent era with satellites and how much mass we've been losing from big glaciers such as Pine Island and Thwaites. But, actually, we don't have a very good understanding of how the snowfall has been changing. ""The general assumption up until now is that it hasn't really changed at all - that it's just stayed stable. Well, this study shows that's not the case.â Cores have been collected across the continent - making this the largest study of its kind Dr Thomas and colleagues examined 79 ice cores drilled from across Antarctica. These long cylinders of frozen material are essentially just years of compacted snow. By analysing the cores' chemistry, it is possible to determine not only when their snows fell but also how much precipitation came down. For example, one key marker used to differentiate one year from the next, even seasons, is hydrogen peroxide. This is a photochemical product that forms in the atmosphere when water vapour encounters sunlight. ""For us, that's perfect. Antarctica works like an on-off switch with the long 'polar nights' in winter and long periods of daylight in summer,"" Dr Thomas explained. The previous, most extensive survey of this kind assessed just 16 cores. The new study is therefore much more representative of snowfall behaviour across the entire continent. It found the greater precipitation delivered additional mass to the Antarctic ice sheet at a rate of 7 billion tonnes per decade between 1800 and 2010 and by 14 billion tonnes per decade when only the period from 1900 is considered. Most of this extra snow has fallen on the Antarctic Peninsula, which saw significant increases in temperature during the 20th Century. ""Theory predicts that, as Antarctica warms, the atmosphere should hold more moisture and that this should lead therefore to more snowfall. And what we're showing in this study is that this has already been happening,"" Dr Thomas said. Artwork: Satellites routinely map Antarctica, but their data record is only about 25 years The BAS researcher is keen to stress that the increases in snowfall do not contradict the observations of glacial retreat and thinning observed by satellites over the last 25 years. Although the extra snow since 1900 has worked to lower global sea level by about 0.04mm per decade, this is more than being countered by the ice lost to the oceans at Antarctica's margins, where warm water is melting the undersides of glaciers. Dr Anna Hogg, from Leeds University, UK, uses radar satellites to measure the shape and mass of the ice sheet. She told BBC News: ""Even with these large snowfall events, Antarctica is still losing ice mass at a faster rate than it is gaining mass from snowfall, mainly due to the regions of known ice dynamic instability, such as in the Amundsen Sea Embayment which includes Pine Island and Thwaites glaciers. ""The Antarctic 4.3mm contribution to global sea level since about 1992 is still our best estimate."" Liz Thomas' research has been published in theEGU journal Climate of the Past,external.

"A satellite image showing the T4/Tiyas airbase in central Syria The Syrian government and its ally Russia have blamed Israel for a deadly attack on a Syrian military airport. Monday's attack hit the Tiyas airbase, known as T4, near the city of Homs. Observers say 14 people were killed. Israel, which has previously hit Syrian targets, has not commented. Syria initially blamed the US for the strike. The incident comes amid international alarm over an alleged chemical attack on a Syrian rebel-held town. The US and France had threatened to respond. US President Donald Trump said there would be a ""big price to pay""for the alleged chemical attack in Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region, near the capital Damascus.

But Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said accusations that Mr Assad is behind the attack were a ""provocation"". Moscow favoured an ""honest investigation"" of such incidents but opposed apportioning blame without any proof, he added. Meanwhile, Ahmet Uzumcu, head of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, expressed ""grave concern"" about the alleged attack. The OPCW is currently gathering information about the possible use of chemical weapons. Why is there a war in Syria? Syrian state news agency Sana, quoting a military source, reported that air defences had repelled an Israeli missile attack on T4, saying the missiles were fired by Israeli F15 jets in Lebanese airspace. Russia's defence ministry said that, of eight missiles, five were shot down and three reached the western part of the aerodrome. Israel rarely acknowledges carrying out strikes, but has admitted attacking targets in Syria dozens of times since 2012.Its heaviest air strike on Syria, in February this year, included targeting the T4 air base. That followed an incursion by an Iranian drone into Israel and the shooting down by Syrian air defences of an Israeli F16 fighter jet. Israel has said it will not allow Iran, its arch-foe, to set up bases in Syria or operate from there, something Israel considers a major threat. The Israeli military said Iran and its Revolutionary Guards had long been active in the T4 base, and were using it to transfer weapons, including to Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah, an enemy of Israel. They also said the drone had been launched from the base. Iran building base in Syria - claim UK-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said that fighters of various nationalities - meaning Iranians or members of Iranian-backed Shia militias - were among the 14 dead at the base. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent This attack could be part of Israel's growing effort to contain Iran's military build-up in Syria and to interrupt the supply of advanced Iranian missiles to its Lebanese Shia ally, Hezbollah. Any Israeli operation would have been closely monitored by Russian air defence radars in Syria. There is also a telephone hotline between the Israelis and the Russian headquarters in Syria. So far Moscow has done nothing to interfere with Israel's air operations. But the presence of Russia's air defences in Syria certainly complicates the strategic equation as Western governments ponder their response to the recent chemical attack. Mr Trump and France's President Emmanuel Macron issued a joint statement on Sunday vowing to ""co-ordinate a strong, joint response"" to the alleged chemical attack. Suspected Syria chemical attack kills scores But US officials said America did not launch the overnight strike. ""At this time, the Department of Defense is not conducting air strikes in Syria,"" the Pentagon said in a statement. This video can not be played A short guide to the Syrian civil war ""However, we continue to closely watch the situation and support the ongoing diplomatic efforts to hold those who use chemical weapons, in Syria and otherwise, accountable."" France also issued a denial. Sana initially called the reported missile strike on the Tiyas airfield a ""suspected US attack"", but later dropped the reference to the US. In April 2017, the US fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Syria's Shayrat military airfieldin response to a chemical weapons attack on a different rebel-held town, Khan Sheikhoun. Medical sources say dozens of people were killed on Saturday in the attack on Douma, in the Eastern Ghouta region. One video, recorded by rescue workers known as the White Helmets, shows a number of men, women and children lying lifeless inside a house, many with foam at their mouths. However, it has not been possible to verify independently what actually happened, or the actual number of dead. This video can not be played Unverified video shows children being treated after the alleged gas attack The UN Security Council is expected to discuss the crisis on Monday. Both Syria and Russia deny a chemical attack took place, and have reached an evacuation deal with the Jaish al-Islam rebels who hold Douma. Moscow said military operations there had been halted. Under the deal, 100 buses are said to be moving 8,000 fighters and 40,000 of their relatives out of the battered town. Hostages who had been held by the rebels are being set free. The development means pro-government forces have now taken full control of Eastern Ghouta. Analysts say this is President Assad's biggest military success since the fall of Aleppo in 2016. It follows a weeks-long government offensive in which more than 1,600 people were killed.

Israel, which has previously hit Syrian targets, has not commented. Syria initially blamed Washington for the strike, but the US, UK and France have all denied involvement. It is unclear whether the strike had anything to do with the suspected chemical attack. President Trump said there would be a ""big price to pay""for what he said was a chemical attack in Douma. In April last year, the US fired cruise missiles at a Syrian airbase after a Sarin attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun killed more than 80 people.

France has also led international condemnation, with President Emmanuel Macron and Mr Trump vowing to ""co-ordinate a strong, joint response"" after a telephone call on Sunday. The US and France have not released any evidence. In other reaction: UK Prime Minister Theresa May hit out at the Syrian government's Russian backers, saying they also needed to be held to account for the ""brutal actions"" of the Assad regime The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons expressed ""grave concern"" about the alleged attack and opened an investigation UK PM condemns 'barbaric attack' in Syria Mr Lavrov said that the Russian military had warned many times of a ""provocation"" being prepared, aimed at putting the blame on Damascus for the alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians. This video can not be played A short guide to the Syrian civil war ""Our military specialists have visited this place, along with representatives of the Syrian Red Crescent... and they did not find any trace of chlorine or any other chemical substance used against civilians,"" he said. Moscow favoured an ""honest investigation"" of such incidents, he said, but opposed apportioning blame without any proof. Following the alleged attack, Syria and Russia reached an evacuation deal with the Jaish al-Islam rebels, who up until now have been holding Douma. Moscow said military operations there had been halted. Under the deal, 100 buses are said to be moving 8,000 fighters and 40,000 of their relatives out of the battered town. Hostages who had been held by the rebels are being set free. The development means pro-government forces have now taken full control of the Eastern Ghouta. Analysts say this is President Assad's biggest military success since the fall of Aleppo in 2016. It follows a weeks-long government offensive in which more than 1,600 people were killed. Syrian state news agency Sana reported that air defences had repelled an Israeli missile attack on the T4 base, saying the missiles were fired by Israeli F15 jets in Lebanese airspace. Iran building base in Syria - claim Iran's Fars news agency said that three members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards were among those killed. Earlier, UK-based monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said 14 people were killed in total, and that fighters of various nationalities - meaning Iranians or members of Iranian-backed Shia militias - were among them. Russia's defence ministry said that, of eight missiles, five were shot down and three reached the western part of the aerodrome. Israel rarely acknowledges carrying out strikes, but has admitted attacking targets in Syria dozens of times since 2012.Its heaviest air strike on Syria, in February this year, included targeting the T4 air base. That followed an incursion by an Iranian drone into Israel and the shooting down by Syrian air defences of an Israeli F16 fighter jet. Israel has said it will not allow Iran, its arch-foe, to set up bases in Syria or operate from there, something Israel considers a major threat. The Israeli military said Iran and its Revolutionary Guards had long been active in the T4 base, and were using it to transfer weapons, including to Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah, an enemy of Israel. They also said the drone had been launched from the base. Israel blamed for Syria airfield attack Trump condemns Syria for 'chemical attack' 100 years of chemical weapons.

Mrs Badenoch told the Mail on Sunday,external, which had obtained footage of the interview, it was ""a foolish prank over a decade ago, for which I apologise"".

"The runway at Gatwick Airport had to be closed four times Gatwick Airport was forced to temporarily shut its runway four times because of staff sickness, causing flights to be diverted and delays. Only one air traffic controller out of a scheduled three was at work in the control tower at the time. The runway was closed to enable the controller to take mandatory breaks on shift through Sunday and Monday. Two inbound flights were diverted and several were delayed on Sunday morning and four were delayed on Monday. The air traffic controller took the two one-hour breaks per shift to coincide with when there were no scheduled departures. Some passengers took to social media to vent their frustration.

"On his way out... but Deutsche Bank said John Cryan had ""laid the groundwork for a successful future of the bank"" Deutsche Bank has dismissed its chief executive John Cryan amid continued losses at Germany's biggest lender. After taking over in 2015, British-born Mr Cryan, 57, has battled the fallout from a series of scandals as well as three years of reported losses. Co-deputy chief executive Christian Sewing, 47, will take over as chief executive immediately. The shake-up was announced after an emergency meeting that ended late on Sunday night. Mr Cryan's contract was due to run until 2020. Deutsche chairman Paul Achleitner said Mr Cryan had ""laid the groundwork for a successful future of the bank"" despite his ""relatively short tenure"" as chief executive. Mr Sewing, who has been with the bank for his entire career, had been responsible for its private and commercial bank operations. Some analysts say his appointment suggests a strategic shift towards retail banking in its home market. Deutsche Bank has grappled with falling revenues and its share price has sunk by close to a third this year. Shares rose more than 3% in Frankfurt on Monday. The search to replace Mr Cryan is understood to have begunafter the bank reported an annual loss of â¬500m,external(Â£436m) at the end of February. That followed losses of â¬6.8bn in 2015 and â¬1.4bn in 2016. Mr Cryan was appointed as co-chief executive in July 2015 to overhaul the bank following a number of regulatory problems stretching back to before the financial crisis. The Sunderland-born banker was also tasked with controlling the lender's spiralling costs and quickly cut thousands of jobs. But after becoming sole chief executive in 2016, Deutsche continued to struggle, largely because of a slump in its investment banking division which accounts for more than half of sales. In resolving its legal difficulties, it also incurred a series of heavy penalties, including a$7.2bn (Â£5.9bn) payment to US authoritiesin 2016 over an investigation into mortgage-backed securities. At that time, it was considered to bethe most dangerous bank in the worldafter the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that a potential collapse of Deutsche posed the biggest risk to the stability of the global financial system. Also in June 2016, Deutsche's US division failed a stress test conducted by the US Federal Reserve. Deutsche and Santander's US unit were the only two of 33 banks to fail the test, which assessed how they would perform in a financial crisis. Markus Riesselmann, an analyst at Independent Research, said Mr Cryan ""had to battle serious problems that his predecessors swept under the rug for years"". ""He's largely cleared those up and now it looks like Deutsche can't turn things around regarding margins, but I doubt a new chief executive could successfully make that transition. It seems rather to be a fundamental 'Deutsche Bank problem',"" he added. Christian Sewing has been described as strong and disciplined Mr Achleitner said Mr Sewing had proved to be a ""strong and disciplined leader""  in his more than 25 years at Deutsche. ""The supervisory board is convinced that he and his team will be able to successfully lead Deutsche Bank into a new era. We trust in the great ability of this bank and its many talents.""

"Viktor Orban (c) will be prime minister for a third time Hungary's right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed a landslide victory in Sunday's general election. The 54-year-old will serve a third consecutive term in office, with his party Fidesz projected to win a two-thirds majority in parliament. Fidesz won almost half of the vote, with 93% of ballots counted, Hungary's National Election Office said. Mr Orban is a strong Eurosceptic who campaigned on an anti-immigration platform. In a speech to supporters on Sunday night, Mr Orban said his victory gave Hungarians ""the opportunity to defend themselves and to defend Hungary"". Leaders of the second and third-placed parties have resigned in light of the result. Polling stations were meant to close at 19:00 (17:00 GMT), but some stayed open hours later due to long queues. Voter turnout reached a near-record 69% - an outcome some believed would favour the prime minister's opponents. But with almost all votes counted, the nationalist Jobbik party is in second place with 20% of the vote. The Socialists are in third with 12%, and the LMP, Hungary's main Green Party, is in fourth with 7%. The man who thinks Europe is being invaded Nationalism in heart of Europe needles EU Jobbik's chairman Gabor Vona stood down on Sunday night, telling a news conference: ""Jobbik's goal, to win the elections and force a change in government, was not achieved. Fidesz won. It won again."" Socialist Party President Gyula Molnar was similarly downcast as he resigned, saying: ""We regard ourselves as responsible for what happened [and] we have acknowledged the decision of voters."" By the BBC's Budapest Correspondent Nick Thorpe As Fidesz paints the map of Hungary orange (their colour) once again, preliminary results show they will reach the 133 seats in the 199 seat Parliament needed for a constitutional two-thirds majority. They won two-thirds victories at both previous elections, in 2010 and 2014. The prime minister's party won in most rural constituencies and in provincial towns, while opposition parties took most seats in the capital, Budapest. Mr Orban's legitimacy on a European level will likely be strengthened, as nationalist parties across the continent take heart from his victory. There were only two consolation prizes for anti-Fidesz voters: most constituencies in the capital, Budapest, went to opposition candidates. And Fidesz have also lost a large part of the youth vote. The next Fidesz government can be expected to include younger ministers, in an attempt to address this problem. The result spells trouble ahead for civil society groups which campaign for human rights and against corruption, and for critical media. Viktor Orban has promised a ""settling of accounts - moral, politically, and legally"" with his opponents. The election campaign was dominated by immigration, with Mr Orban promising to defend the country's borders and block migration by Muslims. The prime minister refused to debate publicly with his opponents or speak to the independent media, speaking instead at rallies for his supporters. These addresses focused on one core policy - stopping immigration. ""Migration is like rust that slowly but surely would consume Hungary,"" Mr Orban said at his final rally on Friday. In 2015, Hungary built a fence along its borders with Serbia and Croatia to stop illegal migrants. Mr Orban hammered home his anti-immigration stance at a number of campaign rallies Mr Orban is an avowed Eurosceptic who opposes further EU integration. He refused to take part in the EU's refugee resettlement programme and has praised Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Marine Le Pen, leader of France's National Front, tweeted Mr Orban her congratulations and said the ""mass immigration promoted by the EU has been rejected once again"". Hungary jails 'terrorist' over border riot Hungarian PM: Migrant crisis 'is a German problem' Mr Orban has promised to cut income taxes and pass pro-growth economic policies. His administration has presided over strong economic growth, which he had argued would be threatened under the opposition.

"Cassie Hayes (left) with her mother Tracy Hayes (centre) and sister Nadine Hayes (right) A man who murdered his ex-partner's new girlfriend by cutting her throat at her workplace has been jailed for a minimum of 26 years. Travel agent Cassie Hayes, 28, was attacked at the Tui store in Southport town centre on 13 January. Andrew Burke, 31, of St Helens, had been convicted the day before of harassing his former partner Laura Williams. The judge described Ms Hayes's death as a ""cold-blooded execution in public"". Burke pleaded guilty to murder and having an offensive weapon, namely a knife, in a public place and was jailed at Liverpool Crown Court for a minimum of 26 years on Monday. Sentencing him to life, Judge David Aubrey described the murder as ""an act of unspeakable savagery"". ""This was a cowardly act of revenge designed to kill and did kill a totally innocent person in broad daylight in front of, and witnessed by, so many,"" he added. Andrew Burke told police: ""It was either kill me or kill her, so I killed her"" Prosecutor Gordon Cole QC said the murder of Ms Hayes, who was originally from Alnwick, Northumberland, was a pre-meditated and planned attack carried out in a ""chilling and ruthless way"". ""It was essentially an execution of a young woman in her place of work,"" he added. The court heard Ms Hayes, who had a four-year-old daughter, was attending to a family at the Tui branch on a Saturday lunchtime when Burke entered with his hood up. He then told a cashier: ""I just want to apologise for what I am about to do."" After killing Ms Hayes, Burke remained at the back of the shop and made apologies by saying that nobody deserved to see what happened, the court was told. He was also heard to have made remarks to the effect that Ms Hayes ""had it coming for her what she had done to his family"". Laura Williams said Cassie Hayes (right) was ""my future wife and my forever"" A post-mortem examination found Ms Hayes died of shock and haemorrhaging due to a wound to the throat. The court heard staff and customers who witnessed the attack, including a 12-year-old girl, had suffered flashbacks of the attack, with one of Ms Hayes's colleagues saying she had become a recluse since it happened. Ms Hayes's mother told Burke he should ""rot in hell"" for taking away ""my whole world"" as she read out a victim impact statement in court. ""You are the most evil, evil monster walking on this whole earth. You do not deserve to breathe fresh air,"" Tracy Hayes added. Cassie Hayes's mother Tracy (centre) was at court with her other daughter Nadine (second from right) The court heard police officers found Burke lying on the floor in the centre of the shop with his head towards the door. He then told a firearms officer: ""I'm no threat to you, officer. I've got nothing else on me. The knife's on the table."" Mr Cole added: ""After this ruthless and chilling murder the defendant seemed to remain calm. ""He showed no emotion and remained seated whilst everybody else was reacting in one way or another to what had happened."" The court heard Burke also told police: ""It was either kill me or kill her, so I killed her."" He added: ""Can you tell the family that was in here I'm sorry, I thought I'd waited till there were no kids in there."" Andrew Burke attacked Cassie Hayes at the Tui store in Southport town centre Burke, of Vincent Street, was the ex-partner of Ms Williams, 29, who had been in a relationship with Ms Hayes since the break-up. He had been charged with harassing Ms Williams on 13 November and was bailed ahead of sentencing after being convicted of the offence on 12 January. Burke was also the subject of an allegation of harassment against Ms Hayes from May and was issued with a police information notice warning him regarding any future contact. He had been fined at court in January 2017 for making malicious communications when his mother made a statement to police about remarks he had made to her over the phone when he repeatedly threatened to kill himself or Ms Hayes because he held her responsible for the end of his relationship.

The Socialists are in third with 12%, and the LMP, Hungary's main Green Party, is in fourth with 7%. The man who thinks Europe is being invaded Nationalism in heart of Europe needles EU Jobbik's chairman Gabor Vona stood down on Sunday night, telling a news conference: ""Jobbik's goal, to win the elections and force a change in government, was not achieved. Fidesz won. It won again."" Socialist Party President Gyula Molnar was similarly downcast as he resigned, saying: ""We regard ourselves as responsible for what happened [and] we have acknowledged the decision of voters."" By the BBC's Budapest Correspondent Nick Thorpe As Fidesz paints the map of Hungary orange (their colour) once again, preliminary results show they will reach the 133 seats in the 199 seat Parliament needed for a constitutional two-thirds majority. They won two-thirds victories at both previous elections, in 2010 and 2014. The prime minister's party won in most rural constituencies and in provincial towns, while opposition parties took most seats in the capital, Budapest. Mr Orban's legitimacy on a European level will likely be strengthened, as nationalist parties across the continent take heart from his victory. There were only two consolation prizes for anti-Fidesz voters: most constituencies in the capital, Budapest, went to opposition candidates. And Fidesz have also lost a large part of the youth vote. The next Fidesz government can be expected to include younger ministers, in an attempt to address this problem. The result spells trouble ahead for civil society groups which campaign for human rights and against corruption, and for critical media. Viktor Orban has promised a ""settling of accounts - moral, politically, and legally"" with his opponents. The election campaign was dominated by immigration, with Mr Orban promising to defend the country's borders and block migration by Muslims. The prime minister refused to debate publicly with his opponents or speak to the independent media, speaking instead at rallies for his supporters. These addresses focused on one core policy - stopping immigration. ""Migration is like rust that slowly but surely would consume Hungary,"" Mr Orban said at his final rally on Friday. In 2015, Hungary built a fence along its borders with Serbia and Croatia to stop illegal migrants. Mr Orban hammered home his anti-immigration stance at a number of campaign rallies Mr Orban is an avowed Eurosceptic who opposes further EU integration. He refused to take part in the EU's refugee resettlement programme and has praised Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Marine Le Pen, leader of France's National Front, tweeted Mr Orban her congratulations and said the ""mass immigration promoted by the EU has been rejected once again"". Hungary jails 'terrorist' over border riot Hungarian PM: Migrant crisis 'is a German problem' Mr Orban has promised to cut income taxes and pass pro-growth economic policies. His administration has presided over strong economic growth, which he had argued would be threatened under the opposition.

"This video can not be played Masters 2018: Patrick Reed holds nerve to beat rivals and win Masters Masters final leaderboard -15P Reed (US);-14R Fowler (US);-13J Spieth (US);-11J Rahm (Sp);-9C Smith (Aus), B Watson (US), H Stenson (Swe), R McIlroy (NI);-8M Leishman (Aus);-7T Finau (US), D Johnson (US);-6C Hoffman (US), J Rose (Eng), L Oosthuizen (SA) Selected others: -5P Casey (Eng);-4T Fleetwood (Eng), J Thomas (US);+1T Woods(US);+2P Mickelson (US);+3M Fitzpatrick (Eng);+4T Hatton (Eng), I Poulter (Eng) Patrick Reed held off fellow Americans Jordan Spieth and Rickie Fowler to claim his first major title with a one-shot win at the Masters at Augusta. The world number 24, who had been ahead since the second round, led Rory McIlroy by three shots overnight. McIlroy, chasing his first Green Jacket to complete the Grand Slam, faded with a two-over 74, while Reed parred the last to shoot 71 and win on 15 under. Fowler (67) ended second, one ahead of Spieth, who had nine birdies in a 64. Reed, 27, said: ""I knew it was going to be tough. ""Any time trying to close off a golf tournament is really hard but to close off my first major at a place that's so close to me, being where I went to college, means so much. Woods will captain the US team at the 2019 Presidents Cup ""I knew the lead would shrink and grow - it's just the flows of golf, you have to know how to handle it and the way I could get that done was to make sure the putter was working. ""Just to make par on the last and to watch the ball go in the hole and know that I've won my first major - to finish off that drought - meant so much to me."" This video can not be played Masters 2018: Patrick Reed presented with green jacket at Augusta The scene was set for a classic duel between the final pair, Reed and McIlroy, with expectations for a repeat of their epic match at the2016 Ryder Cup,which the American shaded by one hole. But the 28-year-old Northern Irishman, who surged into contention with a bogey-free 65 on Saturday, cut a disconsolate figure and he was the only one of the top 16 to return an over-par final round. ""I played probably some of the best golf I've ever played here - it just wasn't meant to be,"" said McIlroy, who has won four majors, the last of them the 2014 PGA Championship. ""I think 100% I can come back and win here. I've played in two final groups in the last seven years, I've had five top-10s, I play this golf course well. I just haven't played it well enough at the right times."" Although it was not the collapse of 2011 when hesquandered a four-shot leadwith a final round of 80, McIlroy was unable to produce his sparkling best and made only one birdie in the closing 14 holes. This video can not be played 'I didn't put enough pressure on Reed' Reed is the ninth first-time major winner in the past 12 Masters and all four major championships are now held by Americans - all of whom are aged 27 or under. Spieth won last year'sOpen,Brooks Koepka theUS Openand Justin Thomas theUS PGA Championship. Both Reed and McIlroy hit errant drives at the opening hole but, while Reed dropped a shot, McIlroy saved his par. They could have been level at the second when McIlroy hit a majestic second to four feet at the par five and Reed found the bunker. But McIlroy missed his eagle chance and then missed the green at the third to drop a shot, while Reed rattled in a putt from the fringes of the green for a birdie to regain his three-shot advantage. Another imperious iron shot from McIlroy to three feet set up a birdie at the par three fourth but he missed another short putt at the next to fall three shots back again. Twice Reed followed bogeys with birdies as he combated the challenge of the world number seven. This video can not be played Masters 2018: Jordan Spieth sinks a ninth birdie to keep pressure on Patrick Reed However, there were challenges coming from further down the leaderboard. Spieth, who began nine shots behind Reed, had five birdies in his opening nine holes and claimed sole possession of second place on 11 under when he holed from off the green at the 12th. The Texan almost followed it with an eagle at the par-five 13th after a superb iron to 12 feet from the pine straw but his putt stayed right and he tapped in for birdie. Reed moved two clear again when he rolled in a 22-foot birdie putt from the back of the 12th green but Spieth was soon tied at the top, with birdies on the 15th and 16th - the latter a 33-foot putt. However, Reed regained the lead with a birdie from eight feet at the 14th. The roar that greeted Spieth's putt on 16 in comparison to Reed's on 14 gave a clear indication of who the Augusta National patrons wanted to win. In fact, right from the first tee, the fans appeared to be siding more with McIlroy than Reed and once they realised the Northern Irishman was fading, they cheered every change to the leaderboard that favoured Spieth, or indeed Fowler, over the man who went to university in Georgia. BBC Radio 5 live commentator John Murray pointed out that there were groans around the 15th green and 16th tee when Spieth's bogey at the last was registered on one of the on-course leaderboards. Reed was about to putt for par on the 15th at the time. And when Reed walked on to the 18th green the BBC's Iain Carter noted the reception was ""respectful"" rather than the ""whooping and hollering"" normally reserved for a champion in waiting. Spieth had needed a par at the last to equal the course record but his final drive clipped a tree and went only 177 yards, leaving him 267 to the green, which took him another two shots. He then missed an eight-foot par putt to set the clubhouse target at 13 under. Fowler, playing in the penultimate group and like Reed searching for a first major, came closest to usurping his compatriot, with six birdies in his final 11 holes. While the crowd were captivated by the thrilling charge from Spieth, the slightly built 29-year-old Fowler, who was five off the lead going into the final round, quietly moved up the leaderboard. Birdies on the 12th, 13th and 15th holes pushed him to 13 under. The world number nine, who added second place at the Masters to runner-up finishes at the US Open and The Open, sent his approach to seven feet for a birdie at the last to set the clubhouse target, but Reed, who played the final seven holes in two under, calmly negotiated the 18th to take the coveted Green Jacket. Casey made the cut on the number at five over Justin Roseconceded he had ""a nearly week"" after finishing as the leading Englishman, making six birdies in a final round 69 to tie for 12th. He told BBC Sport: ""I got some momentum going and saw some signs I was going to make some putts but at Augusta if you're one or two yards out you go from hero to zero. ""I find it amazing that the winner normally comes out of the last group because I think it's a golf course where a huge comeback is possible."" Paul Caseywas also in sight of the Augusta National course record of 63, jointly held by Nick Price (1986) and Greg Norman (1996). The 40-year-old, who won the Valspar Championship last month, was five over after two rounds to make the cut on the number. He played his first 15 holes in nine under and needed one more birdie in the final three for the record, but he bogeyed the last two for a 65 and finished in a share of 15th on five under. Tommy Fleetwoodbogeyed two of the final four holes for a 74 and finished joint 17th with PGA champion and world number twoJustin Thomason four under. Matt Fitzpatrickhad two double bogeys in a 75 and share of 38th at three over. Ian Poulter,who won last week in Houston to earn his place at Augusta, had seven birdies in a closing 69 and finished four over alongsideTyrrell Hatton,who had six birdies in his 70 to compensate for a double bogey at the 15th. This video can not be played Masters 2018: Charley Hoffman sinks a stunning hole-in-one Tony Finau,who dislocated an ankle in exuberant celebration of a hole-in-one in Wednesday's par-three competition, rolled in six consecutive birdies from the 12th to finish at seven under. The solitary hole-in-one in the main event came from fellow AmericanCharley Hoffman,who made the 20th ace at the 16th in Masters history and he ended in a tie for 12th. Four-time championTiger Woods,who won the last of his 14 major titles 10 years ago, completed his first four rounds at a major since the 2015 Masters with an eagle at the 15th in a round of 69 for a share of 32nd on one over par. World number 18Phil Mickelson,three times a Masters champion, also eagled the 15th, having made an eagle at the eighth on Saturday, and finished a fluctuating week with a 67 and a two over total for a share of 36th. There were a total of 19 sub-70 rounds on the final day, but Reed's 71 ensured that no player has yet compiled a week of four rounds in the 60's in the history of the Masters.

"On his way out... but Deutsche Bank said John Cryan had ""laid the groundwork for a successful future of the bank"" Deutsche Bank has dismissed its chief executive John Cryan amid continued losses at Germany's biggest lender. After taking over in 2015, British-born Mr Cryan, 57, has battled the fallout from a series of scandals as well as three years of reported losses. Co-deputy chief executive Christian Sewing, 47, will take over as chief executive immediately. The shake-up was announced after an emergency meeting that ended late on Sunday night. Mr Cryan's contract was due to run until 2020. Deutsche chairman Paul Achleitner said Mr Cryan had ""laid the groundwork for a successful future of the bank"" despite his ""relatively short tenure"" as chief executive. Mr Sewing, who has been with the bank for his entire career, had been responsible for its private and commercial bank operations. Some analysts say his appointment suggests a strategic shift towards retail banking in its home market. Deutsche Bank has grappled with falling revenues and its share price has sunk by close to a third this year. Shares rose more than 3% in Frankfurt on Monday. The search to replace Mr Cryan is understood to have begunafter the bank reported an annual loss of â¬500m,external(Â£436m) at the end of February. That followed losses of â¬6.8bn in 2015 and â¬1.4bn in 2016. Mr Cryan was appointed as co-chief executive in July 2015 to overhaul the bank following a number of regulatory problems stretching back to before the financial crisis. The Sunderland-born banker was also tasked with controlling the lender's spiralling costs and quickly cut thousands of jobs. But after becoming sole chief executive in 2016, Deutsche continued to struggle, largely because of a slump in its investment banking division which accounts for more than half of sales. In resolving its legal difficulties, it also incurred a series of heavy penalties, including a$7.2bn (Â£5.9bn) payment to US authoritiesin 2016 over an investigation into mortgage-backed securities. At that time, it was considered to bethe most dangerous bank in the worldafter the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found that a potential collapse of Deutsche posed the biggest risk to the stability of the global financial system. Also in June 2016, Deutsche's US division failed a stress test conducted by the US Federal Reserve. Deutsche and Santander's US unit were the only two of 33 banks to fail the test, which assessed how they would perform in a financial crisis. Markus Riesselmann, an analyst at Independent Research, said Mr Cryan ""had to battle serious problems that his predecessors swept under the rug for years"". ""He's largely cleared those up and now it looks like Deutsche can't turn things around regarding margins, but I doubt a new chief executive could successfully make that transition. It seems rather to be a fundamental 'Deutsche Bank problem',"" he added. Christian Sewing has been described as strong and disciplined Mr Achleitner said Mr Sewing had proved to be a ""strong and disciplined leader""  in his more than 25 years at Deutsche. ""The supervisory board is convinced that he and his team will be able to successfully lead Deutsche Bank into a new era. We trust in the great ability of this bank and its many talents.""

"This video can not be played The engineless train sped backwards for seven miles Seven employees have been suspended after 22 carriages carrying 1,000 passengers detached from a train and sped backwards for 11km (seven miles) in the eastern Indian state of Orissa. The runaway carriages were halted by railway staff after they placed rocks on the tracks. None of the people on the train were injured in the incident, which occurred on Saturday night, officials said. More than 22 million Indians commute daily on about 9,000 trains. A video of the incident, caught on a mobile phone camera, showed onlookers screaming as the carriages rolled backwards and past a railway platform. India train crash in Uttar Pradesh leaves 23 dead India train travels 160km in 'wrong direction' The suspended employees allegedly did not follow protocol and an investigation has been launched, JP Mishra, a spokesman for the railway ministry, told AFP news agency. Officials believe that the brakes that are normally applied when a carriage is detached were incorrectly used or overlooked. ""Something ghastly could have happened and it was averted by alert staff,"" Mr Mishra said. Such incidents are not uncommon in India. Across the country, trains carry more than 22 million passengers every day but much of the equipment is out of date. Last November, a group of Indian farmers woke up to find that the train they were travelling on had sped 160km (99 miles) in the ""wrong direction"".

"This video can not be played Hamilton won seven awards, including best actor in a musical for Giles Terera Hip hop musical Hamilton has swept the board at the Olivier Awards, picking up seven gongs from its 13 nominations. It equals Matilda's 2012 record for most Olivier Awards won by a musical. The West End production of Lin-Manuel Miranda's show about US founding father Alexander Hamilton won best new musical and outstanding achievement in music. But its creator had to stay away from the London awards, the biggest event in the UK theatrical calendar, having been diagnosed with shingles. All the winners and nominees Olivier Awards 2018: What else happened? Hamilton opened in London late last year It was also a good night for The Ferryman, which picked up three awards. The drama, set in rural County Armagh in 1981, against the backdrop of The Troubles, won best new play and best director for Sam Mendes, while Laura Donnelly was named best actress. Laura Donnelly received the best actress award for her starring role in The Ferryman Miranda was jointly awarded the outstanding achievement in music prize with orchestrator Alex Lacamoire. He sent Lacamoire a list of thank yous - set to the music of My Favourite Things - to sing to the audience at the show, at the Royal Albert Hall, on his behalf. Giles Terera, who won best actor in a musical for his role as Hamilton's nemesis Aaron Burr, said he was ""relieved, elated and happy"" that Hamilton had done so well. ""We didn't take anything for granted,"" he said. ""But I'm glad we got recognised."" ""Every now and then there's a show that comes along and it shifts things, moves it outside the realm of musical theatre,"" he added, putting Hamilton alongside other great musicals like West Side Story, Les MisÃ©rables and Rent. Jamael Westman, who stars as Alexander Hamilton, said the show - which opened in London late last year - was ""breaking down barriers, it's breaking down the understanding we have of musical theatre"". He added: ""This is re-imagining what it can be, using the hip-hop form and more contemporary types of song and the use of language that is almost Shakespearean. ""It's changing the way that we see theatre and is breaking boundaries. That's why it's been recognised."" Hamilton's other awards include best supporting actor in a musical Michael Jibson, who plays King George III (in a performance that sees him on stage for just eight minutes), as well as best theatre choreographer, best lighting design and best sound design. Despite being the biggest winner of the night, it failed to break the record for most Olivier Awards set by Harry Potter and the Cursed Child last year when it picked up nine. Giles Terera, winner of the best actor in a musical award for Hamilton, alongside Sir Cameron Mackintosh and co-star Michael Jibson, winner of the best actor in a supporting role Jez Butterworth wrote The Ferryman based on the experiences of his partner Donnelly's family in Northern Ireland. Picking up the best new play award, Butterworth said: ""It's her story. I stayed in with a gin and tonic and she had to go out to work. I knew how much that cost her and how much this will mean."" After picking up her own award, Donnelly - who played widow Caitlin in the original production - said: ""I'm thrilled - but I'm in shock. It's what I dreamt of from childhood so to get to this point is surreal."" She said because of the subject matter, she felt a ""weight of responsibility I hadn't in any other job to do it justice, because it was so close to home."" The couple are taking The Ferryman to Broadway later this year. Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston took the best actor prize for Network for his portrayal of Howard Beale in the National Theatre production. In his acceptance speech, he said he was grateful to be working in a country that funds the arts, adding: ""Hopefully that will continue."" Speaking backstage, he added: ""To support children's imagination and their ability to grow in a social, emotional way, [the arts are] more important than learning the dates of a war."" Former Breaking Bad star Bryan Cranston won the best actor award for his performance in Network Other highlights of the ceremony, hosted by Catherine Tate, included: Bertie Carvel being named best actor in a supporting role for Ink James Graham winning best new comedy for Labour of Love Stephen Sondheim's Follies winning best musical revival Killology winning outstanding achievement in affiliate theatre Dick Whittington winning the Olivier for best entertainment and family show Denise Gough was named best supporting actress for Angels in America. Gough was not there to collect her award, but in a statement read by actress Ophelia Lovibond, she highlighted the importance of the Time's Up movement. Several actresses brought feminist activists as their guests, and many others wore Time's Up and 50/50 pins or rings to show their support. Angels in America also won best revival, with director Marianne Elliott saying: ""No one thought we could do this. It's a monolith of a play. This is extraordinary - it's the proudest I've ever been."" Bob Dylan-inspired musical Girl from the North Country was also honoured, with Shirley Henderson winning best actress in a musical and Sheila Atim winning best supporting role in a musical. Shirley Henderson being helped on to the stage by Cuba Gooding Jr Atim seemed genuinely shocked by her win. ""Guys, guys - this is mental!"" she said. One of the first people she thanked was Bob Dylan, ""for writing this stuff before I was born"". Sheila Atim thanked the women of colour who had won Olivier Awards before her She then thanked women of colour who had won Olivier Awards before her. ""To me, it is very, very important. I really hope - especially with Time's Up and the 50/50 movement - that there will be more women who look like me up here."" Shirley Henderson said it felt ""crazy"" to win, and that the script for Girl From the North Country had been ""everything I'd been looking for, for a long time"" - having not been on the stage for 17 years. David Lan won the special award in recognition of his outstanding contribution for his artistic directorship of the Young Vic. Performances included one from past stars of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat - including Jason Donovan and Lee Mead - to mark the 50th anniversary of the Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice musical.

"Viktor Orban (c) will be prime minister for a third time Hungary's right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed a landslide victory in Sunday's general election. The 54-year-old will serve a third consecutive term in office, with his party Fidesz projected to win a two-thirds majority in parliament. Fidesz won almost half of the vote, with 93% of ballots counted, Hungary's National Election Office said. Mr Orban is a strong Eurosceptic who campaigned on an anti-immigration platform. In a speech to supporters on Sunday night, Mr Orban said his victory gave Hungarians ""the opportunity to defend themselves and to defend Hungary"". Leaders of the second and third-placed parties have resigned in light of the result. Polling stations were meant to close at 19:00 (17:00 GMT), but some stayed open hours later due to long queues. Voter turnout reached a near-record 69% - an outcome some believed would favour the prime minister's opponents. But with almost all votes counted, the nationalist Jobbik party is in second place with 20% of the vote. The Socialists are in third with 12%, and the LMP, Hungary's main Green Party, is in fourth with 7%. The man who thinks Europe is being invaded Nationalism in heart of Europe needles EU Jobbik's chairman Gabor Vona stood down on Sunday night, telling a news conference: ""Jobbik's goal, to win the elections and force a change in government, was not achieved. Fidesz won. It won again."" Socialist Party President Gyula Molnar was similarly downcast as he resigned, saying: ""We regard ourselves as responsible for what happened [and] we have acknowledged the decision of voters."" By the BBC's Budapest Correspondent Nick Thorpe As Fidesz paints the map of Hungary orange (their colour) once again, preliminary results show they will reach the 133 seats in the 199 seat Parliament needed for a constitutional two-thirds majority. They won two-thirds victories at both previous elections, in 2010 and 2014. The prime minister's party won in most rural constituencies and in provincial towns, while opposition parties took most seats in the capital, Budapest. Mr Orban's legitimacy on a European level will likely be strengthened, as nationalist parties across the continent take heart from his victory. There were only two consolation prizes for anti-Fidesz voters: most constituencies in the capital, Budapest, went to opposition candidates. And Fidesz have also lost a large part of the youth vote. The next Fidesz government can be expected to include younger ministers, in an attempt to address this problem. The result spells trouble ahead for civil society groups which campaign for human rights and against corruption, and for critical media. Viktor Orban has promised a ""settling of accounts - moral, politically, and legally"" with his opponents. The election campaign was dominated by immigration, with Mr Orban promising to defend the country's borders and block migration by Muslims. The prime minister refused to debate publicly with his opponents or speak to the independent media, speaking instead at rallies for his supporters. These addresses focused on one core policy - stopping immigration. ""Migration is like rust that slowly but surely would consume Hungary,"" Mr Orban said at his final rally on Friday. In 2015, Hungary built a fence along its borders with Serbia and Croatia to stop illegal migrants. Mr Orban hammered home his anti-immigration stance at a number of campaign rallies Mr Orban is an avowed Eurosceptic who opposes further EU integration. He refused to take part in the EU's refugee resettlement programme and has praised Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Marine Le Pen, leader of France's National Front, tweeted Mr Orban her congratulations and said the ""mass immigration promoted by the EU has been rejected once again"". Hungary jails 'terrorist' over border riot Hungarian PM: Migrant crisis 'is a German problem' Mr Orban has promised to cut income taxes and pass pro-growth economic policies. His administration has presided over strong economic growth, which he had argued would be threatened under the opposition.

Canada has seen an outpouring of grief following Friday's collision. Ten players on the Humboldt Broncos team, aged between 16 and 21, died when their team bus collided with a semi-trailer in Saskatchewan. Police are still trying to determine the reason for the crash. The lorry's driver was not hurt. Hockey teams from around the country paid tribute to the dead during weekend fixtures. Many have pledged donations to support their families and the surviving players. Online fundraising pages have raised millions of dollars. Aerial photographs of the scene showed the scale of the collision with heavy damage to the coach (right) There were 29 people on the team's bus when the crash happened around 17:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Friday. That number includes players, coaching staff and the driver. Fifteen were confirmed dead by officials on Sunday. Fourteen people were also injured in the crash. Head coach Darcy Haugan, 42, was among the first confirmed casualties. Broncos team president Kevin Garinger said that Haugan believed that ""the Humboldt Broncos were about not building hockey players but creating amazing young men"". ""He's sadly missed by our entire organisation."" Tributes have poured in for the 42-year-old team head coach Darcy Haugen Assistant coach Mark Cross, 27, was remembered as ""a ferocious competitor who had a vibrant approach to life"", by York University Lions men's hockey head coach Russ Herrington. Cross played for five seasons with the college team. Broncos team captain Logan Schatz, 20, played for the Broncos for more than four years. His host family recalled how the young athlete was quick to make himself at home. ""The first night he was here, he walked in and he was checking the fridge to see what we had for leftovers,"" Colin Brochu told the Globe and Mail. The following Broncos players were also confirmed dead: Adam Herold, 16, from Montmartre, Saskatchewan Connor Lukan, 21 from Slave Lake, Alberta Evan Thomas, 18,  from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan Jacob Leicht , 19, Humboldt, Saskatchewan Jaxon Joseph , 20 , from Edmonton, Alberta Logan Boulet, 21, Lethbridge, Alberta Logan Hunter, 18, from St. Albert, Alberta Stephen Wack, 21, from St. Albert, Alberta Parker Tobin, 18, from Alberta Player Xavier Labelle, 18, had been incorrectly identified by authorities and was believed deceased, but is among the injured.

One team member's father, Tom Straschnitzki, said his son Ryan was in hospital with a serious back injury and that he could not feel his legs. The family flew to his bedside on Saturday. ""He keeps asking about his team and coaches,"" Mr Straschnitzki told the BBC from his home in Airdrie, Alberta. ""I say: 'I don't know son'."" The lorry and bus collided on Highway 35, north of Tisdale. The team had been heading to the town of Nipawin for a play-off game. Aerial photographs of the crash site show it happened close to a junction between two roads. The lorry driver was not injured and has been allowed to go free while authorities investigate, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. Myles Shumlanski, father of one of the Broncos players, described the crash scene as a ""disaster"" to the Saskatoon Star Phoenix paper. ""We had a crane lifting the bus,"" he said. Rob Muench, the mayor of Humboldt, said it would take years for the community to come to grips with the tragedy. ""Throughout Canada we see teams going out into the Canadian winters on buses all the time and it's always a thought in parents' and fans' minds about what could happen,"" he said. ""There is no playbook on what to do in cases like this."" Humboldt's mayor wore the team's jersey in solidarity on Saturday evening Nipawin Apostolic Church lead pastor Jordan Gadsby told the BBC he had opened his church to families shortly after learning of the crash. ""The worst part of the night was sitting with and watching parents cry as they waited to find out if their son was alive or not,"" he said. News of the crash has shocked Canada, where ice hockey is a national sport and loved by many. Users on social media expressed solidarity using the hashtags #prayersforhumboldt and #humboldtstrong. Mr Trudeau said the entire country was ""in shock and mourning"" along with Humboldt, which has a population of only 6,000. ""Our national hockey family is a close one, with roots in almost every town - small and big - across Canada,"" he added. He has received condolence calls from other world leaders, including US President Donald Trump. Humboldt Broncos President Kevin Garinger said the club were ""heartbroken and completely devastated"" by the tragedy. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Falling police numbers are not to blame for rising violence and a new approach is needed, the home secretary has said. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Amber Rudd said evidence did not back up claims that reduced resources were the cause of more crime. Labour said police numbers were a factor and accused Ms Rudd of having her head ""stuck in the sand"". More than 50 people have been killed in violent attacks in London since the start of the year. In the latest incident, a woman was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder on Saturday night after a man wasstabbed outside Highbury and Islington stationin north London. On Monday the government will unveil a new strategy to tackle serious violence, including an  Offensive Weapons Bill for England and Wales, with new rules on the carrying of knives and acid. Woman held after man stabbed in London London killings: Why are they happening? Met 'has not lost control of streets' In her article, Ms Rudd said police numbers were rising in the early 2000s - when serious violent crimes were at their highest. But, speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr programme, the shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said Ms Rudd had ""stuck her head in the sand"" and that suggesting police numbers had little effect was ""a very naive position"". There have been more than 50 killings in London this year ""We've seen cuts to youth services, education, children's services and all these wrap around services that we know support our young people,"" she told the Andrew Marr programme. The government has defended its current policy on ""stop and search"", which Ms Rudd described as a ""vital policing tool"". Speaking on Andrew Marr, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC the government would consult on extending the powers of stop and search, so that those who may be carrying acid could also be searched by police. Mr Javid said there was ""a real problem"", but that the new weapons bill would make a ""big difference"" to the rate of crimes. Tough restrictions on online sales of knives - preventing them from being posted to residential addresses It would also become illegal to possess in private certain weapons such as zombie knives and knuckle-dusters A ban on the sale of the most dangerous corrosive products to under-18s A consultation on extending stop and search powers to enable the police to seize acid from people carrying it in public without good reason Making it an offence to possess a knife on a further education premises Ms Rudd said the government's new Serious Violence Strategy would ""radically change"" how the rising violence is addressed. Crime minister Victoria Atkins said it would be focused on education and prevention. ""So before a young person thinks of picking up a knife we want them to stop, to have the skills to say no, to be resilient,"" she told the BBC. No easy answers to London's killings Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales As well as introducing new laws and powers, Ms Rudd pledged to work with representatives from local government, health, education and industry to address the root causes of crime. She said the drug trade would be highlighted as a ""key driver"" of rising violence and pressure would be put on internet companies to clamp down on the incitement and glorification of violence on social media. Mo Timbo says there are many issues which lead young men to gang culture Mo Timbo - now a pastor in Hull - grew up in Peckham in south-east London. From the age of  14 he was heavily involved in gang culture, and sold drugs like cannabis and heroin. ""By the age of 19, I'd been stabbed, arrested several times and I found myself serving time in prison,"" he told Radio Humberside's James Hogarth. ""For the society I was part of, that seemed to be a very normal thing."" Mo agreed with Ms Rudd's assessment that falling police numbers may not be linked to the rise in violence. ""With more stop and searches and more police around, it almost sends a message out to the gangs that it's you against us. So we would stick together to the point where rival gangs would come together as a team against the police,"" he said. ""It's not down to one thing. There are so many deep issues we need to work on,"" he added. ""Look at the family - what happens in the household? (If) you're no longer finding that nurturing at home, you're finding it on the streets. I wouldn't say it's just down to angry young men.""

"This video can not be played The names of the victims were read out at the service Canadian PM Justin Trudeau has attended a vigil to honour the 15 killed in a crash involving a bus carrying a junior ice hockey team. Canada has seen an outpouring of grief following Friday's collision. Ten players on the Humboldt Broncos team, aged between 16 and 21, died when their team bus collided with a semi-trailer in Saskatchewan. Police are still trying to determine the reason for the crash. The lorry's driver was not hurt. Hockey teams from around the country paid tribute to the dead during weekend fixtures. Many have pledged donations to support their families and the surviving players. Online fundraising pages have raised millions of dollars. Aerial photographs of the scene showed the scale of the collision with heavy damage to the coach (right) There were 29 people on the team's bus when the crash happened around 17:00 local time (23:00 GMT) on Friday. That number includes players, coaching staff and the driver. Fifteen were confirmed dead by officials on Sunday. Fourteen people were also injured in the crash. Head coach Darcy Haugan, 42, was among the first confirmed casualties. Broncos team president Kevin Garinger said that Haugan believed that ""the Humboldt Broncos were about not building hockey players but creating amazing young men"". ""He's sadly missed by our entire organisation."" Tributes have poured in for the 42-year-old team head coach Darcy Haugen Assistant coach Mark Cross, 27, was remembered as ""a ferocious competitor who had a vibrant approach to life"", by York University Lions men's hockey head coach Russ Herrington. Cross played for five seasons with the college team. Broncos team captain Logan Schatz, 20, played for the Broncos for more than four years. His host family recalled how the young athlete was quick to make himself at home. ""The first night he was here, he walked in and he was checking the fridge to see what we had for leftovers,"" Colin Brochu told the Globe and Mail. The following Broncos players were also confirmed dead: Adam Herold, 16, from Montmartre, Saskatchewan Connor Lukan, 21 from Slave Lake, Alberta Evan Thomas, 18,  from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan Jacob Leicht , 19, Humboldt, Saskatchewan Jaxon Joseph , 20 , from Edmonton, Alberta Logan Boulet, 21, Lethbridge, Alberta Logan Hunter, 18, from St. Albert, Alberta Stephen Wack, 21, from St. Albert, Alberta Parker Tobin, 18, from Alberta Player Xavier Labelle, 18, had been incorrectly identified by authorities and was believed deceased, but is among the injured.

One team member's father, Tom Straschnitzki, said his son Ryan was in hospital with a serious back injury and that he could not feel his legs. The family flew to his bedside on Saturday. ""He keeps asking about his team and coaches,"" Mr Straschnitzki told the BBC from his home in Airdrie, Alberta. ""I say: 'I don't know son'."" The lorry and bus collided on Highway 35, north of Tisdale. The team had been heading to the town of Nipawin for a play-off game. Aerial photographs of the crash site show it happened close to a junction between two roads. The lorry driver was not injured and has been allowed to go free while authorities investigate, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said. Myles Shumlanski, father of one of the Broncos players, described the crash scene as a ""disaster"" to the Saskatoon Star Phoenix paper. ""We had a crane lifting the bus,"" he said. Rob Muench, the mayor of Humboldt, said it would take years for the community to come to grips with the tragedy. ""Throughout Canada we see teams going out into the Canadian winters on buses all the time and it's always a thought in parents' and fans' minds about what could happen,"" he said. ""There is no playbook on what to do in cases like this."" Humboldt's mayor wore the team's jersey in solidarity on Saturday evening Nipawin Apostolic Church lead pastor Jordan Gadsby told the BBC he had opened his church to families shortly after learning of the crash. ""The worst part of the night was sitting with and watching parents cry as they waited to find out if their son was alive or not,"" he said. News of the crash has shocked Canada, where ice hockey is a national sport and loved by many. Users on social media expressed solidarity using the hashtags #prayersforhumboldt and #humboldtstrong. Mr Trudeau said the entire country was ""in shock and mourning"" along with Humboldt, which has a population of only 6,000. ""Our national hockey family is a close one, with roots in almost every town - small and big - across Canada,"" he added. He has received condolence calls from other world leaders, including US President Donald Trump. Humboldt Broncos President Kevin Garinger said the club were ""heartbroken and completely devastated"" by the tragedy. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The young athletes who play in the competitions like the Saskatchewan league often go on to play for colleges, major junior teams or the National Hockey League. Canada has experienced similar tragedies before. In 1986 a bus carrying the Swift Current Broncos junior hockey team hit a patch of black ice on a Saskatchewan stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway, killing four players.

"This video can not be played London violence: Mother of murdered teen in tears over his death Gangs that recruit children as drug couriers will be targeted by a government strategy aiming to cut violent crime in England and Wales. The home secretary said it would also focus on the online ""glamourisation"" of crime and supporting young people. Amber Rudd said there was a ""strong link"" between the illegal drugs market and rising violence. However, a leaked Home Office document linked the rise to falling police officers. It said a lack of resources and fewer people being charged may have ""encouraged"" offenders to commit crimes. But Ms Rudd said it was a ""mistake"" and a ""disservice"" to communities and families to blame police numbers alone. The new strategy comes amid concerns following thedeaths of more than 50 people in violent attacksin London since the start of the year. The names and faces of those killed in London London killings: Why are they happening? Britain's Teenage Drug Runners 'I don't agree young people have nowhere to go' Part of the government's Â£40mSerious Violence Strategy,externalwill include: Exploring the legal responsibility of social media firms Implementing more ways to flag inappropriate material online - specifically on video platforms Establishing new partnerships within the community to ensure young people get support at a local level Some will be given early access to a scheme which promotes employment and provides work experience opportunities This video can not be played âI was a teenage drug runnerâ Ms Rudd said the plans would also focus on early intervention and tougher law enforcement. The strategy, which was first outlined last year, will target so-called ""county lines"" drug distribution, where city gangs courier heroin and crack cocaine to rural or coastal towns. The gangs use children as young as 12 to traffic drugs, using dedicated mobile phones or ""lines"". ""The evidence is we're seeing a different approach to drug dealing, a different approach to using children in the most disgraceful way as drug dealers,"" Ms Rudd said. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The 114-page strategy document contains an impressive level of analysis on the way illicit drugs may be driving serious violence, an apparent shift towards younger offenders and the importance of early intervention. But there is a huge gap. There is no mention of police resources or the cuts that have left forces across England and Wales with 21,000 fewer officers and 7,000 fewer police community support officers than in 2010. The document hints at the problem - police are catching proportionately fewer robbery suspects despite rising levels of the crime - but does not say why. Given that a leaked Home Office analysis suggested that a lack of resources may have ""encouraged"" offenders to commit robbery, the assumption is that this was a deliberate omission. The result is that it undermines the credibility of the rest of the strategy. Under the plans, Â£3.6m will go to a national county-lines coordination centre to gather ""vital intelligence"" about illegal drugs markets. And Â£11m will be spent on an ""early intervention youth fund"" to help young people at risk of getting involved in violence. A new Offensive Weapons Bill includes new proposals on the carrying of knives and acid. It includes: Restrictions on online sales of knives - preventing them from being posted to residential addresses It would also become illegal to possess in private certain weapons such as zombie knives and knuckle-dusters A ban on the sale of the most dangerous corrosive products to under-18s A consultation on extending stop-and-search powers to enable the police to seize acid from people carrying it in public without good reason Making it an offence to possess a knife on a further education premises Ms Rudd emphasised the government's determination to halt the rise in violence Ms Rudd said the government would also tell social media companies to do more to remove violent gang content. She also announced a cross-party taskforce, which would involve MPs, police and local communities, to tackle serious violence, as well as hold an international symposium on what drives violent crime. The leaked document from February notes that forces have faced greater demand since 2012 due to an increase in recorded sex offences while during the same time officer numbers have fallen. It says this pressure on resources had not been the ""main driver"" for the shift but has ""likely contributed"". Is UK the 'drugs market of Europe'? Corbyn: Tories have failed on policing Violent crime rising, police figures suggest Nine charts on rising knife crime in England and Wales The analysis added forces with the largest fall in officer numbers did not see the biggest rise in serious violence. The government dismissed the claim but said it did not comment on leaked documents. Across England and Wales, the number of police officers fell by 14%, to 121,929, between September 2010 and September 2017, according to theHome Office,external. It said that out of 43 territorial police forces in England and Wales, 25 recorded falls in police numbers in the year to 30 September. Some of the biggest falls were recorded in the West Midlands (-4.1%), Thames Valley (-2.9%) and the Metropolitan Police (-2.9%). The Met, which has more than 30,000 officers, saw officer numbers fall by 922 over the year. Reality Check: Is crime up or down? Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government had ""decimated"" local services, adding that ""cuts have consequences"". Speaking at the launch of Labour's local election campaign in London, he said: ""Today's leaked documents make a nonsense, an absolute nonsense, of the Tories' repeated claims that their cuts to police numbers have had no effect."" The Local Government Association said it supported tackling crime by involving young people and communities but admitted it would be a challenge to sustain this success. ""Councils are still waiting to receive their youth justice grant allocations for 2018/19.

"Viktor Orban (c) will be prime minister for a third time Hungary's right-wing Prime Minister Viktor Orban has claimed a landslide victory in Sunday's general election. The 54-year-old will serve a third consecutive term in office, with his party Fidesz projected to win a two-thirds majority in parliament. Fidesz won almost half of the vote, with 93% of ballots counted, Hungary's National Election Office said. Mr Orban is a strong Eurosceptic who campaigned on an anti-immigration platform. In a speech to supporters on Sunday night, Mr Orban said his victory gave Hungarians ""the opportunity to defend themselves and to defend Hungary"". Leaders of the second and third-placed parties have resigned in light of the result. Polling stations were meant to close at 19:00 (17:00 GMT), but some stayed open hours later due to long queues. Voter turnout reached a near-record 69% - an outcome some believed would favour the prime minister's opponents. But with almost all votes counted, the nationalist Jobbik party is in second place with 20% of the vote. The Socialists are in third with 12%, and the LMP, Hungary's main Green Party, is in fourth with 7%. The man who thinks Europe is being invaded Nationalism in heart of Europe needles EU Jobbik's chairman Gabor Vona stood down on Sunday night, telling a news conference: ""Jobbik's goal, to win the elections and force a change in government, was not achieved. Fidesz won. It won again."" Socialist Party President Gyula Molnar was similarly downcast as he resigned, saying: ""We regard ourselves as responsible for what happened [and] we have acknowledged the decision of voters."" By the BBC's Budapest Correspondent Nick Thorpe As Fidesz paints the map of Hungary orange (their colour) once again, preliminary results show they will reach the 133 seats in the 199 seat Parliament needed for a constitutional two-thirds majority. They won two-thirds victories at both previous elections, in 2010 and 2014. The prime minister's party won in most rural constituencies and in provincial towns, while opposition parties took most seats in the capital, Budapest. Mr Orban's legitimacy on a European level will likely be strengthened, as nationalist parties across the continent take heart from his victory. There were only two consolation prizes for anti-Fidesz voters: most constituencies in the capital, Budapest, went to opposition candidates. And Fidesz have also lost a large part of the youth vote. The next Fidesz government can be expected to include younger ministers, in an attempt to address this problem. The result spells trouble ahead for civil society groups which campaign for human rights and against corruption, and for critical media. Viktor Orban has promised a ""settling of accounts - moral, politically, and legally"" with his opponents. The election campaign was dominated by immigration, with Mr Orban promising to defend the country's borders and block migration by Muslims. The prime minister refused to debate publicly with his opponents or speak to the independent media, speaking instead at rallies for his supporters. These addresses focused on one core policy - stopping immigration. ""Migration is like rust that slowly but surely would consume Hungary,"" Mr Orban said at his final rally on Friday. In 2015, Hungary built a fence along its borders with Serbia and Croatia to stop illegal migrants. Mr Orban hammered home his anti-immigration stance at a number of campaign rallies Mr Orban is an avowed Eurosceptic who opposes further EU integration. He refused to take part in the EU's refugee resettlement programme and has praised Russian leader Vladimir Putin. Marine Le Pen, leader of France's National Front, tweeted Mr Orban her congratulations and said the ""mass immigration promoted by the EU has been rejected once again"". Hungary jails 'terrorist' over border riot Hungarian PM: Migrant crisis 'is a German problem' Mr Orban has promised to cut income taxes and pass pro-growth economic policies. His administration has presided over strong economic growth, which he had argued would be threatened under the opposition.

The young athletes who play in the competitions like the Saskatchewan league often go on to play for colleges, major junior teams or the National Hockey League. Canada has experienced similar tragedies before. In 1986 a bus carrying the Swift Current Broncos junior hockey team hit a patch of black ice on a Saskatchewan stretch of the Trans-Canada Highway, killing four players. Since 1987, Western Hockey League team uniforms have been adorned with a clover patch in remembrance of the young men killed that day.

"A bitter row has broken out between Labour and the Conservatives over their language and response to the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. Boris Johnson accused Jeremy Corbyn of refusing to ""unequivocally"" blame the Russian state, describing him as ""the Kremlin's useful idiot"". But Labour said Mr Johnson was the ""idiot"" having ""undermined his own government's position"" on the evidence. Moscow has denied the UK government's claim that it was behind the attack. Russian spy: What we know so far Yulia Skripal 'getting stronger daily' Ex-spy 'improving rapidly' after poisoning The UK says there is ""no other plausible explanation"" for the incident, while Russia has accused Britain of  waging a ""propaganda war"" against it over the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, on 4 March. More than 20 countries have expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK, following Britain's initial expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats. Writing in the Sunday Times,external, Mr Johnson said the Kremlin had made a ""cynical attempt to bury awkward facts beneath an avalanche of lies and disinformation"". He said the Russian government and state-owned media had invented 29 theories about the attack. ""There is only one thing that gives the Kremlin succour and lends false credibility to its propaganda onslaught. That is when politicians from the targeted countries join in,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Sadly, I am driven to the conclusion that Jeremy Corbyn has joined this effort ...Truly he is the Kremlin's useful idiot"". The health of Mr Skripal and his daughter are said to be improving Fellow Conservatives joined the attack on the Labour Leader. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC: ""There's no doubt when it comes up against this issue with Russia that we are having, this very serious issue, that Jeremy Corbyn has let the British people down."" And policing minister Nick Hurd said that while the phrase ""useful idiot"" was part of ""the lexicon of Johnson"", he added: ""I feel very strongly that Jeremy Corbyn has been insufficiently clear in his condemnation of Russia."" Labour has already called for an investigation into whether Mr Johnson misled the public about Russia's involvement, in his remarks about the findings of the UK's defence laboratory Porton Down. The party said that in an interview given to German TV last month, Mr Johnson said that ""people from Porton Down"" were ""absolutely categorical"", adding: ""I asked the guy myself. I said 'are you sure?', and he said 'there's no doubt'."" But last week, the Porton Down laboratory said it could not verify the precise source of the Novichok nerve agent used, although it did say it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Speaking to the BBC on Sunday, Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner said: ""Boris Johnson is the government's useful idiot because what he's done is create a situation where he has contradicted the evidence and overstepped the mark. ""Porton Down have been absolutely clear that they didn't say what Boris Johnson said."" She said that Mr Johnson had ""driven a wedge for the Russians to say there are questions on the evidence."" ""I think that is really dangerous, that we have got a foreign secretary that undermines his own government's position."" The UK has refused to grant Viktoria Skripal a visa to visit Britain Labour says Mr Corbyn ""has repeatedly said the evidence points to Russia being responsible, directly or indirectly, and that the Russian authorities must be held to account on the basis of evidence"". On Saturday, the Foreign Office described a Russian request for a meeting with Mr Johnson on the Salisbury poisoning as a ""diversionary tactic"". Meanwhile, the Russian Embassy has also requested a meeting with Scotland Yard over its handling of the suspected murder of Russian businessman Nikolay Glushkov. Mr Glushkov was found dead in his home in New Malden, south London, on 12 March. Four days later the Met launched a murder investigation and an inquest heard the 68-year-old's cause of death was compression to the neck. ""For Russia this murder has a criminal as well as political dimension,"" an embassy spokesman said. ""Almost a month has passed since Mr Glushkov's death, and like ... with Sergei and Yulia Skripal, the British side provided no information."" Mr Glushkov was a close friend of outspoken President Putin critic Boris Berezovsky, the Russian oligarch found hanged at his Berkshire home in 2013. The Met made no comment. The requests followed Russian Embassy criticism of the UK government's refusal - on immigration rules - to grant a visa to Ms Skripal's cousin, Viktoria Skripal, to visit Britain. The embassy says the refusal to allow Viktoria Skripal to visit her cousin and uncle was ""disappointing"" and ""politically motivated"". Mr Skripal was jailed by Russia for spying for Britain, but released as part of a spy swap between the US and Russia in 2010. Yulia was visiting him in the UK when the attack happened on 4 March. She is now conscious and talking in hospital. Salisbury District Hospital has said Mr Skripal is responding well to treatment and ""improving rapidly"".
