"This video can not be played The crash happened in the Model Colony residential area One of the survivors of Friday's plane crash in the Pakistani city of Karachi has described his ordeal, saying all he could see ""was fire"". Passenger Muhammad Zubair was one of at least two passengers who survived after the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) Airbus A320 came down in a residential area. Health authorities in Sindh province said 97 deaths had been confirmed. The cause of the crash is not yet known. The pilot had reported a technical fault after one failed landing attempt, according to local media, then issued a mayday call as the plane came down. It came days after Pakistan allowed commercial flights to resume after the country's coronavirus lockdown was eased. Flight PK8303, an Airbus A320 carrying 91 passengers and eight crew - including many families travelling ahead of Sunday's Eid holiday - had travelled from Lahore. It was attempting to land at Karachi's Jinnah International Airport at about 14:30 local time (09:30 GMT) when it came down. Mr Zubair, who suffered only minor injuries, said the plane attempted one landing and then crashed 10-15 minutes later. ""No-one was aware that the plane was about to crash; they were flying the plane in a smooth manner,"" he said. He lost consciousness following the crash. When he came to, he said, ""I could hear screams from all directions. Kids and adults. All I could see was fire. I couldn't see any people - just hear their screams"". ""I opened my seatbelt and saw some light - I went towards the light. I had to jump down about 10ft (3m) to get to safety,"" he added. How likely are you to survive a plane crash? The plane was only just short of the runway perimeter when it struck houses in the Model Colony residential area. TV footage showed rescue crews combing through debris strewn across the streets of the densely populated zone. A number of cars were set on fire. Eyewitness Mohammed Uzair Khan told the BBC he had heard a massive sound and went outside his home. ""Almost four houses were completely collapsed, there was so much fire and smoke,"" he said. ""They are almost my neighbours, I can't tell you what a horrible thing it was."" Purported audio of the conversation between air traffic control and a pilot was published by Pakistani media. The pilot is heard saying the plane had ""lost engines"". An air traffic controller asks whether it is going to carry out a ""belly landing"", to which the pilot replies ""mayday, mayday, mayday"". One civil aviation official told Reuters the plane may have been unable to lower its undercarriage. Images posted on social media appeared to show scorch marks under both engines, with no undercarriage visible on approach. Investigators will try to retrieve the so-called black box recorders to help determine the cause. A committee of investigation has already been set up. PIA said the plane had joined the fleet in 2014 and passed its annual airworthiness inspection last November. Air disasters timeline The plane crashed in a residential area According to local authorities, 97 deaths have been confirmed, although it is unclear how many of the dead were passengers and how many residents on the ground. Nineteen of the dead have been identified. Zafar Masud, president of the Bank of Punjab, was the other passenger who survived the crash, a provincial government spokesman said. Both were at the front of the plane. There are reports of other survivors but these have not been confirmed. Many of those on board were families travelling ahead of Sunday's Eid holiday On Saturday, funerals took place for some of the victims in Karachi. DNA tests are being conducted on the bodies of others before they can be handed over to relatives. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the crash,external, promising an immediate investigation. But the Pakistan Airlines' Pilots Association (Palpa) said it had no faith in the official investigation. The group called for international investigators to be involved in the inquiry. Pakistan has a chequered aviation safety record, including a number of airliner crashes. In 2010, an aircraft operated by private airline Airblue crashed near Islamabad, killing all 152 people on board - the deadliest air disaster ever in Pakistan. In 2012, a Boeing 737-200 operated by Pakistan's Bhoja Air crashed in bad weather on its approach to land in Rawalpindi, killing all 121 passengers and six crew. And in 2016, a Pakistan International Airlines plane burst into flames while travelling from northern Pakistan to Islamabad, killing 47 people. Are you in Karachi? Did you witness the crash?

"The far-right Vox party urged supporters to protest the country's lockdown from their cars Thousands of people in Spain are protesting against the government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The far-right Vox party urged supporters to drive through major cities without leaving their vehicles in order to maintain social distancing. Protesters in the capital, Madrid, drove in convoy and waved Spanish flags as they called for socialist Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez to resign. Spain imposed some of the tightest restrictions in Europe on 14 March. It has eased restrictions in recent weeks, but Madrid and Barcelona have remained under tight lockdown due to their more severe outbreaks of Covid-19. How is lockdown being lifted across Europe? Spain tightens mask rules for all older than five Spain set for basic income to ease crisis pain Both cities will begin to relax their curbs from Monday by allowing outdoor dining and gatherings of up to 10 people. The country's two-month lockdown has seen hotels, bars and restaurants all close as well as beaches and other outdoor attractions. The government says this has allowed it to get the outbreak under control, and the daily death toll has been gradually declining. Spain has been one of the countries worst affected by the pandemic Vox leader Santiago Abascal spoke from an open-topped bus in Madrid But, on Saturday, far-right protesters called for the lockdown to be lifted entirely owing to its impact on jobs and the economy. Almost one million jobs were lost in March alone, and forecasts suggest the Spanish economy will contract by up to 12% this year as a result of the pandemic. The demonstrators called for both Mr Sanchez and Deputy Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias, who heads the left-wing Podemos party, to step down over their handling of the crisis. ""It is time to make a big noise against the government of unemployment and misery that has abandoned our self-employed and workers,"" the opposition Vox party said in a statement. This video can not be played Who are Spain's far-right party? The party's leader, Santiago Abascal, led the protest from an open-topped bus in Madrid. He wore a face mask and accused the government of being ""directly responsible for the worst management of this crisis on the entire planet"". ""Let your desire be heard for the resignation of the government,"" he told supporters in a speech that was broadcast on radio. Similar protests also took place in Seville, Barcelona and other regional capitals where rows of cars and motorbikes decked in Spanish flags honked their horns. Others followed the convoys on foot and held placards While countries such as the UK, US and Brazil have also seen anti-lockdown protests, they have rarely seen social distancing measures respected. While protests against his leadership took place around the country, Prime Minister Sanchez announced two major relaxations of the lockdown. He said the country's borders would reopen to foreign tourists from July. Mr Sanchez also announced that football matches in La Liga- the top league of Spanish football - could resume from the week of 8 June. La Liga players started training in small groups earlier this week ""Spain has done what it should and now new horizons are opening for everyone. The time has come to bring back many day-to-day activities,"" he said. The second division is also set to resume at the same time as the top flight, with reports suggesting the derby between Sevilla and Real Betis will be the first La Liga game to take place. On Wednesday, Mr SÃ¡nchez won parliamentary backing to extend the state of emergency until 6 June. Spain is one of the countries that has been hardest-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with more than 28,000 recorded deaths and 234,000 cases. But the decline in the daily death toll continued on Friday, with 56 recorded over the previous twenty-four hours. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"Louise Smith was described as a ""lovely girl with a heart of gold"" by a friend Police searching for Louise Smith have confirmed that a body recovered from woodland is the missing teenager. The body of the 16-year-old, who was last seen on 8 May, was found in Havant, Hampshire, on Thursday. Louise, from the Leigh Park area, was reported missing on the same day. Hampshire Police said on Saturday evening formal identification procedures were complete and Louise's family informed. They previously said the death was suspicious. The family were being supported by specialist officers, police added. Remains were discovered in Havant Thicket on Thursday Friends of the teenager have spoken of their devastation. Mandy Ferdinando, who had known Louise since she was a young girl, laid flowers at the entrance to Havant Thicket, where the teenager's body was found. She previously told the Press Association: ""She was a lovely girl with a heart of gold. ""The community is devastated, sad, shocked, I can't speak for everybody but when anyone hears of a young person, whoever it may be, it's very sad."" Louise had not been in touch with her friends or family since being seen in Somborne Drive, a short distance from where the body was found. Louise was last seen in Somborne Drive on 8 May Police forensic officers carried out searches of a flat in the street and blacked out the property's windows. Neighbours previously said it is believed that Louise had been staying with a couple at the flat. John Singleton said: ""I saw her on the day she went missing, she just went out walking, I didn't know where she was going. ""It's very sad, the outcome is the saddest, for a while we had some hope."" Describing the police activity at the flat, he added: ""The police have been in and out carrying stuff."" A man and a woman, both aged 29, had previously been arrested on suspicion of kidnapping and released on bail. Hampshire police previously asked people in the area to save any dashcam and CCTV footage from 7 and 8 May - particularly any filmed at VE Day anniversary celebrations - for officers to review.

The Welsh Government said an update would be provided as ""soon as possible"". Critical workersare able to book tests,externalby contacting testing centres directly. But unions said the lack of testing was concerning for workers, especially those on zero-hour contracts or jobs where they were not entitled to company sick pay. The booking portal for the general public as it appeared on Saturday afternoon A Welsh Government spokesman said work was being done on access to the site at the moment. ""As soon as this work is finalised, daily test slot allocations will be available for critical workers,"" he said. On Monday, the Welsh Government said critical workers and members of the public would be able to use the UK booking site for drive-through appointments ""soon."" Home test kits are available to everyone across the UK, but availability depends on demand. The decision to opt into the UK system meant ministers in Cardiff ditched plans to develop Wales' own online-booking system. How do I book a coronavirus test in Wales? Wales fallen behind on coronavirus testing What symptoms should I now look out for? Gemma Powell, a supermarket worker from Bridgend, wanted a coronavirus test last week when she developed a dry cough.

"The Amazon rainforest - which plays a vital role in balancing the world's climate and helping fight global warming - is also suffering as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Deforestation jumped 55% in the first four months of 2020 compared with the same period last year, as people have taken advantage of the crisis to carry out illegal clearances. Logging, illegal mining, land clearances and wildfires were already at an 11-year high and scientists say we're fast approaching a point of no return - after which the Amazon will no longer function as it should. Here, we look at the pressures pushing the Amazon to the brink and ask what the nine countries that share this unique natural resource are doing to protect it. The largest and most diverse tropical rainforest in the world is home to 33 million people and thousands of species of plants and animals. Since coronavirus spread to Brazil, in March, Amazonas has been the state to register Brazil's highest infection rates - it also has one of the most underfunded health systems in the country. As elsewhere, social distancing and travel restrictions have been imposed to limit the spread of the virus. But many of the field agents working to protect reserves have pulled out, Jonathan Mazower, of Survival International, says, allowing loggers and miners to target these areas.  In April, as the number of cases rose and states started adopting isolation measures, deforestation actually increased 64% compared with the same month in 2019, according to preliminary satellite data from space research agency INPE. Last year, an unprecedented number of fires devastated huge swathes of forest in the Amazon. Peak fire season is from July which some experts worry could coincide with the peak of the coronavirus crisis. The Brazilian authorities are deploying troops in the Amazon region to help protect the rainforest, tackle illegal deforestation and forest fires. But critics say that the governmentâs rhetoric and policies could actually be encouraging loggers and illegal miners. Even before this yearâs spike in deforestation, the rate across the nine Amazon countries had continued to rise. Brazil, Bolivia and Peru were among the top five countries for loss of primary forest in 2019, with Bolivia experiencing a record-breaking loss of tree cover because of wildfires. But that is not the only problem. ""To only speak of deforestation when we refer to the loss of the Amazon is what I call ""the great green lie"","" says climate scientist Antonio Donato Nobre. ""The destruction of the Amazon rainforest up till now is much bigger than the almost 20% that they talk of in the media."" To get a more complete sense of the scale of the destruction, Dr Nobre says it is necessary to take into account the figures for degradation. This happens when a combination of pressures on a stretch of forest - such as fires, logging or unlicensed hunting - make it hard for the ecosystem to function properly. Even if an area does not lose all its trees and vegetation, degradation strips the rainforest of properties that are vital to the planet. Scientists say that if we don't reverse current levels of deforestation and degradation, the consequences of climate change could accelerate. The most common way of measuring deforestation is ""tree cover loss"" - where forest vegetation has been completely erased. In 2019 alone, the tree cover loss in the Amazon reached 2.4 million hectares (24,000 sq km), according to Global Forest Watch. Half of this was primary forest - 1.7 million hectares of forest that was still in its original state and rich in biodiversity. Its destruction was the same as threefootball pitchesof virgin forest being destroyed every minute in 2019. A football pitch is frequently used as a reference because, according to Fifa, the maximum size of a pitch is 1.08 hectares. However, some countries use smaller dimensions, which is why deforestation calculations can vary so much. This may seem insignificant - only 0.32% of the forest in the whole Amazon biome - but it is also a question of quality. ""Each hectare deforested means part of the ecosystem ceases to function and this affects the rest,"" says Oxford University rainforest expert Erika Berenguer. In the last 10 years, figures for primary forest loss have remained high or spiked in most of the Amazon nations. Primary forest is home to trees that can be hundreds or even thousands of years old. They perform a powerful role in mitigating the effects of climate change, as they act as an enormous carbon dioxide store. A small part of the CO2 absorbed by trees during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere during respiration. The rest is transformed into carbon which the trees use to produce the sugars needed for their metabolism. The older and larger the tree, the more carbon it stores. According to Dr Berenguer, a large tree (with at least three metres circumference) can contain between three and four tonnes of carbon. This is the same as about 10 to 12 tonnes of CO2, or what a family car emits over four years. One of the direct effects of deforestation is that it releases CO2 stored in the forest. Forest fires or the decomposition of felled trees both transform the carbon within the tree back into gas. For this reason, scientists fear that the Amazon will stop being a carbon store and will instead become a serious emitter of CO2, accelerating the effects of climate change. A recent study claimed that 20% of the Amazon is already emitting more CO2 that it absorbs. Experts like Antonio Nobre believe that deforestation does not show the full picture of what is being lost and we should also take into account ""degradation"". This phenomenon is as much the result of climatic events - such as drought, as human action - such as burning or illegal logging which strip the forest of its vital functions. However, seen from above, it may seem that the forest is still standing. ""Even though not all the vegetation is lost, the soil is drier and more fragile. This changes the microclimate of the forest and makes it easier for fires to spread because the soil heats up faster,"" explains Dr Alexander Lees, Senior Lecturer in tropical ecology at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK. Scientists also warn that degradation is an important factor in releasing stored CO2. A new study by Raisg says 47% of all the emissions in the Amazon are as a result of degradation. And in seven of the nine Amazon countries, they say, degradation is the main source of their carbon dioxide emissions. Degradation also makes the forest less efficient. It loses, for example, the ability to generate some of its own rain. If we take the deforestation and degradation together, more than 50% of the Amazon no longer performs environmental services for the region's climate, says Antonio Nobre. Dr Nobre says the degraded areas of the Amazon are nearly twice as big as the deforested areas. A recent report by the Colombian government confirms that between 2012 and 2015, its own Amazon region lost 187,955 hectares of forest to deforestation and 414,605 hectares to degradation - more than double. So why don't they talk about degradation when measuring forest loss in the Amazon? ""It is a difficult phenomenon to measure because although you can see degradation on satellite images, you need to have data from the ground to understand the real picture - whether that area is more or less degraded or is recovering,"" says Alexander Lees. Among the Amazon countries, only Brazil regularly publishes annual degradation figures. However, scientists from across the region are trying to produce the relevant data to form a wider picture of the current state of the forest. If deforestation and degradation continue at current levels, the Amazon could stop working as a tropical ecosystem, even if some of it is still standing. We could be dangerously close to what scientists call ""the tipping point"" - when the nature of the Amazon will completely change. This will happen when total deforestation reaches between 20% and 25% - and that could happen in the next 20 or 30 years. It would cause the length of the dry season and temperatures in the forest to increase. Trees would start to die and the tropical rainforest could become more like a dry savannah. The projection, however, still does not take into account degradation because of the difficulty of measuring it across Panamazonas - the joint Amazon biome across the different national borders. This means it could be even closer than they think. But what could happen after the tipping point? Scientists can't say exactly what a sudden transformation of the Amazon rainforest would mean. But Brazilian climatologist Carlos Nobre, says temperatures in the region could increase by 1.5-3C in the areas which become degraded savannahs. And that is without taking into account possible increases already caused by global warming. This could have a catastrophic impact on the local economy. Less rain and higher temperatures mean less water for animals or growing crops like soya. Some studies link deforestation to an increase in illnesses transmitted by mosquitoes, such as malaria and leishmaniasis. The process of degradation could make the insects look for other sources of food and get closer to urban settlements. And temperature increases could lead to more heat-related cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, says Beatriz Oliveira, from Brazil's Climate Change Investigations Network (Red-Clima). ""Even if the conditions we have at the moment stay the same, temperatures in the Amazon region could increase by 8C, taking into account deforestation and global warming by 2070. ""Replacing the rainforest with another ecosystem, this increase could be even greater or could happen sooner."" According to Carlos Nobre, there is a way. ""First, we should adopt a zero deforestation policy in Panamazonas, immediately, together with a reforestation programme in the south, south-east and east of the Amazon, which are the most vulnerable areas."" ""If we could restore 60,000 or 70,000 sq km in this large area, where the dry season is already much longer, we could help the forest get back to working better and it would be more resilient."" That doesn't seem an easy task in the near future. Deforestation and its causes are a major source of friction between the governments of the nine Amazon nations, environmentalists, companies and indigenous groups: the desire for economic development clashes, in the main, with the preservation of the Amazon and itsnative peoples. More than 33 million people live in the Amazon - about 8% of the population of South America - in towns, cities, riverside communities and indigenous villages. There are at least 100 tribes who have had little or no contact with outsiders. It affects the ecosystem of the whole region, including those who are not part of the Amazon itself, and beyond. Antonio Nobre says: ""The ring made by central-southern Brazil and the River Plate basin would be a desert if it wasn't for the Amazon. ""People have no idea what it would mean to lose this magnificent hydrological system."" So what is driving deforestation in each of the Amazon nations, how much primary forest have they lost and what are their governments doing? The fires which started in Bolivia in May 2019 destroyed almost two million hectares of forest, according to the Friends of Nature monitoring NGO. Half of that was in protected areas, known for their wide biodiversity. Environmentalists say Evo Morales' government has promoted deforestation with policies of selling land in the Amazon region to businessmen and distributing it to farmers. The expansion of the farming frontier is mainly to encourage soya planting and cattle raising, in the hope of building exports for the Chinese market. In August 2019, Mr Morales celebrated the first beef exports to China from Santa Cruz. The same region was responsible for nearly half of Bolivia's soya production in 2018 and was most affected by the fires last year. In response to criticism during the fires crisis, Morales halted land sales in Santa Cruz for what he called ""an ecological pause"". We asked the Bolivian environment ministry about its strategy to reduce deforestation, but have had no response. Brazil received international acclaim for the drop off in deforestation between 2004 and 2014 - an accumulated fall of 80% in almost 10 years. But the loss of forest has once again started to rise. In November 2019, the government published data confirming expert predictions: that between the middle of 2018 and the middle of 2019, deforestation in the Amazon had increased 30% in relation to the previous year. They had cleared around 980,000 hectares (9,800 sq km), the largest area of forest cut down since 2008. And these figures don't take into account August 2019, when Amazon fires were at their worst. President Jair Bolsonaro's government claimed the fires were down to the dry season. But investigations by IPAM and the Federal University of Acre found otherwise. According to their report, the Amazon fires are directly related to deforestation. ""After felling the trees, they leave it to dry for a few months then set fire to it to clear the vegetation. The land is then used to plant grass and create pastures,"" says Erika Berenguer. According to the FAO, 80% of tree loss in Brazil is directly or indirectly related to cattle farming. Brazil is the largest beef exporter in the world. It makes up 7% of the country's GDP and 4.6% of exports. Today, around 40% of the country's cattle is raised in Amazon states. But that is only part of the story. Around 60 million hectares of the Brazilian Amazon are considered public areas, or rather they have no legal purpose defined by the government. They are not conservation areas, nor indigenous territories, for example. People clear this land, cut the trees down and put cattle on them, it's the cheapest way to occupy them, says Stabile. A patch of land without trees is worth more on the market. The next step in the chain is to illegally obtain a title deed for the land and sell it, says Mr Stabile. They then find another patch of forest and start again. The land is often sold to large-scale farmers and it is hard to tell which was cleared legally and what wasn't. The same happens in Colombia, Peru and Ecuador. According to Mr Stabile and other investigators, Brazil could double or triple its number of cattle without felling another hectare of the Amazon rainforest. ""What's happening is land speculation,"" he says. ""If the government defined these public areas, it would cease to be lucrative."" Environmentalists and investigators say statements and policies from Bolsonaro's government are encouraging clearances and the persecution of indigenous people. Although the government denies this, the president has said he wants to end the ""industry of environmental taxes"" and believes the country has too many conservation areas. The government also wants to allow mining on land belonging to indigenous tribes. Between January and September 2019, attacks and invasions of indigenous people's land increased 40% on the previous year. The finger of blame is pointed at those involved in land clearance, logging and mining. However, as the coronavirus crisis took hold in May, around 4,000 troops were mobilised in the Amazon against illegal logging and other activities until June, although that could be extended into the dry season to help with fire prevention. Environment Minister Ricardo Salles said the coronavirus outbreak had ""aggravated"" the situation this year. President Bolsonaro, however, has spoken against punitive measures taken against loggers and miners - such as the destruction of their equipment when it can't be taken out of the forest. Critics say that sends a message that the government is on their side. In 2017, the level of deforestation in Colombia was one of the biggest in the Amazon region and the highest in the country's history. More than 140,000 hectares of forest was cleared, twice the previous year's total. This peak was a result of the peace accord with Farc rebels in 2016, which left a power vacuum in forested areas. Community leaders said Farc had acted as a type of environmental police, controlling when farmers were allowed to clear the forest or burn for agriculture or cattle farming. ""Government officials wouldn't come near the Amazon region because of Farc, who, for their own protection, had an interest in keeping the trees standing. So the rebels could establish strict rules,"" said Rodrigo Botero, director of Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development. However, Colombia is now facing a race to clear land in the Amazon led by large-scale farmers, local authorities, drug dealers and other paramilitary groups such as the ELN, says Botero. There is a market for land and the government can't stop it, he says. The Colombian government formed a National Council for the Fight against Deforestation in an attempt to tackle the issue. The group works to identify pockets of deforestation, the causes and what action is needed, according to the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development. Laws passed in 2018 made the protection of water, biodiversity and the environment priority issues in matters of national security. The government can now intervene to protect areas in the Amazon national park from illegal activities. They are also carrying out military operations against people clearing land and launching programmes which promote financial incentives for conservation. By 2018, Colombian had lost around 11.7% of its original forest - 14% of which was in the previous eight years. But there are signs the efforts are paying off. In 2019, there was a significant fall in the loss of primary forest - although the level of deforestation was still higher than any year on record before the peace agreement. In the north of Ecuador, palm oil production is the main threat to the Amazon, experts say. The oil is used worldwide in the industrialised production of food such as chocolate, cosmetics, cleaning products and fuels. Ecuador is the second biggest producer of palm oil in Latin America, and the sixth worldwide. The expansion of palm oil and cocoa plantations in the last 10 years is the main driver of deforestation, according to Global Forest Watch and Maap. This is particularly worrying because despite only covering about 2% of the Amazon biome, Ecuador has one of the most diverse parts of the forest. In just one hectare of the YasunÃ­ park area, you'll find 670 tree species - more than in the whole of North America. Furthermore, according to a study by the country's National Institute of Biodiversity, between 40% and 60% of the species of trees in Ecuador's Amazon region are still unknown. Mining projects and oil exploration in the Amazon have also made headline news in Ecuador. One such project is Mirador, an open mine for copper, gold and silver which will be built in two Amazon provinces. It is the biggest project of its type in Ecuador - but not the only one. The government says industrial mining in the region, carried out by a Chinese company, will be responsible and the income generated will allow investment in infrastructure locally. However, investigators believe the activity could bring with it serious problems to the Amazon. ""As well as deforestation, we don't know exactly where they are going to put the dams nor how they are going to monitor them,"" said Carmen Josse, scientific director of the EcoCiencia Foundation. We asked Ecuador's government about their strategy to prevent mining contributing to deforestation - but they have not responded. French Guiana soldiers search for illegal miners Around 75% of it is virgin forest, which has had little or no intervention by humans, according to Global Forest Watch in 2016. Among the Amazon territories it has the largest percentage of forest in protected areas - almost 50% - and the lowest levels of deforestation. However, representatives of native people and environmentalists are worried by the advance of legal and illegal mining, encroaching on the protected zones. At the start of 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron suspended a gold mining megaproject within the Guianan Amazon National Park, which he had initially approved at the start of his tenure. The suspension was the result of national and international campaigns. Despite this, illegal mining is the main threat to the park. Security forces have detected an increase in the number of illegal mines in the area since 2017. With a population of less than 300,000 people, French Guiana has between 8,000 and 10,000 illegal miners. The rising price of gold since the 2008 financial crisis has sparked a rush to find the metal in the forests of the world. ""Most of the time, they're poor kids from Brazil looking for easy money. They live in the forest for months and months,"" explained Captain Vianney, who is leading the Foreign Legion's operations against gold mining. We asked the ministry of French overseas territories about the government's strategy to combat deforestation but they have not replied. Ninety five per cent of Guyana is covered by the Amazon. The country proposes two ways of treating the forest which, for many, seem irreconcilable. On the one hand, it is looking for a way of exploiting it economically while at the same time selling itself as a Green State that protects the Amazon. The annual rate of deforestation in Guyana is the lowest in the region - 0.051% in 2018, according to government figures. Part of its success is due to strategies such as the creation of a forest management commission, which decides which trees can or cannot be cut down. However, legal felling controlled by the government is still considered a factor that enables deforestation. According to environmentalists, licences for large international logging companies create access to virgin forest which illegal miners take advantage of. Guyana's Forestry Commission says it has not opened any new areas of the forest for legal felling since 2015. In fact, some areas were taken back off the companies who had licences to exploit them and they have become conservation areas, the government said. Illegal mining - mainly gold - is to blame for 85% of the forest loss, according to the Forestry Commission. Gold is the country's main export. The government says it has a ""Green State development strategy"" for the country which includes more investment in ecotourism and renewable energy, stricter limits on CO2 emissions and increasing forest conservation. All this is funded by international agreements to preserve the Amazon and the discovery of huge oil reserves at sea. Small scale agriculture has traditionally been the main cause of deforestation in Peru. Recently, however, cultivation of palm oil, cocoa and coca are catching up. A 2018 study found that despite making up only 4% of crops in the Amazon, palm oil was responsible for 11% of deforestation between 2007 and 2013. The oil is used worldwide to produce food, cosmetics and fuel. After some palm oil producers were fined for deforestation, they started to buy land from small farmers who had already cleared the forest illegally, says Sandra Rios, geographical engineer with the Instituto de Bien Comun (IBC Peru). We have asked Peru's environment minister about their strategy to prevent deforestation - but they have not responded. Illegal gold mining poses an increasing risk to the Peruvian Amazon. Peru is the biggest exporter of gold in Latin America, and the sixth worldwide. However, experts say up to 25% of its annual production comes from illegal mining. Since 2006, Peru has been experiencing a new gold rush in the Tambopata Nature Reserve, one of the most biodiverse in the region, driven by rising gold prices and the construction of the Brazil-Peru Transoceanic Highway. The road, from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic, not only makes travelling easier, it also opens up previously inaccessible areas of the forest. The group of miners in the area, known as the La Pampa, has grown to have more than 5,000 members. The miners strip the vegetation from the Amazon soil to look for gold. They use mercury to separate the precious metal from others, poisoning the waters and local animals in the process. In 2017, the loss of forest as a result of mining reached its highest level since 1985, according to the Center for Amazonian Scientific Innovation (Cincia). In March 2019, the government declared a state of emergency for 60 days to carry out military operations against miners in la Pampa. With almost 94% of its territory within the Amazon, Suriname is one of the countries with the best track record of conservation in biome. However, since 2012 Suriname has recorded an increase in the loss of forest, mainly as a result of gold mining. Between 2000 and 2014, the extent of mining areas, generally on a small scale industrial or artisanal mines, increased by 893%, according to the Foundation for Forest Management and Production Control. The government foundation says mining is responsible for 73% of the country's deforestation. Suriname is 10th in the world for gold production relative to its size. And that's without mentioning illegal mining. Most illegal mining takes place in remote areas of the forest, far from the authorities. It is believed that up to 60% of the gold miners in Suriname  are Brazilians who cross the border illegally. In some of the larger areas belong to indigenous tribes or descendents of slaves, mining has become the main source of income for families. There are no current official figures available for deforestation in Venezuela, but monitoring by local and international scientists show forest loss has increased in the last few years - especially since the creation of the Orinoco Mining Arc. With the dramatic fall in oil prices and production in Venezuela since 2014, the Maduro government has focused its attention at states rich in minerals - such as the Amazon. Venezuela has the sixth largest natural gold reserve in the world, with around 7,000 tonnes. The mining arc, created in 2016, allowed licences for mining precious metals such as gold, diamonds and coltan (a combination of columbite and tantalite used in the production of mobile phones) across an area of 112,000 sq km, about 12% of the country. The area also covers natural landmarks, forest reserves, an Amazon national park and at least four designated indigenous territories. ""The Orinoco zone is traditionally a mining area, even the indigenous people did it,"" says ecologist PelÃ¡ez, from the NGO Provita. ""But the law, in some ways, legalised forms of mining that were already in place and did not help reduce activity. This has had an enormous impact on the environment and the local population."" Maduro's plan was to grant concessions to foreign mining companies which would have to form businesses together with state-owned companies in order to operate in the area. In practice, according to Mr PelÃ¡ez, this resulted in an exponential growth in small-scale mining. In 2018 alone, according to the Central Bank of Venezuela, the state bought 9.2 tonnes of gold on the internal market - the same as the total amount for 2011-2017. It's having a devastating effect on the region. ""The gold that is there is of very poor quality, it's dirty,"" says Mr PelÃ¡ez. ""The amount that is coming out of the ground is very small."" Mining is producing tonnes of sediment that is accumulating in the country's main rivers. The use of mercury to separate gold from impurities, is poisoning rivers and indigenous people. Venezuela has the most illegal mines in the Amazon, according to a study by Raisg. There are 1,899 illegal mines, concentrated in the Orinoco mining arc. In the midst of Venezuela's political crisis, the National Assembly tried to repeal the law that created the Orinoco Mining Arc and even labelled it ""ecocide"" or a crime against the environment. We've asked three government ministries about the strategy to reduce deforestation in the zone, but none have responded.

Grant Shapps says Dominic Cummings was safeguarding the safety of his son Asked by reporters about Dominic Cummings, the Prime Minster's special adviser, who has faced criticism for travelling to Durham from London, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says it was a different situation to the resignations of Dr Catherine Calderwood, Scotland's former chief medical officer, and government scientific adviser Prof Neil Ferguson. ""This wasn't visiting a holiday home or going to visit someone,"" he says. ""This was to stay put and remain in isolation to deal with what I hear was a significant bout of coronavirus and then return to London only when well. There is every difference."" Mr Shapps says Boris Johnson knew of Cummings' whereabouts and has ""his full support"". He insists that people should follow the guidance ""to the best of their ability"" but it was ""for an individual to make the decision of how do I ensure I have enough support around the family"". Dr Jenny Harries, England's deputy chief medical officer, says the scientific and medical advice behind the self-isolation rules is ""to take people symptomatic out of the public domain and those likely to develop symptoms"" but adds that ""the only exception is around safeguarding"". SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford has called on the head of the civil service to investigate the ""rule-breaking"" and the UK governmentâs cover-upâ of Dominic Cummingsâ lockdown journey to Durham.

Mr Cummings insists hedid the ""right thing""and told reporters he ""behaved reasonably and legally"". In the letter to Sir Mark Sedwill and Boris Johnson, Mr Blackford highlights the âmatter of serious public concernâ with several questions for the PM including when he found out about the trip and what role the government played in âkeeping the public in the dark for eight weeksâ. He also continued his calls for Mr Cummings to resign, stating his position as âcompletely untenableâ. The Labour Party has also called for an investigation. Dr Jenny Harries, England's deputy chief medical officer, says, across all of the UK, demand for mechanical ventilator beds in hospitals has come down. She says that 12% of such beds are occupied with Covid-19 patients - meaning there is now ""significant capacity"" available. Dr Harries says that deaths are starting to come down and that, over a rolling seven-day average, it is continuing to come down. She says that the UK is maintaining a downward trend in new confirmed cases.

"People arriving in France from the UK will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 8 June, the French government has announced. It comes after Home Secretary Priti Patel revealed quarantine plans for visitors to the UK from the same date. France said it would impose reciprocal measures for any European country enforcing a quarantine. Travellers arriving in France from Spain by plane will also be asked to go into quarantine from Monday. Speaking at Friday's Downing Street briefing, Ms Patel said travellers to the UK will need to tell the government where they will quarantine, and face enforcement through random spot checks and Â£1,000 fines in England if they do not comply. She said the measure would ""reduce the risk of cases crossing our border"". Lorry drivers, seasonal farm workers, and coronavirus medics will be exempt. The requirement will also not apply to those travelling from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. This video can not be played The home secretary said the measures would be reviewed every three weeks If a person does not have suitable accommodation to go to, they will be required to stay in ""facilities arranged by the government"" at the person's own expense, according to Border Force chief Paul Lincoln. The Home Office said the new policy will be in place across the UK, although how it is enforced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be determined by the devolved administrations. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said discussions would take place with Police Scotland to work out how the policy will be implemented. Ms Patel told the briefing the measures were not the same as completely shutting the UK border to visitors. ""We are not shutting down completely. We are not closing our borders,"" she said. And asked about the prospect of foreign holidays this summer, the home secretary added: ""This is absolutely not about booking holidays. We want to avoid a second wave and that is absolutely vital."" What are the new quarantine rules for passengers? Will I be able to go on holiday this year? Why the NHS may need to hire cabin crew So-called ""air bridges"" - agreements with countries that have low infection rates allowing tourists to travel without quarantining - will not be in place initially, the government said. The new measure, previously announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, will be reviewed every three weeks once it is introduced. But airlines have said a quarantine requirementwould ""effectively kill air travel""- and one airport bossdescribed the plans as a ""blunt tool"". The government currently recommends international travel only when absolutely necessary, and nobody should travel if they display anycoronavirus symptoms. Victoria Bacon from ABTA, the travel industry trade body, told the BBC the government needs to come up with some ""wider, more forward thinking"" strategies for the industry. ""There's a whole range of support, not just financial, that the government can put in place to start helping the sector and we've heard very little from them. We really desperately need some help,"" she said. Passengers arriving in the UK will be required to fill out an online locator contact form - providing details of where they will spend their 14 days in self-isolation. The Home Office said the proposed accommodation will need to meet necessary requirements, such as a hotel or a private address with friends or family. There will be a fine of Â£100 for failure to complete the form, and the Border Force will have the power to refuse entry to non-UK citizens who do not comply with the new regulations.

"People arriving in France from the UK will have to self-isolate for 14 days from 8 June, the French government has announced. It comes after Home Secretary Priti Patel revealed quarantine plans for visitors to the UK from the same date. France said it would impose reciprocal measures for any European country enforcing a quarantine. Travellers arriving in France from Spain by plane will also be asked to go into quarantine from Monday. Speaking at Friday's Downing Street briefing, Ms Patel said travellers to the UK will need to tell the government where they will quarantine, and face enforcement through random spot checks and Â£1,000 fines in England if they do not comply. She said the measure would ""reduce the risk of cases crossing our border"". Lorry drivers, seasonal farm workers, and coronavirus medics will be exempt. The requirement will also not apply to those travelling from the Republic of Ireland, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. This video can not be played The home secretary said the measures would be reviewed every three weeks If a person does not have suitable accommodation to go to, they will be required to stay in ""facilities arranged by the government"" at the person's own expense, according to Border Force chief Paul Lincoln. The Home Office said the new policy will be in place across the UK, although how it is enforced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be determined by the devolved administrations. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said discussions would take place with Police Scotland to work out how the policy will be implemented. Ms Patel told the briefing the measures were not the same as completely shutting the UK border to visitors. ""We are not shutting down completely. We are not closing our borders,"" she said. And asked about the prospect of foreign holidays this summer, the home secretary added: ""This is absolutely not about booking holidays. We want to avoid a second wave and that is absolutely vital."" What are the new quarantine rules for passengers? Will I be able to go on holiday this year? Why the NHS may need to hire cabin crew So-called ""air bridges"" - agreements with countries that have low infection rates allowing tourists to travel without quarantining - will not be in place initially, the government said. The new measure, previously announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, will be reviewed every three weeks once it is introduced. But airlines have said a quarantine requirementwould ""effectively kill air travel""- and one airport bossdescribed the plans as a ""blunt tool"". The government currently recommends international travel only when absolutely necessary, and nobody should travel if they display anycoronavirus symptoms. Victoria Bacon from ABTA, the travel industry trade body, told the BBC the government needs to come up with some ""wider, more forward thinking"" strategies for the industry. ""There's a whole range of support, not just financial, that the government can put in place to start helping the sector and we've heard very little from them. We really desperately need some help,"" she said. Passengers arriving in the UK will be required to fill out an online locator contact form - providing details of where they will spend their 14 days in self-isolation. The Home Office said the proposed accommodation will need to meet necessary requirements, such as a hotel or a private address with friends or family. There will be a fine of Â£100 for failure to complete the form, and the Border Force will have the power to refuse entry to non-UK citizens who do not comply with the new regulations. New arrivals will be told they may be contacted at any time during their quarantine and, in England, may be visited by public health authorities conducting spot checks. They will be told to avoid public transport and travel to their accommodation by car ""where possible"", and not to go out to buy food or other essentials ""where they can rely on others"".

"Darrell Glen Humphries admitted assaulting an emergency worker A 53-year-old man has been jailed for 26 weeks for spitting at a police officer after claiming he had coronavirus. Darrell Glen Humphries, from Canton, Cardiff, admitted assaulting an emergency worker when he appeared before the city's magistrates. Supt Jason Rees called it a ""despicable"" incident. He said the sentence should serve as a deterrent to those who assault ""people who are trying to keep them safe"".

"The use of Zoom or Skype by social workers would minimise the disruption caused by coronavirus, VFCC says A lack of access to basic technology during lockdown poses an ""unprecedented threat"" to the wellbeing of children in care and care leavers, a charity warns. Voices from Care Cymru (VFCC) said some of the most vulnerable children and young people in society cannot stay in touch with important support networks. The charity warned isolation and poor mental health is on the rise and called on councils to utilise technology. Local authorities have accepted there are ""technological challenges"". But the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), which represents councils in Wales, said social workers are embracing new ways of working. 'Digital poverty' in schools where few have laptops Lockdown life 'a challenge' for vulnerable children '2m children face heightened lockdown risk' A lack of access to laptop computers, mobile phones and the internet leaves some people unable to contact friends, family, advisers and social workers, VFCC said. It added that many of those affected had experienced childhood trauma and instability, and may have an existing mental illness at a time ofmajor disruption to mental health services. ""By listening to care-experienced young people from across Wales, we know Covid-19 poses an unprecedented threat to the wellbeing of many vulnerable children and young adults,"" said VFCC programmes manager Christopher Dunn. Mr Dunn explained they faced ""a wide range of social and financial inequalities"" and that ""social distancing exacerbates the loneliness and isolation already felt"" by those without ""the usual family support networks"". One care leaver told the BBC she had experienced feelings of isolation despite being fortunate enough to have access to electronic devices. Sarah Crombie, 19, lives in supported housing in Torfaen after spending two years in care. She said it was very common for friends who are in care, or have left care, to have no access to such technology. Although she has access to a laptop and mobile phone, she said she became depressed during the first two weeks of lockdown. Isolation and poor mental health is on the rise among children in care and care leavers, a charity says ""When you are on your own, it gets quite depressing - there's only so much you can do,"" she said. ""Most of the time the only chance you have to talk to someone is contact with your PA [personal adviser] or social worker, and that is really limited. ""We know they have got big caseloads, but at the same it is hard to contact them even by text or call. They need to be more engaged; they need to contact young people more."" Sarah has worked hard enough at college to have the choice between two universities to study at. But with open days cancelled, she said she feels unable to make an informed decision. And with a new tenant due to move into her shared accommodation, she is anxious about becoming infected. ""I have asked my social worker if they can be tested or something because it does worry me,"" she explained. Dan Pitt, co-chairman of VFCC and a care leaver, said: ""Relationships are so important for care-experienced children and young people, so getting to see their social worker via Zoom or Skype, even if it's to just check in, will minimise the disruption of Covid-19."" A WLGA spokesman added: ""Local authorities continue to work extremely hard to overcome these barriers by tailoring approaches to meet individual needs and ensure that they meet their statutory duties."" Sally Holland, the Children's Commissioner for Wales, called on people to remember ""young people can be lonely too"". Sally Holland calls on people to remember children and young people also feel isolated She added: ""Imagine just for a moment living through this lockdown in a bedsit on your own, aged 18, with no family support, hardly any money, possibly mental and physical health problems and little access to a digital device?"" VFCC chief executive Deborah Jones praised the ""resilience"" of care-experienced young people. The Welsh Government said it had announced Â£3m of funding to provide digital devices and internet access to ""excluded learners"". ""We have been assured by heads of children's social services in Wales that children in care are being supported to maintain contact with family and friends during the pandemic,"" a spokesman added.

"Centrepoint, a homeless charity supporting under-25s in England, has seen a 36% increase in people seeking support since lockdown began. The charity, and young people who spoke to the BBC, say that some councils are failing them during the Covid-19 crisis.Â âStay at home, protect the NHS, save lives,â goes the slogan. But what if you donât have a home? âYour grandparents were called to war, you were called to sit on the sofa,â goes another saying. But what happens if other peopleâs sofas were the only thing keeping you off the streets? For many homeless young people, sofa surfing is the only way of keeping a roof over their heads, staying with different friends for days or weeks at a time, while they seek support and work out their next move. While the government has stopped landlords evicting tenants until the end of June, thereâs no protection from being thrown out by your parents or friends. Quin, 24, was sofa surfing at her friendâs parentsâ house when Boris Johnson announced on 23 March that the UK was going into lockdown. She couldnât move to another house because it wasnât allowed - not that anyone else was offering to take her in. But she was already beginning to feel that she had overstayed her welcome. Quin keeps all her possessions next to the sofa bed. They are lined up, still in the bin bags that she brought them in six months ago. When she's looking for something to wear to her job as a carer she carefully rifles through the black sacks â ensuring that the room stays exactly how it was before she started to crash there. She says the difficulty of sofa surfing is âjust not knowing where my home is, not having anywhere to call homeâ. âI donât feel comfortable, because Iâm sleeping in my friend's old bedroom. I work from 6am onwards some days, so we canât always share the room because he keeps me awake. Then I feel guilty that Iâm kicking my friend out of his own bedroom.â It then takes Quin an hour and a half, and three buses, to get to work. Then it takes another five minutes to put on the PPE that she hopes will protect the people sheâs caring for, and herself. As well as looking after people with mental disabilities, her new tasks now include deep cleaning the home twice a day and cutting hair.Â When she finishes her longest shift at 21:30 she starts another virtual flat viewing. For the last six months she has just about managed to save enough, from the Â£8.50 she earns an hour, to put down a deposit somewhere. So far 20 private landlords in Sutton have turned her down. One message from an agent read: âIâve just spoken to the landlord and unfortunately she has said that her and her husband want to pull out. Due to the virus she does not feel comfortable having tenants in the property who are in a line of work affected. Iâve tried to reason with her but she isnât open to discuss.â On 14 May, Quin was asked to leave the house where sheâs been staying and given two weeksâ notice. In a weekâs time, against the backdrop of a global pandemic, she has no idea where sheâll be sleeping. Family breakdown and job losses are two causes of youth homelessness that have increased during the current crisis. Homeless charity Centrepoint told the BBC that from the start of lockdown to the end of April,1,314 young people contacted to ask for help, compared with 838 in the same period last year - an increase of 36%. Some weeks the helpline for England has seen an increase of over 50% in under-25s seeking homelessness support.Â Centrepoint told the BBC it is âabsolutely stretchedâ and requires access to the Covid-19 charity funding to help cope with the increased demand. However, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government has still not published the criteria outlining who is eligible to apply, Centrepoint says. Two leading youth charities, Llamau in Wales and Housing Rights in Northern Ireland, told the BBC that over the last two months they have seen a 50% increase in the volume of calls. Nicole, 24, was sitting in her hotel room when she spoke to the BBC. Every few minutes the music from outside her door would be too loud for Zoom to pick up her voice - giving an insight into what life has been like in her council-provided hotel for the homeless. On 22 February, Nicole visited West Suffolk Council to tell them she was going to be evicted from her home and was at risk of becoming homeless, but she was warned that there was a âsevere shortage of homesâ. On 6 March she began sofa-surfing with a friend, but like Quin, Nicole works at a care home - and her friend, who has diabetes, asked Nicole to move out. Overnight, despite now being designated a key worker, Nicole was facing the possibility of sleeping rough.Â With no other alternative, she set up a tent in her grandmotherâs back garden, making sure not to go into the house in order to keep her grandmother safe. âIt was cold but at the end of the day at least I was somewhere safe and not actually out on the streets. âI had to go into work early and shower... I do a lot of hours, so one day Iâll be doing earlies and the next one Iâm doing late shifts, so the variation of shifts was quite hard with not being able to sleep at night because of the cold.â Nicole says the council knew she would become homeless from 6 March but did not reach out to her when the pandemic was declared. Instead, when news broke of the governmentâs pledge to house all homeless people, Nicole contacted the council. Five days later, on 30 March, she was put up in a local hotel thanks to the government-funded Everyone In scheme - though she was warned the contract for her room was for 12 weeks only. The offer read: âAs you do not meet priority need, we would only be able to accommodate you due to the Covid-19 crisis, so this would be on a temporary basis.â After weeks of camping, Nicole was âover the moonâ when she first moved into the hotel. âThe place is really nice. Itâs got a nice garden. I actually had a bed to sleep in,"" she says. But when more people started to arrive things quickly changed. She says she informed the council that other residents are not always socially distancing. âDrugs are a constant thing every dayâ, and the loud music has been keeping her from sleeping before her long shifts as a carer. Since February, Nicole has bid for about 30 different council properties in areas near her work. Which bid is accepted depends on the biddersâ housing needs, and as Nicole is not seen as a priority case by the council, it is unlikely she will be able to secure one.Â Youâre usually seen as a priority case if you have children under 16, are considered vulnerable or have a serious health condition. She says the council wants her to consider a room in shared accommodation, but she is resisting this.Â âThe first time I lived in it, in the middle of the night the man who owned the house came into my room and tried to sleep with me. I was the one that got kicked out.â The next time she found out the landlord had been secretly filming her. âEven when I moved into the hotel room, I was checking all the light bulbs, checking in the fire alarms, and all the lampshades [for a camera]. âThey're still trying to push me to go to a shared accommodation. Itâs a bit messed up,â she says. Nicole, who was diagnosed with bipolar in 2015, says her depression has been worsening during her stay at the hotel. Her biggest worry is ending up on the streets when her 12-week contract on the council-provided hotel room is up. The council could not confirm whether or not it would extend her stay. âIâm so unsettled here - the fact that I have no idea whatâs going to happen to me after all this, itâs constantly on my mind. Everyoneâs wishing for lockdown to finish and as much as I do in regards to people dying, I donât want it to end because I have somewhere to live.â A West Suffolk Council spokesperson said: âWe donât comment on individual cases but we continue to support people who are homeless during Covid-19 and at other times. Nationally there is a shortage of housing and we know that it is difficult, particularly for young people.â When the government outlined the Everyone In policy, providing Â£3.2bn of funding to local authorities, it pledged to house rough sleepers throughout the coronavirus crisis.Â Since then it says more than 5,000 rough sleepers have been moved into hotels by councils. But Paul Brocklehurst, Senior Helpline Manager at Centrepoint, says there is still a âcontinuous streamâ of young people becoming homeless - some who are being turned away by their councils. Paul acknowledges the great steps that have been taken with the ban on evictions and the housing of entrenched rough sleepers, but says that it does not cover everyone, for example the newly homeless. âYoung people that are newly homeless arenât always getting that treatment. Councils are saying, âThe hotels that we booked are all completely full, we simply donât have the space and resources any more.â âWe're seeing an increase in young people being kicked out and lots of young people very close to being rough sleeping.â Paul says that councils often fail to provide adequate help when thereâs a family breakdown, and regularlyrequire proofthat a young person who has been thrown out by their parents is no longer welcome there.Â âSometimes we see that the parents say to the council, âYes, we'll take them back,â but say to the kid, âNo, you're not coming back.â That doesn't always result in the council supporting the young person.âÂ One 20-year-old told the BBC that despite the pandemic, Bristol City Council asked him to contact his abusive and transphobic family for proof he was homeless. Later officials said he couldnât be housed because he did not have a âlocal connectionâ to the area. Another category that Paul Brocklehurst says have received little help are the âhidden homelessâ who find temporary solutions such as sofa surfing in insecure accommodation. Research by the charity Crisis indicates that about 62% of single homeless people are hidden and may not show up in official government figures.Â Before her friendâs parents asked her to leave their house, Quin had been homeless twice. After leaving her abusive family home, with a scar etched across her forehead, she started to stay with friends. For three years she sofa surfed every few weeks while she did her qualifications. âIâd finish college and go sit in a local Costa for hours on end, using their free Wi-Fi, just to finish my college work because I didnât know where Iâd sleep that night. âIt was just horrific, but Iâm glad I got through it.â After being turned away twice by two different councils, one of which offered her a train ticket back to her abusive mum, Quin says she has given up on going to the council for help. âI thought I was finally getting better, getting over everything thatâs ever happened to me. My abusive ex and my suicide attempt. And then coronavirus happened. I just feel so hopeless.â Quin is on the waiting list for mental health treatment, but she will have to start the process again when she moves. Quin says that while clapping for carers is a good thing, without a pay rise many people like her will continue to struggle. She still doesnât know where sheâll be in two weeks. Now Quin is considering setting up an Only Fans account to sell nude photos, to make enough money to have somewhere safe to stay before she becomes homeless. âItâs something I really donât want to do but I think if itâs getting to the point where Iâm going to need more money, it's something that I canât not do. âDoes anyone want to see the Only Fans of someone thatâs just trying not to be homeless and failing?â A Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government spokesperson said: âThis government is committed to ending rough sleeping. Councils should be proud of their efforts to get rough sleepers off the street â support from central government has ensured 90% of rough sleepers known to councils at the start of the pandemic have been offered accommodation. Weâve been clear councils must continue to provide safe accommodation - backed by an unprecedented Â£3.2bn package of government support. âWe know that young people leaving the care system can be particularly at risk of homelessness. That is why the government has provided Â£3.2m per annum to 47 local authorities with the highest numbers of care leavers. Our youth advisers are working closely with local authorities on the particular challenges that young people and care leavers are facing during COVID-19.â Quin is a pseudonym Illustrations by Emma Lynch What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires, and what caused them?

"The far-right Vox party urged supporters to protest the country's lockdown from their cars Thousands of people in Spain are protesting against the government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The far-right Vox party urged supporters to drive through major cities without leaving their vehicles in order to maintain social distancing. Protesters in the capital, Madrid, drove in convoy and waved Spanish flags as they called for socialist Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez to resign. Spain imposed some of the tightest restrictions in Europe on 14 March. It has eased restrictions in recent weeks, but Madrid and Barcelona have remained under tight lockdown due to their more severe outbreaks of Covid-19. How is lockdown being lifted across Europe? Spain tightens mask rules for all older than five Spain set for basic income to ease crisis pain Both cities will begin to relax their curbs from Monday by allowing outdoor dining and gatherings of up to 10 people. The country's two-month lockdown has seen hotels, bars and restaurants all close as well as beaches and other outdoor attractions. The government says this has allowed it to get the outbreak under control, and the daily death toll has been gradually declining. Spain has been one of the countries worst affected by the pandemic Vox leader Santiago Abascal spoke from an open-topped bus in Madrid But, on Saturday, far-right protesters called for the lockdown to be lifted entirely owing to its impact on jobs and the economy. Almost one million jobs were lost in March alone, and forecasts suggest the Spanish economy will contract by up to 12% this year as a result of the pandemic. The demonstrators called for both Mr Sanchez and Deputy Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias, who heads the left-wing Podemos party, to step down over their handling of the crisis. ""It is time to make a big noise against the government of unemployment and misery that has abandoned our self-employed and workers,"" the opposition Vox party said in a statement. This video can not be played Who are Spain's far-right party? The party's leader, Santiago Abascal, led the protest from an open-topped bus in Madrid. He wore a face mask and accused the government of being ""directly responsible for the worst management of this crisis on the entire planet"". ""Let your desire be heard for the resignation of the government,"" he told supporters in a speech that was broadcast on radio. Similar protests also took place in Seville, Barcelona and other regional capitals where rows of cars and motorbikes decked in Spanish flags honked their horns. Others followed the convoys on foot and held placards While countries such as the UK, US and Brazil have also seen anti-lockdown protests, they have rarely seen social distancing measures respected. While protests against his leadership took place around the country, Prime Minister Sanchez announced two major relaxations of the lockdown. He said the country's borders would reopen to foreign tourists from July. Mr Sanchez also announced that football matches in La Liga- the top league of Spanish football - could resume from the week of 8 June. La Liga players started training in small groups earlier this week ""Spain has done what it should and now new horizons are opening for everyone. The time has come to bring back many day-to-day activities,"" he said. The second division is also set to resume at the same time as the top flight, with reports suggesting the derby between Sevilla and Real Betis will be the first La Liga game to take place. On Wednesday, Mr SÃ¡nchez won parliamentary backing to extend the state of emergency until 6 June. Spain is one of the countries that has been hardest-hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with more than 28,000 recorded deaths and 234,000 cases. But the decline in the daily death toll continued on Friday, with 56 recorded over the previous twenty-four hours. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"Centrepoint, a homeless charity supporting under-25s in England, has seen a 36% increase in people seeking support since lockdown began. The charity, and young people who spoke to the BBC, say that some councils are failing them during the Covid-19 crisis.Â âStay at home, protect the NHS, save lives,â goes the slogan. But what if you donât have a home? âYour grandparents were called to war, you were called to sit on the sofa,â goes another saying. But what happens if other peopleâs sofas were the only thing keeping you off the streets? For many homeless young people, sofa surfing is the only way of keeping a roof over their heads, staying with different friends for days or weeks at a time, while they seek support and work out their next move. While the government has stopped landlords evicting tenants until the end of June, thereâs no protection from being thrown out by your parents or friends. Quin, 24, was sofa surfing at her friendâs parentsâ house when Boris Johnson announced on 23 March that the UK was going into lockdown. She couldnât move to another house because it wasnât allowed - not that anyone else was offering to take her in. But she was already beginning to feel that she had overstayed her welcome. Quin keeps all her possessions next to the sofa bed. They are lined up, still in the bin bags that she brought them in six months ago. When she's looking for something to wear to her job as a carer she carefully rifles through the black sacks â ensuring that the room stays exactly how it was before she started to crash there. She says the difficulty of sofa surfing is âjust not knowing where my home is, not having anywhere to call homeâ. âI donât feel comfortable, because Iâm sleeping in my friend's old bedroom. I work from 6am onwards some days, so we canât always share the room because he keeps me awake. Then I feel guilty that Iâm kicking my friend out of his own bedroom.â It then takes Quin an hour and a half, and three buses, to get to work. Then it takes another five minutes to put on the PPE that she hopes will protect the people sheâs caring for, and herself. As well as looking after people with mental disabilities, her new tasks now include deep cleaning the home twice a day and cutting hair.Â When she finishes her longest shift at 21:30 she starts another virtual flat viewing. For the last six months she has just about managed to save enough, from the Â£8.50 she earns an hour, to put down a deposit somewhere. So far 20 private landlords in Sutton have turned her down. One message from an agent read: âIâve just spoken to the landlord and unfortunately she has said that her and her husband want to pull out. Due to the virus she does not feel comfortable having tenants in the property who are in a line of work affected. Iâve tried to reason with her but she isnât open to discuss.â On 14 May, Quin was asked to leave the house where sheâs been staying and given two weeksâ notice. In a weekâs time, against the backdrop of a global pandemic, she has no idea where sheâll be sleeping. Family breakdown and job losses are two causes of youth homelessness that have increased during the current crisis. Homeless charity Centrepoint told the BBC that from the start of lockdown to the end of April,1,314 young people contacted to ask for help, compared with 838 in the same period last year - an increase of 36%. Some weeks the helpline for England has seen an increase of over 50% in under-25s seeking homelessness support.Â Centrepoint told the BBC it is âabsolutely stretchedâ and requires access to the Covid-19 charity funding to help cope with the increased demand. However, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government has still not published the criteria outlining who is eligible to apply, Centrepoint says. Two leading youth charities, Llamau in Wales and Housing Rights in Northern Ireland, told the BBC that over the last two months they have seen a 50% increase in the volume of calls. Nicole, 24, was sitting in her hotel room when she spoke to the BBC. Every few minutes the music from outside her door would be too loud for Zoom to pick up her voice - giving an insight into what life has been like in her council-provided hotel for the homeless. On 22 February, Nicole visited West Suffolk Council to tell them she was going to be evicted from her home and was at risk of becoming homeless, but she was warned that there was a âsevere shortage of homesâ. On 6 March she began sofa-surfing with a friend, but like Quin, Nicole works at a care home - and her friend, who has diabetes, asked Nicole to move out. Overnight, despite now being designated a key worker, Nicole was facing the possibility of sleeping rough.Â With no other alternative, she set up a tent in her grandmotherâs back garden, making sure not to go into the house in order to keep her grandmother safe. âIt was cold but at the end of the day at least I was somewhere safe and not actually out on the streets. âI had to go into work early and shower... I do a lot of hours, so one day Iâll be doing earlies and the next one Iâm doing late shifts, so the variation of shifts was quite hard with not being able to sleep at night because of the cold.â Nicole says the council knew she would become homeless from 6 March but did not reach out to her when the pandemic was declared. Instead, when news broke of the governmentâs pledge to house all homeless people, Nicole contacted the council. Five days later, on 30 March, she was put up in a local hotel thanks to the government-funded Everyone In scheme - though she was warned the contract for her room was for 12 weeks only. The offer read: âAs you do not meet priority need, we would only be able to accommodate you due to the Covid-19 crisis, so this would be on a temporary basis.â After weeks of camping, Nicole was âover the moonâ when she first moved into the hotel. âThe place is really nice. Itâs got a nice garden. I actually had a bed to sleep in,"" she says. But when more people started to arrive things quickly changed. She says she informed the council that other residents are not always socially distancing. âDrugs are a constant thing every dayâ, and the loud music has been keeping her from sleeping before her long shifts as a carer. Since February, Nicole has bid for about 30 different council properties in areas near her work. Which bid is accepted depends on the biddersâ housing needs, and as Nicole is not seen as a priority case by the council, it is unlikely she will be able to secure one.Â Youâre usually seen as a priority case if you have children under 16, are considered vulnerable or have a serious health condition. She says the council wants her to consider a room in shared accommodation, but she is resisting this.Â âThe first time I lived in it, in the middle of the night the man who owned the house came into my room and tried to sleep with me. I was the one that got kicked out.â The next time she found out the landlord had been secretly filming her. âEven when I moved into the hotel room, I was checking all the light bulbs, checking in the fire alarms, and all the lampshades [for a camera]. âThey're still trying to push me to go to a shared accommodation. Itâs a bit messed up,â she says. Nicole, who was diagnosed with bipolar in 2015, says her depression has been worsening during her stay at the hotel. Her biggest worry is ending up on the streets when her 12-week contract on the council-provided hotel room is up. The council could not confirm whether or not it would extend her stay. âIâm so unsettled here - the fact that I have no idea whatâs going to happen to me after all this, itâs constantly on my mind. Everyoneâs wishing for lockdown to finish and as much as I do in regards to people dying, I donât want it to end because I have somewhere to live.â A West Suffolk Council spokesperson said: âWe donât comment on individual cases but we continue to support people who are homeless during Covid-19 and at other times. Nationally there is a shortage of housing and we know that it is difficult, particularly for young people.â When the government outlined the Everyone In policy, providing Â£3.2bn of funding to local authorities, it pledged to house rough sleepers throughout the coronavirus crisis.Â Since then it says more than 5,000 rough sleepers have been moved into hotels by councils. But Paul Brocklehurst, Senior Helpline Manager at Centrepoint, says there is still a âcontinuous streamâ of young people becoming homeless - some who are being turned away by their councils. Paul acknowledges the great steps that have been taken with the ban on evictions and the housing of entrenched rough sleepers, but says that it does not cover everyone, for example the newly homeless. âYoung people that are newly homeless arenât always getting that treatment. Councils are saying, âThe hotels that we booked are all completely full, we simply donât have the space and resources any more.â âWe're seeing an increase in young people being kicked out and lots of young people very close to being rough sleeping.â Paul says that councils often fail to provide adequate help when thereâs a family breakdown, and regularlyrequire proofthat a young person who has been thrown out by their parents is no longer welcome there.Â âSometimes we see that the parents say to the council, âYes, we'll take them back,â but say to the kid, âNo, you're not coming back.â That doesn't always result in the council supporting the young person.âÂ One 20-year-old told the BBC that despite the pandemic, Bristol City Council asked him to contact his abusive and transphobic family for proof he was homeless. Later officials said he couldnât be housed because he did not have a âlocal connectionâ to the area. Another category that Paul Brocklehurst says have received little help are the âhidden homelessâ who find temporary solutions such as sofa surfing in insecure accommodation. Research by the charity Crisis indicates that about 62% of single homeless people are hidden and may not show up in official government figures.Â Before her friendâs parents asked her to leave their house, Quin had been homeless twice. After leaving her abusive family home, with a scar etched across her forehead, she started to stay with friends. For three years she sofa surfed every few weeks while she did her qualifications. âIâd finish college and go sit in a local Costa for hours on end, using their free Wi-Fi, just to finish my college work because I didnât know where Iâd sleep that night. âIt was just horrific, but Iâm glad I got through it.â After being turned away twice by two different councils, one of which offered her a train ticket back to her abusive mum, Quin says she has given up on going to the council for help. âI thought I was finally getting better, getting over everything thatâs ever happened to me. My abusive ex and my suicide attempt. And then coronavirus happened. I just feel so hopeless.â Quin is on the waiting list for mental health treatment, but she will have to start the process again when she moves. Quin says that while clapping for carers is a good thing, without a pay rise many people like her will continue to struggle. She still doesnât know where sheâll be in two weeks. Now Quin is considering setting up an Only Fans account to sell nude photos, to make enough money to have somewhere safe to stay before she becomes homeless. âItâs something I really donât want to do but I think if itâs getting to the point where Iâm going to need more money, it's something that I canât not do. âDoes anyone want to see the Only Fans of someone thatâs just trying not to be homeless and failing?â A Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government spokesperson said: âThis government is committed to ending rough sleeping. Councils should be proud of their efforts to get rough sleepers off the street â support from central government has ensured 90% of rough sleepers known to councils at the start of the pandemic have been offered accommodation. Weâve been clear councils must continue to provide safe accommodation - backed by an unprecedented Â£3.2bn package of government support. âWe know that young people leaving the care system can be particularly at risk of homelessness. That is why the government has provided Â£3.2m per annum to 47 local authorities with the highest numbers of care leavers. Our youth advisers are working closely with local authorities on the particular challenges that young people and care leavers are facing during COVID-19.â Quin is a pseudonym Illustrations by Emma Lynch What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires, and what caused them?

"This video can not be played As the National Botanic Garden of Wales celebrates 20 years - we look at how it has grown From bailouts to blooming marvellous - the National Botanic Garden of Wales is celebrating its 20th birthday. Along the way, vital lessons have been learned, especially in the last decade, says its chairman of the trustees. Marking the birthday milestone, Gary Davies said without turning the garden's fortunes around ""180 degrees"", it would not have weathered the coronavirus pandemic. But lockdown means a party to mark its anniversary remains on hold. ""There's no doubt about it, in the early days we made some fundamental mistakes,"" said Mr Davies. ""As we were a novelty, in our first year we attracted 240,000 visitors, and we planned on the assumption that this would continue forever. ""We overstretched ourselves and nearly paid the price."" Built at a cost of Â£43m, the 568-acre garden opened its doors in May 2000. But after the initial success, visitor figures slumped below 100,000 a year. Twice the garden at Llanarthne in Carmarthenshire needed saving from financial ruin, with emergency grants from the Welsh Government and the county council. Last year, there was a ""sustainable average"" of 160,000 people who went through its gates. The garden has worked hard to attract a new - and younger - audience In 2010 just a quarter of the income was self-generated, and three-quarters came from grants. Today the reverse is true. ""In the early 2000s the gardens were very immature, and frankly a little underwhelming,"" admitted Mr Davies. ""It's taken 20 years for them to reach their full splendour."" The garden team has also worked hard to develop what is on offer - especially for a younger audience. It includes a butterfly house, play areas, and even zorbing - where thrill-seekers can whizz along inside a giant balls. ""I was told by one parent that their child used to cry when they were told they were going to the Botanic Gardens for a day out, now they cry when they have to come away,"" added Mr Davies, who is also acting head of the garden. Could lockdown help wildflowers? Secret life of plants The 'Big Flower Fight' The focus on education and science at the establishment has also stood the garden in a good position to survive the coronavirus pandemic. They have been able to offer ecology lessons online, and help with teaching about living more sustainable lives. A seed bank at the site now holds over two million specimens of vulnerable plant species. Protecting plant species is one of the vital roles played by the garden Staff have also played a key role in preserving 270 plant species threatened by Australian wildfires earlier this year. ""More and more we're considered to be a global centre of excellence for botany, and are part of a network of institutions caring for the world's most at-risk flora, whether because of climate change or loss of habitat,"" said Mr Davies. But like other attractions in Wales, it remains closed to visitors at the moment. ""If there's any silver lining to all of this, at least it didn't happen 10 years ago when we were in an utter financial mess,"" added the chairman. ""We've been able to keep on some staff and volunteers, caring for the gardens under appropriate distancing measures, and the irony is that they've never looked better."" Mr Davies stressed that once they can reopen, they must play their part in the wider recovery. ""After this is all over we need to help all the hotels, pubs and small businesses who have helped us over the years. ""Not everyone is going to be as lucky as us, but we'll do whatever we can to assist. ""We may have missed celebrating our 20th anniversary, but I've promised everyone a bumper 21st birthday party, when we'll be welcoming back all our friends, and most certainly offering them the key to the door.""

"The use of Zoom or Skype by social workers would minimise the disruption caused by coronavirus, VFCC says A lack of access to basic technology during lockdown poses an ""unprecedented threat"" to the wellbeing of children in care and care leavers, a charity warns. Voices from Care Cymru (VFCC) said some of the most vulnerable children and young people in society cannot stay in touch with important support networks. The charity warned isolation and poor mental health is on the rise and called on councils to utilise technology. Local authorities have accepted there are ""technological challenges"". But the Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA), which represents councils in Wales, said social workers are embracing new ways of working. 'Digital poverty' in schools where few have laptops Lockdown life 'a challenge' for vulnerable children '2m children face heightened lockdown risk' A lack of access to laptop computers, mobile phones and the internet leaves some people unable to contact friends, family, advisers and social workers, VFCC said. It added that many of those affected had experienced childhood trauma and instability, and may have an existing mental illness at a time ofmajor disruption to mental health services. ""By listening to care-experienced young people from across Wales, we know Covid-19 poses an unprecedented threat to the wellbeing of many vulnerable children and young adults,"" said VFCC programmes manager Christopher Dunn. Mr Dunn explained they faced ""a wide range of social and financial inequalities"" and that ""social distancing exacerbates the loneliness and isolation already felt"" by those without ""the usual family support networks"". One care leaver told the BBC she had experienced feelings of isolation despite being fortunate enough to have access to electronic devices. Sarah Crombie, 19, lives in supported housing in Torfaen after spending two years in care. She said it was very common for friends who are in care, or have left care, to have no access to such technology. Although she has access to a laptop and mobile phone, she said she became depressed during the first two weeks of lockdown. Isolation and poor mental health is on the rise among children in care and care leavers, a charity says ""When you are on your own, it gets quite depressing - there's only so much you can do,"" she said. ""Most of the time the only chance you have to talk to someone is contact with your PA [personal adviser] or social worker, and that is really limited. ""We know they have got big caseloads, but at the same it is hard to contact them even by text or call. They need to be more engaged; they need to contact young people more."" Sarah has worked hard enough at college to have the choice between two universities to study at. But with open days cancelled, she said she feels unable to make an informed decision. And with a new tenant due to move into her shared accommodation, she is anxious about becoming infected. ""I have asked my social worker if they can be tested or something because it does worry me,"" she explained. Dan Pitt, co-chairman of VFCC and a care leaver, said: ""Relationships are so important for care-experienced children and young people, so getting to see their social worker via Zoom or Skype, even if it's to just check in, will minimise the disruption of Covid-19."" A WLGA spokesman added: ""Local authorities continue to work extremely hard to overcome these barriers by tailoring approaches to meet individual needs and ensure that they meet their statutory duties."" Sally Holland, the Children's Commissioner for Wales, called on people to remember ""young people can be lonely too"". Sally Holland calls on people to remember children and young people also feel isolated She added: ""Imagine just for a moment living through this lockdown in a bedsit on your own, aged 18, with no family support, hardly any money, possibly mental and physical health problems and little access to a digital device?"" VFCC chief executive Deborah Jones praised the ""resilience"" of care-experienced young people. The Welsh Government said it had announced Â£3m of funding to provide digital devices and internet access to ""excluded learners"". ""We have been assured by heads of children's social services in Wales that children in care are being supported to maintain contact with family and friends during the pandemic,"" a spokesman added.

"This video can not be played The crash happened in the Model Colony residential area One of the survivors of Friday's plane crash in the Pakistani city of Karachi has described his ordeal, saying all he could see ""was fire"". Passenger Muhammad Zubair was one of at least two passengers who survived after the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) Airbus A320 came down in a residential area. Health authorities in Sindh province said 97 deaths had been confirmed. The cause of the crash is not yet known. The pilot had reported a technical fault after one failed landing attempt, according to local media, then issued a mayday call as the plane came down. It came days after Pakistan allowed commercial flights to resume after the country's coronavirus lockdown was eased. Flight PK8303, an Airbus A320 carrying 91 passengers and eight crew - including many families travelling ahead of Sunday's Eid holiday - had travelled from Lahore. It was attempting to land at Karachi's Jinnah International Airport at about 14:30 local time (09:30 GMT) when it came down. Mr Zubair, who suffered only minor injuries, said the plane attempted one landing and then crashed 10-15 minutes later. ""No-one was aware that the plane was about to crash; they were flying the plane in a smooth manner,"" he said. He lost consciousness following the crash. When he came to, he said, ""I could hear screams from all directions. Kids and adults. All I could see was fire. I couldn't see any people - just hear their screams"". ""I opened my seatbelt and saw some light - I went towards the light. I had to jump down about 10ft (3m) to get to safety,"" he added. How likely are you to survive a plane crash? The plane was only just short of the runway perimeter when it struck houses in the Model Colony residential area. TV footage showed rescue crews combing through debris strewn across the streets of the densely populated zone. A number of cars were set on fire. Eyewitness Mohammed Uzair Khan told the BBC he had heard a massive sound and went outside his home. ""Almost four houses were completely collapsed, there was so much fire and smoke,"" he said. ""They are almost my neighbours, I can't tell you what a horrible thing it was."" Purported audio of the conversation between air traffic control and a pilot was published by Pakistani media. The pilot is heard saying the plane had ""lost engines"". An air traffic controller asks whether it is going to carry out a ""belly landing"", to which the pilot replies ""mayday, mayday, mayday"". One civil aviation official told Reuters the plane may have been unable to lower its undercarriage. Images posted on social media appeared to show scorch marks under both engines, with no undercarriage visible on approach. Investigators will try to retrieve the so-called black box recorders to help determine the cause. A committee of investigation has already been set up. PIA said the plane had joined the fleet in 2014 and passed its annual airworthiness inspection last November. Air disasters timeline The plane crashed in a residential area According to local authorities, 97 deaths have been confirmed, although it is unclear how many of the dead were passengers and how many residents on the ground. Nineteen of the dead have been identified. Zafar Masud, president of the Bank of Punjab, was the other passenger who survived the crash, a provincial government spokesman said. Both were at the front of the plane. There are reports of other survivors but these have not been confirmed. Many of those on board were families travelling ahead of Sunday's Eid holiday On Saturday, funerals took place for some of the victims in Karachi. DNA tests are being conducted on the bodies of others before they can be handed over to relatives. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said he was ""shocked and saddened"" by the crash,external, promising an immediate investigation. But the Pakistan Airlines' Pilots Association (Palpa) said it had no faith in the official investigation. The group called for international investigators to be involved in the inquiry. Pakistan has a chequered aviation safety record, including a number of airliner crashes. In 2010, an aircraft operated by private airline Airblue crashed near Islamabad, killing all 152 people on board - the deadliest air disaster ever in Pakistan. In 2012, a Boeing 737-200 operated by Pakistan's Bhoja Air crashed in bad weather on its approach to land in Rawalpindi, killing all 121 passengers and six crew. And in 2016, a Pakistan International Airlines plane burst into flames while travelling from northern Pakistan to Islamabad, killing 47 people. Are you in Karachi? Did you witness the crash?

"The Amazon rainforest - which plays a vital role in balancing the world's climate and helping fight global warming - is also suffering as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Deforestation jumped 55% in the first four months of 2020 compared with the same period last year, as people have taken advantage of the crisis to carry out illegal clearances. Logging, illegal mining, land clearances and wildfires were already at an 11-year high and scientists say we're fast approaching a point of no return - after which the Amazon will no longer function as it should. Here, we look at the pressures pushing the Amazon to the brink and ask what the nine countries that share this unique natural resource are doing to protect it. The largest and most diverse tropical rainforest in the world is home to 33 million people and thousands of species of plants and animals. Since coronavirus spread to Brazil, in March, Amazonas has been the state to register Brazil's highest infection rates - it also has one of the most underfunded health systems in the country. As elsewhere, social distancing and travel restrictions have been imposed to limit the spread of the virus. But many of the field agents working to protect reserves have pulled out, Jonathan Mazower, of Survival International, says, allowing loggers and miners to target these areas.  In April, as the number of cases rose and states started adopting isolation measures, deforestation actually increased 64% compared with the same month in 2019, according to preliminary satellite data from space research agency INPE. Last year, an unprecedented number of fires devastated huge swathes of forest in the Amazon. Peak fire season is from July which some experts worry could coincide with the peak of the coronavirus crisis. The Brazilian authorities are deploying troops in the Amazon region to help protect the rainforest, tackle illegal deforestation and forest fires. But critics say that the governmentâs rhetoric and policies could actually be encouraging loggers and illegal miners. Even before this yearâs spike in deforestation, the rate across the nine Amazon countries had continued to rise. Brazil, Bolivia and Peru were among the top five countries for loss of primary forest in 2019, with Bolivia experiencing a record-breaking loss of tree cover because of wildfires. But that is not the only problem. ""To only speak of deforestation when we refer to the loss of the Amazon is what I call ""the great green lie"","" says climate scientist Antonio Donato Nobre. ""The destruction of the Amazon rainforest up till now is much bigger than the almost 20% that they talk of in the media."" To get a more complete sense of the scale of the destruction, Dr Nobre says it is necessary to take into account the figures for degradation. This happens when a combination of pressures on a stretch of forest - such as fires, logging or unlicensed hunting - make it hard for the ecosystem to function properly. Even if an area does not lose all its trees and vegetation, degradation strips the rainforest of properties that are vital to the planet. Scientists say that if we don't reverse current levels of deforestation and degradation, the consequences of climate change could accelerate. The most common way of measuring deforestation is ""tree cover loss"" - where forest vegetation has been completely erased. In 2019 alone, the tree cover loss in the Amazon reached 2.4 million hectares (24,000 sq km), according to Global Forest Watch. Half of this was primary forest - 1.7 million hectares of forest that was still in its original state and rich in biodiversity. Its destruction was the same as threefootball pitchesof virgin forest being destroyed every minute in 2019. A football pitch is frequently used as a reference because, according to Fifa, the maximum size of a pitch is 1.08 hectares. However, some countries use smaller dimensions, which is why deforestation calculations can vary so much. This may seem insignificant - only 0.32% of the forest in the whole Amazon biome - but it is also a question of quality. ""Each hectare deforested means part of the ecosystem ceases to function and this affects the rest,"" says Oxford University rainforest expert Erika Berenguer. In the last 10 years, figures for primary forest loss have remained high or spiked in most of the Amazon nations. Primary forest is home to trees that can be hundreds or even thousands of years old. They perform a powerful role in mitigating the effects of climate change, as they act as an enormous carbon dioxide store. A small part of the CO2 absorbed by trees during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere during respiration. The rest is transformed into carbon which the trees use to produce the sugars needed for their metabolism. The older and larger the tree, the more carbon it stores. According to Dr Berenguer, a large tree (with at least three metres circumference) can contain between three and four tonnes of carbon. This is the same as about 10 to 12 tonnes of CO2, or what a family car emits over four years. One of the direct effects of deforestation is that it releases CO2 stored in the forest. Forest fires or the decomposition of felled trees both transform the carbon within the tree back into gas. For this reason, scientists fear that the Amazon will stop being a carbon store and will instead become a serious emitter of CO2, accelerating the effects of climate change. A recent study claimed that 20% of the Amazon is already emitting more CO2 that it absorbs. Experts like Antonio Nobre believe that deforestation does not show the full picture of what is being lost and we should also take into account ""degradation"". This phenomenon is as much the result of climatic events - such as drought, as human action - such as burning or illegal logging which strip the forest of its vital functions. However, seen from above, it may seem that the forest is still standing. ""Even though not all the vegetation is lost, the soil is drier and more fragile. This changes the microclimate of the forest and makes it easier for fires to spread because the soil heats up faster,"" explains Dr Alexander Lees, Senior Lecturer in tropical ecology at Manchester Metropolitan University in the UK. Scientists also warn that degradation is an important factor in releasing stored CO2. A new study by Raisg says 47% of all the emissions in the Amazon are as a result of degradation. And in seven of the nine Amazon countries, they say, degradation is the main source of their carbon dioxide emissions. Degradation also makes the forest less efficient. It loses, for example, the ability to generate some of its own rain. If we take the deforestation and degradation together, more than 50% of the Amazon no longer performs environmental services for the region's climate, says Antonio Nobre. Dr Nobre says the degraded areas of the Amazon are nearly twice as big as the deforested areas. A recent report by the Colombian government confirms that between 2012 and 2015, its own Amazon region lost 187,955 hectares of forest to deforestation and 414,605 hectares to degradation - more than double. So why don't they talk about degradation when measuring forest loss in the Amazon? ""It is a difficult phenomenon to measure because although you can see degradation on satellite images, you need to have data from the ground to understand the real picture - whether that area is more or less degraded or is recovering,"" says Alexander Lees. Among the Amazon countries, only Brazil regularly publishes annual degradation figures. However, scientists from across the region are trying to produce the relevant data to form a wider picture of the current state of the forest. If deforestation and degradation continue at current levels, the Amazon could stop working as a tropical ecosystem, even if some of it is still standing. We could be dangerously close to what scientists call ""the tipping point"" - when the nature of the Amazon will completely change. This will happen when total deforestation reaches between 20% and 25% - and that could happen in the next 20 or 30 years. It would cause the length of the dry season and temperatures in the forest to increase. Trees would start to die and the tropical rainforest could become more like a dry savannah. The projection, however, still does not take into account degradation because of the difficulty of measuring it across Panamazonas - the joint Amazon biome across the different national borders. This means it could be even closer than they think. But what could happen after the tipping point? Scientists can't say exactly what a sudden transformation of the Amazon rainforest would mean. But Brazilian climatologist Carlos Nobre, says temperatures in the region could increase by 1.5-3C in the areas which become degraded savannahs. And that is without taking into account possible increases already caused by global warming. This could have a catastrophic impact on the local economy. Less rain and higher temperatures mean less water for animals or growing crops like soya. Some studies link deforestation to an increase in illnesses transmitted by mosquitoes, such as malaria and leishmaniasis. The process of degradation could make the insects look for other sources of food and get closer to urban settlements. And temperature increases could lead to more heat-related cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, says Beatriz Oliveira, from Brazil's Climate Change Investigations Network (Red-Clima). ""Even if the conditions we have at the moment stay the same, temperatures in the Amazon region could increase by 8C, taking into account deforestation and global warming by 2070. ""Replacing the rainforest with another ecosystem, this increase could be even greater or could happen sooner."" According to Carlos Nobre, there is a way. ""First, we should adopt a zero deforestation policy in Panamazonas, immediately, together with a reforestation programme in the south, south-east and east of the Amazon, which are the most vulnerable areas."" ""If we could restore 60,000 or 70,000 sq km in this large area, where the dry season is already much longer, we could help the forest get back to working better and it would be more resilient."" That doesn't seem an easy task in the near future. Deforestation and its causes are a major source of friction between the governments of the nine Amazon nations, environmentalists, companies and indigenous groups: the desire for economic development clashes, in the main, with the preservation of the Amazon and itsnative peoples. More than 33 million people live in the Amazon - about 8% of the population of South America - in towns, cities, riverside communities and indigenous villages. There are at least 100 tribes who have had little or no contact with outsiders. It affects the ecosystem of the whole region, including those who are not part of the Amazon itself, and beyond. Antonio Nobre says: ""The ring made by central-southern Brazil and the River Plate basin would be a desert if it wasn't for the Amazon. ""People have no idea what it would mean to lose this magnificent hydrological system."" So what is driving deforestation in each of the Amazon nations, how much primary forest have they lost and what are their governments doing? The fires which started in Bolivia in May 2019 destroyed almost two million hectares of forest, according to the Friends of Nature monitoring NGO. Half of that was in protected areas, known for their wide biodiversity. Environmentalists say Evo Morales' government has promoted deforestation with policies of selling land in the Amazon region to businessmen and distributing it to farmers. The expansion of the farming frontier is mainly to encourage soya planting and cattle raising, in the hope of building exports for the Chinese market. In August 2019, Mr Morales celebrated the first beef exports to China from Santa Cruz. The same region was responsible for nearly half of Bolivia's soya production in 2018 and was most affected by the fires last year. In response to criticism during the fires crisis, Morales halted land sales in Santa Cruz for what he called ""an ecological pause"". We asked the Bolivian environment ministry about its strategy to reduce deforestation, but have had no response. Brazil received international acclaim for the drop off in deforestation between 2004 and 2014 - an accumulated fall of 80% in almost 10 years. But the loss of forest has once again started to rise. In November 2019, the government published data confirming expert predictions: that between the middle of 2018 and the middle of 2019, deforestation in the Amazon had increased 30% in relation to the previous year. They had cleared around 980,000 hectares (9,800 sq km), the largest area of forest cut down since 2008. And these figures don't take into account August 2019, when Amazon fires were at their worst. President Jair Bolsonaro's government claimed the fires were down to the dry season. But investigations by IPAM and the Federal University of Acre found otherwise. According to their report, the Amazon fires are directly related to deforestation. ""After felling the trees, they leave it to dry for a few months then set fire to it to clear the vegetation. The land is then used to plant grass and create pastures,"" says Erika Berenguer. According to the FAO, 80% of tree loss in Brazil is directly or indirectly related to cattle farming. Brazil is the largest beef exporter in the world. It makes up 7% of the country's GDP and 4.6% of exports. Today, around 40% of the country's cattle is raised in Amazon states. But that is only part of the story. Around 60 million hectares of the Brazilian Amazon are considered public areas, or rather they have no legal purpose defined by the government. They are not conservation areas, nor indigenous territories, for example. People clear this land, cut the trees down and put cattle on them, it's the cheapest way to occupy them, says Stabile. A patch of land without trees is worth more on the market. The next step in the chain is to illegally obtain a title deed for the land and sell it, says Mr Stabile. They then find another patch of forest and start again. The land is often sold to large-scale farmers and it is hard to tell which was cleared legally and what wasn't. The same happens in Colombia, Peru and Ecuador. According to Mr Stabile and other investigators, Brazil could double or triple its number of cattle without felling another hectare of the Amazon rainforest. ""What's happening is land speculation,"" he says. ""If the government defined these public areas, it would cease to be lucrative."" Environmentalists and investigators say statements and policies from Bolsonaro's government are encouraging clearances and the persecution of indigenous people. Although the government denies this, the president has said he wants to end the ""industry of environmental taxes"" and believes the country has too many conservation areas. The government also wants to allow mining on land belonging to indigenous tribes. Between January and September 2019, attacks and invasions of indigenous people's land increased 40% on the previous year. The finger of blame is pointed at those involved in land clearance, logging and mining. However, as the coronavirus crisis took hold in May, around 4,000 troops were mobilised in the Amazon against illegal logging and other activities until June, although that could be extended into the dry season to help with fire prevention. Environment Minister Ricardo Salles said the coronavirus outbreak had ""aggravated"" the situation this year. President Bolsonaro, however, has spoken against punitive measures taken against loggers and miners - such as the destruction of their equipment when it can't be taken out of the forest. Critics say that sends a message that the government is on their side. In 2017, the level of deforestation in Colombia was one of the biggest in the Amazon region and the highest in the country's history. More than 140,000 hectares of forest was cleared, twice the previous year's total. This peak was a result of the peace accord with Farc rebels in 2016, which left a power vacuum in forested areas. Community leaders said Farc had acted as a type of environmental police, controlling when farmers were allowed to clear the forest or burn for agriculture or cattle farming. ""Government officials wouldn't come near the Amazon region because of Farc, who, for their own protection, had an interest in keeping the trees standing. So the rebels could establish strict rules,"" said Rodrigo Botero, director of Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development. However, Colombia is now facing a race to clear land in the Amazon led by large-scale farmers, local authorities, drug dealers and other paramilitary groups such as the ELN, says Botero. There is a market for land and the government can't stop it, he says. The Colombian government formed a National Council for the Fight against Deforestation in an attempt to tackle the issue. The group works to identify pockets of deforestation, the causes and what action is needed, according to the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development. Laws passed in 2018 made the protection of water, biodiversity and the environment priority issues in matters of national security. The government can now intervene to protect areas in the Amazon national park from illegal activities. They are also carrying out military operations against people clearing land and launching programmes which promote financial incentives for conservation. By 2018, Colombian had lost around 11.7% of its original forest - 14% of which was in the previous eight years. But there are signs the efforts are paying off. In 2019, there was a significant fall in the loss of primary forest - although the level of deforestation was still higher than any year on record before the peace agreement. In the north of Ecuador, palm oil production is the main threat to the Amazon, experts say. The oil is used worldwide in the industrialised production of food such as chocolate, cosmetics, cleaning products and fuels. Ecuador is the second biggest producer of palm oil in Latin America, and the sixth worldwide. The expansion of palm oil and cocoa plantations in the last 10 years is the main driver of deforestation, according to Global Forest Watch and Maap. This is particularly worrying because despite only covering about 2% of the Amazon biome, Ecuador has one of the most diverse parts of the forest. In just one hectare of the YasunÃ­ park area, you'll find 670 tree species - more than in the whole of North America. Furthermore, according to a study by the country's National Institute of Biodiversity, between 40% and 60% of the species of trees in Ecuador's Amazon region are still unknown. Mining projects and oil exploration in the Amazon have also made headline news in Ecuador. One such project is Mirador, an open mine for copper, gold and silver which will be built in two Amazon provinces. It is the biggest project of its type in Ecuador - but not the only one. The government says industrial mining in the region, carried out by a Chinese company, will be responsible and the income generated will allow investment in infrastructure locally. However, investigators believe the activity could bring with it serious problems to the Amazon. ""As well as deforestation, we don't know exactly where they are going to put the dams nor how they are going to monitor them,"" said Carmen Josse, scientific director of the EcoCiencia Foundation. We asked Ecuador's government about their strategy to prevent mining contributing to deforestation - but they have not responded. French Guiana soldiers search for illegal miners Around 75% of it is virgin forest, which has had little or no intervention by humans, according to Global Forest Watch in 2016. Among the Amazon territories it has the largest percentage of forest in protected areas - almost 50% - and the lowest levels of deforestation. However, representatives of native people and environmentalists are worried by the advance of legal and illegal mining, encroaching on the protected zones. At the start of 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron suspended a gold mining megaproject within the Guianan Amazon National Park, which he had initially approved at the start of his tenure. The suspension was the result of national and international campaigns. Despite this, illegal mining is the main threat to the park. Security forces have detected an increase in the number of illegal mines in the area since 2017. With a population of less than 300,000 people, French Guiana has between 8,000 and 10,000 illegal miners. The rising price of gold since the 2008 financial crisis has sparked a rush to find the metal in the forests of the world. ""Most of the time, they're poor kids from Brazil looking for easy money. They live in the forest for months and months,"" explained Captain Vianney, who is leading the Foreign Legion's operations against gold mining. We asked the ministry of French overseas territories about the government's strategy to combat deforestation but they have not replied. Ninety five per cent of Guyana is covered by the Amazon. The country proposes two ways of treating the forest which, for many, seem irreconcilable. On the one hand, it is looking for a way of exploiting it economically while at the same time selling itself as a Green State that protects the Amazon. The annual rate of deforestation in Guyana is the lowest in the region - 0.051% in 2018, according to government figures. Part of its success is due to strategies such as the creation of a forest management commission, which decides which trees can or cannot be cut down. However, legal felling controlled by the government is still considered a factor that enables deforestation. According to environmentalists, licences for large international logging companies create access to virgin forest which illegal miners take advantage of. Guyana's Forestry Commission says it has not opened any new areas of the forest for legal felling since 2015. In fact, some areas were taken back off the companies who had licences to exploit them and they have become conservation areas, the government said. Illegal mining - mainly gold - is to blame for 85% of the forest loss, according to the Forestry Commission. Gold is the country's main export. The government says it has a ""Green State development strategy"" for the country which includes more investment in ecotourism and renewable energy, stricter limits on CO2 emissions and increasing forest conservation. All this is funded by international agreements to preserve the Amazon and the discovery of huge oil reserves at sea. Small scale agriculture has traditionally been the main cause of deforestation in Peru. Recently, however, cultivation of palm oil, cocoa and coca are catching up. A 2018 study found that despite making up only 4% of crops in the Amazon, palm oil was responsible for 11% of deforestation between 2007 and 2013. The oil is used worldwide to produce food, cosmetics and fuel. After some palm oil producers were fined for deforestation, they started to buy land from small farmers who had already cleared the forest illegally, says Sandra Rios, geographical engineer with the Instituto de Bien Comun (IBC Peru). We have asked Peru's environment minister about their strategy to prevent deforestation - but they have not responded. Illegal gold mining poses an increasing risk to the Peruvian Amazon. Peru is the biggest exporter of gold in Latin America, and the sixth worldwide. However, experts say up to 25% of its annual production comes from illegal mining. Since 2006, Peru has been experiencing a new gold rush in the Tambopata Nature Reserve, one of the most biodiverse in the region, driven by rising gold prices and the construction of the Brazil-Peru Transoceanic Highway. The road, from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic, not only makes travelling easier, it also opens up previously inaccessible areas of the forest. The group of miners in the area, known as the La Pampa, has grown to have more than 5,000 members. The miners strip the vegetation from the Amazon soil to look for gold. They use mercury to separate the precious metal from others, poisoning the waters and local animals in the process. In 2017, the loss of forest as a result of mining reached its highest level since 1985, according to the Center for Amazonian Scientific Innovation (Cincia). In March 2019, the government declared a state of emergency for 60 days to carry out military operations against miners in la Pampa. With almost 94% of its territory within the Amazon, Suriname is one of the countries with the best track record of conservation in biome. However, since 2012 Suriname has recorded an increase in the loss of forest, mainly as a result of gold mining. Between 2000 and 2014, the extent of mining areas, generally on a small scale industrial or artisanal mines, increased by 893%, according to the Foundation for Forest Management and Production Control. The government foundation says mining is responsible for 73% of the country's deforestation. Suriname is 10th in the world for gold production relative to its size. And that's without mentioning illegal mining. Most illegal mining takes place in remote areas of the forest, far from the authorities. It is believed that up to 60% of the gold miners in Suriname  are Brazilians who cross the border illegally. In some of the larger areas belong to indigenous tribes or descendents of slaves, mining has become the main source of income for families. There are no current official figures available for deforestation in Venezuela, but monitoring by local and international scientists show forest loss has increased in the last few years - especially since the creation of the Orinoco Mining Arc. With the dramatic fall in oil prices and production in Venezuela since 2014, the Maduro government has focused its attention at states rich in minerals - such as the Amazon. Venezuela has the sixth largest natural gold reserve in the world, with around 7,000 tonnes. The mining arc, created in 2016, allowed licences for mining precious metals such as gold, diamonds and coltan (a combination of columbite and tantalite used in the production of mobile phones) across an area of 112,000 sq km, about 12% of the country. The area also covers natural landmarks, forest reserves, an Amazon national park and at least four designated indigenous territories. ""The Orinoco zone is traditionally a mining area, even the indigenous people did it,"" says ecologist PelÃ¡ez, from the NGO Provita. ""But the law, in some ways, legalised forms of mining that were already in place and did not help reduce activity. This has had an enormous impact on the environment and the local population."" Maduro's plan was to grant concessions to foreign mining companies which would have to form businesses together with state-owned companies in order to operate in the area. In practice, according to Mr PelÃ¡ez, this resulted in an exponential growth in small-scale mining. In 2018 alone, according to the Central Bank of Venezuela, the state bought 9.2 tonnes of gold on the internal market - the same as the total amount for 2011-2017. It's having a devastating effect on the region. ""The gold that is there is of very poor quality, it's dirty,"" says Mr PelÃ¡ez. ""The amount that is coming out of the ground is very small."" Mining is producing tonnes of sediment that is accumulating in the country's main rivers. The use of mercury to separate gold from impurities, is poisoning rivers and indigenous people. Venezuela has the most illegal mines in the Amazon, according to a study by Raisg. There are 1,899 illegal mines, concentrated in the Orinoco mining arc. In the midst of Venezuela's political crisis, the National Assembly tried to repeal the law that created the Orinoco Mining Arc and even labelled it ""ecocide"" or a crime against the environment. We've asked three government ministries about the strategy to reduce deforestation in the zone, but none have responded.

"Centrepoint, a homeless charity supporting under-25s in England, has seen a 36% increase in people seeking support since lockdown began. The charity, and young people who spoke to the BBC, say that some councils are failing them during the Covid-19 crisis.Â âStay at home, protect the NHS, save lives,â goes the slogan. But what if you donât have a home? âYour grandparents were called to war, you were called to sit on the sofa,â goes another saying. But what happens if other peopleâs sofas were the only thing keeping you off the streets? For many homeless young people, sofa surfing is the only way of keeping a roof over their heads, staying with different friends for days or weeks at a time, while they seek support and work out their next move. While the government has stopped landlords evicting tenants until the end of June, thereâs no protection from being thrown out by your parents or friends. Quin, 24, was sofa surfing at her friendâs parentsâ house when Boris Johnson announced on 23 March that the UK was going into lockdown. She couldnât move to another house because it wasnât allowed - not that anyone else was offering to take her in. But she was already beginning to feel that she had overstayed her welcome. Quin keeps all her possessions next to the sofa bed. They are lined up, still in the bin bags that she brought them in six months ago. When she's looking for something to wear to her job as a carer she carefully rifles through the black sacks â ensuring that the room stays exactly how it was before she started to crash there. She says the difficulty of sofa surfing is âjust not knowing where my home is, not having anywhere to call homeâ. âI donât feel comfortable, because Iâm sleeping in my friend's old bedroom. I work from 6am onwards some days, so we canât always share the room because he keeps me awake. Then I feel guilty that Iâm kicking my friend out of his own bedroom.â It then takes Quin an hour and a half, and three buses, to get to work. Then it takes another five minutes to put on the PPE that she hopes will protect the people sheâs caring for, and herself. As well as looking after people with mental disabilities, her new tasks now include deep cleaning the home twice a day and cutting hair.Â When she finishes her longest shift at 21:30 she starts another virtual flat viewing. For the last six months she has just about managed to save enough, from the Â£8.50 she earns an hour, to put down a deposit somewhere. So far 20 private landlords in Sutton have turned her down. One message from an agent read: âIâve just spoken to the landlord and unfortunately she has said that her and her husband want to pull out. Due to the virus she does not feel comfortable having tenants in the property who are in a line of work affected. Iâve tried to reason with her but she isnât open to discuss.â On 14 May, Quin was asked to leave the house where sheâs been staying and given two weeksâ notice. In a weekâs time, against the backdrop of a global pandemic, she has no idea where sheâll be sleeping. Family breakdown and job losses are two causes of youth homelessness that have increased during the current crisis. Homeless charity Centrepoint told the BBC that from the start of lockdown to the end of April,1,314 young people contacted to ask for help, compared with 838 in the same period last year - an increase of 36%. Some weeks the helpline for England has seen an increase of over 50% in under-25s seeking homelessness support.Â Centrepoint told the BBC it is âabsolutely stretchedâ and requires access to the Covid-19 charity funding to help cope with the increased demand. However, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government has still not published the criteria outlining who is eligible to apply, Centrepoint says. Two leading youth charities, Llamau in Wales and Housing Rights in Northern Ireland, told the BBC that over the last two months they have seen a 50% increase in the volume of calls. Nicole, 24, was sitting in her hotel room when she spoke to the BBC. Every few minutes the music from outside her door would be too loud for Zoom to pick up her voice - giving an insight into what life has been like in her council-provided hotel for the homeless. On 22 February, Nicole visited West Suffolk Council to tell them she was going to be evicted from her home and was at risk of becoming homeless, but she was warned that there was a âsevere shortage of homesâ. On 6 March she began sofa-surfing with a friend, but like Quin, Nicole works at a care home - and her friend, who has diabetes, asked Nicole to move out. Overnight, despite now being designated a key worker, Nicole was facing the possibility of sleeping rough.Â With no other alternative, she set up a tent in her grandmotherâs back garden, making sure not to go into the house in order to keep her grandmother safe. âIt was cold but at the end of the day at least I was somewhere safe and not actually out on the streets. âI had to go into work early and shower... I do a lot of hours, so one day Iâll be doing earlies and the next one Iâm doing late shifts, so the variation of shifts was quite hard with not being able to sleep at night because of the cold.â Nicole says the council knew she would become homeless from 6 March but did not reach out to her when the pandemic was declared. Instead, when news broke of the governmentâs pledge to house all homeless people, Nicole contacted the council. Five days later, on 30 March, she was put up in a local hotel thanks to the government-funded Everyone In scheme - though she was warned the contract for her room was for 12 weeks only. The offer read: âAs you do not meet priority need, we would only be able to accommodate you due to the Covid-19 crisis, so this would be on a temporary basis.â After weeks of camping, Nicole was âover the moonâ when she first moved into the hotel. âThe place is really nice. Itâs got a nice garden. I actually had a bed to sleep in,"" she says. But when more people started to arrive things quickly changed. She says she informed the council that other residents are not always socially distancing. âDrugs are a constant thing every dayâ, and the loud music has been keeping her from sleeping before her long shifts as a carer. Since February, Nicole has bid for about 30 different council properties in areas near her work. Which bid is accepted depends on the biddersâ housing needs, and as Nicole is not seen as a priority case by the council, it is unlikely she will be able to secure one.Â Youâre usually seen as a priority case if you have children under 16, are considered vulnerable or have a serious health condition. She says the council wants her to consider a room in shared accommodation, but she is resisting this.Â âThe first time I lived in it, in the middle of the night the man who owned the house came into my room and tried to sleep with me. I was the one that got kicked out.â The next time she found out the landlord had been secretly filming her. âEven when I moved into the hotel room, I was checking all the light bulbs, checking in the fire alarms, and all the lampshades [for a camera]. âThey're still trying to push me to go to a shared accommodation. Itâs a bit messed up,â she says. Nicole, who was diagnosed with bipolar in 2015, says her depression has been worsening during her stay at the hotel. Her biggest worry is ending up on the streets when her 12-week contract on the council-provided hotel room is up. The council could not confirm whether or not it would extend her stay. âIâm so unsettled here - the fact that I have no idea whatâs going to happen to me after all this, itâs constantly on my mind. Everyoneâs wishing for lockdown to finish and as much as I do in regards to people dying, I donât want it to end because I have somewhere to live.â A West Suffolk Council spokesperson said: âWe donât comment on individual cases but we continue to support people who are homeless during Covid-19 and at other times. Nationally there is a shortage of housing and we know that it is difficult, particularly for young people.â When the government outlined the Everyone In policy, providing Â£3.2bn of funding to local authorities, it pledged to house rough sleepers throughout the coronavirus crisis.Â Since then it says more than 5,000 rough sleepers have been moved into hotels by councils. But Paul Brocklehurst, Senior Helpline Manager at Centrepoint, says there is still a âcontinuous streamâ of young people becoming homeless - some who are being turned away by their councils. Paul acknowledges the great steps that have been taken with the ban on evictions and the housing of entrenched rough sleepers, but says that it does not cover everyone, for example the newly homeless. âYoung people that are newly homeless arenât always getting that treatment. Councils are saying, âThe hotels that we booked are all completely full, we simply donât have the space and resources any more.â âWe're seeing an increase in young people being kicked out and lots of young people very close to being rough sleeping.â Paul says that councils often fail to provide adequate help when thereâs a family breakdown, and regularlyrequire proofthat a young person who has been thrown out by their parents is no longer welcome there.Â âSometimes we see that the parents say to the council, âYes, we'll take them back,â but say to the kid, âNo, you're not coming back.â That doesn't always result in the council supporting the young person.âÂ One 20-year-old told the BBC that despite the pandemic, Bristol City Council asked him to contact his abusive and transphobic family for proof he was homeless. Later officials said he couldnât be housed because he did not have a âlocal connectionâ to the area. Another category that Paul Brocklehurst says have received little help are the âhidden homelessâ who find temporary solutions such as sofa surfing in insecure accommodation. Research by the charity Crisis indicates that about 62% of single homeless people are hidden and may not show up in official government figures.Â Before her friendâs parents asked her to leave their house, Quin had been homeless twice. After leaving her abusive family home, with a scar etched across her forehead, she started to stay with friends. For three years she sofa surfed every few weeks while she did her qualifications. âIâd finish college and go sit in a local Costa for hours on end, using their free Wi-Fi, just to finish my college work because I didnât know where Iâd sleep that night. âIt was just horrific, but Iâm glad I got through it.â After being turned away twice by two different councils, one of which offered her a train ticket back to her abusive mum, Quin says she has given up on going to the council for help. âI thought I was finally getting better, getting over everything thatâs ever happened to me. My abusive ex and my suicide attempt. And then coronavirus happened. I just feel so hopeless.â Quin is on the waiting list for mental health treatment, but she will have to start the process again when she moves. Quin says that while clapping for carers is a good thing, without a pay rise many people like her will continue to struggle. She still doesnât know where sheâll be in two weeks. Now Quin is considering setting up an Only Fans account to sell nude photos, to make enough money to have somewhere safe to stay before she becomes homeless. âItâs something I really donât want to do but I think if itâs getting to the point where Iâm going to need more money, it's something that I canât not do. âDoes anyone want to see the Only Fans of someone thatâs just trying not to be homeless and failing?â A Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government spokesperson said: âThis government is committed to ending rough sleeping. Councils should be proud of their efforts to get rough sleepers off the street â support from central government has ensured 90% of rough sleepers known to councils at the start of the pandemic have been offered accommodation. Weâve been clear councils must continue to provide safe accommodation - backed by an unprecedented Â£3.2bn package of government support. âWe know that young people leaving the care system can be particularly at risk of homelessness. That is why the government has provided Â£3.2m per annum to 47 local authorities with the highest numbers of care leavers. Our youth advisers are working closely with local authorities on the particular challenges that young people and care leavers are facing during COVID-19.â Quin is a pseudonym Illustrations by Emma Lynch What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires, and what caused them?

He also continued his calls for Mr Cummings to resign, stating his position as âcompletely untenableâ. The Labour Party has also called for an investigation. Dr Jenny Harries, England's deputy chief medical officer, says, across all of the UK, demand for mechanical ventilator beds in hospitals has come down. She says that 12% of such beds are occupied with Covid-19 patients - meaning there is now ""significant capacity"" available. Dr Harries says that deaths are starting to come down and that, over a rolling seven-day average, it is continuing to come down. She says that the UK is maintaining a downward trend in new confirmed cases.

McDade's Coaches, like many similar firms across Scotland, is facing ""almost impossible choices"" as it struggles to deal with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. He toldBBC Scotland's The Ninehe will have to turn down a council payment for school transport contracts in order to keep his staff employed using the furlough scheme. Since mid-March, he is the only one of 39 people at the company who has not been furloughed.

"Democratic White House candidate Joe Biden is in damage limitation mode after saying African Americans ""ain't black"" if they even consider voting for President Donald Trump over him. Gaffe-prone Mr Biden made the remark in an interview on Friday with a prominent black radio host, Charlamagne Tha God, about his outreach to black voters. Mr Biden later expressed regret for the ""cavalier"" comment. The black vote has been key to the Biden candidacy. Throughout the 18-minute interview, Mr Biden, 77, stressed his longstanding ties to the black community, noting his overwhelming win this year in South Carolina's presidential primary, a state where the Democratic electorate is more than 60% African American. Will Joe Biden's record come back to haunt him? Biden bid to take on Trump gets major boost Black and voting for Donald Trump ""I won every single county. I won the largest share of the black vote that anybody had, including Barack,"" he said of President Barack Obama, the country's first African-American president, who picked Mr Biden as his running mate. The presumptive nominee for November's election also ""guaranteed"" that several black women were being considered to serve as his vice-president. He has already committed to selecting a woman to join him on the Democratic ticket. Toward the end of the interview, a campaign aide interrupted to say the former vice-president was out of time. When an aide for Mr Biden tried to end the interview, Charlamagne protested, saying: ""You can't do that to black media."" ""I do that to white media and black media,"" Mr Biden replied, adding that his wife was waiting to use their home broadcast studio. This video can not be played The biggest myth about the 'black vote' Charlamagne urged Mr Biden to return for another interview, saying he had more questions. ""If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black,"" Mr Biden responded. Charlamagne's nationally syndicated Breakfast Club show reaches more than 8 million listeners each month. Joe Biden just touched a live electrical wire of racial identity in US politics. Until now his support among black voters has been rock-solid, and there's little chance Friday's line will do much by itself to dent that. The Trump campaign will be happy, however, if they can chip away even a sliver of Mr Biden's support, particularly in key electoral states like Wisconsin and Michigan, where black voter apathy hurt Democrats in 2016. Mr Biden's gaffe came at the end of an interview, as he was being pressed on whether he favoured Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar over a black woman as his running mate. That he responded with indignation - and then veered dangerously off-script - suggests his preference might lie with someone like Ms Klobuchar, who shares Mr Biden's pragmatic political sensibilities. If Friday's kerfuffle has staying power, however, he might feel compelled to pick a black female candidate like Kamala Harris or Stacey Abrams - if only to clean up the mess he created. Biden campaign adviser Symone Sanders defended the comments on Friday, saying they were made ""in jest"". ""Let's be clear about what the VP was saying: he was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump's any day. Period."" Mr Biden scrambled to make amends on a call later to black business leaders. ""I should not have been so cavalier,"" he said. ""I've never, never, ever taken the African American community for granted."" He added: ""I shouldn't have been such a wise guy."" He continued: ""No-one should have to vote for any party based on their race, their religion, their background."" Mr Biden's resounding win among black voters in South Carolina healed seal his status as presumptive nominee The Trump campaign seized on the remarks, which senior campaign adviser Katrina Pierson described as ""racist and dehumanising"". ""He truly believes that he, a 77-year-old white man, should dictate how black people should behave,"" she said. Her comment was echoed by Senator Tim Scott, a black Republican. ""That is the most arrogant, condescending comment I've heard in a very long time,"" he told on Fox News. ""He's saying that 1.3 million African Americans, that you're not black? Who in the heck does he think he is?"" the South Carolina lawmaker said, referring to the black Americans who voted for Mr Trump in 2016. Mr Biden's words also provoked criticism from his side of the aisle. Mr Biden often references his record as Barack Obama's running mate. Keith Boykin, a former aide to Democratic President Bill Clinton, tweeted: ""Yes, Biden is a much better choice for black people than racist Trump. ""But white people don't get to tell black people what is black. Biden still has to EARN our vote."" Derrick Johnson, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), told CBS News that Mr Biden could not ""take the African-American vote for granted"". One disappointed black voter's response went viral. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

America knows Joe Biden as the vice-president to the first black president in history. Mr Obama endorsed him last month, saying in a video that Mr Biden ""has all the qualities we need in a president right now"". A Quinnipiac University poll released this week showed Mr Biden's support among black voters at a stunning 81%, compared with 3% for Mr Trump. The remainder said they didn't know. A former Senate aide who accuses Mr Biden of sexual assault has been dropped as a client by a prominent lawyer who has represented several #MeToo cases. Tara Reade says Mr Biden attacked her in a Senate hallway in 1993. On Thursday, attorney Douglas Wigdor said his office's decision was no reflection on Ms Reade's credibility, and he accused the media of trying to victim-shame her. It came as questions were raised about Ms Reade's past. A spokesperson for Antioch University in Seattle told the New York Times that she did not receive a degree from the university, though she had listed one on her CV. She also claimed to have been a legislative assistant to Mr Biden. But she was actually a staff assistant - a more junior role. However, Seattle University confirmed to Politico that Ms Reade did have a law degree from there. Lawyers in legal cases in which she testified as an expert witness on domestic violence are reportedly now seeking to reopen them on the grounds that her credentials could have been faked.

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak today. We'll have another update for you on Sunday. Dominic Cummingstravelled from London to County Durhamduring lockdown while he had coronavirus symptoms, it has emerged, sparking calls for his resignation. Pressure is mounting on No 10 to provide a ""very swift explanation"" regarding the actions ofBoris Johnson's chief aide, who visited his parents' home some 260 miles away. Police have said thatspitting attacks on officerscould be behind a national rise in assaults on emergency workers during lockdown, with figures showing a 14% increase in incidents in one month compared with last year. Such assaults had made colleagues ""really wary"" while on patrol, one officer said. There will be arise in the number of businessesthat will not pay their quarterly rent bills which are due at the end of June, accountancy firm EY has said. Since lockdown, non-payment of commercial rent has become widespread, with the Coronavirus Act temporarily banning landlords from evicting tenants if they fail to pay their rent. Leadenhall Market There has been a 36% increase in young peopleseeking support since lockdown began,homeless charity Centrepoint, which supports under 25s in England, has found. Young people and the charity said that homeless youths, such as those who rely on ""sofa-surfing"" to stay off the streets, are being failed by councils. Lockdown measures have forced millions of people to spend more time at home, andthousands of Lego-buildershave taken advantage of this additional time indoors to create stop-motion movies and models of real-life construction. From James Bond scenes to Glastonbury's iconic Pyramid Stage, the creations have brought comfort - and entertainment - to many holed up at home.

Here's a round-up of today's main developments:  And a reminder that quite a few of us worked to bring the latest to you today, including: David Walker, Robert Greenall, Steven Sutcliffe, Jonathan Jurejko, Deirdre Finnerty, George Wright, Matthew Henry, Matthew Cannon, George Bowden, Jennifer Scott, Victoria Lindrea, Sarah Collerton, and Paulin Kola.  Renowned Tunisian philosopher and anthropologist Youssef Seddik says he hopes the pandemic will usher in a new way of thinking - and a new way to use language. In an interview with AFP news agency in Tunis, he said his time in lockdown had changed him ""by making me think about words, about sayings that were self-evident and that we thought were automatic"". ""For example: killing time. What is time killed? It is no longer positive,"" he said. ""Confinement must change our automatic response to language and force us to reflect more, to no longer trust the obvious and ready-made formulas."" He added: ""Perhaps we are about to inaugurate another way of thinking, rather like when we went from the Middle Ages to the Age of Reason."" The screen will show 200 fans at a time Video calls have become an increased part of everyday life for many people during lockdown. And the coronavirus crisis has seen football forced into a big change, with matches having to be played without supporters. So Danish club AGF Aarhus has brought them both together in an attempt to create a unique atmosphere at their stadium. They are installing a giant screen along the side of the pitch, creating what theycall ""the world's first virtual grandstand"". There will even be a section for away fans. ""The players will see that they have the support from the city even though there are no supporters in the stands,"" said the project's co-ordinator Soren Carlsen. This video can not be played The coronavirus pandemic has had a devastating impact on the global tourism industry.

In the US city of Las Vegas, which has been built around tourism, 160,000 hotel rooms are sitting empty. Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak has set 4 June as a target date to reopen casinos and although the city's employees are glad to be going back to work, some are awaiting reassurances that they will be safe. With the professional tennis tours on hold until at least August because of the coronavirus pandemic, domestic and regional tournaments appear to be the future - in the short-term, at least - for the world's top players. Tournaments in Germany and the United States have already been played - without spectators, line judges, ball kids or handshakes. And more are set to follow around the globe. Serbia's Novak Djokovic, the men's world number one, has set up a Balkan-based tournament which starts on 13 June and will feature Austria's world number three Dominic Thiem and Bulgaria's Grigor Dimitrov. Scottish doubles player Jamie Murray is planning an exhibition event for the leading British men next month, while the British National Championships - featuring men, women, junior and wheelchair events - willreturn at ""some point this year"". The President of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, has announced that the country's religious, cultural and historic sites will reopen on Sunday as it eases restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus. The move coincides with the Eid celebrations that mark the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Mr Rouhani urged pilgrims visiting shrines to avoid mass gatherings and observe social distancing. A decision on the reopening of mosques across the country is due to be announced next week. Iran says more than 7,000 people have so far died from Covid-19, but the number is believed to be much higher. US Surgeon General Jerome Adams - the country's top doctor - has taken to Twitter in an effort to clarify confusion over the use of masks and face coverings. ""Wearing a face covering has always been more about protecting your neighbor than protecting yourself,"" he tweeted. ""But the more people who wear them, the lower the likely spread and burden of Covid-19 in YOUR community. Whatâs good for your neighbor is also good for you in the long run!"" he added. ""For most people over the age of 2, wearing a mask is completely safe. As an anesthesiologist, I wear a mask all day long to protect my patients in the operating room."" See below for more on whether we should be wearing face masks. This video can not be played Should I wear a mask to stop coronavirus? A group of 40 churchgoers who attended a service after lockdown was eased in Germany earlier this month have contracted coronavirus, health officials say. Six of those infected were taken to hospital. The service was held on 10 May at a Baptist church in the city of Frankfurt. Church officials say they followed social distancing rules and disinfected the building ahead of the service. They have now reverted to online worship. At least 16 of the cases were detected in Hanau, east of Frankfurt.  As
a result, the town has called off a prayer
gathering that Muslim leaders had organised for this Sunday. Dominic Cummings should be sacked by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson for travelling almost 260 miles to be near family members during lockdown, says the Scottish National Party's Westminster leader Ian Blackford. ""It is quite shocking. We've had no acceptance that what he did was wrong,"" Blackford told the BBC News Channel. ""It is obvious this is a journey which was unnecessary and has put at risk the whole public messaging that the UK government has delivered over the past few weeks. ""He should have resigned by now. There is no real defence and Dominic Cummings should be sacked by the prime minister."" The everyday sacrifices millions of us have made during the pandemic are illustrated by a self-isolating nurse who has been separated from her two-year-old son George for five weeks. Charlotte Cole, from Lancashire, took the ""hard decision"" to move George to her parents, who live five minutes away, after Covid-19 was confirmed at one of her workplaces. The 30-year-old and her husband have been making daily trips to see the toddler through a window ever since. Read morehere. Mercy JumaBBC Africa, Nairobi The chairs were placed at least 1m (3ft) apart - family sat on one side, church officials on the other. Everyone wore a mask. Everyone knew of the strict instructions that the Kenyan government had laid down for funerals during the coronavirus pandemic. Only 15 people could gather for the burial of my cousin, Chris, and everything had to be done by 09:00 local time. By 07:00 the rest of us had gathered, in front of our phones and computers, watching the burial unfold as a friend live-streamed it on Facebook. See here for more on how Mercy paid her final respects to her cousin Chris. A 53-year-old man from Wales has been jailed for 26 weeks for spitting at a police officer after claiming he had coronavirus. Darrell Glen Humphries admitted the assault when he appeared before Cardiff magistrates. It is the latest of a spate of similar incidents in the UK. Thames Valley Police, for example, said between March and April there were 198 assaults on police officers, 58 of which involved them being coughed, spat at or bitten. In Kent, police reported 196 assaults on officers in March and April, with nearly double the number of spitting incidents compared to last year. Italy has recorded 119 new deaths from the coronavirus, down from 130 on the previous 24 hours. New cases rose to 669, up from 652 on Friday, the Civil Protection Agency said. The overall death toll now stands at 32,735, the third highest in the world behind the US and the UK. Italy imposed a strict and lengthy lockdown on 7 March - initially in the north, then nationwide - with a ban on walking or exercising more than 200m (656ft) from home. In early May, some restrictions were relaxed and people are now able to travel for longer distances, as well as visit their relatives in small numbers. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent This video can not be played Shapps faces questions on Cummings' lockdown trip Ministers are rallying around Dominic Cummings and it's clear the PM does not want to lose a trusted adviser
with whom he first worked closely on the Vote Leave campaign. The hope is that this will be seen as a ""Westminster bubble"" story
and that the bubble will soon burst. Also, after a U-turn on the NHS surcharge for migrants this
week, No 10 will not want to look as though it is on the run. But this is an issue that has resonance way beyond
Westminster. Other parents will have been sick during the pandemic
and stuck to what they thought were the guidelines to self isolate for up to 14
days. So, the danger for the government isnât just the prospect of
political attacks from opponents. It is the perception the rules that apply in your street don't apply to Downing Street. And if No 10 are interpreting the guidelines flexibly enough
to allow people with Covid symptoms to travel substantial distances to isolate
away from their principal residence, the wider public may follow suit. That may, in turn, make the government's task of pushing the reproduction rate of the virus down all the more difficult. Today's UK government coronavirus briefing was held by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who was joined by Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England. Much of it was dominated by the news the PM's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, had travelled from London to County Durham during the lockdown to self-isolate near family. Here is what we learnt:   UK virus experts Prof Neil Ferguson (bottom left) and Dr Catherine Calderwood resigned from their roles, while government adviser Dominic Cummings (top left) and minister Robert Jenrick have defended their actions (top right) As we've been reporting, the UK Prime Minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is facing calls to resign after making a 260-mile trip to visit family during lockdown. Other public figures - charged with leading the country's response to the virus - have faced similar calls for other alleged breaches. Here are the most-prominent cases: Professor Neil Ferguson -resigned from his role as a key government adviserafter admitting that he had undermined social-distancing rules amid reports he meet his ""lover"" at his own home Dr Catherine Calderwood -resigned from her role as Scotland's chief medical officerin April after twice breaking lockdown restrictions to drive to her second home - about an hour from her Edinburgh property Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick -The cabinet ministerdefended his decision to travel from London to Shropshire, via his second home in Hertforshire, to visit his parents - saying he went to deliver food and medicine. At the Downing Street Brexit night party on 31 January, Johnson hailed Cummings as a âgeniusâ. The ""dishevelled rule-breaker"" who masterminded the Vote Leave campaign has become Boris Johnson's right-hand man. Many credit him with  ""getting Brexit done"" and detect his handiwork in the cabinet reshuffle which saw Sajid Javid resign as Chancellor. So just who is Dominic Cummings - and how did he become one of the most talked-about figures in contemporary British politics. Read more in our in-depth profile, first published in February.  Reality Check Social media is awash with posts containing fake and misleading information about the coronavirus pandemic. We've been fact-checking some of those claims most widely shared this week. So-called ""protective"" badges which ward off viruses are being sold around the world. Some of the badges, featuring a white cross design, appear to be of the type falsely marketed as ""virus stoppers"" in Russia. Some members of the Russian parliament wore them at a recent meeting of the State Duma. However, the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) says the substance released by such badges - the bleaching agent chlorine dioxide - is harmful. It says claims that it helps protect against Covid-19 are ""fraudulent"". See here for more fact-checking on Covid-19 cannabis treatment, virus origin speculation and claims of a ""mass execution"" in Yemen.  The Labour Party has called for an inquiry into Dominic Cummings' trip from London to County Durham during the UK's coronavirus lockdown. In a letter to Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill, Labour's Rachel Reeves says: âThe British people have made
important and painful sacrifices to support the national effort, including
being away from family in times of need. ""It is therefore vital that the government can reassure the public that its most senior figures have been
adhering to the same rules as everyone else.â The letter dissects anearlier statementfrom Downing Street - contrasting its words with those of government spokespeople, Boris Johnson and medical and scientific guidance. And it asks Sir Mark 10 questions, including when Johnson was made aware of his aide's trip to Durham. Reality Check Dominic Cummings, the PMâs top adviser, says he behaved âreasonably and legallyâ when he made a trip to an address in Durham at the end of March to be near relatives. He says it was because his wife had Covid-19 symptoms and he was worried about childcare if he became ill as well. The UK Governmentâsofficial advice,externalsays you shouldnât visit another property - whether for isolation purposes or holidays. But in law, the definition of a âreasonable excuseâ has never been clear.Read moreabout what powers the police have. Â© 2025 BBC.

A group of 40 churchgoers who attended a service after lockdown was eased in Germany earlier this month have contracted coronavirus, health officials say. Six of those infected were taken to hospital. The service was held on 10 May at a Baptist church in the city of Frankfurt. Church officials say they followed social distancing rules and disinfected the building ahead of the service. They have now reverted to online worship. At least 16 of the cases were detected in Hanau, east of Frankfurt.  As
a result, the town has called off a prayer
gathering that Muslim leaders had organised for this Sunday. Dominic Cummings should be sacked by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson for travelling almost 260 miles to be near family members during lockdown, says the Scottish National Party's Westminster leader Ian Blackford. ""It is quite shocking. We've had no acceptance that what he did was wrong,"" Blackford told the BBC News Channel. ""It is obvious this is a journey which was unnecessary and has put at risk the whole public messaging that the UK government has delivered over the past few weeks. ""He should have resigned by now. There is no real defence and Dominic Cummings should be sacked by the prime minister."" The everyday sacrifices millions of us have made during the pandemic are illustrated by a self-isolating nurse who has been separated from her two-year-old son George for five weeks. Charlotte Cole, from Lancashire, took the ""hard decision"" to move George to her parents, who live five minutes away, after Covid-19 was confirmed at one of her workplaces. The 30-year-old and her husband have been making daily trips to see the toddler through a window ever since. Read morehere. Mercy JumaBBC Africa, Nairobi The chairs were placed at least 1m (3ft) apart - family sat on one side, church officials on the other. Everyone wore a mask. Everyone knew of the strict instructions that the Kenyan government had laid down for funerals during the coronavirus pandemic. Only 15 people could gather for the burial of my cousin, Chris, and everything had to be done by 09:00 local time. By 07:00 the rest of us had gathered, in front of our phones and computers, watching the burial unfold as a friend live-streamed it on Facebook. See here for more on how Mercy paid her final respects to her cousin Chris. A 53-year-old man from Wales has been jailed for 26 weeks for spitting at a police officer after claiming he had coronavirus. Darrell Glen Humphries admitted the assault when he appeared before Cardiff magistrates. It is the latest of a spate of similar incidents in the UK. Thames Valley Police, for example, said between March and April there were 198 assaults on police officers, 58 of which involved them being coughed, spat at or bitten. In Kent, police reported 196 assaults on officers in March and April, with nearly double the number of spitting incidents compared to last year. Italy has recorded 119 new deaths from the coronavirus, down from 130 on the previous 24 hours. New cases rose to 669, up from 652 on Friday, the Civil Protection Agency said. The overall death toll now stands at 32,735, the third highest in the world behind the US and the UK. Italy imposed a strict and lengthy lockdown on 7 March - initially in the north, then nationwide - with a ban on walking or exercising more than 200m (656ft) from home. In early May, some restrictions were relaxed and people are now able to travel for longer distances, as well as visit their relatives in small numbers. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent This video can not be played Shapps faces questions on Cummings' lockdown trip Ministers are rallying around Dominic Cummings and it's clear the PM does not want to lose a trusted adviser
with whom he first worked closely on the Vote Leave campaign. The hope is that this will be seen as a ""Westminster bubble"" story
and that the bubble will soon burst. Also, after a U-turn on the NHS surcharge for migrants this
week, No 10 will not want to look as though it is on the run. But this is an issue that has resonance way beyond
Westminster. Other parents will have been sick during the pandemic
and stuck to what they thought were the guidelines to self isolate for up to 14
days. So, the danger for the government isnât just the prospect of
political attacks from opponents. It is the perception the rules that apply in your street don't apply to Downing Street. And if No 10 are interpreting the guidelines flexibly enough
to allow people with Covid symptoms to travel substantial distances to isolate
away from their principal residence, the wider public may follow suit. That may, in turn, make the government's task of pushing the reproduction rate of the virus down all the more difficult. Today's UK government coronavirus briefing was held by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, who was joined by Jenny Harries, the deputy chief medical officer for England. Much of it was dominated by the news the PM's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, had travelled from London to County Durham during the lockdown to self-isolate near family. Here is what we learnt:   UK virus experts Prof Neil Ferguson (bottom left) and Dr Catherine Calderwood resigned from their roles, while government adviser Dominic Cummings (top left) and minister Robert Jenrick have defended their actions (top right) As we've been reporting, the UK Prime Minister's chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, is facing calls to resign after making a 260-mile trip to visit family during lockdown. Other public figures - charged with leading the country's response to the virus - have faced similar calls for other alleged breaches. Here are the most-prominent cases: Professor Neil Ferguson -resigned from his role as a key government adviserafter admitting that he had undermined social-distancing rules amid reports he meet his ""lover"" at his own home Dr Catherine Calderwood -resigned from her role as Scotland's chief medical officerin April after twice breaking lockdown restrictions to drive to her second home - about an hour from her Edinburgh property Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick -The cabinet ministerdefended his decision to travel from London to Shropshire, via his second home in Hertforshire, to visit his parents - saying he went to deliver food and medicine. At the Downing Street Brexit night party on 31 January, Johnson hailed Cummings as a âgeniusâ. The ""dishevelled rule-breaker"" who masterminded the Vote Leave campaign has become Boris Johnson's right-hand man. Many credit him with  ""getting Brexit done"" and detect his handiwork in the cabinet reshuffle which saw Sajid Javid resign as Chancellor. So just who is Dominic Cummings - and how did he become one of the most talked-about figures in contemporary British politics. Read more in our in-depth profile, first published in February.  Reality Check Social media is awash with posts containing fake and misleading information about the coronavirus pandemic. We've been fact-checking some of those claims most widely shared this week. So-called ""protective"" badges which ward off viruses are being sold around the world. Some of the badges, featuring a white cross design, appear to be of the type falsely marketed as ""virus stoppers"" in Russia. Some members of the Russian parliament wore them at a recent meeting of the State Duma. However, the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) says the substance released by such badges - the bleaching agent chlorine dioxide - is harmful. It says claims that it helps protect against Covid-19 are ""fraudulent"". See here for more fact-checking on Covid-19 cannabis treatment, virus origin speculation and claims of a ""mass execution"" in Yemen.  The Labour Party has called for an inquiry into Dominic Cummings' trip from London to County Durham during the UK's coronavirus lockdown. In a letter to Cabinet Secretary Mark Sedwill, Labour's Rachel Reeves says: âThe British people have made
important and painful sacrifices to support the national effort, including
being away from family in times of need. ""It is therefore vital that the government can reassure the public that its most senior figures have been
adhering to the same rules as everyone else.â The letter dissects anearlier statementfrom Downing Street - contrasting its words with those of government spokespeople, Boris Johnson and medical and scientific guidance. And it asks Sir Mark 10 questions, including when Johnson was made aware of his aide's trip to Durham. Reality Check Dominic Cummings, the PMâs top adviser, says he behaved âreasonably and legallyâ when he made a trip to an address in Durham at the end of March to be near relatives. He says it was because his wife had Covid-19 symptoms and he was worried about childcare if he became ill as well.

"Centrepoint, a homeless charity supporting under-25s in England, has seen a 36% increase in people seeking support since lockdown began. The charity, and young people who spoke to the BBC, say that some councils are failing them during the Covid-19 crisis.Â âStay at home, protect the NHS, save lives,â goes the slogan. But what if you donât have a home? âYour grandparents were called to war, you were called to sit on the sofa,â goes another saying. But what happens if other peopleâs sofas were the only thing keeping you off the streets? For many homeless young people, sofa surfing is the only way of keeping a roof over their heads, staying with different friends for days or weeks at a time, while they seek support and work out their next move. While the government has stopped landlords evicting tenants until the end of June, thereâs no protection from being thrown out by your parents or friends. Quin, 24, was sofa surfing at her friendâs parentsâ house when Boris Johnson announced on 23 March that the UK was going into lockdown. She couldnât move to another house because it wasnât allowed - not that anyone else was offering to take her in. But she was already beginning to feel that she had overstayed her welcome. Quin keeps all her possessions next to the sofa bed. They are lined up, still in the bin bags that she brought them in six months ago. When she's looking for something to wear to her job as a carer she carefully rifles through the black sacks â ensuring that the room stays exactly how it was before she started to crash there. She says the difficulty of sofa surfing is âjust not knowing where my home is, not having anywhere to call homeâ. âI donât feel comfortable, because Iâm sleeping in my friend's old bedroom. I work from 6am onwards some days, so we canât always share the room because he keeps me awake. Then I feel guilty that Iâm kicking my friend out of his own bedroom.â It then takes Quin an hour and a half, and three buses, to get to work. Then it takes another five minutes to put on the PPE that she hopes will protect the people sheâs caring for, and herself. As well as looking after people with mental disabilities, her new tasks now include deep cleaning the home twice a day and cutting hair.Â When she finishes her longest shift at 21:30 she starts another virtual flat viewing. For the last six months she has just about managed to save enough, from the Â£8.50 she earns an hour, to put down a deposit somewhere. So far 20 private landlords in Sutton have turned her down. One message from an agent read: âIâve just spoken to the landlord and unfortunately she has said that her and her husband want to pull out. Due to the virus she does not feel comfortable having tenants in the property who are in a line of work affected. Iâve tried to reason with her but she isnât open to discuss.â On 14 May, Quin was asked to leave the house where sheâs been staying and given two weeksâ notice. In a weekâs time, against the backdrop of a global pandemic, she has no idea where sheâll be sleeping. Family breakdown and job losses are two causes of youth homelessness that have increased during the current crisis. Homeless charity Centrepoint told the BBC that from the start of lockdown to the end of April,1,314 young people contacted to ask for help, compared with 838 in the same period last year - an increase of 36%. Some weeks the helpline for England has seen an increase of over 50% in under-25s seeking homelessness support.Â Centrepoint told the BBC it is âabsolutely stretchedâ and requires access to the Covid-19 charity funding to help cope with the increased demand. However, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government has still not published the criteria outlining who is eligible to apply, Centrepoint says. Two leading youth charities, Llamau in Wales and Housing Rights in Northern Ireland, told the BBC that over the last two months they have seen a 50% increase in the volume of calls. Nicole, 24, was sitting in her hotel room when she spoke to the BBC. Every few minutes the music from outside her door would be too loud for Zoom to pick up her voice - giving an insight into what life has been like in her council-provided hotel for the homeless. On 22 February, Nicole visited West Suffolk Council to tell them she was going to be evicted from her home and was at risk of becoming homeless, but she was warned that there was a âsevere shortage of homesâ. On 6 March she began sofa-surfing with a friend, but like Quin, Nicole works at a care home - and her friend, who has diabetes, asked Nicole to move out. Overnight, despite now being designated a key worker, Nicole was facing the possibility of sleeping rough.Â With no other alternative, she set up a tent in her grandmotherâs back garden, making sure not to go into the house in order to keep her grandmother safe. âIt was cold but at the end of the day at least I was somewhere safe and not actually out on the streets. âI had to go into work early and shower... I do a lot of hours, so one day Iâll be doing earlies and the next one Iâm doing late shifts, so the variation of shifts was quite hard with not being able to sleep at night because of the cold.â Nicole says the council knew she would become homeless from 6 March but did not reach out to her when the pandemic was declared. Instead, when news broke of the governmentâs pledge to house all homeless people, Nicole contacted the council. Five days later, on 30 March, she was put up in a local hotel thanks to the government-funded Everyone In scheme - though she was warned the contract for her room was for 12 weeks only. The offer read: âAs you do not meet priority need, we would only be able to accommodate you due to the Covid-19 crisis, so this would be on a temporary basis.â After weeks of camping, Nicole was âover the moonâ when she first moved into the hotel. âThe place is really nice. Itâs got a nice garden. I actually had a bed to sleep in,"" she says. But when more people started to arrive things quickly changed. She says she informed the council that other residents are not always socially distancing. âDrugs are a constant thing every dayâ, and the loud music has been keeping her from sleeping before her long shifts as a carer. Since February, Nicole has bid for about 30 different council properties in areas near her work. Which bid is accepted depends on the biddersâ housing needs, and as Nicole is not seen as a priority case by the council, it is unlikely she will be able to secure one.Â Youâre usually seen as a priority case if you have children under 16, are considered vulnerable or have a serious health condition. She says the council wants her to consider a room in shared accommodation, but she is resisting this.Â âThe first time I lived in it, in the middle of the night the man who owned the house came into my room and tried to sleep with me. I was the one that got kicked out.â The next time she found out the landlord had been secretly filming her. âEven when I moved into the hotel room, I was checking all the light bulbs, checking in the fire alarms, and all the lampshades [for a camera]. âThey're still trying to push me to go to a shared accommodation. Itâs a bit messed up,â she says. Nicole, who was diagnosed with bipolar in 2015, says her depression has been worsening during her stay at the hotel. Her biggest worry is ending up on the streets when her 12-week contract on the council-provided hotel room is up. The council could not confirm whether or not it would extend her stay. âIâm so unsettled here - the fact that I have no idea whatâs going to happen to me after all this, itâs constantly on my mind. Everyoneâs wishing for lockdown to finish and as much as I do in regards to people dying, I donât want it to end because I have somewhere to live.â A West Suffolk Council spokesperson said: âWe donât comment on individual cases but we continue to support people who are homeless during Covid-19 and at other times. Nationally there is a shortage of housing and we know that it is difficult, particularly for young people.â When the government outlined the Everyone In policy, providing Â£3.2bn of funding to local authorities, it pledged to house rough sleepers throughout the coronavirus crisis.Â Since then it says more than 5,000 rough sleepers have been moved into hotels by councils. But Paul Brocklehurst, Senior Helpline Manager at Centrepoint, says there is still a âcontinuous streamâ of young people becoming homeless - some who are being turned away by their councils. Paul acknowledges the great steps that have been taken with the ban on evictions and the housing of entrenched rough sleepers, but says that it does not cover everyone, for example the newly homeless. âYoung people that are newly homeless arenât always getting that treatment. Councils are saying, âThe hotels that we booked are all completely full, we simply donât have the space and resources any more.â âWe're seeing an increase in young people being kicked out and lots of young people very close to being rough sleeping.â Paul says that councils often fail to provide adequate help when thereâs a family breakdown, and regularlyrequire proofthat a young person who has been thrown out by their parents is no longer welcome there.Â âSometimes we see that the parents say to the council, âYes, we'll take them back,â but say to the kid, âNo, you're not coming back.â That doesn't always result in the council supporting the young person.âÂ One 20-year-old told the BBC that despite the pandemic, Bristol City Council asked him to contact his abusive and transphobic family for proof he was homeless. Later officials said he couldnât be housed because he did not have a âlocal connectionâ to the area. Another category that Paul Brocklehurst says have received little help are the âhidden homelessâ who find temporary solutions such as sofa surfing in insecure accommodation. Research by the charity Crisis indicates that about 62% of single homeless people are hidden and may not show up in official government figures.Â Before her friendâs parents asked her to leave their house, Quin had been homeless twice. After leaving her abusive family home, with a scar etched across her forehead, she started to stay with friends. For three years she sofa surfed every few weeks while she did her qualifications. âIâd finish college and go sit in a local Costa for hours on end, using their free Wi-Fi, just to finish my college work because I didnât know where Iâd sleep that night. âIt was just horrific, but Iâm glad I got through it.â After being turned away twice by two different councils, one of which offered her a train ticket back to her abusive mum, Quin says she has given up on going to the council for help. âI thought I was finally getting better, getting over everything thatâs ever happened to me. My abusive ex and my suicide attempt. And then coronavirus happened. I just feel so hopeless.â Quin is on the waiting list for mental health treatment, but she will have to start the process again when she moves. Quin says that while clapping for carers is a good thing, without a pay rise many people like her will continue to struggle. She still doesnât know where sheâll be in two weeks. Now Quin is considering setting up an Only Fans account to sell nude photos, to make enough money to have somewhere safe to stay before she becomes homeless. âItâs something I really donât want to do but I think if itâs getting to the point where Iâm going to need more money, it's something that I canât not do. âDoes anyone want to see the Only Fans of someone thatâs just trying not to be homeless and failing?â A Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government spokesperson said: âThis government is committed to ending rough sleeping. Councils should be proud of their efforts to get rough sleepers off the street â support from central government has ensured 90% of rough sleepers known to councils at the start of the pandemic have been offered accommodation. Weâve been clear councils must continue to provide safe accommodation - backed by an unprecedented Â£3.2bn package of government support. âWe know that young people leaving the care system can be particularly at risk of homelessness. That is why the government has provided Â£3.2m per annum to 47 local authorities with the highest numbers of care leavers. Our youth advisers are working closely with local authorities on the particular challenges that young people and care leavers are facing during COVID-19.â Quin is a pseudonym Illustrations by Emma Lynch What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires, and what caused them?

On 22 February, Nicole visited West Suffolk Council to tell them she was going to be evicted from her home and was at risk of becoming homeless, but she was warned that there was a âsevere shortage of homesâ. On 6 March she began sofa-surfing with a friend, but like Quin, Nicole works at a care home - and her friend, who has diabetes, asked Nicole to move out. Overnight, despite now being designated a key worker, Nicole was facing the possibility of sleeping rough.Â With no other alternative, she set up a tent in her grandmotherâs back garden, making sure not to go into the house in order to keep her grandmother safe. âIt was cold but at the end of the day at least I was somewhere safe and not actually out on the streets. âI had to go into work early and shower... I do a lot of hours, so one day Iâll be doing earlies and the next one Iâm doing late shifts, so the variation of shifts was quite hard with not being able to sleep at night because of the cold.â Nicole says the council knew she would become homeless from 6 March but did not reach out to her when the pandemic was declared. Instead, when news broke of the governmentâs pledge to house all homeless people, Nicole contacted the council. Five days later, on 30 March, she was put up in a local hotel thanks to the government-funded Everyone In scheme - though she was warned the contract for her room was for 12 weeks only. The offer read: âAs you do not meet priority need, we would only be able to accommodate you due to the Covid-19 crisis, so this would be on a temporary basis.â After weeks of camping, Nicole was âover the moonâ when she first moved into the hotel. âThe place is really nice. Itâs got a nice garden. I actually had a bed to sleep in,"" she says. But when more people started to arrive things quickly changed. She says she informed the council that other residents are not always socially distancing. âDrugs are a constant thing every dayâ, and the loud music has been keeping her from sleeping before her long shifts as a carer. Since February, Nicole has bid for about 30 different council properties in areas near her work. Which bid is accepted depends on the biddersâ housing needs, and as Nicole is not seen as a priority case by the council, it is unlikely she will be able to secure one.Â Youâre usually seen as a priority case if you have children under 16, are considered vulnerable or have a serious health condition. She says the council wants her to consider a room in shared accommodation, but she is resisting this.Â âThe first time I lived in it, in the middle of the night the man who owned the house came into my room and tried to sleep with me. I was the one that got kicked out.â The next time she found out the landlord had been secretly filming her. âEven when I moved into the hotel room, I was checking all the light bulbs, checking in the fire alarms, and all the lampshades [for a camera]. âThey're still trying to push me to go to a shared accommodation. Itâs a bit messed up,â she says. Nicole, who was diagnosed with bipolar in 2015, says her depression has been worsening during her stay at the hotel. Her biggest worry is ending up on the streets when her 12-week contract on the council-provided hotel room is up. The council could not confirm whether or not it would extend her stay. âIâm so unsettled here - the fact that I have no idea whatâs going to happen to me after all this, itâs constantly on my mind. Everyoneâs wishing for lockdown to finish and as much as I do in regards to people dying, I donât want it to end because I have somewhere to live.â A West Suffolk Council spokesperson said: âWe donât comment on individual cases but we continue to support people who are homeless during Covid-19 and at other times. Nationally there is a shortage of housing and we know that it is difficult, particularly for young people.â When the government outlined the Everyone In policy, providing Â£3.2bn of funding to local authorities, it pledged to house rough sleepers throughout the coronavirus crisis.Â Since then it says more than 5,000 rough sleepers have been moved into hotels by councils. But Paul Brocklehurst, Senior Helpline Manager at Centrepoint, says there is still a âcontinuous streamâ of young people becoming homeless - some who are being turned away by their councils. Paul acknowledges the great steps that have been taken with the ban on evictions and the housing of entrenched rough sleepers, but says that it does not cover everyone, for example the newly homeless. âYoung people that are newly homeless arenât always getting that treatment. Councils are saying, âThe hotels that we booked are all completely full, we simply donât have the space and resources any more.â âWe're seeing an increase in young people being kicked out and lots of young people very close to being rough sleeping.â Paul says that councils often fail to provide adequate help when thereâs a family breakdown, and regularlyrequire proofthat a young person who has been thrown out by their parents is no longer welcome there.Â âSometimes we see that the parents say to the council, âYes, we'll take them back,â but say to the kid, âNo, you're not coming back.â That doesn't always result in the council supporting the young person.âÂ One 20-year-old told the BBC that despite the pandemic, Bristol City Council asked him to contact his abusive and transphobic family for proof he was homeless. Later officials said he couldnât be housed because he did not have a âlocal connectionâ to the area. Another category that Paul Brocklehurst says have received little help are the âhidden homelessâ who find temporary solutions such as sofa surfing in insecure accommodation. Research by the charity Crisis indicates that about 62% of single homeless people are hidden and may not show up in official government figures.Â Before her friendâs parents asked her to leave their house, Quin had been homeless twice. After leaving her abusive family home, with a scar etched across her forehead, she started to stay with friends. For three years she sofa surfed every few weeks while she did her qualifications. âIâd finish college and go sit in a local Costa for hours on end, using their free Wi-Fi, just to finish my college work because I didnât know where Iâd sleep that night. âIt was just horrific, but Iâm glad I got through it.â After being turned away twice by two different councils, one of which offered her a train ticket back to her abusive mum, Quin says she has given up on going to the council for help. âI thought I was finally getting better, getting over everything thatâs ever happened to me. My abusive ex and my suicide attempt. And then coronavirus happened. I just feel so hopeless.â Quin is on the waiting list for mental health treatment, but she will have to start the process again when she moves. Quin says that while clapping for carers is a good thing, without a pay rise many people like her will continue to struggle. She still doesnât know where sheâll be in two weeks. Now Quin is considering setting up an Only Fans account to sell nude photos, to make enough money to have somewhere safe to stay before she becomes homeless. âItâs something I really donât want to do but I think if itâs getting to the point where Iâm going to need more money, it's something that I canât not do. âDoes anyone want to see the Only Fans of someone thatâs just trying not to be homeless and failing?â A Ministry of Housing, Communities & Local Government spokesperson said: âThis government is committed to ending rough sleeping. Councils should be proud of their efforts to get rough sleepers off the street â support from central government has ensured 90% of rough sleepers known to councils at the start of the pandemic have been offered accommodation. Weâve been clear councils must continue to provide safe accommodation - backed by an unprecedented Â£3.2bn package of government support. âWe know that young people leaving the care system can be particularly at risk of homelessness. That is why the government has provided Â£3.2m per annum to 47 local authorities with the highest numbers of care leavers. Our youth advisers are working closely with local authorities on the particular challenges that young people and care leavers are facing during COVID-19.â Quin is a pseudonym Illustrations by Emma Lynch What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires, and what caused them?

One of Belgium's old water mills has been working flat out to meet the needs of the new wannabe bakers. Miller Adrienne Delacroix, whose mill in the Ardennes region has been producing flour for six centuries, said: ""We've witnessed an explosion in demand from individuals"". Ms Delacroix believes the love of baking will continue after the pandemic is over. ""I think the crisis has also brought home
the importance of eating local produce.""  BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast has been speaking to Amanda, who was sleeping rough in Manchester city centre before the coronavirus pandemic. During the lockdown, thousands of homeless people have been helped into homes and shelters, and Amanda was given a room in a Holiday Inn. She said on the first night âI think I slept for two daysâ. Amanda said the security of having a room is something thatâs made a huge difference to a lot of people. This video can not be played Amanda got a room in the lockdown, after sleeping rough Some parks in Paris have reopened but many others are closed A mysterious lock-picker has been unlocking parks in Paris for local residents to use during lockdown. Many parks are currently closed in the French capital and, amid good weather and the easing of other restrictions, the government has resisted calls from the mayor to open them. Instead, a man, who has revealed himself as ""Jose"" to a local newspaper, has been unlocking the parks in poorer areas of the city at night. Two handwritten posters hanging from the railings of the Parc de Belleville on Friday read ""Thank you, Jose!"". The closure of parks has been an increasingly controversial topic in France with police forced to clear open lawns in central Paris of twice in recent days. Cyprus is to reopen its airports to commercial flights from 9 June. The reopening will start by allowing flights from 20 countries, the country's transport minister announced. People arriving from those countries will be required to produce evidence of a negative coronavirus test from within the previous 72 hours. The UK and Russia are not part of the first group, due to the government believing Covid-19 has not been sufficiently contained in the two countries, which are the biggest markets for Cyprus tourism. The Endeavour launched in 2011 from Florida's Cape Canaveral SpaceX and Nasa are urging spectators to stay away from next Wednesday's rocket launch on Florida's Space Coast. But officials in Brevard County, home of the Kennedy Space Center, hope the event will help boost tourism to the state, where visitor revenue is down sharply during the pandemic. In a news conference with reporters earlier this month, Nasa Administrator Jim Bridenstine noted that previous launches had brought hundreds of thousands of sightseers to Florida beaches. But Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey has actively encouraged visitors, as long as they practise social distancing. ""We are not going to keep the great Americans that want to come watch that from coming here,"" Ivey said. ""If Nasa is telling people to not come here and watch the launch, that's on them. I'm telling people what I believe as an American. And so Nasa has got their guidelines, and I got mine."" The 27 May launch of a SpaceX rocket with two astronauts aboard will be the first launch of astronauts from US soil since the end of the US space shuttle program in 2011. Dominic Cummings, a top adviser to PM Boris Johnson, travelled hundreds of miles from London to County Durham during the lockdown when he had virus symptoms, the BBC has been told. A source close to the PM's chief aide confirmed reports he and his wife went to his parents' home to self-isolate. But the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said she had been told Mr Cummings did not break government guidance because he and his wife stayed in a separate building. Labour said No 10 needed to provide a ""very swift explanation"" for Mr Cummings' actions. ""If accurate, the prime minister's chief adviser appears to have breached the lockdown rules. The government's guidance was very clear: stay at home and no non-essential travel,"" a spokesman said. ""The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings."" See here for more. The US state of Washington lost ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars to benefits scammers, officials there have acknowledged, as the number of workers laid off due to coronavirus continues to rise. The loss was disclosed by the state's Employment Security Department on Thursday. Last week, the US Secret Service warned that states were being targeted by a âwell-organised Nigerian fraud ring exploiting the COVID-19 crisis to commit large-scale fraud against state unemployment insurance programsâ adding up to âpotential losses in the hundreds of millions of dollarsâ. The agency added that there was also evidence of attacks in North Carolina, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Oklahoma, Wyoming and Florida, the Seattle Times reports. The news came on the same day that the federal government reported another 2.4m American workers filed for jobless benefits last week. In total, 38.6m unememployment claims have been filed in the past nine weeks. Reality Check Thereâs been interest in whether alcohol-based hand cleaners can
overheat and catch fire inside cars after a warning from a local fire service
in the US. TheFacebook post,externalappeared to suggest that a
bottle of hand sanitiser left inside a car led to a fire which burnt
the car door. But should we be worried about leaving hand sanitiser bottles in
our cars during hot weather? Alcohol-based products are flammable and there isguidance from the WHO,externalwhich advises them to be
stored safely - but it is very unlikely they would catch fire from hot weather
alone. There have been various reports of alcohol-based cleaning products
catching fire in different circumstances, but usually because theyâve been
spilled onto something or have been left too close to an open flame. Professor of Chemistry at Nottingham University, Steven Howdle
says: âUnless you have a lighted match or another ignition source in the car,
it is very unlikely there is going to be any problem with fire."" It's been one of the key questions behind the debate about reopening schools. This video looks at whether children can catch coronavirus - and whether they can spread it as well. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Can children catch and pass on coronavirus? Ikea will reopen 19 stores across England and Northern Ireland from 1 June, with new safety measures to ensure social distancing, the Swedish retailer says. The homewares chain said social distancing wardens will patrol the stores and the number of customers will be limited. Stores in Scotland, Wales and Ireland will remain closed, in line with government coronavirus guidance. Restaurants and play areas will remain closed, but the food market will reopen for customers to make food like Swedish meatballs at home. Ikea stores have reopened in several European countries including Belgium, Switzerland and Germany. Dan Smith from the band Bastille has told the BBC that he thinks the music industry needs to ""rethink"" how much artists are paid by online streaming sites. âThe money is there, itâs about how itâs distributed"" said the singer. ""I hope that across the music industry, and so many other things â looking at the NHS, and nurses and wages â I hope thereâs a real rethinking across the board of how people are remunerated and whatâs important.â Speaking to The Coronavirus Newscast, Smith said that although things were âuncertainâ now he hoped the industry would be more ""thoughtfulâ after the pandemic. Spotify said in a statement to the BBC that ""the vast majority of revenue generated is paid out to rights holders, including labels, publishing companies, and distributors"". Dan also talked about how the pandemic is having a tougher impact on smaller artists. âLike Spotify pointed out [in their statement to the BBC], the money is there, but I think the most important thing is not these huge artists who get to play arenas and get to play stadiums and headline festivalsâ¦ but it's smaller artists who I think are really, really suffering here and looking ahead of them and just totally questioning how they're going to pay rent and feed themselves.â People in England are being urged to stay away from tourism hotspots over the bank holiday weekend, with warm weather again forecast. Pictures of large numbers visiting beaches in Brighton and Southend in recent days have raised fears over social distancing, with no limit in place on how far people can travel. Visitors to Brighton will find stewards stationed around the beach to encourage physical distancing and direct people to less busy parts of the seafront if it becomes too busy. Councillor Carmen Appich, from Brighton & Hove City Council, said it would be an ""insult to the NHS staff and frontline workers"" to promote the city as a destination to visit. Hastings Borough Council says the area is ""closed to visitors from outside the town"" and on the Isle of Wight the council's ""clear advice"" is to stay away. People are also being advised not to visit Blackpool and have been asked to think twice before visiting the Peak District or Morecambe Bay. In Cornwall, council leaders have warned there is no lifeguard cover,  and a large coastal swell and spring tide will bring hazardous sea conditions over the weekend. The National Trust is urging people across England to stay close to home and explore local green spaces and countryside this weekend. Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, Home Secretary Priti Patel said people can enjoy the outdoors as long as they follow social distancing advice. The president of the Canadian Medical Association, which represents
physicians across the country, has called Canada's health-care system
""sick"" and is warning that a second wave of coronavirus could strike. Dr Sandy Buchman criticised the lack of personal protection equipment,
contact tracing and testing, and warned government officials they were
""gambling by reopening"". Dr Buchman was speaking before a Senate committee on Wednesday. ""We'd never permit a firefighter to go into a burning building without
adequate protection. We can't expect our frontline health care workers to put
themselves in harm's way,"" he said. Canadian labs have the capacity to process 60,000 tests a day, say public health
officials. But between 17 and 18 May, only about 23,000 tests were conducted. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has pledged to get PPE to the front lines, and
ramp up contract tracing. His warning is a sharp rebuke for a country that prides itself on its public
health-care system. White House coronavirus taskforce co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx was asked during a briefing about a large study of hydroxychloroquine, which found an increased risk of death for those taking it as a Covid-19 treatment. The Lancet study of 96,000 coronavirus patients found treatment with hydroxychloroquine - an anti-malaria drug - was also more likely to cause heart arrhythmia in patients. Dr Birx said the study revealed more about underlying health conditions, and said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ""has been very clear"" about their concerns in using the drug as a coronavirus prevention (as President Trump has said he is doing) or as a treatment course. Time to catch up on the latest developments: Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News A study of Covid-19 patients in hospitals has found no benefits to treating them with the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. In fact, the patients given the drug were more likely to die in hospital and develop heart rhythm complications than other Covid patients in a comparison group. Nearly 15,000 patients took the drug (or a related form chloroquine) either alone or with an antibiotic, in The Lancet study. The researchers warn that the drug - which is safe for treating malaria and diseases such as lupus and arthritis - should not be used outside of clinical trials. But US President Donald Trump has been taking it, despite warnings it might be unsafe. In a bid to find out more, a trial to see whether the anti-malarial drug could prevent Covid-19 is under way. More than 40,000 healthcare workers from Europe, Africa, Asia and South America who are in contact with patients with the disease will be given the drugs to see if they work. Opening day at the Minnesota State Fair The Minnesota State Fair - one of the largest state fairs in the US with over 2m annual visitors - will close for the first time since 1946. Back then it was cancelled due to a polio outbreak. ""This isnât a difficult decision. Itâs the only decision,"" Minnesota State Fair General Manager Jerry Hammer said. ""Itâs the right thing to do."" According to the fair website, it has been cancelled only six times in total since its founding in 1859. ""By taking the tough road today, we guarantee that the fairâs future remains hopeful and bright,"" Hammer said. ""We want to see you all for many years to come, when we can celebrate in true State Fair style."" Coronavirus has been blamed for the collapse into administration of travel company Specialist Leisure Group. About 2,500 jobs have been lost, and 64,000 bookings cancelled, as a result. The company, based in Wigan, Greater Manchester, specialised in breaks and events for the over 50s. The group included well-known coach holiday brands Shearings and National Holidays. The firm said on its website that all tours, cruises, holidays and hotel breaks had been cancelled and would not be rescheduled, and blamed the impact of coronavirus. Travel trade organisation Abta said the hotel and travel company had been ""significantly impacted"" by the pandemic.  Â© 2025 BBC.
