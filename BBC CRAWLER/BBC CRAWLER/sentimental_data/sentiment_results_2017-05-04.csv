"The Conservatives have made the biggest gains by a governing party in a local election for more than 40 years. With five weeks to go to the general election, they gained more than 500 seats and seized 11 extra councils. The gains mainly came at the expense of Labour, which came third in Scotland, and UKIP, which lost all of its seats. The Lib Dems failed to make headway. Polling expert John Curtice puts the Tories' national vote share at 38%, Labour 27%, Lib Dems 18% and UKIP 5%. Local elections: Latest updates Laura Kuenssberg: What results mean for Theresa May Iain Watson: What should Labour do now? Six key lessons for general election Conservative leader Theresa May sought to combat any complacency in her party's ranks by saying she was ""taking nothing for granted"" in 8 June's general election. Mrs May said she would be fighting every day of the next five weeks to ""earn the support of the British people"" to strengthen her hand in negotiations with the European Commission over Brexit. This video can not be played Theresa May responds to the Conservatives' success in the local elections Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party had done better than expected in some places, such as Cardiff and Swansea, but results elsewhere had been ""very disappointing"". ""Of course I'm disappointed, we have to get our supporters out to vote in June, we have to get our message across and I'm utterly determined to do that,"" he said. He insisted he was the right person to get Labour's message across to voters but conceded that Labour faced a challenge on a ""historic scale"" if it is to regain power. ""We know this is no small task,"" he said in a statement, ""but we, the whole Labour movement and the British people, can't afford not to seize our moment."" This video can not be played The Labour leader says the results in some areas are disappointing, but it isn't all bad news Polling expert John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said that if the council results were reflected at next month's general election, Theresa May would win a bigger majority - but probably not enough to get the landslide she was hoping for. The 11-point Tory lead over Labour in the projected national share is smaller than their 17% average lead in recent opinion polls, he added, but he cautioned against reading too much into the projections. Much could change in the coming weeks of what's likely to be a brutal general election campaign. Theresa May insists still that the vote could be close, warning her supporters not to take a majority for granted. The results don't translate necessarily into a big Tory win. But according to those who put crosses in a box on Thursday, the ground is prepared.

They also forced Labour into third place in its former stronghold of Scotland and won control of Monmouthshire in Wales. Their victories in English county council elections, where they gained control of Derbyshire, Norfolk, Warwickshire, Lincolnshire, Gloucestershire and the Isle of Wight, were fuelled by a collapse in the UKIP vote, as anti-EU supporters appeared to flock to Theresa May's party. Straw draw denies Tories control This video can not be played Labour has had disappointing results in the local and mayoral elections. Labour lost control of seven councils - including Glasgow, where it has held power for decades, and saw its number of seats go down by 382. It also lost the metro mayor contests in the West Midlands and Tees Valley, a traditional Labour heartland, to the Conservatives - but former cabinet minister Andy Burnham scored a big win in Greater Manchester. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell acknowledged that Labour had suffered a ""tough"" night, but insisted the results were not ""the wipe-out that some people expected"". There was still ""all to play for"" in the general election in just five weeks' time, he added, insisting ""we can close that gap"". Westminster hopeful loses council seat Voters in the West of England, Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City region, the West Midlands, Tees Valley, and Cambridge and Peterborough have elected ""metro mayors"" covering combined local authority areas. The Conservatives have won four out of the six new mayor posts. Labour former cabinet minister Andy Burnham has won Greater Manchester, with 63% of the vote - hailing it is a ""new era"" in British politics - and Steve Rotherham won for Labour in Liverpool. In the West Midlands, Conservative Andy Street, a former John Lewis boss, beat former Labour MP Sion Simon. Ben Houchen, who won Tees Valley for the Conservatives, said after defeating Labour's Sue Jeffrey: ""We are seeing a massive trend towards the Conservatives. We have started to turn the Tees Valley blue."" The mayors will mostly be responsible for economic development, but some will have powers over transport and housing. Tory elected West of England mayor New mayors elected on low turnout English mayoral candidates The SNP has replaced Labour as the biggest party in Glasgow, but fell short of a majority. And despite also replacing Labour as the largest party in Aberdeen, and finishing as comfortably the biggest party across the country, the SNP lost overall control of Dundee and Angus councils - the only two areas where it had won majorities in 2012. It was a strong night for the Conservatives, who increased their number of councillors by more than 130, including in areas that had previously been ""no-go"" for the party. SNP leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was a ""clear and emphatic"" victory for her party and a ""great springboard for the general election,"" saying the Tory gains were at the expense of Labour. But Labour's John McDonnell said the SNP had fallen back, a sign of the ""increasing rejection"" of the case for a second independence referendum. Conservatives make gains across Scotland Brian Taylor: Who's celebrating the results? It was a mixed picture for Labour in Wales, where it has been the dominant force in local government for decades. Labour lost control of Blaenau Gwent and Bridgend, and its leader in Merthyr Tydfil, but held seven councils. Wayne David said the Tories made fewer gains than expected as Welsh Labour was ""in touch with people's realities"". The highlight for the Conservatives was winning a majority in Monmouthshire, but they also made progress elsewhere, increasing their number of councillors by 80. Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies said his party made ""huge strides in the Vale of Glamorgan, doubled our representation in Wrexham, and reached double digits right in the backyard of the first minister [in Bridgend]"". Vaughan Gething, a member of the Labour government in Wales, said there was an ""awful lot of work"" for the party to do before the general election. He told Radio 4's Today there had been ""mixed messages"" on the doorsteps about Jeremy Corbyn but there had also been strong results - with his party ""turning back the Tory tide"" and managing to hold on to Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. Labour losses in Wales 'not so bad' This video can not be played UKIP's Peter Reeve maintains on Today his party is still leading the national agenda UKIP's foothold in local government achieved four years ago was wiped out, as the party lost 145 seats and made just one gain. In Lincolnshire, where UKIP had 16 councillors elected in 2013 and was the official opposition on the council, the party has lost all of its remaining 13 seats. It also lost all its seats in Warwickshire, Hampshire, Essex and the Isle of Wight, which were taken by the Conservatives. Former UKIP leadership contender Steven Woolfe said the party's influence was ""at an end"" and its former MP Douglas Carswell said ""it was over"". But party leader Paul Nuttall said UKIP, which did well in 2013 council elections and won 3.8 million votes in the 2015 general election, was a ""victim of its own success"". UKIP suffers big losses in council polls The Lib Dems increased their share of the vote by 7% but lost more than 40 seats. Lib Dem president Sal Brinton described her party's performance overall as ""patchy"", while former business secretary Vince Cable said there had been no ""spectacular breakthrough"". The Conservatives saw off the Lib Dems' challenge to hold on to Somerset County Council and in Cumbria, where party leader Tim Farron is hoping to be re-elected as MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, they failed to increase its representation. The Green Party gained six seats, while Plaid Cymru added 33 in Wales. Farron pledges to double Lib Dem MPs What's your reaction to the results?

"The polls have closed. These elections are a complicated set of local contests, some old, some new, some electing an individual to a position of great power, most, individual races in wards that make up only a few streets, for councillors who then group together to run our towns and cities. So as the results come in, from the early hours of Friday morning right through the day, what are we looking for? First, these are important elections in their own right, and the results make a big difference to decisions that are made on our behalves all round the country. Local authorities have significant powers over education, planning, local business rates for example, and the drift of government policy has been to give them more, not less. UKIP suffers big losses in council polls Analysis: Where the parties stand... so far Second, while you will hear my colleagues and me caution dozens of times in the next 24 hours that the results do not translate directly to the general election, they are a really significant barometer. Pay attention, therefore, to how the Conservative and Labour fight shapes up in areas like Nottinghamshire, or Derbyshire. Big Tory inroads will be a real worry for Labour as we hurtle towards the General Election. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map See results and latest news in your area See all results: EnglandScotlandWalesCymru The loss of Glasgow council to the SNP and falling back in Wales too seem feasible - and would again add to Jeremy Corbyn's party's anxieties about June. The elections will also be a test of whether the UKIP vote really does seem set to fade away now that we are heading for Brexit and, as it seems, Nigel Farage has taken his final bow. And the Lib Dems are crossing their fingers for signs of a comeback. To get their activists gingered up for the General Election they need signs of decent gains around the country. The elections of new metro mayors will also be big headlines - particularly in Birmingham where the two big parties are both desperate to win. It will be a long, and complicated day, and don't forget the caveats with which these results need to be coupled. But the most important test of all will be whether Labour loses or gains seats in England, in parts of the country where the General Election will really be decided. If they lose seats in England, that is a depressing indicator for any political party that wants to be seen to be on track for government May: Dinner row claim is Brussels gossip May hits out at EU LA firefighters to give update as wildfires destroy buildings and force thousands to flee Inside the neighbourhood totally lost in LA fires Starmer and Badenoch clash over call for grooming inquiry How Canada's immigration debate soured - and helped seal Trudeau's fate 'I can't get divorced as I can't get my pension valued' BBC Sound of 2025: Barry Can't Swim is a new dance music superstar Ros Atkins on...Elon Musk's political interventions A journalist's murder highlights risks of reporting in small-town India Jean-Marie Le Pen - founder of French far right and 'Devil of the Republic' Cases of HMPV are on the rise in China - but what is it?

"As voters go to the polls in local and mayoral elections, here's a guide to what's going on and where... Voting will take place from 07:00 to 22:00 BST on 4 May. Elections will be held in 34 councils in England, all 32 councils in Scotland and all 22 councils in Wales. In addition, six areas in England are voting for newly-created ""combined local authority mayors"". These mayors will mostly be responsible for economic development in their regions, but some will have powers over transport and housing. Doncaster and North Tyneside are also voting for local authority mayors, who are elected leaders of their respective councils. The Manchester Gorton parliamentary by-election triggered by the death of Labour MP Gerald Kaufman was also due to take place, but has now been delayed until the general election on 8 June.

There are also 687 independent councillors, with no party allegiances, whose seats are being contested. The rest of the total is made up of residents' association councillors and parties with a handful of representatives, including Cornish separatists Mebyon Kernow, who have four councillors. Some English and Welsh councils will begin counting ballots as soon as polls close at 22:00 BST. Others will start counting on Friday morning, with results continuing all day Friday. Scotland's 32 councils will start their counts on Friday morning, with first results expected from midday. Most mayoral results will be declared on Friday. There will be full live text and video coverage of the results as they come in on the BBC News website and on special BBC news programmes. You must be registered to vote, be at least 18 on polling day in England and Wales or 16 in Scotland, be resident in Britain and be British or a Commonwealth or a European Union citizen. To take part in the polls, voters had to be registered by midnight on Thursday, 13 April if living in England or Wales, and by Monday, 17 April if living in Scotland. It's too late to register for Thursday's local elections, but voters have until 22 May to take part in the general election on 8 June. For more information clickhere.,external Convicted prisoners, anybody found guilty of election corruption within the past five years. Members of the House of Lords and anyone subject to any legal incapacity to vote. If you are registered to vote you should have received a polling card telling you where you should go to cast your vote on Thursday.  You do not have to take the card with you when you go to vote. No form of identity is required. If your polling card hasn't arrived, contact the electoral services department at your local council. The deadline for asking for a postal vote from the electoral registration office at your local council has passed. If you have applied to vote by post, you cannot vote in person at the polling station. However, you can return your postal vote to the polling station before 22:00 BST, or to the returning officer at your local council before they close if you do not want to post it or it is too late to post it. See the Electoral Commission's guidelines forpostal voting.,external You can only apply for a long-term proxy vote if you have a specific reason such as a disability or being overseas. To vote by proxy for just one election, you must have a reason - for example you will be on holiday or away owing to work. The deadline to vote by proxy has already passed, but if you are suddenly incapacitated or taken ill, you can apply to vote by proxy for medical reasons up until 17:00 BST on polling day. As long as you are registered to vote in both places you can choose to vote at either your home address or your student address - or in both places if they are in different council areas. To help blind and partially sighted voters, there has to be a ""tactile device"" in each polling station and there are rules on the size of print on ballot papers. The vast majority of polling stations are now more accessible for wheelchair users. Proxy ballots are allowed for those unable to vote because of disability. A doctor's note is required if the person with disabilities is applying for an indefinite proxy vote.

No. People cannot be forced to vote and registration is not compulsory. Yes. The ballot papers contain a serial number and it is possible, but illegal, to trace all the votes to the people who cast them. The number is there to stop electoral fraud. Not all councils hold elections at the same time. All councillors are elected for a term of four years, but the four-year cycle of elections is different for different councils. This year it is the turn of all the English county councils, who last had elections in 2013, and seven other authorities. Next year will see elections to all the London boroughs and some of the smaller district councils. There are also some councils who elect a third of councillors each year for three out of the four-year cycle. Six new mayors are being elected to represent several regions of England. These mayors are being created as part of the government's drive to devolve more power to English regions. The mayors will serve and represent a number of local authorities in each region. Their exact powers vary according to the different agreements reached between local authorities and the government, but will mainly cover economic strategy, transport and planning. Local authority mayors are also being elected in Doncaster and North Tyneside. Mayors are elected using the Supplementary Vote system, which means voters choose first and second preferences for mayor. Candidates must be aged 18 or over and either be British or citizens of other European Union or Commonwealth countries. In addition, those standing in English council elections must be on the electoral register of the council concerned or must have lived in or worked in the council area within the past year. Those banned from standing in the elections include anyone employed by the local authority, bankrupts and people in a variety of politically restricted jobs.

All political parties have to be registered with the Electoral Commission if they want their names to appear on the ballot papers. The commission will need the names of three party officials and details of the party's financial structure. It can refuse to register a party if its name is confusingly similar to another party's or if the name is deemed offensive. The deadline has passed to register a political party for these elections. The top official of the local authority is the returning officer for the elections in each constituency, with the day-to-day running of the poll left to the head of the council's electoral registration office. They do not have to be - it is just convention. One theory about its origins is that people were not paid until Fridays and so holding polls on Thursdays ensured they were not too drunk to vote.

"This video can not be played Geraint at the Giro: how the Welshman could shine in Italy Geraint Thomas will venture into ""uncharted territory"" when he leads Team Sky in a Grand Tour for the first time at the Giro d'Italia. Thomas will share the leadership with Mikel Landa, having previously played a supporting role for his team-mates. The 100th edition of the Giro, one of cycling's three Grand Tours - alongside the Tour de France and Vuelta a Espana - starts in Sardinia on Friday. ""It's one of the biggest challenges of my career,"" said Briton Thomas, 30. ""I've got a massive few weeks in front of me. I'm just looking forward to racing now. It feels like we've been talking about it forever. ""It's uncharted territory really. I've always been helping other guys so if I do blow up now it doesn't really matter. Hopefully it all goes well."" This year's Giro will comprise agruelling, 21-stage route,starting in Alghero, Sardinia on Friday and ending in Milan on Sunday, 28 May. It will be Welshman Thomas' third appearance at the Giro and his 11th Grand Tour start, though his previous outings have been as a support rider for the likes of British three-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome. Thomas has shone in his role as 'super domestique' in cycling's showpiece events, while he has impressed as a leader in other races,winning the Tour of the Alps in Apriland Paris-Nice last year. ""Preparations have gone really well. I've got three wins this year which is certainly nice,"" the Cardiff-born rider told BBC Wales Sport. ""Being a support rider and a leader are two totally different things. I'm just relishing that opportunity and trying to make the most of it. ""It's been a long build-up and something I've been thinking about for a long time, so it will be good to get racing."" Nairo Quintana celebrates winning the Giro in 2014 If he is to claim the winner's Maglia Rosa (pink jersey) in Italy, Thomas must overcome some formidable competition. The favourite is Nairo Quintana, who won convincingly when he last appeared at the Giro in 2014. A former Vuelta champion and runner-up at the Tour de France, the 27-year-old Colombian is a renowned climber who is expected to be well suited to a demanding Giro route. However, the Movistar rider might be mindful of over-exerting himself as he keeps one eye on preparations for the Tour, which starts in July. Other leading candidates include defending champion Vincenzo Nibali, one of only six cyclists to have won all three of the Grand Tours. The 32-year-old Italian, nicknamed 'The Shark', won in dramatic circumstances last year as he capitalised on Dutchman Steven Kruijswijk's late crash to clinch his third Giro title. ""Nibali and Quintana have won this race before, they've got all that experience and, for sure, they're the favourites,"" said Thomas. ""Myself and Landa, we have a chance - but we're not at that level, I don't think."" Mikel Landa joins Thomas as joint Team Sky leader in the Giro Cycling teams tend to choose one rider to spearhead their Grand Tour campaigns, but Thomas will share his new role with Spaniard Landa. The 27-year-old finished third at the Giro in 2015 while riding for Astana and Thomas believes their styles will be well suited to each other. ""He's obviously a great climber. He's been third in this race before, he's got the experience, he's a great athlete and he'll certainly give us another card to play,"" Thomas added. ""We can ride off each other. We get on well and I think it can work well. As we get into that last week there will certainly be gaps and one will be ahead of the other. ""Depending on how we're both feeling, I'd happily help him and vice versa. We'll see how it goes.""

The double Olympic team pursuit champion was also shocked by thedeath of Italian cyclist Michele Scarponiin April, after the 37-year-old was involved in a collision with a van during a training ride. Scarponi, a former Giro champion, had finished fourth at the Tour of the Alps, which Thomas won earlier that month. Asked if his result at the Giro could define his career as a road cyclist, Thomas played down its significance given recent events. ""I don't think it would be a step backwards whatever happens. It's going to be a good challenge and, if it doesn't work out, then it doesn't work out,"" he said. ""What we've seen lately - what happened with Scarponi and I lost my auntie last week - it puts everything into perspective. ""It's a bike race, there's no point putting extra stress on it.

"The Conservatives have made the biggest gains by a governing party in a local election for more than 40 years. With five weeks to go to the general election, they gained more than 500 seats and seized 11 extra councils. The gains mainly came at the expense of Labour, which came third in Scotland, and UKIP, which lost all of its seats. The Lib Dems failed to make headway. Polling expert John Curtice puts the Tories' national vote share at 38%, Labour 27%, Lib Dems 18% and UKIP 5%. Local elections: Latest updates Laura Kuenssberg: What results mean for Theresa May Iain Watson: What should Labour do now? Six key lessons for general election Conservative leader Theresa May sought to combat any complacency in her party's ranks by saying she was ""taking nothing for granted"" in 8 June's general election. Mrs May said she would be fighting every day of the next five weeks to ""earn the support of the British people"" to strengthen her hand in negotiations with the European Commission over Brexit. This video can not be played Theresa May responds to the Conservatives' success in the local elections Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his party had done better than expected in some places, such as Cardiff and Swansea, but results elsewhere had been ""very disappointing"". ""Of course I'm disappointed, we have to get our supporters out to vote in June, we have to get our message across and I'm utterly determined to do that,"" he said. He insisted he was the right person to get Labour's message across to voters but conceded that Labour faced a challenge on a ""historic scale"" if it is to regain power. ""We know this is no small task,"" he said in a statement, ""but we, the whole Labour movement and the British people, can't afford not to seize our moment."" This video can not be played The Labour leader says the results in some areas are disappointing, but it isn't all bad news Polling expert John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said that if the council results were reflected at next month's general election, Theresa May would win a bigger majority - but probably not enough to get the landslide she was hoping for. The 11-point Tory lead over Labour in the projected national share is smaller than their 17% average lead in recent opinion polls, he added, but he cautioned against reading too much into the projections. Much could change in the coming weeks of what's likely to be a brutal general election campaign. Theresa May insists still that the vote could be close, warning her supporters not to take a majority for granted. The results don't translate necessarily into a big Tory win. But according to those who put crosses in a box on Thursday, the ground is prepared. Read Laura's blog in full Sorry, your browser cannot display this map The Conservatives gained more than 500 councillors and won closely fought battles for elected Metro Mayors in the West Midlands and Tees Valley. They also forced Labour into third place in its former stronghold of Scotland and won control of Monmouthshire in Wales. Their victories in English county council elections, where they gained control of Derbyshire, Norfolk, Warwickshire, Lincolnshire, Gloucestershire and the Isle of Wight, were fuelled by a collapse in the UKIP vote, as anti-EU supporters appeared to flock to Theresa May's party. Straw draw denies Tories control This video can not be played Labour has had disappointing results in the local and mayoral elections. Labour lost control of seven councils - including Glasgow, where it has held power for decades, and saw its number of seats go down by 382. It also lost the metro mayor contests in the West Midlands and Tees Valley, a traditional Labour heartland, to the Conservatives - but former cabinet minister Andy Burnham scored a big win in Greater Manchester. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell acknowledged that Labour had suffered a ""tough"" night, but insisted the results were not ""the wipe-out that some people expected"". There was still ""all to play for"" in the general election in just five weeks' time, he added, insisting ""we can close that gap"". Westminster hopeful loses council seat Voters in the West of England, Greater Manchester, the Liverpool City region, the West Midlands, Tees Valley, and Cambridge and Peterborough have elected ""metro mayors"" covering combined local authority areas. The Conservatives have won four out of the six new mayor posts. Labour former cabinet minister Andy Burnham has won Greater Manchester, with 63% of the vote - hailing it is a ""new era"" in British politics - and Steve Rotherham won for Labour in Liverpool. In the West Midlands, Conservative Andy Street, a former John Lewis boss, beat former Labour MP Sion Simon. Ben Houchen, who won Tees Valley for the Conservatives, said after defeating Labour's Sue Jeffrey: ""We are seeing a massive trend towards the Conservatives. We have started to turn the Tees Valley blue."" The mayors will mostly be responsible for economic development, but some will have powers over transport and housing. Tory elected West of England mayor New mayors elected on low turnout English mayoral candidates The SNP has replaced Labour as the biggest party in Glasgow, but fell short of a majority. And despite also replacing Labour as the largest party in Aberdeen, and finishing as comfortably the biggest party across the country, the SNP lost overall control of Dundee and Angus councils - the only two areas where it had won majorities in 2012. It was a strong night for the Conservatives, who increased their number of councillors by more than 130, including in areas that had previously been ""no-go"" for the party. SNP leader and Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was a ""clear and emphatic"" victory for her party and a ""great springboard for the general election,"" saying the Tory gains were at the expense of Labour. But Labour's John McDonnell said the SNP had fallen back, a sign of the ""increasing rejection"" of the case for a second independence referendum. Conservatives make gains across Scotland Brian Taylor: Who's celebrating the results? It was a mixed picture for Labour in Wales, where it has been the dominant force in local government for decades. Labour lost control of Blaenau Gwent and Bridgend, and its leader in Merthyr Tydfil, but held seven councils. Wayne David said the Tories made fewer gains than expected as Welsh Labour was ""in touch with people's realities"". The highlight for the Conservatives was winning a majority in Monmouthshire, but they also made progress elsewhere, increasing their number of councillors by 80. Welsh Tory leader Andrew RT Davies said his party made ""huge strides in the Vale of Glamorgan, doubled our representation in Wrexham, and reached double digits right in the backyard of the first minister [in Bridgend]"". Vaughan Gething, a member of the Labour government in Wales, said there was an ""awful lot of work"" for the party to do before the general election. He told Radio 4's Today there had been ""mixed messages"" on the doorsteps about Jeremy Corbyn but there had also been strong results - with his party ""turning back the Tory tide"" and managing to hold on to Cardiff, Newport and Swansea. Labour losses in Wales 'not so bad' This video can not be played UKIP's Peter Reeve maintains on Today his party is still leading the national agenda UKIP's foothold in local government achieved four years ago was wiped out, as the party lost 145 seats and made just one gain. In Lincolnshire, where UKIP had 16 councillors elected in 2013 and was the official opposition on the council, the party has lost all of its remaining 13 seats. It also lost all its seats in Warwickshire, Hampshire, Essex and the Isle of Wight, which were taken by the Conservatives. Former UKIP leadership contender Steven Woolfe said the party's influence was ""at an end"" and its former MP Douglas Carswell said ""it was over"". But party leader Paul Nuttall said UKIP, which did well in 2013 council elections and won 3.8 million votes in the 2015 general election, was a ""victim of its own success"". UKIP suffers big losses in council polls The Lib Dems increased their share of the vote by 7% but lost more than 40 seats. Lib Dem president Sal Brinton described her party's performance overall as ""patchy"", while former business secretary Vince Cable said there had been no ""spectacular breakthrough"". The Conservatives saw off the Lib Dems' challenge to hold on to Somerset County Council and in Cumbria, where party leader Tim Farron is hoping to be re-elected as MP for Westmorland and Lonsdale, they failed to increase its representation. The Green Party gained six seats, while Plaid Cymru added 33 in Wales. Farron pledges to double Lib Dem MPs What's your reaction to the results?

" What is periodontal disease? Periodontal disease is caused by an inflammation of an animal’s teeth and gums.  It’s a surprisingly common condition, affecting over 87% of dogs and 70% of cats. Preventing it is essential to the health of your pet. How it develops Food particles and bacteria combine in the mouth to create plaque which, over time, transforms into calculus. Calculus allows more plaque to rapidly colonise the tooth surface. This causes gum irritation and leads to an inflammatory condition called gingivitis.  Persistent bad breath, known as halitosis, is a sign that your dog is likely to have gum disease, but you should also look out for a reddening of the gums directly bordering the teeth. Why it matters for your pet’s health Over time, the calculus and plaque migrate below the gum line, forcing it away from the tooth and allowing more bacteria to grow in the space.  In turn, the bone below the tooth retreats and further tissue destruction follows. At this stage bacteria from the mouth can move from the damaged gum into the blood stream, causing damage to the kidneys, liver and heart and shortening the life of your pet. How to prevent periodontal disease Cleaning your dog or cat’s teeth regularly is essential to prevent the build-up of plaque and prevent gum disease.  There are plenty of products available on the market to help you achieve this:  All of these products have been tested in laboratories by manufacturers before they are made available to buy in shops.  However, only some have been tested in clinical trials for effectiveness in reducing plaque build-up. Most of them have never been trialled in a home setting, nor have they been tested against each other to find out which is the most effective at keeping plaque at bay. Our Study We joined forces with leading veterinary dental specialist Norman Johnston and veterinary surgeon Ross Allan to test which of the following methods was most effective:  Method Three different groups of dog owners each used one of the three teeth-cleaning methods with their dogs, for 6 weeks. Our dogs were:  All dogs were recruited through owners volunteering to take part and were already registered with veterinary practice “Pets ‘n’ Vets”. All our dogs were seen by a pet dentist to have their teeth cleaned and polished before the study started, to allow valid comparisons of their dental health at the end. 27 dogs were enrolled on the study and were assigned at random to one of the three groups. Results Of the 27 enrolled, 22 dogs completed the trial. At the end of six weeks the 22 dogs returned to “Pets ‘n’ Vets” to have their teeth examined using plaque-disclosing fluid, which colours plaque on the teeth and gums.  Their teeth were given a final score based on how much plaque had built up during the trial. A dog with no plaque or calculus would have a mouth score of zero, so the lower the score, the better the result. Our study showed:  Tooth brushing resulted in a significantly lower average mouth score compared to dental kibble or dental chews, which both had similar results. Our study has shown that tooth brushing is the best way to keep your dog’s teeth free from plaque.  Based on this study and previous research, expert Norman Johnston declares tooth brushing the ‘gold standard’ for oral hygiene in both cats and dogs. The group of dog owners find out about canine teeth brushing",Positive,1.0

Selling fruit on a market stall instead of being at school, and being labelled a ""macho woman"" for playing football are experiences which have inspired BBC Women's Footballer of the Year 2017 nominee Marta to achieve success on and off the field. The Brazil captain, a five-time Fifa World Player of the Year, enjoyed one of the proudest moments in her career last year when she was one of her country's flag-bearers at her home Olympics in Rio. Becoming the most famous female footballer of the past 20 years is a dream she could never have imagined would come true when she was working to earn a wage as an 11-year-old. ""I used to sell fruit in the public market, once a week to help my family and it was not even our own fruit, it was someone else's,"" said the 31-year-old forward, who joined Orlando Pride in the United States in early April from Sweden's FC Rosengard. ""I worked selling clothes in street stands too. I think that's one of the things people do not believe I've done.

""My mum went through many difficulties with four children to raise. My father left her very early, I was less than one year old when he left. I would meet her only at night because of work and unfortunately we didn't have much time together. I saw that constant struggle and that inspired me a lot to get where I am now."" Despite her pride at flying the Brazilian flag in front of thousands of fans in Rio, the Olympics were tinged with disappointment for Marta as the hosts finished fourth after losing to Sweden on penalties in the semi-finals and then to Canada in the bronze-medal match. But she feels inspiring future generations was a huge positive from the Games. ""We constantly noticed the warmth of the fans all the time with us, the people stuck with us,"" she said. ""It was sad because we did not get the medal, but I think the biggest prize was that we realised in some way that the people were with us."" Living far from her family, Marta turns to puppy Candinho for support. ""When I lose he comes to welcome me happily, when I win he comes to welcome me happily. He is my life partner."" Many defences have been torn apart by her strong running, superb control and left foot but this might never have happened if she had not left home at the age of 14 to pursue her footballing career with Rio-based club Vasco da Gama. ""I remember I suffered a lot of discrimination and prejudice. It was constant; every day,"" she said. ""People would come to me and say: 'It's a boys' sport, you have to play with a doll.'

"Marcus Rashford also scored the winner in United's quarter-final against Anderlecht Marcus Rashford's superb free-kick gave Manchester United control of their Europa League semi-final against Celta Vigo. The 19-year-old striker's curling effort not only gave United the lead, but also a precious away goal going into next Thursday's second leg at Old Trafford. With United outside the Premier League's top four - a point behind Manchester City and four off third-placed Liverpool - the Europa League perhaps represents their best opportunity of earning a place in next season's Champions League. They looked to have spurned their best chances in northern Spain - three times they were denied in the first half by home goalkeeper Sergio Alvarez. As Celta improved, United's wastefulness seemed increasingly important, only for Rashford to produce the sort of quality needed to beat the excellent Alvarez. Returning home with an advantage, Jose Mourinho's side will be strong favourites to progress to faceAjax or Lyonin Stockholm on 24 May in the final of a competition they have never won. Man Utd boss Mourinho vows to rest players Nevin: 'Man Utd much better than Celta Vigo' - listen to 5 live Football Daily Listen: 'Rashford not a natural goalscorer' Relive Man Utd's win in Spain Rashford gave United the lead midway through the second half Rashford was one of the three United players thwarted by Alvarez in a first period the visitors had the better of. His arcing strike was heading for the top corner before Alvarez leapt to his left, with the Spaniard also stopping a surging Henrikh Mkhitaryan and diving to push away a Jesse Lingard prod from eight yards out. With United seeing less of the ball in the second period, Rashford - who scored the extra-time winner in thequarter-final against Anderlecht- stood over a free-kick to the right of the Celta penalty area. After Daley Blind's decoy run, the England international whipped the ball over the wall, past the outstretched left hand of Alvarez and just inside the far post. By then, Celta could have been out of the tie, having been kept on level terms by the brilliance of their goalkeeper. In their first European semi-final, the hosts did not look to be any better than their current domestic position - 11th in La Liga and on the back of three successive defeats. United should have every confidence of progressing from their first European semi in six years. Celta did have chances - both Daniel Wass and former Liverpool player Iago Aspas headed wide when they should have done better, while Pione Sisto's deflected shot forced Sergio Romero to save in the second half. But United's front three of Rashford, Lingard and Mkhitaryan were more lively, while Paul Pogba and Marouane Fellaini dominated midfield. Substitute Ashley Young lasted only 11 minutes before being forced off This was United's 58th game of a season that promises six more matches if they make it to Stockholm. When Eric Bailly limped off in thedraw against Swansea on Sunday,Mourinho's squad looked to be further stretched, especially at the back. Luke Shaw had already been injured in that game, while Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo were on the sidelines. However, Bailly was fit enough to start in Spain, alongside midfielder Pogba, who has recovered from a muscle strain. Centre-back Smalling, who had not played for United since 19 March because of a knee injury, was on the bench. Still, it was not all positive news for Mourinho. Ashley Young, himself a substitute, lasted only 11 minutes before suffering what appeared to a hamstring problem, paving the way for Smalling's return. Marcus Rashford may have produced the defining moment, but Celta would have been as good as out if it had not been for goalkeeper Alvarez Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho:""I am very pleased with the performance but not with the result. At half-time we should have had three - or at least two goals. ""We played well enough to have the tie closed, but we have to go and play at Old Trafford. ""Rashford is a 19-year-old kid who is in love with football. He stays after training for half an hour to practise taking free-kicks and waits for the opportunity. ""We tried to win the match but we missed chances. We played well, we were compact against a team who are difficult to play against. ""Let's hope Old Trafford wants us to win because when Old Trafford wants it, we win."" United's hectic schedule continues with a Premier League trip to Arsenal at 16:00 BST on Sunday, while Celta have a domestic date at Malaga on the same day.

"Marcus Rashford also scored the winner in United's quarter-final against Anderlecht Marcus Rashford's superb free-kick gave Manchester United control of their Europa League semi-final against Celta Vigo. The 19-year-old striker's curling effort not only gave United the lead, but also a precious away goal going into next Thursday's second leg at Old Trafford. With United outside the Premier League's top four - a point behind Manchester City and four off third-placed Liverpool - the Europa League perhaps represents their best opportunity of earning a place in next season's Champions League. They looked to have spurned their best chances in northern Spain - three times they were denied in the first half by home goalkeeper Sergio Alvarez. As Celta improved, United's wastefulness seemed increasingly important, only for Rashford to produce the sort of quality needed to beat the excellent Alvarez. Returning home with an advantage, Jose Mourinho's side will be strong favourites to progress to faceAjax or Lyonin Stockholm on 24 May in the final of a competition they have never won. Man Utd boss Mourinho vows to rest players Nevin: 'Man Utd much better than Celta Vigo' - listen to 5 live Football Daily Listen: 'Rashford not a natural goalscorer' Relive Man Utd's win in Spain Rashford gave United the lead midway through the second half Rashford was one of the three United players thwarted by Alvarez in a first period the visitors had the better of. His arcing strike was heading for the top corner before Alvarez leapt to his left, with the Spaniard also stopping a surging Henrikh Mkhitaryan and diving to push away a Jesse Lingard prod from eight yards out. With United seeing less of the ball in the second period, Rashford - who scored the extra-time winner in thequarter-final against Anderlecht- stood over a free-kick to the right of the Celta penalty area. After Daley Blind's decoy run, the England international whipped the ball over the wall, past the outstretched left hand of Alvarez and just inside the far post. By then, Celta could have been out of the tie, having been kept on level terms by the brilliance of their goalkeeper. In their first European semi-final, the hosts did not look to be any better than their current domestic position - 11th in La Liga and on the back of three successive defeats. United should have every confidence of progressing from their first European semi in six years. Celta did have chances - both Daniel Wass and former Liverpool player Iago Aspas headed wide when they should have done better, while Pione Sisto's deflected shot forced Sergio Romero to save in the second half. But United's front three of Rashford, Lingard and Mkhitaryan were more lively, while Paul Pogba and Marouane Fellaini dominated midfield. Substitute Ashley Young lasted only 11 minutes before being forced off This was United's 58th game of a season that promises six more matches if they make it to Stockholm. When Eric Bailly limped off in thedraw against Swansea on Sunday,Mourinho's squad looked to be further stretched, especially at the back. Luke Shaw had already been injured in that game, while Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Marcos Rojo were on the sidelines. However, Bailly was fit enough to start in Spain, alongside midfielder Pogba, who has recovered from a muscle strain. Centre-back Smalling, who had not played for United since 19 March because of a knee injury, was on the bench. Still, it was not all positive news for Mourinho. Ashley Young, himself a substitute, lasted only 11 minutes before suffering what appeared to a hamstring problem, paving the way for Smalling's return. Marcus Rashford may have produced the defining moment, but Celta would have been as good as out if it had not been for goalkeeper Alvarez Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho:""I am very pleased with the performance but not with the result. At half-time we should have had three - or at least two goals. ""We played well enough to have the tie closed, but we have to go and play at Old Trafford. ""Rashford is a 19-year-old kid who is in love with football. He stays after training for half an hour to practise taking free-kicks and waits for the opportunity. ""We tried to win the match but we missed chances. We played well, we were compact against a team who are difficult to play against. ""Let's hope Old Trafford wants us to win because when Old Trafford wants it, we win."" United's hectic schedule continues with a Premier League trip to Arsenal at 16:00 BST on Sunday, while Celta have a domestic date at Malaga on the same day. The return leg is at Old Trafford next Thursday (20:05 BST kick-off).

"Jimena Rico and Shaza Ismail are back in Spain after a three-week ordeal Less than a month ago, Spaniard Jimena Rico, and Egyptian-born Shaza Ismail were just like any other young, gay couple in London, the city where their romance blossomed. But after a call from Ms Ismail's father, the two set out on on a trip which they say involved death threats, escape across international borders, and a spell in a Turkish jail where, Ms Ismail says, the treatment was ""unexpected, inhumane and horrible"". Safe in Ms Rico's Spanish hometown of Torrox, the couple faced the cameras to reveal a nightmarish three-week ordeal which, according to Ms Rico, began after her partner's family in Dubai had tried to separate them by force. ""I really want to tell our story because I think it could help many people who live in a situation of repression for being homosexual,"" Ms Rico told reporters who had gathered in the room to hear their story. It had all started innocently enough. According to the 28-year-old, the couple flew from London to Dubai on 14 April because Ms Ismail's father had said that her mother was ill in hospital. ""But it was a trick,"" said Jimena Rico. ""He threatened to kill us and said we could go to jail for being lesbians."" Ms Rico (R) embraces her sister (C) on her return to Spain According to her partner, 21-year-old Ms Ismail was locked up by her family. But the couple managed to escape and flew to Tbilisi, Georgia, from where they were hoping to catch a connecting flight to London. But even putting more than 2,000 miles between them and Ms Ismail's family had not guaranteed their safety. Ms Ismail's father appeared at the airport and the Egyptian woman's papers, including the visa she needed to return to the UK, were torn up in the altercation. Where is it illegal to be gay? My secret life as a gay ultra-Orthodox Jew What is it like to be a gay refugee? Ms Rico explained that at this point the Georgian authorities escorted the couple to the Turkish border. Spain's foreign ministry says the couple were then arrested in Samsun, northern Turkey, and taken to Istanbul. There, they were arrested on a charge ""apparently to do with terrorism"", says Ms Rico, adding that they signed papers they did not understand. Ms Rico got word to her family, who reported the situation to the Spanish police. After three days in a Turkish jail, the Spanish foreign ministry managed to secure their release - allowing them to fly home to Spain, where Ms Rico's relieved family welcomed them with open arms. ""I thought we were not going to get out of [prison],"" Ms Rico said. ""They told me I could leave but she had to stay, and I said I wasn't going without her."" Ms Ismail's father, however, tells a different version of events, although he admits travelling to Tbilisi airport and forcibly attempting to retain his daughter. ""When she arrived in Dubai, I embraced her,"" the unnamed father told Spain's Antena 3 television station. ""She said she wanted to stay in London and I asked her to come home and talk about her being a lesbian because she told us via text message. She came out of the closet like that, sending her mother a text message."" Ms Rico (R) hopes she will be able to marry her girlfriend, who is on a temporary visa in Spain Ms Ismail's father said that he offered to take his daughter to a psychologist and that she had agreed to stay in Dubai and study there. Then, he claimed, his daughter vanished from the family home. ""I went to the police after she had disappeared. A friend told me Shaza was in Georgia and I reported that she had run away or been kidnapped."" He explained that he had gone to Tbilisi with a lawyer, but insisted the only papers he had torn up were part of an old passport belonging to his daughter. Jimena Rico accepts her partner's father is doing what he thinks is best: ""I know that [Ms Ismail's] father loves her. But his mind is so closed that he can't understand."" She is now hoping to marry Shaza Ismail, currently staying with her on a temporary visa after the Spanish government  secured the couple's release.

"Supporters of Mr Macron watch the debate in a Paris bar After the debate was over, some of the French media commentariat was saying it had been a disgrace. Nothing had been elucidated. It was all mud-slinging. It was unworthy of a presidential election. Maybe. But it didn't half make for riveting viewing. And at the end of the day, the debate did its job. For the millions sitting through those two hours of insults, interruptions and (just occasionally) ideas, the differences between Marine Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron could hardly have been made any plainer. The National Front leader set the tone with her opening remarks, which were clearly intended to cause personal hurt. Macron's smile had become a grimace, she said. The mask had fallen - behind the personable front lay the coldness of a banker. Insults like that can only have been intended to rattle her adversary, to provoke him into saying something he would regret. And that was her tactic throughout: constantly needling Emmanuel Macron with jibes and vaguely-worded accusations. In depth: Emmanuel Macron's meteoric rise In depth: Is Marine Le Pen far-right? There had been a big argument in advance about whether the producers of the debate would be allowed to use cutaways. These are images of the person who is not talking, when he or she reacts to the one who is. Finally it was agreed that they could be broadcast - and thus we were able to watch Marine Le Pen doing something unusual. Throughout much of the debate she was smiling, sometimes even chuckling. It seemed to be part of a rehearsed psychological ploy to unnerve her opponent, by appearing to find his answers so ludicrous as to be amusing. Showing candidates' reactions was a sticking point before the event Except none of this tactic worked. Emmanuel Macron did not rise to the bait. Say what you will of him, Macron is an extraordinarily composed and accomplished performer. Throughout the debate he remained master of himself and his argument. At only one point did she score. In the section on terrorism, she launched a attack on Macron's supposed feebleness in face of the jihadist threat, and explained that she would make France safer by expelling foreign suspects. Macron responded with a long-winded explanation of how so many terrorists were in fact French, and how therefore France needed to examine its own conscience for letting that happen. The argument misfired badly because it made it look as if Macron blamed France as much as the terrorists. But for the rest, it was Marine Le Pen who betrayed weakness and confusion on a range of issues - especially economic. On the question of leaving the euro, far from clearing up the uncertainty about what she actually wants, she made matters worse by exposing her ignorance of the old European Currency Unit. Does Le Pen have a chance of winning French presidency? The issues dividing Le Pen and Macron How do the French candidates differ on world affairs? French election 2017: The economic challenge She was constantly playing with documents in front of her, searching for points and remarks to quote back at him. But it made her look unsure of her brief, and too often her attacks were reduced to the same old slogans. Macron, by contrast, appeared comfortable and spontaneous. These face-to-face debates are a traditional part of the election process, and for 40 years the French have tuned in to see which candidate is more likely tofaire prÃ©sident. They want to know who has the look, who has the feel of a head of state. Emmanuel Macron is an unknown quantity. Many loathe his ideas. Many fear his inexperience. But last night - against Marine le Pen - there was little doubt who was the morepresidentiable. How do the French candidates differ on world affairs?

"Five years ago a midwife in Kenya delivered a child with male and female sexual organs. The father told her to kill it, but instead she hid it and raised it as her own. Two years later, the same thing happened again - and before long she was forced to flee to save the children's lives. Zainab was used to delivering babies. As a traditional birth attendant in rural western Kenya, she'd delivered dozens over the years. But none like the one in front of her now. It had been a tricky birth, but nothing Zainab couldn't handle. The umbilical cord had got twisted around the baby's head and she'd had to think quickly, using a wooden spoon to untangle it. After clearing the baby's airway, she washed the child and cut and tied the umbilical cord. It was then that Zainab saw something she'd never seen before. ""When I looked to see if it was a boy or a girl, I saw two things protruding - this baby had male and female parts,"" she says. Instead of saying what she usually said at this point - ""It's a boy!"" or ""It's a girl!"" - Zainab handed the baby to its mother and simply told her, ""Here is your baby."" When the exhausted mother saw that her child's sex was unclear, she was stunned. But when her husband arrived, he was in no doubt about what should happen next. ""He told me, 'We can't take this baby home. We want this baby to be killed.' I told him that the child was God's creation and must not be killed. But he insisted. So eventually I told him, 'Leave the baby with me, I'll kill it for you.' But I did not kill the baby. I kept it."" The father came back several times to check that Zainab had done what she'd promised. She hid the baby and insisted she had killed it. But this would not work forever. ""A year later, the parents somehow heard that their baby was alive and came to see me,"" Zainab says. ""They told me I must never reveal that the baby was theirs. I agreed and since then I've been raising the child as my own."" It was an extraordinary - and risky - choice. In Zainab's community, and in many others in Kenya, an intersex baby is seen as a bad omen, bringing a curse upon its family and neighbours. By adopting the child, Zainab flouted traditional beliefs and risked being blamed for any misfortune. That was in 2012. But two years later Zainab was amazed to deliver a second intersex baby. Although there are no reliable statistics on how many Kenyans are intersex, doctors believe the rate is the same as in other countries. Some estimates put this as high as 1.7% of the population but there is disagreement over what constitutes being intersex. ""This time, the parents didn't ask me to kill the child. The mother was alone and she just fled and left me with the baby,"" Zainab says. Once again, she took the baby into her home and raised it as part of her family. But her husband - a fisherman on Lake Victoria - was not happy. ""When he went out to the lake to fish and had a bad catch, he blamed the children,"" says Zainab. ""He said it was because they had brought a curse on us. He suggested I hand the children over to him so he could drown them in the lake. But I refused. I told him I would never allow that to happen. He became violent and we started fighting all the time."" Zainab became so worried by her husband's behaviour that she decided to leave him and take the children with her. ""It was a difficult choice for me because financially I had a comfortable life with my husband and we had grown-up children together and even grandchildren. But you can't live in such an environment - with threats and fighting. I was forced to flee."" Childbirth is changing in Kenya. Increasingly, mothers are giving birth in hospitals, rather than in the village. But not so long ago the use of traditional birth attendants was the norm, and there was a tacit assumption about how to deal with intersex babies. ""They used to kill them,"" explains Seline Okiki, chairperson of the Ten Beloved Sisters, a group of traditional birth attendants, also from western Kenya. ""If an intersex baby was born, automatically it was seen as a curse and that baby was not allowed to live. It was expected that the traditional birth attendant would kill the child and tell the mother her baby was stillborn."" In the Luo language, there was even a euphemism for how the baby was killed. Traditional birth attendants would say that they had ""broken the sweet potato"". This meant they had used a hard sweet potato to damage the baby's delicate skull. ""The parents did not get any say in the matter,"" says the group secretary Anjeline Naloh. ""The expectation was that the baby should not even live long enough to cry."" These days, the Ten Beloved Sisters leave delivering babies to hospital midwives. Instead, they support expectant and new mothers and raise awareness about HIV transmission. But in more remote areas, where hospitals are hard to reach, traditional birth attendants still deliver babies the old-fashioned way and the Ten Beloved Sisters believe infanticide still happens. ""It is hidden. Not open as it was before,"" says Anjeline Naloh. ""Those things still happen, but they are secrets now,"" agrees Seline Okiki. ""People bathe openly and if you see something that is a little different, that's where they go speak: 'Oh, did you see something, eh?' [laughter]. You compare. That's normal!"" Listen:BBC Africa health correspondent Anne Soy hears how it's hard for intersex people to hide their condition Coming out of the Shadows in Africais broadcast on Assignment on the BBC World Service -click here for transmission times, or to catch up on the BBC iPlayer Georgina Adhiambo, executive director of the charity Voices of Women in Western Kenya, which is making efforts to reduce the stigma that surrounds intersex people in western Kenya, says the subject is still taboo. ""We've come across parents who've tried to hide their intersex child or even locked them up - some because they were ashamed, others because they were afraid that others might try to harm their child,"" she says. ""We're explaining who intersex people really are. This is a very religious society, so we explain that intersex children are also created by God."" But paediatric endocrinologist Joyce Mbogo - one of a new generation of doctors trained specifically to deal with what they call Disorders of Sex Development, or DSDs - says attitudes to intersex people are starting to change. ""We have a new set of parents who are willing to seek help,"" she says. ""The internet is accessible even in the rural areas, so when they realise there's something wrong they're able to look and see what could this possibly be."" Treatment options vary. Some patients require no treatment, many need medication or hormone therapy and others need corrective surgery - though often this is delayed until after puberty so the children can decide for themselves who they want to be. For Zainab's adoptive children, such decisions are a long way off. They are healthy and happy and when she talks about them her face lights up. She's visibly proud of them and the new life she's built for herself. She still delivers babies when she's needed, but makes her living mostly by buying and selling clothes and sandals. ""We all eat well and I can see that they are normal children. We talk, the older one helps with the household chores and my son thinks of them both as his siblings. They are all my family. It's a miracle from God."" When asked if she's ever regretted her decision, Zainab laughs as if it's a ridiculous question. ""Should I throw them out? No, I'm their mum! They're human beings and I have to take care of God's creation.""

"Lana Hopkins couldn't find the perfect bag so she launched Mon Purse When it comes to handbags, these days there are almost as many ways to jazz up your existing bag as there are new designs. In Selfridges' vast accessories hall in London, you can buy a clip-on set of metal flowers from Louis Vuitton, multi-coloured jangling robots from Prada, and leather tassels at Ted Baker. What customers want, it seems, is a way to stamp a bit of individuality on their purchases. And one new counter at Selfridges will let you go a stage further. At Mon Purse, an Australian brand, you are handed an iPad and samples of leathers, and given the chance to design your own handbag. ""I was looking around for the perfect handbag and I just couldn't find it,"" explains Lana Hopkins, 33, the company's founder. ""And I was quite heartbroken, you know?"" Wandering through a Sydney shopping mall one day in 2014, Ms Hopkins stumbled upon Build-A-Bear, a shop where you can assemble your own cuddly toy with some limited variables such as fur, colour and clothing. Mon Purse's customers can choose from nine different basic bag shapes Although Ms Hopkins was rather older than the average customer, she found creating a teddy for her nephew gave her an extra emotional connection to the product. And the idea for Mon Purse was born. Skip forward three years and Mon Purse now has eight outlets in Australia, three in the UK and two in the US, including a newly opened concession in Bloomingdales, San Francisco. Customers then select colours, linings and hardware Last December, buoyed by Christmas, it sold almost $2m (Â£1.6m) worth of bags, ranging in price from $75 for a simple pouch, to $620 for an extravagant tote. The handbag industry is the latest retail sector to wake up to the possibilities of allowing customers to design their own product. And with people now increasingly used to having things their own way, be it configuring their own music playlists or choosing their exact sandwich fillings, industry insiders say demand for personally designed handbags is soaring. This video can not be played What would your dream handbag look like? ""I've never seen a cultural shift like this in the marketplace, and it's giving me whiplash,"" says Frank Zambrelli, co-founder of 1 Atelier, a New York-based handbag company. To avoid the sky-high prices of a fully bespoke service, which would see customers be able to follow their every whim, most design-your-own handbag firms - such as Mon Purse - instead use the ""mass customisation"" business model. This means that customers can design their own handbag, but only from a combination of set styles, sizes, colours and materials. So while Mon Purse promises billions of possible variations, in practice the choice is limited to 19 different bag shapes in 35 different colours. This, however, is typically substantially more customisation than offered by established bag-makers. While brands such as Gucci, Coach and Longchamp allow customers to change some elements, the business model of the larger firms still revolves around placing large orders for a design that their in-house team predict will be popular. 1 Atelier's Frank Zambrelli says customers' own designs have surprised him and shown him how narrow his vision was of what works The new wave of small companies set up to deliver customisation flip that model on its head. Mon Purse uses a visualisation tool based on 3D gaming technology, through which the customer can select size, leather texture, the type of metalwork, and shade of lining. The bag then takes approximately two to four weeks to manufacture. Launched just seven months ago, 1 Atelier allows customers to combine colours from a carefully selected palette for the body, side panels, straps and pockets of 10 different bag designs. But if in the past buying something unique meant a price tag to match, now you can actually make the tailor-made item for less than the mass-manufactured equivalent, according to Mr Zambrelli, who was previously a designer at Chanel. Bags from 1 Atelier are made in its Manhattan workshop ""Because we're not putting together a collection based on some inspiration and hopes that we've got the trend right, we're not placing any inventory buys,"" he says. In other words, they will never be left with unsold stock, which he says more than compensates for not having the economies of scale of a large order. However, prices at 1 Atelier do still range from $295 to $7,380, depending upon the materials and size of bag chosen by the customer. For a significantly cheaper personally designed handbag, Indian company Toteteca will sell you one for between $25 and $40. It makes its bags from polyvinyl, choosing not to use leather for what it says are ethical reasons. ""You'd be amazed how inexpensive it is to make custom-made bags,"" says Kushal Chudiwala, the 31-year-old founder of the Mumbai-based business. Toteteca customers are free to combine 35 different colours on 12 different bags Perhaps thanks to the low prices, Toteteca seems to free up customers' creativity. While 70% of Mon Purse's customised orders are still a version of a black bag, Toteteca's customers are more adventurous. ""We don't make many black bags,"" says Mr Chudiwala. But they do sometimes feel the need to rein in customers' wilder ideas, he says. Toteteca uses polyvinyl to make its bags ""When we first launched, we had a customer select a combination that looked like a handbag for a joker, green and yellow and pink all mixed into one product,"" he says. When queried the customer stuck to their design, so Toteteca went ahead and made the bag. At 1 Atelier, Mr Zambrelli was initially ""hell-bent"" on configuring its design tool so that choosing one element would limit the subsequent options, avoiding the possibility of a customer ""creating something absolutely hideous that we wouldn't want our name on,"" he says. Frank Zambrelli (right) and his co-founders launched 1 Atelier last year But in the end they decided against it. ""And I'm so glad we did that, because, shame on me, my eyes have been opened up,"" says Mr Zambrelli. ""Many people have put together combinations of materials and colours that as a designer for 25 years were anathema to me. And I was 100% wrong. I'm ashamed actually at how narrow my vision was of what works."" But 1 Atelier, Mon Purse and Toteteca's founders do all agree that there is such a thing as too much choice - that customers can feel baffled and overwhelmed without some guidance, or narrowing down of the options. If you're not feeling too creative you can always just go for a plain black or cream bag Mon Purse's next step will be to offer an algorithm-based design service, to those ""feeling a little lost"". ""We can tap into your Facebook [photos] and see what your favourite colours, textures and designs are, and say you might like A, B and C,"" says Ms Hopkins. But ultimately, if you lack an inner accessories designer, and your Facebook account doesn't provide inspiration, the safe option remains available - a nice, plain, black bag.

"Pioneering work to extract detailed information from audio recordings of gunshots could give forensic case officers new avenues for solving murder cases. The hustle and bustle of a city going about its business is broken by the crack of gunshots, sending bystanders running and screaming. In the aftermath one man lies dead and another badly injured. Further down the street, four security cameras outside a local resident's home picked up the sound of the exchange of fire between the two men, but no images of what happened. Eyewitnesses reported seeing the pair standing just a few metres apart firing handguns at each other, but it is unclear which of the two perpetrators shot first. In an attempt to unravel what happened, local police called Robert Maher, a professor in electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University. Using audio captured by the microphones on the security cameras, he was able to reconstruct the incident shot-by-shot to reveal where each of the men were standing and who fired first. Prof Maher is one of a small group of acoustics experts working to establish a new field of forensics that examines the sound of gunshots recorded on camera footage or by phones. ""Nowadays it is not uncommon for someone with a cell phone to be making a video at the time of a gunfire incident,"" he explains. ""The most common types of recordings are from dashboard cameras or vest-mounted cameras carried by law enforcement officers. ""Also common are recordings from an emergency telephone call centres where the calls are being recorded and the caller's phone picks up a gunshot sound.  In some cases there are private surveillance systems at homes and businesses that include audio recordings."" Different guns sound similar to the human ear, but software can tell the difference Gunshots make a distinctive sound that makes them easy to distinguish from other commonly mistaken noises such as a car backfiring or fireworks. A firearm produces an abrupt blast of intense noise from the muzzle that lasts just one or two millionths of a second before disappearing again. High-powered rifles also produce an additional sonic boom as the bullet passes through the sound barrier before the sound of the muzzle blast is detected. Most of us spend our lives surrounded by devices capable of capturing these sounds inadvertently if a crime occurs nearby. Professor Maher's aim is to extract details from these recordings that might help police piece together a crime. Together with his colleagues, he has been compiling a database of firearm sounds in a project funded by US National Institute of Justice. They are firing an array of rifles, shotguns, semiautomatic pistols and revolvers beside an array of 12 microphones arranged in a semicircle. Each of the guns appear broadly similar to human ears when fired on an open range, but using software to analyse the sound waves picked up by the microphones, they have found it is possible to distinguish different types of weapon. ""We observe differences between pistols with differing calibre and barrel length for example,"" says Professor Maher. ""Revolvers differ from pistols because sound can emanate from the gap between the revolver cylinder and the gun barrel, causing two sound sources that can be detected at certain angles."" His analysis has also revealed other details can be gleaned from recordings of gunfire. The shape of the sound wave produced by a gunshot, for example, is different depending on which way the weapon is pointing. If the microphone is off to one side of the shooter, the split second burst of noise can different compared to when it is in front of or behind the gun. Researchers can extract information from audio recordings of an incident - this shows a double gunshot They have also found it is possible to pick up distinct echoes as the initial sound produced by a gunshot reverberates off nearby buildings, parked cars, trees and walls. After the initial blast, other smaller blips in the sound wave can be seen within a fraction of a second of the shot. By calculating the time it takes for sound to travel to and from an obstacle, it is possible to calculate how far a shooter was away from it. It can even reveal if a shooter was firing from an elevated position from the muzzle blast reflecting off the ground. ""This means the orientation and location of shooters in some circumstances can be determined,"" according to Prof Maher, who revealed some of his findings to a symposium organised by the National Institute of Justice in New Orleans last month. ""In situations where more than one recording of the shooting scene is available, such as where two or more patrol cars equipped with dashboard audio or video recorders are present at an incident, the position of the vehicles can sometimes help triangulate the sounds."" It is a similar concept to the one used by companies like Raytheon, which produces sniper locators for the military that use the sound of a gunshot to locate the shooter. An array of microphones can be mounted on buildings, vehicles or helicopters to help spot shots. Another firm, Shotspotter, uses a network of microphones across 90 cities in the US to help law enforcement detect gunshots. The difference with these systems is that they detect gunfire in real time, while Professor Maher is trying piece together what happened days, weeks and even months after a shooting. In the case described at the start of this article - a real shooting that occurred recently in Cincinnati, Ohio - the injured man claimed he had shot the other man dead in self defence after he was fired at first. Military systems like Boomerang use gunshot sounds to pinpoint the locations of snipers With the two gunshots occurring less than a second apart, it was impossible for witnesses to definitely say which of the shooters had fired first. Using the security camera recordings of a local home owner living further down the street, however, Professor Maher was able to reveal two distinct gunshots in the audio. Just a few milliseconds after the first gunshot, a distinct second blip appeared in the sound wave, just moments before the second shot was fired. This blip was the echo of the first gunshot bouncing off a large building at a T-junction around 90 metres to the north. The echo from the second gunshot was far harder to spot in the sound-waves produced. According to Professor Maher, this suggests the first shooter to fire their gun was the one pointing it to the north - the same man who claimed he had been firing in self-defence. Professor Maher hopes the growing amount of technology capable of recording audio will make such analysis even easier in the future. The microphones on many older consumer devices are not designed to handle the abrupt, loud sounds of gunshots and it can overload them But as more homes become equipped with home security cameras and ""always-on"" smart assistants like Amazon's Echo and Google Home, it may be possible to capture better audio of events. It is something that other forensics experts believe could have a growing role in the future. Mike Brookes, a reader in communications and signal processing at Imperial College London, said: """"The sort of question that such recordings can help with are in sorting out the timing and sequence of events that took place and in establishing the position from which a gun was fired.""

"A model wears a hijab as part of the Anniesa Hasibuan collection at New York Fashion Week 2016. Hasibuan is a Muslim designer whose models wear the Islamic headscarf, but now much bigger fashion brands are taking a similar approach. There's a growing number of fashion brands and multinational companies showcasing women wearing an Islamic headscarf. But, for various reasons, some women from Muslim backgrounds aren't happy with the trend. Dolce and Gabbana, H&M, Pepsi, Nike: just a few of the big brands putting women wearing a hijab - a traditional Islamic headscarf - front and centre in advertising campaigns. The hijab has long been a contentious topic of conversation; feminists, religious conservatives, secularists are some of the online communities that have engaged in passionate debate about what it represents. But this time, online and using social media, it's some Muslim women who are questioning the use of such images. Tasbeeh Harwees, a journalist, recentlywrote,externalin the online magazine Good about arecent viral Pepsi advertstarring Kendall Jenner. The advertisement was controversial because of its alleged trivialisation of street protests - but some Muslim women took issue for a different reason, the casting of a hijab-wearing woman who photographs the rally. ""A multi-billion dollar company was using the image of a Muslim woman to project an image of progressiveness that it may not necessarily live up to,"" Harwees tellsBBC Trending radio. Kendall Jenner was recently derided for taking part in the Pepsi commercial Pepsi certainly isn't the only company highlighting women wearing the hijab. Nike recently announced anewly designed sports hijabwhich will hit shops in 2018. H&M used afirst Muslim modelin hijab in an advertisement while numerous brands and labels have launched ""Ramadan collections"" in the hope of attracting Muslim shoppers during the holy month. ""Images of Muslim women communicate to their consumer bases that these companies are 'progressive' or 'inclusive',"" Harwees says. ""Given the political climate, it has become socially expedient to align oneself with dissident communities, and for many people, that's what Muslim women have come to represent."" The rise in popularity of so-called hijabi fashion bloggers and make-up tutorials aimed at women who wear the hijab is also a heavily debated subject. They generate millions of views and shares but some women cite increasing pressure to appear fashionable as a reason to stop covering their heads. They feel something sacred is being undermined by commercialism. Khadija Ahmed is the editor of a new online magazine called Another Lenz, but wrote a personal story of how she wore the hijab for two years, then took the decision to stop wearing it. She told BBC Trending she felt pressured by the images she saw in advertising and on social media. ""I don't feel that the brands are doing us a favour - we don't need the approval of the mainstream companies to approve of our identity,"" Ahmed says. ""It's not doing anything for the Muslim community other than reducing the hijab - which I see as an act of worship - into something as simple as a fashion statement."" Visit theTrending Facebook page,external Then there are feminists who have quite a different interpretation of the headscarf, particularly in countries where it is mandatory. Masih Alinejad is an Iranian activist and journalist who started the Facebook campaign ""My stealthy freedom"", showing women in Iran removing their hijabs in defiance of the state. ""I think the media in the West want to normalise the hijab issue - they want to talk about minority Muslims in the West, but they totally forget there are millions of women in Muslim countries that are forced to wear the hijab,"" Alinejad says. ""If you want to talk about the hijab and introduce it as a sign of feminists or resistance you have to think about those girls and women who are forced to wear it,"" she says. You can hear more on this story onBBC Trending on the BBC World Service And for more Trending stories,download our podcast So with the potential of a growing online backlash, why are brands keen to show off this particular religious garment? Shelina Janmohamed is vice president of Ogilvy Noor, part of the giant advertising and marketing agency WPP. Ogilvy Noor was established to help market companies to Muslims around the world. ""At this moment in time there is a growing Muslim consumer segment,"" she says, ""and they have lifestyle aspirations about how they want to live and that should be reflected just like any other lifestyle aspiration. ""It's a matter of commerce and the bottom line."" That approach does have some support among female Muslims. Hend Amry has been dubbed ""the queen of Muslim Twitter"" - and although it's a label she says she is slightly uncomfortable with, she does see an upside in the recent prominence of the hijab online. Hend Amry has been dubbed ""the queen of Muslim Twitter"" ""There are Muslim women in hijab tweeting out these hilarious comebacks or sharing their wisdom or strong personalities,"" she says. ""Just by doing that it's already wiping away stereotypes of the docile, oppressed, silenced Muslim woman, and that's really energising."" ""I think there is only one change that needs to be made and that is Muslim women need to tell their own stories. Once that happens the narratives will take care of themselves,"" she says.

"Jimena Rico and Shaza Ismail are back in Spain after a three-week ordeal Less than a month ago, Spaniard Jimena Rico, and Egyptian-born Shaza Ismail were just like any other young, gay couple in London, the city where their romance blossomed. But after a call from Ms Ismail's father, the two set out on on a trip which they say involved death threats, escape across international borders, and a spell in a Turkish jail where, Ms Ismail says, the treatment was ""unexpected, inhumane and horrible"". Safe in Ms Rico's Spanish hometown of Torrox, the couple faced the cameras to reveal a nightmarish three-week ordeal which, according to Ms Rico, began after her partner's family in Dubai had tried to separate them by force. ""I really want to tell our story because I think it could help many people who live in a situation of repression for being homosexual,"" Ms Rico told reporters who had gathered in the room to hear their story. It had all started innocently enough. According to the 28-year-old, the couple flew from London to Dubai on 14 April because Ms Ismail's father had said that her mother was ill in hospital. ""But it was a trick,"" said Jimena Rico. ""He threatened to kill us and said we could go to jail for being lesbians."" Ms Rico (R) embraces her sister (C) on her return to Spain According to her partner, 21-year-old Ms Ismail was locked up by her family. But the couple managed to escape and flew to Tbilisi, Georgia, from where they were hoping to catch a connecting flight to London. But even putting more than 2,000 miles between them and Ms Ismail's family had not guaranteed their safety. Ms Ismail's father appeared at the airport and the Egyptian woman's papers, including the visa she needed to return to the UK, were torn up in the altercation. Where is it illegal to be gay? My secret life as a gay ultra-Orthodox Jew What is it like to be a gay refugee? Ms Rico explained that at this point the Georgian authorities escorted the couple to the Turkish border. Spain's foreign ministry says the couple were then arrested in Samsun, northern Turkey, and taken to Istanbul. There, they were arrested on a charge ""apparently to do with terrorism"", says Ms Rico, adding that they signed papers they did not understand. Ms Rico got word to her family, who reported the situation to the Spanish police. After three days in a Turkish jail, the Spanish foreign ministry managed to secure their release - allowing them to fly home to Spain, where Ms Rico's relieved family welcomed them with open arms. ""I thought we were not going to get out of [prison],"" Ms Rico said. ""They told me I could leave but she had to stay, and I said I wasn't going without her."" Ms Ismail's father, however, tells a different version of events, although he admits travelling to Tbilisi airport and forcibly attempting to retain his daughter. ""When she arrived in Dubai, I embraced her,"" the unnamed father told Spain's Antena 3 television station. ""She said she wanted to stay in London and I asked her to come home and talk about her being a lesbian because she told us via text message. She came out of the closet like that, sending her mother a text message."" Ms Rico (R) hopes she will be able to marry her girlfriend, who is on a temporary visa in Spain Ms Ismail's father said that he offered to take his daughter to a psychologist and that she had agreed to stay in Dubai and study there. Then, he claimed, his daughter vanished from the family home. ""I went to the police after she had disappeared. A friend told me Shaza was in Georgia and I reported that she had run away or been kidnapped."" He explained that he had gone to Tbilisi with a lawyer, but insisted the only papers he had torn up were part of an old passport belonging to his daughter. Jimena Rico accepts her partner's father is doing what he thinks is best: ""I know that [Ms Ismail's] father loves her. But his mind is so closed that he can't understand."" She is now hoping to marry Shaza Ismail, currently staying with her on a temporary visa after the Spanish government  secured the couple's release.
