"This video can not be played Four couples battled it out to be crowned champions Documentary maker Stacey Dooley and dance partner Kevin Clifton have been crowned the winners of the 16th series of BBC One's Strictly Come Dancing. Stacey beat Joe Sugg, Faye Tozer and Ashley Roberts to win the coveted glitterball trophy in Saturday's final. She was previously best known for hosting her hard-hitting seriesStacey Dooley Investigates, but has won over millions on Saturday night TV. It was Kevin's first victory after being a losing finalist four times. Kevin was clearly emotional to finally get his hands on the glitterball. After winning, Stacey paid tribute to him as ""the biggest gem"". Stacey and Kevin proved to be the viewers' favourites She said: ""I've had the most incredible time. It's daunting doing something you haven't done before - you feel silly, you feel like a bit of an idiot. ""But Kevin walks you through - and you so deserve this."" In response, he told her: ""Thank you so much not just for being so amazing and dancing so well and getting this, but just for being the most wonderful person to work with, to spend every day in training [with]. ""You've worked so hard and always with a massive smile on your face."" Stacey and Kevin were popular winners, and there was also huge support for Joe from fellow YouTubers and some of the eight million people who subscribe to his YouTube channel. Allow Twitter content?

The couples in the final performed a dance of the judge's choice, a show dance and their favourite dance of the series. The judges chose the foxtrot for Stacey and Kevin's first dance. The pair then performed the show dance to Land of a Thousand Dances by Jessica Mauboy, and their choice was the Paso Doble - or ""Paso Dooley"". Strictly stars on how it's changed their lives What makes a Strictly winner? Beyond Today: Stacey Dooley Although judges Craig Revel-Horwood, Dame Darcey Bussell, Shirley Ballas and Bruno Tonioli gave their scores as usual, the winners were decided purely by a public vote. Stacey and Kevin would have actually come fourth out of the four final pairs if it had just been down to the judges, who awarded them a score of 114 out of a possible total of 120. Front left-right: Faye and Giovanni, Ashley and Pasha, Joe and Dianne, and Stacey and Kevin Two couples - Pussycat Dolls star Ashley and partner Pasha Kovalev, and Steps singer Faye and Giovanni Pernice - were given top marks for all three dances in the final, getting 120 out of 120. But some viewers were less impressed by their achievements because Ashley and Faye had previously had dance training and experience, whereas Stacey and Joe were relative novices when they started. Host Claudia Winkleman said there had never been so many 10s in a final This year's series was as eventful as ever - off the dancefloor as well as on it. It hit the headlines when comedianSeann Walsh was caught kissing his married dance partner Katya Jonesoutside a pub. There were also reports ofa row between actor Danny John-Jules and his dance partner Amy Dowdenduring training.

"Many readers will find the thought of Christmas tree-flavoured crisps revolting, but Iceland is betting its customers will feel the opposite this festive season. The crisps are part of the supermarket chain's festive food range, and have a distinct pine-like taste thanks to their pine salt seasoning, which is made with pine tree oil. It is part of a wider trend for novel, sometimes bizarre fusion foods that has swept the UK over the last few years as retailers vie for our attention and our cash. But some have questioned whether the trend has gone too far, with newspapers calling Iceland's crisps ""dubious"" and consumers mocking them on social media. Anyone for tea? Brussels sprouts tea? Iceland says the crisps offer a ""completely new combination, unlike any other festive flavour"", but shoppers I speak to outside a branch in Clapham, south London are divided. ""It tastes a bit organic, kind of herby. They have a good aroma and feel kind of Christmassy,"" says Rory. He likes the fact Iceland is catering to niche tastes and would potentially buy the crisps, although another shopper Martin is unconvinced. ""It tastes a little bit earthy, like dirt I guess. It's pretty unpleasant,"" he says. ""To me it stands out as a bit of a gimmick, it's just cashing in ahead of Christmas."" Martin thinks Iceland's new crisps are ""pretty unpleasant"" Other experimental Christmas foods on sale in recent seasons have included Brussels sprouts-flavoured tea (containing granulated sprouts) from Sainsbury's, Christmas pudding smoothies from M&S and turkey breast-infused gin from Portobello Road Gin. Have we reached 'peak' advent calendar? Brits get Christmas shopping done early Is September too early to think about Christmas? Restaurants and cafÃ© chains are getting in on the act too, with Costa Coffee selling pigs in blankets mac and cheese, and Pizza Express offering a pizza complete with turkey, festive stuffing and rosemary. Analysts say these novel creations help operators to differentiate themselves in an increasingly competitive climate. Market research firm Mintel says only 7% of grocery shoppers stick with one retailer in a single month and they are increasingly likely to spread their spending across brands. ""There's no doubt there's a marketing angle to this but consumers also love new products and it creates interest and excitement,"" says Mintel senior retail analyst Nicholas Carroll. ""It is hard to say whether [the more experimental creations] sell well, but the trend has been accelerating so there has to be demand."" Marmite sprouts (Iceland):in this simple recipe the festive vegetable is coated in a Marmite butter Mince pie croissants (cafÃ© chain Paul):flaky all-butter croissants, filled with sweet mincemeat and dusted with icing sugar Christmas pudding gammon (Aldi):sweet cured gammon with a fruit-filled stuffing and rich ""mince pie glaze"", topped with edible gold lustre Battered Brussels sprouts (Poppie's Soho):served in newspaper-style wrapping Winter berries and prosecco crisps (M&S):flavoured with dried prosecco, raspberry juice and sea salt Operators say the sales of some Christmas inventions have been strong reflecting consumer demand for more experimental flavours alongside traditional Christmas classics. But they don't always get it right and often pull creations or change them following feedback, one example being Asda's Christmas dinner pizza. Asda's Christmas dinner pizza: the new and improved version ""This year, we've listened to customer and colleague feedback and have ditched the sprouts in favour of pigs in blankets and stuffing balls, and it's already proving very popular,"" says Linsey Taylor, senior director of new product development at Asda. Carol Raithatha, a sensory science expert, says retailers will often work with consumers to find concepts that work before developing them. These might build on classic flavour combinations like sweet and sour or current food trends such as veganism or Mexican cuisine. ""Once the concept is there, you can use trained assessors to understand the sensory profiles of the foods you want to combine or create,"" she says. ""It is then about pulling out the key flavours that define a food or idea rather than making wholesale extracts."" Aldi's Christmas pudding gammon - an acquired taste, perhaps... Sainsbury's, for instance, is selling a pigs-in-blankets tea this year but it contains no meat, instead blending Lapsang Souchong tea with sage and rosemary, two ingredients commonly found in British sausages. Other recipes are more literal interpretations though, such as M&S's Brussemole, launched in 2015, which used sprouts instead of avocado in its take on the famous Mexican dip. Some experts say the fad for festive-flavoured food may already be passing, however, and there are signs retailers are pulling back. M&S, for example, says it will focus more on classic dishes this year and less on ""weird and wacky flavours"", while restricting quirkier fare to its Christmas party range. ""You can only take it so far,"" says Robbie Bargh, the founder of Gorgeous Group, which advises restaurants and hotel groups such as Radisson on food. Robbie Bargh says Christmas sandwiches work well ""If I saw Christmas-themed sushi I would be put off, a Christmas dinner pizza doesn't sound quite right either."" He says it is nice for cafÃ©s and restaurants to give a nod to Christmas but operators should focus on flavours rather than trying to reinvent the wheel. ""Ingredients like cinnamon and nutmeg provide nice Christmas touches to coffees and chai teas, while classic Christmas dinner sandwiches work well. It's when people jump on the bandwagon that it's a problem."" However, he says he did try an excellent mince pie-flavoured ice cream recently, admitting: ""Most of it is marketing but occasionally you find something amazing.""

"Climate talks in Poland have continued through the night as negotiators try to agree the next steps forward for the Paris climate agreement. Thousands of delegates worked well past the official deadline for reaching a deal but key sticking points remain. Rows continue over the issue of paying poorer countries for damage caused by global warming and the use of carbon markets to reduce emissions. The likelihood of a deal increased on Friday after a new text was released. The outline decision contains plans for a common rulebook for all countries, with flexibility for poorer nations. There are also calls for all countries to increase their carbon cutting commitments by 2020. But many issues are not yet settled, as developing countries seek recognition and compensation for the impact of rising temperatures. The idea of being legally liable for causing climate change has long been rejected by richer nations, who fear huge bills well into the future. US, Saudis and Russia block climate report Failure to tackle warming 'suicidal' Climate change is 'shrinking winter' At these talks, the question of loss and damage only features as a footnote in the text at present, something that has irritated developing countries. Prof Myles Allen, from the University of Oxford told BBC News: ""Climate change is already affecting many people around the world and the people most affected by climate change are not those who have historically contributed most to the problem. Another issue causing problems is the question of 'market mechanisms', where countries can buy carbon credits from each other as a way of reducing their emissions. Similar schemes in the past were often shown to be fraudulent. But many observers believed that overall, some progress is being made. ""It was never going to be great, not least because the US is playing a laggard role, but I think we can get a decent outcome, if it's framed in the right way,"" said Alden Meyer from the Union of Concerned Scientists. Prof Allen added: ""For countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia, where an enormous chunk of their national income arises from sales of fossil fuels, this is a much deeper problem, and that's where sticking points are arising."" Earlier, the former president of the Maldives, and now their lead negotiator, Mohamed Nasheed, made an impassioned plea for urgent progress on cutting carbon. Mohamed Nasheed is an influential figure in the UN climate process ""It's just madness for us to allow global CO2 levels (in the atmosphere) to go beyond 450 parts per million, and temperatures to shoot past 1.5 degrees,"" he told a press briefing on Thursday. ""That can still be prevented. If we come together on the basis of the emergency facing us, we can do it. ""Every country at this summit will have hell to pay if we don't."" Representatives from 196 states are here trying to sort out some very tricky questions pertaining to the rulebook of the Paris agreement which comes into force in 2020. These are the regulations that will govern the nuts and bolts of how countries cut carbon, provide finance to poorer nations and ensure that everyone is doing what they say they are doing. It sounds easy but it is very technical. At the moment countries often have different definitions and timetables for their carbon cutting actions. However some progress is being seen in shaping the rules. ""Some of the text that is key to the rulebook, in terms of the transparency of countries reporting their mitigating actions are pretty strong. It is better than it was a week ago,"" said one senior negotiator. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA But there are significant holdups. Poorer countries want some ""flexibility"" in the rules so that they are not overwhelmed with regulations that they don't have the capacity to put into practice. ""The rulebook right now hangs in the balance, because you need all countries on board and you need to support developing countries,"" said Jennifer Morgan from Greenpeace. ""Flexibility can mean a lot of things and I think some countries are using that word to delay having to implement rules, and others are worried because they don't have the capacity to do it, when you don't have a clear signal from developed countries that they are going to provide that support it just brings a lot of uncertainty."" There's a strong push to recognise the science of the IPCC, which earlier this yearproduced a critical reporton how the world would be impacted by temperatures rising by 1.5C this century. The decision to welcomethis report was rejected amid controversyearlier in the conference when Saudi Arabia, the US, Kuwait and Russia wanted to just take note of the report. When consensus couldn't be found, the text about the IPCC was dropped - much to the surprise of a majority of countries. There is a determination here to ensure that at the end of this meeting a ""COP decision"" will recognise the IPCC. ""There are 196 countries in the UN and 192 counties agree,"" said Mohamed Nasheed. ""We are just talking about four that do not agree, and these four are taking us hostage."" There is a big push here for countries to up their ambition, to cut carbon deeper and with greater urgency. In the light of the IPPC report many delegates want to see a rapid increase in ambition before 2020 to keep the chances of staying under 1.5C alive. Right now, the plans that countries lodged as part of the Paris agreement don't get anywhere near that, described as ""grossly insufficient"" by one delegate from a climate vulnerable country. It is not just the negotiators and ministers here who want to see progress on cutting carbon. Business is looking for a signal from this meeting about the future. ""Companies are ready to invest and banks are ready to finance,"" said Carlos Salle from Spanish energy conglomerate, Iberdrola. ""So we need that greater ambition in the policy to enable business to move further and faster."" Poland holds the COP presidency but there is a lot of concern among delegates that they lack an overall picture of what should emerge from the meeting. Most people want to see a strong rulebook, a commitment by countries to raise their ambitions and carbon cutting promises before 2020 and some clarity on how much money will be delivered to poorer countries - as well as when it will arrive. While some negotiators say the Poles are doing a good job in difficult circumstances, many are critical, saying they are responding to the needs of the rich and not the poor. ""I think the presidency is too honed in with the what the high-emitting countries are looking for right now and that could lead to a weak outcome here,"" said Jennifer Morgan from Greenpeace. ""Often in these talks when it's quite complex, and you don't have clear leadership, that's when countries like Saudi Arabia can come in and just wreak havoc. That's why we need the ministers from EU to come and work with poor nations to drive that home to counterbalance what the Saudis and the Poles are doing here."" For the more than 20,000 people attending these talks, the end can't come quick enough. Most have been here for around two weeks. The expectation is that it will be Saturday afternoon at the earliest. Some are worried that it could go into Sunday, but most delegates have flights to catch on that date so the pressure will be on to finish by then. Follow Matt on Twitter@mattmcgrathbbc,external.

"The discovery that more men than women hold positions of power rarely comes as a surprise. What may be more unexpected is that things are not always as they seem when women appear to have equality. Countries can sometimes stand out for their efforts at getting women into positions of power. Take, for example, Rwanda's appointment of a cabinet in which half of the posts went to women. Its move came just days after a gender-balanced cabinet was named in Ethiopia. Elsewhere in the world, there are many striking examples of women having equality with men, or even outperforming them, in other jobs that offer power and influence. Walk into a courtroom in Slovenia and the judge is four times more likely to be a woman than a man. In journalism, Namibia stands out: half of its top newsroom posts are held by women. It is not difficult to find other countries which buck the trend for a particular job. Half of IT professionals in Malaysia are female, along with six out of 10 medical researchers in New Zealand and five out of 10 engineers in Oman. That women hold these posts, which are so often dominated by men, is to be welcomed. Yet while it may seem obvious that other countries could learn from these examples, it is often worth asking ourselves where influence really lies. Ruth Bader Ginsburg is one of three female judges in the US Supreme Court Fresh in many people's minds will be the controversy surroundingthe confirmation of judge Brett Kavanaughto the US Supreme Court, despite allegations of sexual assault - which he denied. The Supreme Court - in which three of the nine judges are women - is an example of a system in which top judges wield considerable power. As in the UK, the legal system is based on common law. In the US judges are often appointed late on in their careers - sometimes through male-dominated networks - and the law is based on their decisions and precedent. By contrast, in other countries such as France and Slovenia, judges' power is far more constrained. In these civil law systems - which are based on written rules - judges have less discretion to make their own interpretations. And the way in is different too. Law graduates become judges by passing a competitive exam to enter training straight after graduating. The fact that positions are allocated on academic merit rather than via a tap on the shoulder makes a big difference. The women who dream of power-sharing BBC 100 Women 2018: Who is on the list? Olivette Otele: The UK's only black female history professor Why half of America panics when this woman falls ill More than six out of 10 judges in France are female, butthe position comes with a loss of pay,external. Lawyers can often earn more working in private practice. Some of the highest percentages of female judges are found in post-Soviet societies. LikeSlovenia, seven out of 10 judges in Romania and Latvia are women,external. Under communism the role of the judge was not only poorly paid but much constrained by ideological factors - the real power lay elsewhere. The judiciary in these countries still has a relatively low reputation and earning power. In other professions, it is often the case that women have gained power following a period of change, or upheaval. For example, in communist-era Bulgaria, journalism was primarily a function of the state. But after 1989, press freedom grew and many well-educated and entrepreneurial women changed their career path and now have parity in top-level newsroom jobs. In Rwanda, parliamentary gender quotas were introduced in 2003. The move came after the the destruction of government institutions during the genocide of 1994. Rwandan President Paul Kagame with 80 new MPs in September 2018 That six out of 10 parliamentarians is now femaleputs it ahead of every other country worldwide,external. But here too there are questions over what real power looks like. Rwanda's male leader,President Paul Kagame, has been accused of being authoritarian. Some have argued that having large numbers of female MPs offers little in the way of concrete power. More stories like this The ordinary people making the world more right-wing How a 'concrete floor' could get more women into power Why working from home was never an easy option The puzzle of the people least likely to vote Tory On the other hand, others have pointed to the wider social effects of women's presence in parliaments. This may include increased respect for women from family and community members, and greater ability for women to influence decisions. So what does all this tell us? The relationship between women and power is complex and it's difficult to draw strong conclusions from looking at any one statistic - it's important to always look at the bigger picture. While we may still have a long way to go, we know that having more women in top positions - even if they're not perfect - can be symbolically powerful,increasing people's acceptance of female leaders,external. Nonetheless, one thing does seem clear: when things are done the way they've always been done, change happens very slowly - if at all.

"Ruth Wilson played her real-life grandmother, Alison Wilson, in the BBC drama Mrs Wilson BBC One's Mrs Wilson - in which the actress Ruth Wilson plays her own grandmother - has shone an unforgiving light on the author, spy and bigamist Alexander Wilson. But not one living soul knows the whole truth about Alexander - my grandfather - except maybe inside MI5. When the many strands of Alexander's story began to emerge a decade or so ago we joked that it would have to be made into a film one day. And we turned to my sister Ruth and said: ""And you can play Granny!"" And she did. In fact she went further, making our grandmother Alison the central character in the drama -which became a three-part series in the end, rather than a film. It may not have been the obvious choice to focus on Granny, but the decision was fine by me because the gruelling poverty and psychological torture Alison endured as a result of Alexander's actions and lies deserved equal billing with his exploits. At a preview screening last month, about 50 members of my extended family gathered to see the story brought to life. At the end we were left stunned to silence, many in tears, at what felt like the culmination of our shared past. But there is still more to discover. After he died in 1963, the fabrications Alexander - known as Alec - had built up during his 22-year ""marriage"" to Alison quickly collapsed. He was still married to his first wife - there had never been a divorce - making Alison, as well as Alec, a bigamist. The country manor he had promised they would inherit was a sham, along with his aristocratic lineage. It would eventually emerge that he had two further families, with seven children in all. Mrs Wilson showed Alec, portrayed by Iain Glen, being recruited as a British spy in India His credentials as a cad and bounder seem beyond dispute. But they are disputed by his children - each one of whom remembers him as a devoted dad. ""He was very kind, very generous, very loving,"" recalled Mike Shannon, Alec's son from his second marriage. But Mike was victim of the cruellest deception in the whole story. He was told at the age of nine that his father had been killed in the war, when in fact he had moved across London to set up home with my grandmother. He only found out the truth six decades later. What makes Alec's story so compelling is the maze of contradictions, where it is difficult to grasp what is truth and what is not, let alone what his motives were. ""His invention was extraordinary, and how do you pick out truth from untruth, after all this time?"" Mike told me. We know some truths because of Alison's private memoir. It tells how she met the charismatic older man, a best-selling spy author, while working for MI6 in London in 1940, where he translated and she transcribed bugged telephone calls from London embassies. She fell deeply in love, got pregnant, and they married. But their life quickly spiralled into extreme poverty. He was first sacked, then imprisoned twice, and declared bankrupt. ""Stunned, sick and cold with terror"", she was left desperate for somewhere to live with two lice-ridden young boys. Even after his death, she was drawn into the deception, keeping her sons in the dark for decades about their father's other family. Alexander and Alison Wilson met while working for MI6 in 1940 The other side of Alec's story has been pieced together by Prof Tim Crook, a journalist and academic who dug and scoured and prodded, tracking down the children from each of his four bigamous marriages, thereby helping to unite an extended family that was spread between Southampton and Edinburgh. In Mrs Wilson, the battle for the truth is personified by Alec's two spy handlers - Coleman, the woman who ran the MI6 office in London, and Shahbaz Karim from Lahore - an invented character, since there are few records from his time in India in the 1920s. Viewers are left trying to decipher how much of his story was devised by the secret services, just as we in the family are now. According to Coleman's version, Alec was the author of his own downfall. His fall from grace was the rightful punishment due to a pathological pretender. Karim, however, puts Alec's side of the story in Mrs Wilson. His sacking and subsequent ostracisation by MI6, his convictions for wearing false uniform and embezzlement, were all part of the cover that would allow him to get close to fascists in prison and other intelligence targets. This is what Alec told my grandmother in as many words. This might seem far-fetched. And why would we believe a word Alec said when deception came so easily to him? But we should remember that there are not just two possibilities - the hapless scapegoat, or the deluded fantasist - there is a whole host of possibilities in between. And Prof Crook has unearthed several anomalies which are hard to explain, and may lend credence to Alec's version. Alec's dismissal from MI6 was apparently because he'd staged a fake burglary at his own flat. We know this because ""C"" himself (the chief of MI6) said so in a 1943 letter marked ""most secret"", which was released in 2013 following Prof Crook's first biography of Alexander Wilson. But there are no records of any inquiry or prosecution for this fraud, and Alison makes no mention of it in her memoir. While Alexander Wilson's output as an author is undisputed - he had more than 20 books published in the 1920s and 30s - his records at his main publisher have been lost. Nor is there any trace of his membership of the Author's Club in Whitehall. Could this be a ""sanitisation"" operation? Fiona Shaw as Coleman, the woman who ran the MI6 office in London, in the drama The biggest unanswered questions surround the claim that Alec had faked his translations at MI6, concocting reports implying the Egyptian ambassador was running a spy ring apparently to benefit Nazi Germany. The spy ring was investigated by MI5, which eventually concluded (after Alec's sacking) that it did not exist and Alec's translations were fabricated. But historical context suggests his reports may have been credible. There is now plenty of evidence that some factions in Egypt were actively helping Nazi Germany during the El-Alamein campaign, on the promise of real Egyptian independence if Britain was defeated. And Egypt's ambassador in London, Nachat Pasha, was a known nationalist activist who plotted to overthrow the pro-British government in Cairo. What nobody disputes is that Alec was a fervent patriot. He wrote many letters pleading to be allowed to serve in World War Two despite his injuries from the previous war. Perhaps the spy writer had detected espionage in the Egyptian conversations, and was only embellishing his translations to raise the alarm? C wrote that Wilson had ""a blameless record, first-rate linguistic abilities, remarkable gifts as a writer of fiction, and no sense of responsibility in using them!"" In the 1943 letters between C and other spymasters they agreed that Alec should never be allowed to work in an official capacity again. It is quite possible that they also warned publishers to steer clear of him. His prolific writing career ground to a halt. That's why Alison - and her sons Nigel (my father) and Gordon - spent years destitute. To make such a sweeping order the MI5 evidence against Alec must have been strong - but it is still being withheld. It was not included in the partial release of files in 2013 for reasons of national security, leaving the family unable to form a rounded view. The direct descendants of Alexander Wilson and their partners gathered in 2018. The four surviving sons Dennis, Gordon, Nigel and Douglas are seated in the middle Personally, I'm dubious that the file would provide the exoneration that many of the Wilsons would welcome. But we'd still like the full picture. ""As things stand our father has been left in limbo as unreliable and a public danger,"" my father says. ""I think he was better than that, but if the files are released and prove otherwise, so be it. ""That would be a better conclusion than the current stench of concealment."" My dad is 74. Dennis, Alec's oldest surviving son, is 97. And Mike, the son from his second ""marriage"" who was told his father was killed in World War Two, died in 2010. Prof Crook has appealed again for the report to be released, 75 years on. As my dad says: ""All we want is the truth.""

"Dustin Lance Black explored the subject of surrogacy for BBC Radio 5 live Dustin Lance Black and his husband, Olympic diver Tom Daley, became parents for the first time in June 2018, having their son Robbie Ray through surrogacy. Mr Black, an Oscar-winning screenwriter, and Mr Daley used a gestational surrogate in California, and a different egg donor, to have Robbie Ray. ""The greatest gift I've ever had in my entire life is this son that I'm holding and I didn't do it alone,"" Mr Black told a specially recorded podcast for BBC Radio 5 Live. ""There are two women out there who made this possible."" In the lead-up to Robbie Ray's birth, and after he'd arrived, Mr Black investigated the personal, scientific, financial and legal aspects of surrogacy. He said the process made him rethink the couple's relationship with their egg donor, adding that he and Mr Daley were now planning to take Robbie Ray to meet her next year. It was through conversations with campaigners such as Jessica Kern, who was born through surrogacy, that led Mr Black to re-examine how important their egg donor might be to their son when he grows up. Ms Kern, who lives in Virginia, in the US, wasn't told that she was born via a surrogate but found out through medical records when she was a teenager. ""It's kind of a major sticking point for me that those of us conceived via these technologies, we don't have the rights to know our own story,"" she said. ""You're going to be bringing a kid into the world who is donor conceivedâ¦ you don't have any guarantee that your child is going to feel positive about it at the end of the day. ""It's a roll of the dice... I just wish you guys luck,"" she told Mr Black. Dustin Lance Black and Tom Daley plan to take their son to meet their egg donor Mr Black said he believed it was important for people to understand the difference between gestational and traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate's own eggs are used. ""That first concern you heard so often... 'How could you rip this child out of its mother's arms?' - which of course is something Tom and I would never want to do - that goes away when people start to understand the science."" Mr Black, who grew up as a Mormon, said that as a child he had thought he'd never have a family of his own, because of his sexuality. ""I wondered at six years old if I'd ever have that, because at six years old I also realised for the first time that I was gay."" Part-way through the recording of the podcast, the couple flew from their home in the UK to California in preparation for the arrival of Robbie Ray. Mr Black revealed how the pair went shopping to get ready for the baby. Browsing the aisles, he said, the realisation he was about to become a father had suddenly struck him. ""And now here I am, in Babies R Us, shopping for nappies, and wipes, and a car seat. And it's happening. It's happening. ""Thanks to a lot of hearts changing, laws changing, and now thanks to science, and the great generosity of a surrogate, and an egg donor. Here I am, about to be a dad."" Mr Black and Mr Daley shared the news they were expecting a baby on Valentine's Day 2018 Mr Black described the moment their surrogate contacted them, at 15:00 local time, saying: ""Boys, get to the hospital!"" He said they had raced through LA rush-hour traffic for the birth. He said they had decided in advance that he would cut the cord and Mr Daley would hold the baby first - ""skin-to-skin, to start creating that bond"". The podcast highlights many differences between UK and US surrogacy law, including that in California intended parents can be made the legal parents before the birth. ""When we walked out of that hospital, we had a birth certificate with our names on it that said: 'Father one and father two, Tom Daley and Dustin Lance Black'.  And we knew our son was not only ours in our hearts but also legally and protected that way."" Due to UK surrogacy laws, which are currently under review, Mr Black and Mr Daley are now in a lengthy legal process to become their son's legal parents in the UK, a process Mr Black said ""breaks your heart"". The couple shared the news of the baby's arrival on social media Weeks into their new life as parents, Mr Black opened up about the couple's determination to get it right when making decisions about their son's relationship with the women who helped bring him into the world. Mr Black said his eyes had been opened to ""the potential benefits of having an even closer relationship with our egg donor"" and he had now started to see surrogacy through the eyes of the children born via this method. He said they wanted their son to be proud of how he had been born and, having investigated surrogacy, he now believed the best way to do that ""is to open the door, to open the windows, and let the light and the truth of who he is and how he came into our family be as evident as possible"". Helen Greenwood with her baby and her surrogate, Caz As part of the podcast, Mr Black also met Helen Greenwood, whose toddler was born through traditional surrogacy, via surrogate Caz, in 2017. Helen, from the north-west of England, said she and her husband were planning to be open with their daughter about how she had been conceived and born, presenting it as something normal. ""She's going to meet other children who were born through surrogacy, she's going to meet other surrogates and their families."" And she said, like Mr Black, she hoped it was something her daughter would feel ""proud of"" when she was older.

"Around the world attitudes towards the use of cannabis are shifting. Mexico's new government plans to legalise recreational cannabis use, as does the incoming government of Luxembourg. Meanwhile, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardernis considering a referendumon what its approach should be. As public opinion - and that of governments - changes, it seems increasingly likely that other countries will follow, raising questions about how they work together to manage the use and supply of cannabis. What has led one country after another to move towards a relaxation of their laws and, in many cases, outright legalisation? It was only in 2012 that Uruguay announced it would be the first country in the world to legalise recreational cannabis use. In large part, the move was aimed at replacing links between organised crime and the cannabis trade with more accountable state regulation. Later the same year, voters in Washington State and Colorado became the first in the US to support legalisation of the drug for non-medical use. Under President Barack Obama, a critic of the US-led war on drugs, the US government stepped back from enforcing federal laws and effectively gave states a green light to explore alternatives. Eight more states and Washington DC have since supported the legalisation of recreational cannabis and penalties are softening elsewhere. The use of the drug for medical reasons is allowed in 33 of the 50 states. In many ways the jury is still out on the effects of legalisation on society and individuals' health, but there is no question that public opinion and government policy has softened. Health risks of recreational cannabis Cannabis debate: What you need to know Does UK export the most legal cannabis? The tide has crept across the Americas, withCanada legalising the sale, possession and recreational use of cannabis nationwide in October. That Mexico will legalise marijuana seems a virtual certainty. The new government of AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador has introduced a bill that would legalise its medical and recreational use, while the country's supreme court recently ruled an absolute ban on recreational use unconstitutional. Other countries are pushing ahead. Although the sale of cannabis remains illegal, possession of small amounts is no longer a crime in countries including Brazil, Jamaica and Portugal. In Spain it is legal to use cannabis in private, while the drug is sold openly in coffee shops in the Netherlands. Still more countries allow the use of medicinal cannabis. Around the world, there are many more countries where change is under way: In the UK, doctors have been allowed to prescribe cannabis productssince November South Korea has legalisedstrictly-controlled medical use,external, despite prosecuting residents for recreational use overseas A death sentence given to a young man selling cannabis oilhas stirred debate about legalisation in Malaysia South Africa's highest court legalised the use of cannabisby adults in private places Lesotho became the first African country to legalise the cultivation of marijuanafor medicinal purposes Lebanon is considering the legalisation of cannabis production,externalfor medical purposes, to help its economy In many countries, the move towards legalisation started with a softening of public attitudes. In the US and Canada, images of sick children being denied potentially life-changing medicines had a tremendous impact on public opinion - a concern that brought forward legalisation for medical purposes. Alfie Dingley's mother Hannah Deacon said cannabis oil helped manage his epilepsy A similar softening of attitudes has been seen in the UK. In June, 12-year-oldBilly Caldwell, who has severe epilepsy, was admitted to hospitalafter his medical cannabis oil was confiscated. A month later, a special licence to use cannabis oil was granted toseven-year-old Alfie Dingley, who has a rare form of epilepsy. Following high-profile campaigns, the UK government changed the law to allowdoctors to prescribe cannabis products. As US states such as California found in the 1990s and 2000s, familiarity with medical cannabis can soften attitudes towards recreational use. But in the UK, the Home Office says the recreational use of cannabis will remain banned, although senior figures, including former Conservative leader William Hague, have suggested a rethink. Mexico has also had cases of children being denied medical cannabis, but it has also been motivated by the extraordinary violence of its drugs war. Although marijuana makes up a relatively small share of drug cartel revenues, continuing to ban it is seen as increasingly at odds with reality. Mexican diplomats warned the US it was difficult to enforce the fight against cannabis when the neighbouringAmerican state of California legalised recreational use. Farmers harvest a cannabis crop in Germany With countries worldwide moving towards some form of legalisation, others are rushing to catch up. Often, as in many parts of Latin America, governments want their farmers to have access to the potentially lucrative medicinal cannabis markets that are developing. Corporations have also expressed interest. For example, Altria, which owns cigarette brands including Marlboro, has made a$1.86bn (Â£1.46bn) investment in a Canadian cannabis company. Over time, as the US demonstrates, it is quite possible that the medical trade could quite easily morph into recreational sales - potentially opening up an even bigger market. One immediate obstacle is that cannabis for recreational purposes cannot be traded across borders. Countries can only import and export medicinal cannabis under a licensing system supervised by the International Narcotics Control Board. Farmers in countries such as Morocco and Jamaica may have a reputation for producing cannabis, but they can't access markets that domestic producers sometimes struggle to supply - as happened in Canada following legalisation.

Governments that want to move towards legalisation face a challenge: steering a course between uncontrolled legalisation and hard prohibition. Poorly-regulated industry and mind-altering substances are not a combination about which many societies would feel comfortable. But it seems a virtual certainty that more countries will change their approach to cannabis in the coming decades. As such, domestic and international rules will need to catch up.

" On an ancient monument near Republique, fresh graffiti scars the old grey stone - its garish scrawl a slash of anger above the pigeons serenely scratching beneath the arch: “Down with caviar, long live the kebab!”  A lone shout in a breadcrumb-trail of slogans, marking the path of protesters through Paris last weekend. This boulevard of the French capital became, for a few hours that day, an urban battlefield. Under vast posters showing the latest releases, lines of riot police and armoured vehicles filed past the grand old Rex cinema.  In front of them, protesters pulled together barricades from street furniture, as trees were set alight and tear gas filled the air. “Franck”, who wouldn't give his real name, was among the protesters on Saturday.  A construction worker from the Calais region, he says he supports the protests, and came to Paris with four of his friends to join them. They were carrying gas masks and other protective gear. Franck was prepared for trouble - his friends, he says, were looking for it.  By the time they arrived on the boulevard near Republique, they were part of a group of more than 100 people. “They were overturning cars, breaking shop windows, they set fire to anything they could,” he says.  “I’d never seen anything like it.  It was anarchy, total chaos.  It was war. Everything was on fire - bins, cars, the protective hoarding around the shops. “The police charged us - the atmosphere was very tense.  And the protesters, we all felt like we were in it together.” French protests have often seemed like a dance between demonstrators and police - direct action has a long and cherished history here.  But these weekly confrontations between people and state are different. Not led by any union or political party, the “yellow vest” protests have unleashed the worst civil disorder Paris has seen for decades. Four people have been killed, many hundreds injured and billions of euros of damage inflicted on the country’s urban centres. The French government at one point warned of “serious violence” and “fears for democracy and its institutions”, with at least one protest spokesman calling on people to march on the Elysee Palace, the home of the president. There is a difference between legitimate protest and unacceptable violence, the government has repeated, time after time. And yet the power of this movement lies, not in the violence at its margins, but in the quiet support of what polls suggest is more than half the country for its basic aims. Protesters demonstrate on their knees against rising costs of living in Lille President Emmanuel Macron came to power vowing to face down protesters and drive through long-postponed economic reforms. For the first 18 months of his presidency, that’s exactly what he did - forcing through changes in the labour law against a backdrop of noisy public protests, and bulldozing past broad, union-led demonstrations on railway reform. This current crisis erupted - not over a flagship issue - but over a fiscal detail in the budget for next year, a routine rise in eco-taxes on fuel.  It wasn’t even a policy that the current government had made.  The commitment to annual tax rises on fuel - and especially diesel - in order to fund eco-friendly projects had been part of the previous government’s legacy to Macron. But it was enough to spark a small local rebellion - a handful of motorists who started displaying their regulation hi-vis jackets, or gilets jaunes, in the windscreens of their cars and posting their actions on Facebook. French President Emmanuel Macron (C) in Paris Now a movement created on social media, with no recognised leadership, has forced President Macron into concessions that were unthinkable a few weeks ago.  How? Because this is not a confrontation about fuel taxes, or any one issue. It’s about power. It’s no accident that cars were the spark that ignited this anger.  Not needing one has become a status symbol in France. Those in city centres have a wealth of public transport to choose from, but you need to be rich enough to live in the centre of Paris or Marseille or Bordeaux, and most people are not. “Economic growth happens in big globalised cities, but the working classes no longer live there,” says Christophe Guilluy, an independent researcher specialising in human geography.  “That’s a major change.  For the first time in history, they don’t live where wealth and jobs are created. They live in a ‘peripheral France’, characterised by weak economic growth, high unemployment and high anxiety.” “This economic model creates enormous wealth,” he continues. “But it creates it in a concentrated and unequal way. Since the 1980s, what we are seeing is a weakening of all categories of the middle class.” Tower block in la Cite des 4000 in La Courneuve in the Paris suburbs Outside the ring roads that encircle Paris, and other major French cities, you will find the suburbs and satellite towns where workers like Nouria Benatia live.  And the gap between the world she works in, and the one she can afford to live in, is growing. She commutes into central Paris every day to work as a receptionist in a smart hotel just off the Champs-Elysees.  After this month’s violent protests in the capital, she says the hotel has emptied and bookings have nose-dived. But she has little sympathy for business owners here. “To be honest, I still have the same salary, so what does it change for me if the business is working or not?” she says.  “I [still] have to go outside Paris to live, and come in to work every day. If the protests were more peaceful, maybe I’d join them.” Protesters block a road leading to the Frontignan oil depot Without a car, those in France who have been priced out of the big cities would struggle to get to work, take their children to school and even to shop for groceries. Petrol prices here are roughly the same as in Germany or the UK - and French diesel prices generally lie somewhere in between its two neighbours. But there is a more general sense of unfairness - a feeling that the struggling middle class are being asked to shoulder more than their fair share of the burden, while France’s millionaires have seen their top rate of tax slashed.  And the pain was felt especially keenly this year, because rises in the global oil price had already made fuel more expensive. In September this year, the government announced its planned increase in the eco-taxes levied on petrol and, particularly, on diesel. Shortly afterwards, the first motorists began showing off their hi-vis jackets in the windscreens of their cars, and Jacline Mouraud, a hypnotherapist from Brittany, published a video on social media saying that motorists were being “hunted”. French protester Jacline Mouraud Months earlier, Priscillia Ludosky, the manager of an online cosmetics company from just outside Paris, had launched a petition on the website Change.org calling for petrol prices to be lowered.  After the announcement on tax rises, it really began to take off, quickly gathering a million signatures - but still, she says, there’s been no response from the government. “We are not understood, we are not heard, our opinions are not sought on the big decisions,” she explains.  “I get the impression that when the president speaks to people in the street, he’s completely detached from reality.” Priscillia Ludosky (C) and Eric Drouet (R) Then, in October, truck driver Eric Drouet, another initiator of the movement, suggested on Facebook the idea of a national blockage, calling on protesters around the country to block roads in their area on 17 November, obstructing and slowing traffic in order to get the government’s attention. About 290,000 people took part. The gilets jaunes movement had begun. “The movement started around a tax rise,” says Christophe Guilluy, “but I think it’s simply a pretext, in the same way that Brexit is not fundamentally a confrontation with Europe, but first and foremost a way for people to say ‘we exist’. “In France, people are using the gilets jaunes as a way to say ‘we exist’ to the elites, to the political class, to those who have forgotten about them for the past 20 years, for the simple reason that they no longer live in the same place.” A map of the planned protests to take place on 17 November, collated by the group 'Blocage 17 Novembre' A Christmas tree overlooks the motorway toll station at La Ciotat, 45 minutes’ drive outside Marseille, its tinsel and baubles catching the light from braziers flaring in the drizzle.  The protesters here, as on other blockades across France, are settling in for Christmas.  Their tents are well stocked with food and drink from local well-wishers, and the noise from supporters honking their horns as they pass along the road frequently drowns out conversation. More than a dozen people stand around in their hi-vis jackets, well wrapped up  in hats and gloves against the cold.  Many protest sites, like this one, have developed into semi-permanent camps, snaking along the roadside, with plenty of cover from the elements, and supplies of basic necessities stacked neatly on wooden pallets. Many are 24-hour operations, and more often than not, there are small rivalries and animated discussions over who should speak for the group. Antonin Olles is a retired technology teacher.  He says social media has played a key role in creating this movement, and restoring to people here a role in the national debate. “The government wasn’t aware of the power of social media in giving a voice to people who weren’t being heard,” he says, beneath the ear-splitting blares of passing lorries.  “Not only does it let people air their grievances, it also lets them communicate with people who feel the same way. These people don’t often get to speak to the TV or the newspapers.  It’s a way for them to mobilise; to show they exist.” Antonin Olles Some have questioned whether the movement was helped by a change toFacebook’s algorithms. Posts from companies and the media became less prominent, with individual contributions given a boost.  But, as with other social media uprisings, the roots of this one run deep. Guilluy says France is no longer just looking at an economic or a social crisis, but a democratic one: “You have here groups that have not been represented for a very long time by the big political parties.  Those who join this movement are those that vote least, the most disengaged from public life. They wanted to have their voice heard, but they haven’t had a way to do it.” Olles thinks that politicians, union leaders and other representatives have all been discounted. “People ask themselves - how can this person stand up for me if they don’t know what my life is like?  They are relocating everything from villages to big cities - there are fewer local schools, fewer local doctors or hospitals.  One woman needed a helicopter ambulance to take her hospital in time to give birth.  It’s no wonder people feel like they’re being abandoned.” The irony, for Emmanuel Macron, is that he came to power promising to rebuild trust in politics, especially among those struggling to thrive in the new, globalised economy.  This is the last chance, he told me on the campaign trail last year - if he was to fail, next time it would be Marine Le Pen. The reforms he promised were designed, he said, to create wealth in order that it could be shared with those who needed it most. It was a policy that aimed to liberalise and protect, but many here feel that the social protection for workers has fallen short compared with the liberal reforms enjoyed by businesses. (From L) French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, French President Emmanuel Macron and French Ecology Minister Francois de Rugy meet with representatives of trade unions President Macron pushed through reforms where previous presidents had feared to tread - reducing the power of the unions in workplace relations, ending the special benefits enjoyed by railway workers, and making it easier for companies to hire and fire staff. He also ended the wealth tax on all assets apart from property, meaning a 70% cut in the tax for France’s millionaires. It was meant to boost investment in the economy, but it was seen by many poorer voters as further proof that this former banker-turned-president was still primarily a friend of business, not of the squeezed working and middle class. Winners and losers in France's 2018-2019 budgetSource: Institut des Politiques Publiques France’s Public Policy Institute recently published a review of who had gained and lost under Macron’s presidency so far. It found that the buying power of the poorest in society had slightly shrunk, while those in the economic middle had slightly gained. But the biggest winners were the richest 1%. This sense of unfairness emerges time and again in the graffiti that has appeared on walls and monuments in Paris.  Much of it calls for the resignation of Macron, or simply the “fall of the regime”.  On the Republic’s famous monument at Republique, someone has changed the revolutionary right of “universal suffrage” to read “universal suffering”. Graffiti reads: ""The people want the fall of the regime"" If the roots of protesters’ frustration lie in the big economic shifts of the 1980s, how far did Macron himself encourage it to bloom into open opposition? “In the last election, many people voted to change their situation and they still find themselves here, so they’ve started to get frustrated,” says protester Antonin Olles.  “They’ve realised that those who govern them don’t know what real life is like - for them, poverty is just a set of numbers.” Despite his warnings against populist nationalism, there have been times when President Macron seemed unaware of the tensions swirling beneath the surface of French society, leading to criticism that he’s aloof and out of touch. At a public event at the Elysee Palace earlier this year, he told a 25-year-old gardener who complained of not finding work that he would easily find a job if he applied to hotels, restaurants or construction sites.  “[If] I crossed the street, I’d find you one,” the president told him.  “So go ahead.” After four weeks of national protest, he addressed the nation in a bid to satisfy demonstrators and drain the movement of momentum.  What he offered was the most significant climb-down of his presidency so far - a monthly bonus of 100 euros for those on the minimum wage, an end to tax and social charges on overtime and workers’ annual bonuses, and a freeze in some pension charges. Protestors take notes as they watch French President Emmanuel Macron's speech on TV on 10 December 2018 There was also an admission that he had sometimes got things wrong. “I know some of the things I’ve said have hurt you,” he said - but there was no formal apology and no change in the government’s economic course.   Further reforms planned for next year - on pensions and unemployment insurance - are still set to go ahead. Instead, the president’s response was to look for solutions at the local level.  He announced an unprecedented national debate - on the environment, immigration, decentralisation and political disengagement.  He also said he wanted to meet France’s mayors “region by region” to build the basis of a “new contract with the nation”. La Penne-sur-Huveaune's town hall The town hall at La Penne-sur-Huveaune, 20 minutes’ drive from La Ciotat, is painted salmon pink. Three huge French flags hang from the poles above the entrance. Dangling from one of them is a hi-vis motorist’s jacket, a gilet jaune. Christine Capdeville is the Communist mayor of La Penne-sur-Huveaune.  When I ask her what she thinks of President Macron’s solution to the crisis, she laughs. Mayor of La Penne-sur-Huveaune, Christine Capdeville “President Macron has ignored us from the moment he came to power,” she says. “And now, all of a sudden, he wants us to come to his rescue! “Can I be honest with you,” she asks. The idea of a national consultation is “absolute rubbish. We’re going to get a piece of paper asking for our grievances, and that’s it. Then everything will carry on just like before.” The call has gone out for another day of national protest - the fifth consecutive weekend for the gilets jaunes, or “Act 5” as it’s being called.  Franck is already planning to come back to Paris with his friends to see more of the action. The violence he saw last week near Republique will stay with him for the rest of his life, he says.  But he liked the atmosphere: “Everyone is together, we are all one, a very good team.  It’s not every day you see that.” That sense of unity among the protesters is what has given the movement its energy, and its power. Sylvie and Christophe arrived on the Champs-Elysees last Saturday by 09:00.  I met them walking up the near-empty boulevard towards the Arc de Triomphe with a group of friends. “She’s far left,” Christophe told me, “and I’m far-right - and we’re here together for the gilets jaunes!” “That’s what Macron doesn’t like,” he continued. “That we’re united.  He’s brought back solidarity among the French.  He’s turned everyone against him.  We’re united in combat - at least for now.  After that, who knows?” Student Sylvie “Our strength is that we’re apolitical,” Sylvie said. “Maybe later when there are new presidential elections, we’ll put together a leaflet, but for the moment we don’t need a leader - that’s our strength.” Are you scared there might be violence here today, I asked her? “No,” she replied.  “We have nothing left to lose.” President Macron won last year’s election by cannibalising France’s traditional centre-right and centre-left parties.  It deepened splits within the remaining opposition - and has helped keep the political opposition in check ever since. Now, that divided opposition has been replaced by a social movement that has also united people from left and right, in the same way that Macron did - along with many of those who are disillusioned with traditional politics altogether. Bruno Bonnell is an MP and founder member of the president’s party, La Republique En Marche. He says the gilets jaunes could emerge as the new opposition to Emmanuel Macron. MP Bruno Bonnell “This [movement] looks like ours did originally,” he said in the lobby of the National Assembly.  “I remember En Marche when people were saying we had no programme and we didn’t know where we were going.  We were debating in bars and cafes, trying to reinvent the world. “This movement is more about resistance, it’s populist like the Five Star movement or Podemos, but if they gather effectively with leaders and representatives, then we’ll finally face a clearer opposition.” He says he had visited protest sites many times to ask, specifically, what demonstrators wanted, but that every proposal he made was rejected. “We are now beyond that.  It’s a political conversation, not a conversation about money or compassion.” Some protesters see a future as a political party.  But so far, diversity has been the movement’s appeal - the right of each of its 10,000 members to speak only for themselves.  Distrust of representatives is so strong that even the few spokespeople to emerge have come under heavy criticism, even death threats. But without a leader, or a cohesive agenda, what future does this movement have? “The leader ought to be the president of France,” Anthony Joubert, one of the founders of the movement, says.  “It’s he who has to understand us.  He should be spending his time listening, instead of creating a situation where restaurants can charge 15 euros for a bottle of water.  As things stand the gilets jaunes are leading ourselves.  We are an assembly.  We are a national assembly.” Back at the barricade at La Ciotat, Antonin Olles has gravitated towards the makeshift barbecue as some of the protesters watch a few small piles of sardines crisp on the coals. There is talk about the next protest - some in La Ciotat say they’re planning to demonstrate here, rather than make the trip up to Paris. Protesters cook sardines at the tollbooth between La Ciotat and Aubagne Many have cautioned against dismissing this movement too quickly, even if the level of protest and violence in the capital falls. “The absence of a complete eruption last Saturday doesn’t mean the protest is easing,” cautioned the daily Le Figaro earlier this week.  “[The president] won’t win over the country by pulling out his cheque-book or flaunting his intellect, he needs to open his heart.” “We want a second French revolution,” Olles says.  “We want to show the rest of Europe that the people have some power.” France was seen from the outside as having avoided a populist revolution 18 months ago - but the election of Emmanuel Macron simply papered over France’s problems.  Fixing them will take a whole lot more. Built with Shorthand",Negative,0.019659106
"This video can not be played President Macron says he is 'partly responsible' for the 'insufficient response' to the yellow vest protests A woman at the forefront of the ""yellow-vest"" protest movement in France has called for a ""truce"" in response to a series of concessions from President Emmanuel Macron. Jacline Mouraud said protesters couldn't ""spend the rest of our lives on roundabouts"". Other leaders have rejected his plans. Having already scrapped a fuel tax rise, Mr Macron promised an extra â¬100 (Â£90; $114) a month for minimum wage earners and tax cuts for pensioners. France has seen four weekends of violent protests from demonstrators known as gilets jaunes - or ""yellow vests"" - over fuel tax rises, living costs and other issues. French press weigh Macron's 'risky gamble' An opinion poll carried out in the wake of Mr Macron's speech,externalsuggested 59% of French people surveyed were unimpressed by his measures, while 40% were. By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris Measures to defuse France's yellow-vest protests will cost â¬10bn (Â£9bn; $11bn), says Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. That money will be offset by cuts in other government spending, he says. Mr Le Maire told British and American journalists that planned reforms remained on course despite the concessions and France would still honour deficit-to-GDP targets set by the EU. ""France's attractiveness (for investors) is at stake. That is why it is so important to maintain the path of reform,"" he said. ""We want to stick to our European commitments. We will do our best to reduce the level of public spending and be as close as possible to 3% in 2019."" Read more from Hugh:Spending cuts to fund Macron concessions The biggest promise was on the minimum wage, or ""Smic"", and affects 2.6 million people, according to the government. Initially described as a monthly increase in the Smic, it became clear that the government instead intended to speed up a planned increase in a supplement for minimum wage earners known as an ""activity premium"". That way, employers would not be taxed on the income. Other key concessions included: Cancelling a planned tax increase for pensioners on less than â¬2,000 a month Scrapping tax on overtime pay Removing tax from end-of-year bonuses for 2.3 million employees next week However, President Macron refused to reinstate a tax on the wealthy, saying ""this would weaken us, we need to create jobs"". Other reforms to pensions, unemployment benefit and public spending would go ahead as planned, he said. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe was set to spell out the proposals to the National Assembly on Tuesday, a week after he first suspended the fuel tax rise and then scrapped it altogether. France U-turn after fuel tax rise protests Police sources told French TV news channel BFMTV that 170 protests were still taking place on Tuesday, involving 45 road blockades and fewer than 2,000 people. The most receptive response to Mr Macron's speech came from Jacline Mouraud, 51, whose viral video complaining about fuel taxes is thought to have kick-started the yellow-vest movement. ""We now have to get out of this crisis,"" she said. An estimated 23 million French viewers watched Mr Macron's TV appearance on Monday night. Other protest leaders were more combative. Dozens of roads were still blocked on Tuesday as not every protest leader was impressed by Mr Macron's comments Maxime Nicolle, whose videos have been shared by protesters, said it was ""too little, too late"". Another key voice, Benjamin Cauchy, complained of the president's ""half measures"". ""â¬100 is all very well for minimum-wage types but what's in it for all the middle-earners struggling under enormous financial pressure?"" Employers' organisation Medef praised the measures, because they were focused on people's purchasing power but did not target businesses themselves. One of the president's key allies, Modem party leader Francois Bayrou, praised Mr Macron's proposals as a change of era, not merely for his presidency but in the context of the past 30 years. ""You can't have economic progress without social justice, if every citizen doesn't feel involved,"" he said. The protesters began as a grassroots French provincial movement with people donning high-visibility yellow jackets, which by law must be carried by every vehicle in France. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Will the environment be the true victim of France's riots? Who supports the protesters? Anger at planned fuel tax rises then included broader issues involving families struggle to make ends meet, with calls for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions and easier university entry requirements. Big protests in central Paris turned violent, and there are calls for a fifth Saturday of protests on 15 December. 17 November:282,000 protesters - one dead, 409 wounded - 73 in custody 24 November:166,000 protesters - 84 wounded - 307 in custody 1 December:136,000 protesters - one dead, 263 wounded - 630 in custody 8 December:136,000 protesters - 118 wounded - 1,220 in custody Who are the 'gilets jaunes'?

"Jo Johnson quit last month, calling the Brexit deal ""a terrible mistake"" Theresa May is trying to ""run down the clock"" and minimise Parliament's role in Brexit, a former minister has said. Jo Johnson - whoresigned as transport ministerover the PM's handling of negotiations - said MPs should be given a vote on her Brexit deal next week. His comments come as Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it is still possible to get ""a version"" of Mrs May's Brexit deal approved by Parliament. Another cabinet minister, Amber Rudd,called for cross-party co-operation. MPs were due to vote on Mrs May's Brexit deal on Tuesday, but it was postponed when the prime minister admitted it would have been ""rejected by a significant margin"". Mr Johnson - who is Boris Johnson's brother but voted Remain in the referendum - said he was concerned by the way Downing Street was treating Parliament. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""No 10 could try to leave that vote until the very last minute. ""Effectively, giving the country, giving Parliament, no choice at all except between her deal... and no deal at all."" He added: ""It's simply unacceptable to run out the clock and face the country with the prospect of being timed-out."" Kuenssberg: An issue of trust Theresa May's week in charts Reality Check: Does Brussels blink? Labour and the SNP have both said the prime minister should stop wasting time and put the deal to a vote in Parliament. After postponing the vote in Parliament, Mrs May travelled to Brussels to make a special plea to EU leaders, in a bid to make her deal more acceptable to MPs. However, the EU said there could be clarification but not renegotiation. This video can not be played Theresa May: 'If we are to leave with a deal this is it' Many of Mrs May's MPs are concerned that the ""backstop"" - which is aimed at preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland - would keep the UK tied to EU rules and limit its ability to strike trade deals. On Saturday, Mr Hunt said the EU needed to listen to appeals from the British government to provide ""legally enforceable language"" that the backstop would be temporary. He told Radio 4: ""The thing that the House of Commons will not accept is any risk of us being permanently trapped through the Northern Irish backstop in the customs union."" He added that the ""only way"" the deal would get through Parliament was ""to have a version of the deal that the government has negotiated"". However, BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar said the problem remained that only ""an end date or a key to the exit door"" would make it possible for the deal to be supported by MPs. He added: ""The EU has shown no indication, publicly or privately at any point, that it is willing to give that."" How could another Brexit referendum work? Brexit: A really simple guide Why isn't Labour trying to topple May now? Ms Rudd said she supported Mrs May's deal but advocated assembling a ""coalition"" to avoid what she called ""the rocks of no deal"". ""We need to find a plan that a majority in Parliament can support,"" she said. ""We need to try something different. Something that people do in the real world all the time, but which seems so alien in our political culture - to engage with others and be willing to forge a consensus."" One idea, favoured by at least one cabinet minister, is a series of votes on other plans, such as a relationship similar to Norway's with the EU, or another referendum. By BBC political correspondent Tom Barton A cabinet split? Certainly, a disagreement between senior ministers over the viability of Theresa May's Brexit deal. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, telling Radio 4's Today programme that it will be possible to get ""a version"" of the prime minister's Brexit deal approved by MPs. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, openly musing in the Daily Mail that the government needs need ""to try something different"" because Parliament is currently headed towards ""no compromise, no agreement and no deal"". For the foreign secretary, the risk of no deal works as leverage in the UK's attempt to get the EU to reconsider the detail of the Northern Ireland backstop, warning European leaders that ""they can't be sure"" Parliament would stop it. For Amber Rudd, it's something which ""for the sake of all our futures, mustn't be allowed to happen"". Nigel Farage told a Leave Means Leave rally it was time for Brexit supporters to prepare for another referendum At a Leave Means Leave rally in London on Friday, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage told the BBC it was ""outrageous"" another referendum could happen, but added: ""I can see where we're going."" Mr Farage added the treatment of Mrs May in Brussels this week had been a ""shaming moment"" for both the UK and the EU and that the prime minister's Brexit deal was now ""dead"".

"The French capital is experiencing its fifth Saturday of tear gas and clashes ""Yellow vest"" protesters have gathered in Paris and other cities for a fifth consecutive Saturday of demonstrations. Protesters defied a government call to suspend the action following Tuesday's attack on Strasbourg's Christmas market where a gunman killed four people. However, fewer people turned up - 66,000 altogether, officials said, compared to 125,000 last Saturday. The movement, initially against a rise in fuel taxes, now addresses other issues, including education reforms. The gilets jaunes Macron promises divide protest leaders Are the Yellow Vests spreading beyond France Seven people have died in the ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vest) protests so far, the latest in an accident resulting from a blockade by protesters on Friday. About 69,000 police have been mobilised across France to prevent a repeat of the violence of previous weeks. In Paris, slightly more than 2,000 took to the streets on a cold and rainy day, compared to 10,000 last week. This video can not be played Yellow vests: Is the symbol spreading across Europe? Police stopped and questioned 168 people in the capital, detaining 115. Scuffles broke out on the Champs-ElysÃ©es several times during the day, with police using tear gas and water cannon. However, as night fell, the iconic boulevard was reopened to traffic. Some women dressed as ""Marianne"", a symbol of the French Republic Seven people were injured. Some museums were closed, but both the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower remained open. In Nantes, there were scenes of tension In Marseille, this protester holds a sign demanding a ""citizens referendum"" In Bordeaux, more than 4,500 protesters took to the streets. Police had to use water cannon to disperse them. A similar number protested in Toulouse. In Nantes, some 1,200 protesters saw rounds of tear gas fired at them. Similar scenes occurred in Avignon and BesanÃ§on. In Calais, a group of ""yellow vests"" blocked the access road to the port. Analysis by Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris A few hundred desultory figures in day-glo vests wander up and down the Champs ElysÃ©es.  Occasionally there are whoops and jeers, followed by a bang and a bit of gas.  A group of protesters has got too close to a police cordon, and a show of force pushes them back. The mini-panic lasts about 15 seconds. That is about the extent of the fifth yellow-vest demonstration, which confirms the downward trend of last Saturday.  Maybe the troublemakers will enter the game like they did last week - but it can't be on the same scale, because today there simply aren't enough bona fide protesters around to give them cover. The ""gilets jaunes"" who have turned out seem to be the hardline left-wing element. There is a lot of talk about the ""RIC"" - Citizens' Initiative Referendums. This is a demand of the far-left leader Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon - and a long way from the yellow vests' original call, which was for a simple cut in fuel tax (long since conceded). The movement - or at least the Saturday protest movement - is shrinking and hardening. The impact of the demonstrations has been keenly felt in France. The government has been forced to bow to pressure and adjust its economic course. President Emmanuel Macron responded to the nationwide street protests by scrapping an unpopular fuel tax rise, and promising an extra â¬100 (Â£90; $114) a month for minimum wage earners and tax cuts for pensioners. However, it is far from clear that he has done enough to defuse public anger. The protesters adopted the name after a social-media campaign urging people to take to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow jackets that must be carried in every vehicle in France. They were initially protesting against a rise in duties on diesel, which is widely used by French motorists and has long been less heavily taxed than other types of fuel. Mr Macron had said higher taxes on fossil fuels were needed to fund renewable energy investments. Will the environment be the true victim of France's riots? Who supports the protesters? But protests have also erupted over other issues, including calls for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions and easier university entry requirements. The movement's core aim, to highlight the economic frustration and political distrust of poorer working families, has widespread support. 17 November:282,000 protesters - one dead, 409 wounded - 73 in custody 24 November:166,000 protesters - 84 wounded - 307 in custody 1 December:136,000 protesters - one dead, 263 wounded - 630 in custody 8 December:136,000 protesters - 118 wounded - 1,220 in custody Who are the 'gilets jaunes'?

"J Hus was jailed for eight months on Friday, after being found guilty of carrying a knife For many people living in east London, the Westfield that opened in Stratford in 2011 was a blessing. J Hus probably only has bad memories of it. The shopping centre has been the setting for numerous arrests and altercations the rapper's been involved in over the last seven years. He wassentenced on Fridayto eight months in prison, after admitting to carrying a knife when a car he was in was stopped outside the shopping centre. It wasn't the first time he'd been in trouble there. Stratford Westfield is the largest shopping centre in Europe When J Hus - real name Momodou Jallow, of Baldwin Drive, Peterborough - was 16, in 2011, he was arrested outside Westfield following a ""mass attack"" on four people, which ended in one of them being stabbed. He'd already received a referral order that year after being caught with a knife in public. Four years later, he was released on bail after chasing a man down the road outside Westfield with three or four other people, ""brandishing a large combat knife or a machete"". While still on bail, the following year, he was chased down by police and found in possession of a ""large silver combat style knife"" in Hackney, which he said he intended to hand in. The court heard that J Hus ""failed"" to leave his past behind him after finding success with music In 2015, J Hus was stabbed twice, something judge Sandy Canavan said had resulted in mild PTSD - post-traumatic stress disorder. When asked why he was carrying a six-inch blade following the most recent arrest, J Hus said: ""You know, it's Westfield."" Just six days earlier, a friend of J Hus was sitting in a car owned by the rapper, when he was stabbed and left paralysed. ""What was your response?"" the judge asked on Friday. ""It was to go to Westfield in Stratford with a lock knife in your possession. There was absolutely no good reason for you to go shopping there, you could have gone somewhere where you would not be so easily recognisable, would not be under threat, where you would not need to carry a knife. ""Instead you chose to go somewhere, understanding the risks, where you would be very likely to be recognised, both by those who liked and admired you and those who did not and who might wish you harm."" J Hus was unable to perform at Wireless following his arrest but performed at Parklife earlier in the summer After previous arrests J Hus said the reason he carried a knife was fear. He'd had problems with gangs in Newham, the area he grew up in. The 23-year-old moved his family from there to Peterborough, but was still drawn back to Westfield like a ""moth to a flame"", according to the judge. Out of 44 police services in England and Wales,38 have recorded a rise in knife crime since 2011. The increase is the result of cuts to youth funding, according to Mayor of London Sadiq Khan - who says it's a problem that could take 10 years to solve. This video can not be played Knife crime could take a ""generation"" to solve, according to Sadiq Khan Some people though have blamed violent music such as UK drill, which often features darker lyrics. Grime artist Novelist has described it as ""murder music"". J Hus has been credited for helping lead a chart-friendly genre referred to as afro swing or afrobashment, which fuses elements of music from the Caribbean and Africa with the UK. His debut album Common Sense was nominated for a BRIT award as well as the Mercury Prize. But his lyrics still referenced the violence he'd grown up living around. The track Dark Vader, which was released this year, was taken off the Radio 1 and 1Xtra playlist following his arrest in June. Common Sense reached number six in the UK chart, and got J Hus Mercury Prize and Brit Award nominations It featured lyrics about a ""skeng"" - a patois term for a knife or gun. ""If I can't have you, nobody can / Bare face so they all know who I am / If you saw what the skeng done to the man / You wouldn't look at me, you'd go look your friend."" Dianne Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said in parliament this week that ""much of the drill music and videos are horrifying and appalling"". ""But at the end of the day, the music is a reflection of those young people's lives and realities. ""It is not a cause of violent crime.""

"US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is leaving his post at the end of the year, President Donald Trump says, in the latest high profile departure from his administration. In a tweet, President Trump thanked Mr Zinke for his service, saying he had ""achieved much during his tenure"". He said he would appoint a new interior secretary next week. Mr Zinke, an ex-Navy Seal and a former Montana congressman, has been embroiled in allegations of ethics violations. The White House revolving door: Who's gone?

The interior department oversees federal land, including national parks such as Yosemite and Yellowstone. Mr Zinke has faced scrutiny over expensive trips in US Park Police helicopters and on private jets. Costly alterations at his department also came in for criticism, including reports that three sets of double doors in his office were being upgraded at a cost of nearly $139,000 (Â£110,000). He later said he had negotiated the price down to $75,000. The New York Times has also publisheda guide to the investigations into Mr Zinke,external. According to the newspaper, he is facing scrutiny for blocking a Native American casino expansion after meetings with lobbyists opposing the plan, and for possible breaches of the Hatch Act - which stops federal employees from influencing elections by using their office. Mr Zinke has promoted oil drilling and coal mining, and worked to roll back environmental protections brought in under President Obama. Chuck Schumer, the Senate's most senior Democrat, was blunt in his condemnation. ""The swamp cabinet will be a little less foul without him,"" he tweeted. Allow Twitter content?

He said: ""Unfortunately, even with Secretary Zinke out, the interior department remains disturbingly biased in favour of special interests over the health of American communities and the public lands that they love."" It is not clear if Mr Zinke resigned, or was fired. News of Mr Zinke's departure comes just a week after the announcement that Mr Trump's chief of staff, Gen John Kelly, is to leave the White House.

"Delegates at climate talks in Poland have begun voting on details on how to implement the Paris climate agreement. The session was delayed by more than 30 hours amid disagreements - and some accusations that poor handling by the hosts was behind the delays. Ministers from around 100 countries are gathered in Katowice for the UN talks. The majority of the details have been settled, but there is an ongoing stand-off over the question of carbon credits and carbon markets to reduce emissions. Rich nations often reduce their emissions by paying for carbon-cutting projects in other countries. But these programmes are very difficult to police. Fraud and double accounting have rendered many of them worthless - they are often dubbed hot air schemes. Climate change talks run into extra time US, Saudis and Russia block climate report Failure to tackle warming 'suicidal' At these talks, Brazil has been pushing for a weaker set of rules on carbon markets, despite strong opposition from many other countries. A suggested compromise would see the discussions on markets kicked down the road to next year. Ministers and negotiating teams say they are happy to agree to this idea. But they insist it is up to the Polish presidency of the conference to lead the way. And some negotiators are already unhappy about the way their Polish hosts have allowed the conference to meander. This video can not be played No more beef? Five things you can do to help stop rising global temperatures On Friday, organisers released a new text intended to form the basis of a deal. The outline decision contains plans for a common rulebook for all countries, with flexibility for poorer nations. Developing countries seek recognition and compensation for the impact of rising temperatures. The idea of being legally liable for causing climate change has long been rejected by richer nations, who fear huge bills well into the future. Prof Myles Allen, from the University of Oxford told BBC News: ""Climate change is already affecting many people around the world and the people most affected by climate change are not those who have historically contributed most to the problem."" But many observers believed that, overall, a degree of progress has been made. ""It was never going to be great, not least because the US is playing a laggard role, but I think we can get a decent outcome, if it's framed in the right way,"" said Alden Meyer from the Union of Concerned Scientists. In the final week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterresreturned to the meeting to try to push it to a successful conclusion. ""To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change,"" Mr Guterres said. ""It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal."" And the former president of the Maldives and now their lead negotiator, Mohamed Nasheed, said that there would be ""hell to pay"" if countries did not come together at the summit to prevent temperatures shooting past 1.5C. Last weekend, scientists and delegates were shocked when the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwaitobjected to the meeting ""welcoming"" a recent UN reporton keeping global temperature rise to within the 1.5C limit. The report said the world is now completely off track, heading more towards 3C this century. Keeping to the preferred goal would need ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"". Prof Allen said: ""For countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia, where an enormous chunk of their national income arises from sales of fossil fuels, this is a much deeper problem, and that's where sticking points are arising."" Representatives from 196 states are trying to sort out some very tricky questions about the rulebook of the Paris agreement, which comes into force in 2020. These are the regulations that will govern the nuts and bolts of how countries cut carbon, provide finance to poorer nations and ensure that everyone is doing what they say they are doing. It sounds easy but is very technical. At the moment countries often have different definitions and timetables for their carbon cutting actions. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA Poorer countries want some ""flexibility"" in the rules so that they are not overwhelmed with regulations that they don't have the capacity to put into practice. ""Flexibility can mean a lot of things and I think some countries are using that word to delay having to implement rules, and others are worried because they don't have the capacity to do it,"" said Jennifer Morgan from Greenpeace. There's a strong push to recognise the science of the IPCC, which earlier this yearproduced a critical reporton how the world would be impacted by temperatures rising by 1.5C this century. The decision to welcomethis report was rejected amid controversyearlier in the conference when Saudi Arabia, the US, Kuwait and Russia wanted to just take note of the report. When consensus couldn't be found, the text about the IPCC was dropped - to considerable surprise. This is being seen as something of a win for those four countries. ""There are 196 countries in the UN and 192 counties agree,"" said Mohamed Nasheed. ""We are just talking about four that do not agree, and these four are taking us hostage."" There has been a big push here for countries to up their ambition, to cut carbon deeper and with greater urgency. Many delegates want to see a rapid increase in ambition before 2020 to keep the chances of staying under 1.5C alive. Right now, the plans that countries lodged as part of the Paris agreement don't get anywhere near that, described as ""grossly insufficient"" by one delegate from a climate vulnerable country. Business is also looking for a signal from this meeting about the future. ""Companies are ready to invest and banks are ready to finance,"" said Carlos Salle from Spanish energy conglomerate, Iberdrola. ""So we need that greater ambition in the policy to enable business to move further and faster."" Poland holds the COP presidency but there has been concern that they lack an overall picture of what should emerge from the meeting. Most people want to see a strong Paris ""rulebook"", a commitment by countries to raise their ambitions and carbon-cutting promises before 2020 and some clarity on how much money will be delivered to poorer countries - as well as when it will arrive. While some negotiators say the Poles are doing a good job in difficult circumstances, many are critical, saying they are responding to the needs of the rich not the poor.

The zoo tweeted,externalthe blaze was in its Monsoon Forest habitat. One person was treated for the effects of smoke inhalation but there were no other reports of injuries. Fifteen fire crews have been tackling the blaze. In a statement,,externalthe zoo said: ""Sumatran orangutans and other mammals are all accounted for. We are working hard to account for all other species."" Police said the fire was reported just before 11:30 GMT. The fire broke out in the Monsoon Habitat area Some zoo visitors tweeted images from the scene includingSophie Flynn,external, who said staff were ""working hard to deal"" with the fire, which ""happened very quickly"". ""It started as a little fire... which we saw but it's obviously much worse now!"" David Clough, who lives across the road from the zoo, said: ""We first saw signs of the fire shortly after 11.30 GMT."" He added: ""It was spreading across the roof in strong winds for a while. ""Lots of fire engines arrived quickly. ""We were very worried for the people and animals that would have been in the building."" Fifteen crews were involved in tackling the blaze The zoo tweeted,externalto say it had closed the whole site, adding: ""Visitors have been evacuated and our response team is working alongside emergency services to bring the situation under control."" Flames were fanned by today's very strong winds and raced across the roof of the Monsoon Forest enclosure. As hundreds of visitors were being evacuated from the wider premises, zoo staff were leading threatened animals to safety. The zoo has closed and we have no indication of when it will reopen. Of course an investigation has begun into the cause of the fire. Even though visitor numbers would have been much lower on a day of bad weather like today, this is obviously a very dramatic event for one of northern England's premier attractions. The Monsoon Forest habitat is the UK's largest zoological building, according to the attraction, and opened as part of the zoo's islands section in August 2015. The 14-acre section houses Sumatran orangutans, rhinoceros hornbills, crocodiles and a variety of plant species.

"J Hus was jailed for eight months on Friday, after being found guilty of carrying a knife For many people living in east London, the Westfield that opened in Stratford in 2011 was a blessing. J Hus probably only has bad memories of it. The shopping centre has been the setting for numerous arrests and altercations the rapper's been involved in over the last seven years. He wassentenced on Fridayto eight months in prison, after admitting to carrying a knife when a car he was in was stopped outside the shopping centre. It wasn't the first time he'd been in trouble there. Stratford Westfield is the largest shopping centre in Europe When J Hus - real name Momodou Jallow, of Baldwin Drive, Peterborough - was 16, in 2011, he was arrested outside Westfield following a ""mass attack"" on four people, which ended in one of them being stabbed. He'd already received a referral order that year after being caught with a knife in public. Four years later, he was released on bail after chasing a man down the road outside Westfield with three or four other people, ""brandishing a large combat knife or a machete"". While still on bail, the following year, he was chased down by police and found in possession of a ""large silver combat style knife"" in Hackney, which he said he intended to hand in. The court heard that J Hus ""failed"" to leave his past behind him after finding success with music In 2015, J Hus was stabbed twice, something judge Sandy Canavan said had resulted in mild PTSD - post-traumatic stress disorder. When asked why he was carrying a six-inch blade following the most recent arrest, J Hus said: ""You know, it's Westfield."" Just six days earlier, a friend of J Hus was sitting in a car owned by the rapper, when he was stabbed and left paralysed. ""What was your response?"" the judge asked on Friday. ""It was to go to Westfield in Stratford with a lock knife in your possession. There was absolutely no good reason for you to go shopping there, you could have gone somewhere where you would not be so easily recognisable, would not be under threat, where you would not need to carry a knife. ""Instead you chose to go somewhere, understanding the risks, where you would be very likely to be recognised, both by those who liked and admired you and those who did not and who might wish you harm."" J Hus was unable to perform at Wireless following his arrest but performed at Parklife earlier in the summer After previous arrests J Hus said the reason he carried a knife was fear. He'd had problems with gangs in Newham, the area he grew up in. The 23-year-old moved his family from there to Peterborough, but was still drawn back to Westfield like a ""moth to a flame"", according to the judge. Out of 44 police services in England and Wales,38 have recorded a rise in knife crime since 2011. The increase is the result of cuts to youth funding, according to Mayor of London Sadiq Khan - who says it's a problem that could take 10 years to solve. This video can not be played Knife crime could take a ""generation"" to solve, according to Sadiq Khan Some people though have blamed violent music such as UK drill, which often features darker lyrics. Grime artist Novelist has described it as ""murder music"". J Hus has been credited for helping lead a chart-friendly genre referred to as afro swing or afrobashment, which fuses elements of music from the Caribbean and Africa with the UK. His debut album Common Sense was nominated for a BRIT award as well as the Mercury Prize. But his lyrics still referenced the violence he'd grown up living around. The track Dark Vader, which was released this year, was taken off the Radio 1 and 1Xtra playlist following his arrest in June. Common Sense reached number six in the UK chart, and got J Hus Mercury Prize and Brit Award nominations It featured lyrics about a ""skeng"" - a patois term for a knife or gun. ""If I can't have you, nobody can / Bare face so they all know who I am / If you saw what the skeng done to the man / You wouldn't look at me, you'd go look your friend."" Dianne Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, said in parliament this week that ""much of the drill music and videos are horrifying and appalling"". ""But at the end of the day, the music is a reflection of those young people's lives and realities. ""It is not a cause of violent crime.""

"People have downloaded the raw images of Jupiter and processed them, often revealing new details of its surface Nasa's Juno mission to the gas giant Jupiter has reached its halfway mark and has revealed new views of cyclones at the poles. As it orbits the planet every 53 days - Juno performs a science-gathering dive, speeding from pole to pole. Its sensors take measurements of the composition of the planet, in an effort to decipher how the largest world in our Solar System formed. Mapping the magnetic and gravity fields should also expose Jupiter's structure. JunoCam has seen giant cyclones at the poles Butimages from JunoCam - a camera that was intended to capture images that could be shared with the public,external- has already given us some surprising insights. This video can not be played A video made of 21 images gives a spectacular view of a Juno 'dive' Dr Candice Hansen, from the Planetary Science Institute in Arizona, is leading the JunoCam project, which she described as ""our little outreach camera"". She presented some of the remarkable images from the camera - raw images downloaded and processed by members of the public - at the American Geophysical Union meeting here in Washington DC. The world's most remote island Sun-skimming probe starts calling home Space laser makes height maps of Earth Detailed images have revealed how one storm takes the shape of a dolphin ""When we made our first pass over the poles, we knew we were seeing a territory on Jupiter we had never seen before,"" said Prof Hansen. ""What we did not expect was that we would see these orderly polygons of cyclones; huge storms - twice the size of Texas. ""We thought, wow  - that's spectacular."" And 16 passes later, she added, those orderly arrangements of giant storms are still there. The Juno mission has set out to uncover Jupiter's deep structure and the secrets of its formation These ""pretty pictures"" are starting to teach scientists about how the largest planet in the Solar System formed and evolved. ""The objective for the Juno mission is to study the interior structure of Jupiter and how that structure expresses itself out on the cloud tops. That's the kind of connection we're trying to make.

"Pupils at Ysgol Gymuned Rhosybol on Anglesey will not be buying staff Christmas gifts A school has asked parents not to buy Christmas presents for teachers in a bid to relieve pressure on families and support those in need. Ysgol Gymuned Rhosybol on Anglesey asked parents who wanted to give gifts to donate to charity instead. One parent said teachers she knew would be ""mortified"" if parents felt pressured to buy presents they could not afford. And another described the move as ""quite a relief"". Claire Hughes, a teaching assistant and parent at the school, said the idea was prompted by the school's head teacher after reading about the financial burden gift giving placed on families. 'I spend Â£400 on each of my five kids' The early Christmas gift many of us now buy Is it ever OK to charge family for Christmas lunch? She said during the festive period, the staff room could be filled with around twenty boxes of chocolates from parents, on top of other gifts. Mrs Hughes said: ""We felt quite guilty receiving gifts and felt that we needed to change what happens here in our school."" She added that a Christmas card was more than enough. Teaching assistant and parent Claire Hughes said a Christmas card was more than enough Mrs Hughes explained that when they told pupils they would not be doing presents, they were ""initially quite disappointed"". However, it led to the decision for children to give to charity instead, such as food banks - although Mrs Hughes explained there is no pressure for them to donate at all. She added that the children are ""realising the importance"" of helping people at Christmas. As a result, her six-year-old son Caleb decided to create his own box for an Anglesey homeless charity. Caleb donating his box to the charity, Digartref Ynys Mon She explained that as a parent, not having the burden of buying gifts for staff is a ""relief"". ""I find it quite a relief myself, not having to worry about what to give them"", she said. ""As staff know I appreciate just a thank you."" Cathryn Scott, who runs parenting blog Cardiff Mummy Says, said that it is ""natural"" for parents to want to thank teachers over Christmas. But the mother-of-three added that although it is not something she experiences, reports of parents competing to buy presents are ""worrying"". ""I have a lot of friends who are teachers and I know they would be mortified if they thought parents were feeling pressure to buy gifts they can't afford."" At her children's school, parents can contribute Â£5 to buy vouchers for the class teacher and teaching assistants, and Ms Scott says there is no way she could buy individual gifts for all her children's teachers. Part of the note sent out by the Anglesey primary school A primary school teacher in Cardiff, Frances Herbert, explained that children enjoy giving the presents to teachers, but said she does feel guilty sometimes. ""Especially when only working part time! But children love watching you open something."" Harriet Warren, a mother from Cardiff, said her children opted to make homemade gifts. ""My three children have each made a bauble for their teachers, instead of joining in with the parents' group collection"", she explained. ""I felt it was a more personal gift which they enjoyed doing and saved me a little bit of money."" Christmas gifts for teachers: Yes or no?

"A federal judge in the US state of Texas has ruled that a key part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare, is unconstitutional. Twenty states argued the whole law was invalidated by a change in tax rules last year which eliminated a penalty for not having health insurance. President Donald Trump said the ruling was great news for America. The law's provisions will, however, remain in place until an appeal is heard at the US Supreme Court. President Trump promised to dismantle Barack Obama's landmark 2010 healthcare law, which was designed to make medical cover affordable for the many Americans who had been priced out of the market. Has Trump killed off Affordable Care Act? Obamacare v Republican plan compared But despite his Republican Party having majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the ACA is still operating. However, in 2017 Congress did repeal the requirement - the so-called individual mandate - that people buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Mr Trump took to Twitter following the judge's ruling in Texas. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He also urged incoming Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to ""pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare"". The ruling came a day before the deadline for Obamacare enrolment for the coming year. Two Republicans - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his Wisconsin counterpart Brad Schimel led the legal challenge. Sitting in Fort Worth, US District Judge Reed O'Connor noted that a $1.5tn tax bill passed by Congress in 2017 eliminated the tax penalties which anyone who failed to obtain health insurance had to pay. He ruled that the individual mandate was now unconstitutional. As the individual mandate was an ""essential"" element of the ACA, the whole of Obamacare was therefore unconstitutional, Judge O'Connor said. He said his ruling was concerned with the intentions of the 2010 and 2017 Congresses. ""The former enacted the ACA. The latter sawed off the last leg it stood on."" Health care provision in the US has long been a divisive issue Ms Pelosi described the ruling as ""cruel"" and ""absurd"" and said it would be repealed. She said it exposed ""the monstrous endgame of Republicans' all-out assault on people with pre-existing conditions and Americans' access to affordable health care"". Mr Schumer, meanwhile, said the ruling appeared ""to be based on faulty legal reasoning and hopefully it will be overturned"". He said that if it was upheld in the higher courts ""it will be a disaster for tens of millions of American families, especially for people with pre-existing conditions"". The decision is almost certain to be challenged in the US Supreme Court. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said that the law would remain in place for the time being, pending further legal developments. This video can not be played 'Trump not thinking about the little people' Meanwhile, the White House called on Congress to replace Obamacare with an affordable healthcare system which protects people with pre-existing conditions. But other states have argued that eliminating Obamacare would harm millions of Americans, and pending any appeal the landmark health care law remains in place. US Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said: ""If this awful ruling is upheld in the higher courts, it will be a disaster for tens of millions of American families.""

"Delegates at climate talks in Poland have begun voting on details on how to implement the Paris climate agreement. The session was delayed by more than 30 hours amid disagreements - and some accusations that poor handling by the hosts was behind the delays. Ministers from around 100 countries are gathered in Katowice for the UN talks. The majority of the details have been settled, but there is an ongoing stand-off over the question of carbon credits and carbon markets to reduce emissions. Rich nations often reduce their emissions by paying for carbon-cutting projects in other countries. But these programmes are very difficult to police. Fraud and double accounting have rendered many of them worthless - they are often dubbed hot air schemes. Climate change talks run into extra time US, Saudis and Russia block climate report Failure to tackle warming 'suicidal' At these talks, Brazil has been pushing for a weaker set of rules on carbon markets, despite strong opposition from many other countries. A suggested compromise would see the discussions on markets kicked down the road to next year. Ministers and negotiating teams say they are happy to agree to this idea. But they insist it is up to the Polish presidency of the conference to lead the way. And some negotiators are already unhappy about the way their Polish hosts have allowed the conference to meander. This video can not be played No more beef? Five things you can do to help stop rising global temperatures On Friday, organisers released a new text intended to form the basis of a deal. The outline decision contains plans for a common rulebook for all countries, with flexibility for poorer nations. Developing countries seek recognition and compensation for the impact of rising temperatures. The idea of being legally liable for causing climate change has long been rejected by richer nations, who fear huge bills well into the future. Prof Myles Allen, from the University of Oxford told BBC News: ""Climate change is already affecting many people around the world and the people most affected by climate change are not those who have historically contributed most to the problem."" But many observers believed that, overall, a degree of progress has been made. ""It was never going to be great, not least because the US is playing a laggard role, but I think we can get a decent outcome, if it's framed in the right way,"" said Alden Meyer from the Union of Concerned Scientists. In the final week, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterresreturned to the meeting to try to push it to a successful conclusion. ""To waste this opportunity would compromise our last best chance to stop runaway climate change,"" Mr Guterres said. ""It would not only be immoral, it would be suicidal."" And the former president of the Maldives and now their lead negotiator, Mohamed Nasheed, said that there would be ""hell to pay"" if countries did not come together at the summit to prevent temperatures shooting past 1.5C. Last weekend, scientists and delegates were shocked when the US, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Kuwaitobjected to the meeting ""welcoming"" a recent UN reporton keeping global temperature rise to within the 1.5C limit. The report said the world is now completely off track, heading more towards 3C this century. Keeping to the preferred goal would need ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"". Prof Allen said: ""For countries like Russia and Saudi Arabia, where an enormous chunk of their national income arises from sales of fossil fuels, this is a much deeper problem, and that's where sticking points are arising."" Representatives from 196 states are trying to sort out some very tricky questions about the rulebook of the Paris agreement, which comes into force in 2020. These are the regulations that will govern the nuts and bolts of how countries cut carbon, provide finance to poorer nations and ensure that everyone is doing what they say they are doing. It sounds easy but is very technical. At the moment countries often have different definitions and timetables for their carbon cutting actions. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA Poorer countries want some ""flexibility"" in the rules so that they are not overwhelmed with regulations that they don't have the capacity to put into practice. ""Flexibility can mean a lot of things and I think some countries are using that word to delay having to implement rules, and others are worried because they don't have the capacity to do it,"" said Jennifer Morgan from Greenpeace. There's a strong push to recognise the science of the IPCC, which earlier this yearproduced a critical reporton how the world would be impacted by temperatures rising by 1.5C this century. The decision to welcomethis report was rejected amid controversyearlier in the conference when Saudi Arabia, the US, Kuwait and Russia wanted to just take note of the report. When consensus couldn't be found, the text about the IPCC was dropped - to considerable surprise. This is being seen as something of a win for those four countries. ""There are 196 countries in the UN and 192 counties agree,"" said Mohamed Nasheed. ""We are just talking about four that do not agree, and these four are taking us hostage."" There has been a big push here for countries to up their ambition, to cut carbon deeper and with greater urgency. Many delegates want to see a rapid increase in ambition before 2020 to keep the chances of staying under 1.5C alive. Right now, the plans that countries lodged as part of the Paris agreement don't get anywhere near that, described as ""grossly insufficient"" by one delegate from a climate vulnerable country. Business is also looking for a signal from this meeting about the future. ""Companies are ready to invest and banks are ready to finance,"" said Carlos Salle from Spanish energy conglomerate, Iberdrola. ""So we need that greater ambition in the policy to enable business to move further and faster."" Poland holds the COP presidency but there has been concern that they lack an overall picture of what should emerge from the meeting. Most people want to see a strong Paris ""rulebook"", a commitment by countries to raise their ambitions and carbon-cutting promises before 2020 and some clarity on how much money will be delivered to poorer countries - as well as when it will arrive. While some negotiators say the Poles are doing a good job in difficult circumstances, many are critical, saying they are responding to the needs of the rich not the poor.

"Father Don LaCuesta used the funeral at Our Lady of Mount Carmel church in Temperance, Michigan to condemn suicide Parents of a teenage boy who took his own life have complained after their Catholic priest criticised him at the funeral for killing himself. Father Don LaCuesta in the service questioned whether Maison Hullibarger, 18, would enter heaven, horrifying his parents and family. The Archdiocese of Detroit have relieved Father LaCuesta from funeral duties, but the family want him fired. Catholicism has traditionally taught that suicide is an unforgiveable sin. Only recently has the church said that extreme psychological stress could mean forgiveness for those who take their own lives. 'I lost three sons to suicide' Suicide reporting 'should be more sensitive' Maison, from Temperance, Michigan, took his own life on 4 December. His parents Jeff and Linda Hullibarger sought the help of their priest, Father LaCuesta, before the funeral. ""We wanted him to celebrate how Maison lived, not how he died,""Ms Hullibarger told the Detroit Free Press,external. But the priest used the service at Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic church to attack their child. ""He was up there condemning our son, pretty much calling him a sinner,"" Mr Hullibarger said. ""He wondered if he had repented enough to make it to heaven. He said 'suicide' upwards of six times."" The Catholic Church has historically condemned suicide as an unforgiveable sin The appearance at the funeral against their wishes of their son's football coach, who reportedly bullied Maison and his brothers, added to their pain. A statement released by the Archdiocese of Detroit said Father LaCuesta would not preach at funerals ""for the foreseeable future"" and apologised for what happened, but the family want him removed from his post to stop him upsetting others. ""We're afraid that, like the Catholic Church does, they'll send him off and he'll do it to somebody else,"" Mr Hullibarger said.

"This video can not be played Looted bells returned to the Philippines Three bells looted by US troops more than a century ago have been returned to their church in the Philippines. President Rodrigo Duterte praised his countrymen and the US at a ceremony in Balangiga, where the treasures were taken 117 years ago. The bronze bells were seized during the Philippine-American War as part of reprisals following a massacre. In August, the US Embassy announced the return of the so-called Balangiga bells after decades of pressure. ""Nobody, but nobody, can claim a singular credit for the generous act of the Americans,"" Mr Duterte told a jubilant crowd on Saturday. ""The credit goes to the American people and to the Filipino people, period."" Why the Philippines matters to the US The country stuck between the US and China Philippines country profile The president had called for their return in a 2017 speech, in which he also suggested building closer ties with China. President Duterte rang one of the bells at the ceremony on Saturday The bells are viewed as a symbol of Philippine independence against their former colonial masters. Following the Balangiga massacre of 1901, when Filipino militants ambushed and killed 48 US troops, US General Jacob H Smith ordered the area be turned into a ""howling wilderness"". US troops seized the three bronze bells as war trophies during the bloody reprisals. Thousands of Filipinos are thought to have been killed. Despite calls for their return for decades, US veterans and politicians said the bells were tributes to the killed US troops and refused to consider their repatriation. One of the bells was with the US 9th Infantry Regiment in Korea and the other two were at a former 11th Infantry Regiment base in Wyoming. But after continued Filipino pressure and waning opposition in the US, the bells were flown to Manila earlier this week for Saturday's ceremony in Balangiga. Filipinos waved bell-shaped placards ahead of the repatriation ceremony ""We are the happiest people on Earth now,"" 81-year-old Nemesio Duran told AFP news agency. ""The whole town is walking in the clouds because the bells are finally with us."" However, for some the return struck a more sombre note. Constancia Eleba told AFP the bells gave her ""mixed emotions"" given the history surrounding them. ""It was painful and you cannot take it away from us,"" she said. ""We can never forget that.""

"The status of Jerusalem has long been a highly contested issue Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has confirmed that his government will recognise West Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. However, he said Australia's embassy would not move from Tel Aviv, until a peace settlement was achieved. He added Australia also recognised the aspirations of the Palestinians to a state with a capital in East Jerusalem. The status of Jerusalem is one of the most contested issues between Israel and the Palestinians. Opposition Labor party leader Bill Shorten said he would reverse the decision if he won next year's elections. US President Donald Trump drew international criticism last yearwhen he reversed decades of American foreign policy by recognising the ancient city as Israel's capital. The US embassy was relocated from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May. Why Trump and Jerusalem was not about peace Mr Morrison's announcement comes after a period of consultation with politicians in Australia and allies abroad. ""Australia now recognises West Jerusalem, being the seat of the Knesset and many of the institutions of government, is the capital of Israel,"" said Mr Morrison, speaking in Sydney on Saturday. ""We look forward to moving our embassy to West Jerusalem when practical... and after final status determination."" Mr Morrison said that in the interim Australia would set up a defence and trade office in West Jerusalem. This video can not be played Why the ancient city of Jerusalem is so important The prime minister also stressed that Australia was supporting ""liberal democracy"" in the Middle East. Analysis by Phil Mercer, BBC News, Sydney Scott Morrison's venture into Middle Eastern politics was a surprise to many at home.  The PM said Australia should use its ""incredible influence"" with Israel to try to end a ""rancid stalemate"" in the region. In October, Mr Morrison said he found arguments in favour of moving Australia's diplomatic presence from Tel Aviv to be ""persuasive"". He denied his comments were an attempt to influence Jewish voters in a crucial by-election in Sydney. Others believe he is out of his depth. Australia's federal opposition leader Bill Shorten said the decision not to relocate the embassy to West Jerusalem was a ""humiliating backdownâ¦ by an L-plate prime minister"". It is not a complete U-turn, though.  Australia is now one of the few countries to officially recognise West Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  Leaving the embassy in Tel Aviv should defuse some of the diplomatic anger simmering among Palestinian leaders and others, who had threatened trade and political sanctions if the move went ahead. When Mr Morrison first announced the policy review in October, he said his thinking had been guided by Australia's former ambassador to Israel, Dave Sharma. At the time, Mr Sharma was the government's candidate in a by-election in Sydney, but Mr Morrison denied his comments were aimed at the large Jewish community there. Mr Sharma lost the election, costing the governing coalition its one-seat majority. The policy review drew support from Israel, but criticism from the Palestinian side. The move also angered Australia's neighbour Indonesia, halting talks on a bilateral trade deal with the world's most populous Muslim nation. Why Australia fears upsetting Indonesia Some commentators said Mr Morrison, who is widely expected to lose elections next year, had sought to ease tensions with his distinction between East and West Jerusalem and by holding back on any embassy move. ""It is a combination of him being caught out by making an injudicious remark at a by-election, and then having to walk back from it,"" Rodger Shanahan, from Sydney-based think-tank the Lowy Institute, told AFP news agency. Mr Morrison's predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull, had ruled out following the US in moving Australia's embassy to Jerusalem. Two other countries - Guatemala and Paraguay - have announced they would also make the switch, butParaguay later reversed the decisionafter a change of government. The status of Jerusalem goes to the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Israel regards Jerusalem as its ""eternal and undivided"" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war - as the capital of a future state. Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem has never been recognised internationally, and according to the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords, the final status of Jerusalem is meant to be discussed in the latter stages of peace talks. Since 1967, Israel has built a dozen settlements, home to about 200,000 Jews, in East Jerusalem. These are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. In December 2017, UN member states voted decisively at the General Assembly in favour of a resolution effectively declaring US recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital to be ""null and void"" and demanding it be cancelled.

"MPs across the parties should try to ""forge a consensus"" over Brexit, the work and pensions secretary has said. In the Daily Mail,external, Amber Rudd wrote: ""Brexit is in danger of getting stuck."" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it would be possible to get ""a version"" of the prime minister's Brexit deal approved by MPs. But BBC deputy political editor John Pienaar says that without an end date to the controversial ""backstop"" plan, it has no chance of passing. Theresa May's bid to make her deal more acceptable to MPs suffered a blow when EU leaders said it was ""not open for renegotiation"". Last week, Mrs May delayed a vote in the House of Commons on her Brexit deal, fearing a heavy defeat. She then went on to win a confidence vote brought by her own MPs - but vowed to listen to the concerns of the 37% of Tory MPs who voted against her. Kuenssberg: An issue of trust Theresa May's week in charts She travelled to Brussels to make a special plea to EU leaders, to try to make her deal more appealing. However, the EU said there could be clarification but not renegotiation. By BBC political correspondent Tom Barton A cabinet split? Certainly, a disagreement between senior ministers over the viability of Theresa May's Brexit deal. Jeremy Hunt, the foreign secretary, telling Radio 4's Today programme that it will be possible to get ""a version"" of the prime minister's Brexit deal approved by MPs. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, openly musing in the Daily Mail that the government needs need ""to try something different"" because parliament is currently headed towards ""no compromise, no agreement and no deal"". For the foreign secretary, the risk of no deal works as leverage in the UK's attempt to get the EU to reconsider the detail of the Northern Ireland backstop, warning European leaders that ""they can't be sure"" Parliament would stop it. For Amber Rudd, it's something which ""for the sake of all our futures, mustn't be allowed to happen"". Ms Rudd - who backed Remain in the referendum - said she supported Mrs May's deal and advocated assembling a ""coalition"" to avoid what she called ""the rocks of no deal"". She said the country ""will face serious trouble"" if MPs ""dig in against the prime minister's deal"". ""We need to find a plan that a majority in Parliament can support,"" she said. ""We need to try something different. Something that people do in the real world all the time, but which seems so alien in our political culture - to engage with others and be willing to forge a consensus. This video can not be played Theresa May: 'If we are to leave with a deal this is it' ""It also requires everyone to abandon outrage and accusations."" How could another Brexit referendum work? Brexit: A really simple guide Many of Mrs May's own MPs are concerned that the controversial ""backstop"" plan - which is aimed at preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland - would keep the UK tied to EU rules indefinitely and limit its ability to strike trade deals. Mr Hunt said the EU needed to listen to appeals from the British government to provide ""legally enforceable language"" that the backstop would be temporary. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The thing that the House of Commons will not accept is any risk of us being permanently trapped through the Northern Irish backstop in the customs union."" He added: ""The only way that we're going to get through the House of Commons and give the British people the Brexit that they voted for is to have a version of the deal that the government has negotiated."" However, the BBC's John Pienaar said the problem remained that only ""an end date or a key to the exit door"" would make it possible for the deal to be supported by MPs. He added: ""The EU has shown no indication, publicly or privately at any point, that it is willing to give that."" Former Tory minister Jo Johnson, a Remainer who resigned over Mrs May's handling of negotiations, said MPs should be able to vote on her Brexit deal next week. He said it was ""unacceptable"" for the PM to ""run down the clock"" and leave Parliament with only a choice between her deal and no deal at all. One idea, favoured by at least one cabinet minister, is a series of votes on other plans, such as a relationship similar to Norway's with the EU, or another referendum, before next month's ""meaningful vote"" in the Commons. Nigel Farage told a Leave Means Leave rally it was time for Brexit supporters to prepare for another referendum At a Leave Means Leave rally in London on Friday, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage told the BBC it was ""outrageous"" another referendum could happen, but added: ""I can see where we're going."" Mr Farage added the treatment of Mrs May in Brussels this week had been a ""shaming moment"" for both the UK and the EU and that the prime minister's Brexit deal was now ""dead"". Branson: Hard Brexit will bankrupt UK Why isn't Labour trying to topple May now? Reality Check: Does Brussels blink? Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the withdrawal deal was now ""dead in the water"". He added: ""Rather than ploughing ahead and dangerously running down the clock, the prime minister needs to put her deal to a vote next week so Parliament can take back control.""

"The Boeing 737 was coming in to land at Stansted Airport A drone flying more than 20 times the allowed height came within 15m (50ft) of a Boeing 737 approaching a runway at Stansted Airport in Essex. The plane was flying at 10,000ft (3km) and coming in to land on 17 August when the captain spotted the drone. The first officer then saw ""a dark-coloured square or rectangle-shaped object pass down the right side of the aircraft with minimal separation"". The UK Airprox Board rated the risk of collision as the highest possible. After the incident, which happened at 16:36 BST, the plane was inspected on the ground and found no evidence of contact or damage. It is not known whether the Boeing 737 was carrying passengers or cargo. The drone operator, who it is understood has not been traced, was in breach of the Air Navigation Order 2009, which refers to flight safety of unmanned craft. Drones must not be flown inairspace above 400ft (121m),externalor in the vicinity of airports without permission from air traffic control and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The Airprox Board, which investigates near misses, said the drone was ""endangering other aircraft at that location"" and that ""providence had played a major part in the incident"".

"This video can not be played President Macron says he is 'partly responsible' for the 'insufficient response' to the yellow vest protests A woman at the forefront of the ""yellow-vest"" protest movement in France has called for a ""truce"" in response to a series of concessions from President Emmanuel Macron. Jacline Mouraud said protesters couldn't ""spend the rest of our lives on roundabouts"". Other leaders have rejected his plans. Having already scrapped a fuel tax rise, Mr Macron promised an extra â¬100 (Â£90; $114) a month for minimum wage earners and tax cuts for pensioners. France has seen four weekends of violent protests from demonstrators known as gilets jaunes - or ""yellow vests"" - over fuel tax rises, living costs and other issues. French press weigh Macron's 'risky gamble' An opinion poll carried out in the wake of Mr Macron's speech,externalsuggested 59% of French people surveyed were unimpressed by his measures, while 40% were. By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris Measures to defuse France's yellow-vest protests will cost â¬10bn (Â£9bn; $11bn), says Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. That money will be offset by cuts in other government spending, he says. Mr Le Maire told British and American journalists that planned reforms remained on course despite the concessions and France would still honour deficit-to-GDP targets set by the EU. ""France's attractiveness (for investors) is at stake. That is why it is so important to maintain the path of reform,"" he said. ""We want to stick to our European commitments. We will do our best to reduce the level of public spending and be as close as possible to 3% in 2019."" Read more from Hugh:Spending cuts to fund Macron concessions The biggest promise was on the minimum wage, or ""Smic"", and affects 2.6 million people, according to the government. Initially described as a monthly increase in the Smic, it became clear that the government instead intended to speed up a planned increase in a supplement for minimum wage earners known as an ""activity premium"". That way, employers would not be taxed on the income. Other key concessions included: Cancelling a planned tax increase for pensioners on less than â¬2,000 a month Scrapping tax on overtime pay Removing tax from end-of-year bonuses for 2.3 million employees next week However, President Macron refused to reinstate a tax on the wealthy, saying ""this would weaken us, we need to create jobs"". Other reforms to pensions, unemployment benefit and public spending would go ahead as planned, he said. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe was set to spell out the proposals to the National Assembly on Tuesday, a week after he first suspended the fuel tax rise and then scrapped it altogether. France U-turn after fuel tax rise protests Police sources told French TV news channel BFMTV that 170 protests were still taking place on Tuesday, involving 45 road blockades and fewer than 2,000 people. The most receptive response to Mr Macron's speech came from Jacline Mouraud, 51, whose viral video complaining about fuel taxes is thought to have kick-started the yellow-vest movement. ""We now have to get out of this crisis,"" she said. An estimated 23 million French viewers watched Mr Macron's TV appearance on Monday night. Other protest leaders were more combative. Dozens of roads were still blocked on Tuesday as not every protest leader was impressed by Mr Macron's comments Maxime Nicolle, whose videos have been shared by protesters, said it was ""too little, too late"". Another key voice, Benjamin Cauchy, complained of the president's ""half measures"". ""â¬100 is all very well for minimum-wage types but what's in it for all the middle-earners struggling under enormous financial pressure?"" Employers' organisation Medef praised the measures, because they were focused on people's purchasing power but did not target businesses themselves. One of the president's key allies, Modem party leader Francois Bayrou, praised Mr Macron's proposals as a change of era, not merely for his presidency but in the context of the past 30 years. ""You can't have economic progress without social justice, if every citizen doesn't feel involved,"" he said. The protesters began as a grassroots French provincial movement with people donning high-visibility yellow jackets, which by law must be carried by every vehicle in France. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Will the environment be the true victim of France's riots? Who supports the protesters? Anger at planned fuel tax rises then included broader issues involving families struggle to make ends meet, with calls for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions and easier university entry requirements. Big protests in central Paris turned violent, and there are calls for a fifth Saturday of protests on 15 December. 17 November:282,000 protesters - one dead, 409 wounded - 73 in custody 24 November:166,000 protesters - 84 wounded - 307 in custody 1 December:136,000 protesters - one dead, 263 wounded - 630 in custody 8 December:136,000 protesters - 118 wounded - 1,220 in custody Who are the 'gilets jaunes'?

"Visitors to this pub can't pay for their drinks or food with cash Cashless establishments may be safer and more convenient, but are they more popular with the public at large? After yet another break-in at south London pub the Crown and Anchor, Arber Rozhaja decided enough was enough. Burglars were after cash lying around after lock-up, but what if there was never any cash on site at all? Mr Rozhaja, operations director at the pub's parent firm, London Village Inns, calculated the volume of cash transactions and was bowled over. ""Somewhere in the region of 10-13% of the total revenue would be cash and the rest was card,"" he says. So in October, the Crown and Anchor went fully cashless. Customers can use debit cards, credit cards and contactless payments including Android Pay and Apple Pay. But a fiver will get you nowhere. Pub customers were given notice about the switch - a few have complained Signs dotted around the pub announced the move to customers: ""Apologies, but it is the digital age."" Four of the firm's pubs now refuse cash, with the remaining two set to turn their backs on notes and coins in the New Year. What began as a move to deter thieves has turned out to be a timely business decision, according to Mr Rozhaja. For staff at London Village Inns' businesses, the benefits of working in a cashless public house include not having to count up endless piles of coins at the end of the night. And managers no longer need to travel across town with bags of cash to be lodged at the bank. There are even additional charges to processing cash transactions versus digital ones, says Mr Rozhaja. He adds that while he's had a few complaints from customers, the response has generally been positive. There has been no discernible fall in business. Arber Rozhaja believes going cashless has not harmed his business at all ""It's a short time for me to have a proper analysis but if it was bad you would see straight away,"" he says. But is cash dying out in the UK? And what about the rest of the world? Why Sweden is close to becoming a cashless economy Who loses from a cashless society? BBC Capital - Does a cashless society benefit everyone? It was only in September thata pub in Suffolk claimed to be the first in the UK to go cashless,external. A string of""cashless cafÃ©s"",externalhas cropped up in Britain, too. And establishments that turn down ""hard"" currency are becoming more common all over the world. Take thetrendy eateries in New York,external, for example, which say ""no"" to readies. Or the new supermarket in Singapore whererobots pack your bags and banknotes are futile,external. EvenIkea in Sweden has experimented with a cashless outlet,external. While more establishments are going digital only, cash is far from dead yet Cash, as Mr Rozhaja found, is often a hassle. And if it accounts for a negligible fraction of turnover, why not drop it? Ikea found that so few people - 1.2 in every 1,000 - insisted on paying in cash that it was financially justifiable to offer them free food in the shop cafeteria instead. ""It's slightly surprising to me that there aren't more of these cashless places already,"" says Dave Birch, director of payments at Consult Hyperion, a research consultancy. He feels that some societies are embracing the cashless revolution more quickly than others. ""I was in Australia last week where the use of contactless is near ubiquitous. In fact, if you don't tap to pay for something it's regarded as rather strange already,"" he explains. Getting rid of cash frees up retail staff so they can spend more time with customers, adds Mr Birch. And tills stuffed with grotty banknotes don't clutter up serving space. UK Finance, a trade association, projects that in Britain cash will be used in just one fifth of all sales by 2026. In the last year alone, 4,735 cash machines have disappeared,according to research by Paymentsense,external.

But although cash may be taking a drubbing in some quarters, it remains stubbornly resistant. According toUS-based market research firm McKinsey, cash ""will be around for a long time"",external. ""Some [customers] prefer cash for reasons of privacy and security,"" a recent report notes. ""Others live in areas where poor cellphone coverage and frequent electricity outages make cash the most reliable way to pay."" It chimes witha recent survey carried out in the UK, Australia, Brazil and South Africa by currency exchange company Travelex,external. The research found that about a quarter of people would always refuse to go cashless - despite technological changes and the rise of digital payments. ""Cashless technologies will not replace cash completely... people are happier with an equilibrium between the two,"" Travelex notes. In many countries in Europe,the volume and value of ATM cash withdrawals is falling,external- but in some places the figures are rising. In some countries, such as China, cash is still the main method of payment Wherever the use of cash remains high, businesses may find that there are regulatory or legal barriers to going cashless. In July, for example,China's central bank said that companies and individuals should not refuse cash from customers,external. And in early December,Chinese retailer Hema was reprimanded by the bank,externalfor only accepting digital and card-based payments. China is an interesting case study. While city centres are rapidly embracing new technology and the affluent middle class may be happy to go digital, according to McKinsey the country is still an ""emerging"" market in terms of cashless payments. More than 80% of Chinese retail transactions are still cash-based. There are also ethical considerations. Some argue that cash-free establishments are discriminatory as they make it more difficult, or impossible, for homeless customers or those without bank accounts to shop there. Such concerns have led tolegal challenges against cashless establishments in the US,external. So is Mr Rozhaja worried about putting off people from a low or no-income background? ""No, it's easy to get a prepaid cash card online. Especially in London, I don't think it's possible for you to operate if you don't have some sort of a card,"" he says. But tensions around the issue mean that societies should now be trying to put in place cost-effective infrastructure for digital payments ""for everyone"", says Dave Birch. So while cash is undoubtedly declining, it is certainly not on its deathbed yet. ""A cashless society is not a society that literally has no cash in it,"" concludes Mr Birch. ""It's a society where cash is economically irrelevant and I think we're heading towards that.""

" On an ancient monument near Republique, fresh graffiti scars the old grey stone - its garish scrawl a slash of anger above the pigeons serenely scratching beneath the arch: “Down with caviar, long live the kebab!”  A lone shout in a breadcrumb-trail of slogans, marking the path of protesters through Paris last weekend. This boulevard of the French capital became, for a few hours that day, an urban battlefield. Under vast posters showing the latest releases, lines of riot police and armoured vehicles filed past the grand old Rex cinema.  In front of them, protesters pulled together barricades from street furniture, as trees were set alight and tear gas filled the air. “Franck”, who wouldn't give his real name, was among the protesters on Saturday.  A construction worker from the Calais region, he says he supports the protests, and came to Paris with four of his friends to join them. They were carrying gas masks and other protective gear. Franck was prepared for trouble - his friends, he says, were looking for it.  By the time they arrived on the boulevard near Republique, they were part of a group of more than 100 people. “They were overturning cars, breaking shop windows, they set fire to anything they could,” he says.  “I’d never seen anything like it.  It was anarchy, total chaos.  It was war. Everything was on fire - bins, cars, the protective hoarding around the shops. “The police charged us - the atmosphere was very tense.  And the protesters, we all felt like we were in it together.” French protests have often seemed like a dance between demonstrators and police - direct action has a long and cherished history here.  But these weekly confrontations between people and state are different. Not led by any union or political party, the “yellow vest” protests have unleashed the worst civil disorder Paris has seen for decades. Four people have been killed, many hundreds injured and billions of euros of damage inflicted on the country’s urban centres. The French government at one point warned of “serious violence” and “fears for democracy and its institutions”, with at least one protest spokesman calling on people to march on the Elysee Palace, the home of the president. There is a difference between legitimate protest and unacceptable violence, the government has repeated, time after time. And yet the power of this movement lies, not in the violence at its margins, but in the quiet support of what polls suggest is more than half the country for its basic aims. Protesters demonstrate on their knees against rising costs of living in Lille President Emmanuel Macron came to power vowing to face down protesters and drive through long-postponed economic reforms. For the first 18 months of his presidency, that’s exactly what he did - forcing through changes in the labour law against a backdrop of noisy public protests, and bulldozing past broad, union-led demonstrations on railway reform. This current crisis erupted - not over a flagship issue - but over a fiscal detail in the budget for next year, a routine rise in eco-taxes on fuel.  It wasn’t even a policy that the current government had made.  The commitment to annual tax rises on fuel - and especially diesel - in order to fund eco-friendly projects had been part of the previous government’s legacy to Macron. But it was enough to spark a small local rebellion - a handful of motorists who started displaying their regulation hi-vis jackets, or gilets jaunes, in the windscreens of their cars and posting their actions on Facebook. French President Emmanuel Macron (C) in Paris Now a movement created on social media, with no recognised leadership, has forced President Macron into concessions that were unthinkable a few weeks ago.  How? Because this is not a confrontation about fuel taxes, or any one issue. It’s about power. It’s no accident that cars were the spark that ignited this anger.  Not needing one has become a status symbol in France. Those in city centres have a wealth of public transport to choose from, but you need to be rich enough to live in the centre of Paris or Marseille or Bordeaux, and most people are not. “Economic growth happens in big globalised cities, but the working classes no longer live there,” says Christophe Guilluy, an independent researcher specialising in human geography.  “That’s a major change.  For the first time in history, they don’t live where wealth and jobs are created. They live in a ‘peripheral France’, characterised by weak economic growth, high unemployment and high anxiety.” “This economic model creates enormous wealth,” he continues. “But it creates it in a concentrated and unequal way. Since the 1980s, what we are seeing is a weakening of all categories of the middle class.” Tower block in la Cite des 4000 in La Courneuve in the Paris suburbs Outside the ring roads that encircle Paris, and other major French cities, you will find the suburbs and satellite towns where workers like Nouria Benatia live.  And the gap between the world she works in, and the one she can afford to live in, is growing. She commutes into central Paris every day to work as a receptionist in a smart hotel just off the Champs-Elysees.  After this month’s violent protests in the capital, she says the hotel has emptied and bookings have nose-dived. But she has little sympathy for business owners here. “To be honest, I still have the same salary, so what does it change for me if the business is working or not?” she says.  “I [still] have to go outside Paris to live, and come in to work every day. If the protests were more peaceful, maybe I’d join them.” Protesters block a road leading to the Frontignan oil depot Without a car, those in France who have been priced out of the big cities would struggle to get to work, take their children to school and even to shop for groceries. Petrol prices here are roughly the same as in Germany or the UK - and French diesel prices generally lie somewhere in between its two neighbours. But there is a more general sense of unfairness - a feeling that the struggling middle class are being asked to shoulder more than their fair share of the burden, while France’s millionaires have seen their top rate of tax slashed.  And the pain was felt especially keenly this year, because rises in the global oil price had already made fuel more expensive. In September this year, the government announced its planned increase in the eco-taxes levied on petrol and, particularly, on diesel. Shortly afterwards, the first motorists began showing off their hi-vis jackets in the windscreens of their cars, and Jacline Mouraud, a hypnotherapist from Brittany, published a video on social media saying that motorists were being “hunted”. French protester Jacline Mouraud Months earlier, Priscillia Ludosky, the manager of an online cosmetics company from just outside Paris, had launched a petition on the website Change.org calling for petrol prices to be lowered.  After the announcement on tax rises, it really began to take off, quickly gathering a million signatures - but still, she says, there’s been no response from the government. “We are not understood, we are not heard, our opinions are not sought on the big decisions,” she explains.  “I get the impression that when the president speaks to people in the street, he’s completely detached from reality.” Priscillia Ludosky (C) and Eric Drouet (R) Then, in October, truck driver Eric Drouet, another initiator of the movement, suggested on Facebook the idea of a national blockage, calling on protesters around the country to block roads in their area on 17 November, obstructing and slowing traffic in order to get the government’s attention. About 290,000 people took part. The gilets jaunes movement had begun. “The movement started around a tax rise,” says Christophe Guilluy, “but I think it’s simply a pretext, in the same way that Brexit is not fundamentally a confrontation with Europe, but first and foremost a way for people to say ‘we exist’. “In France, people are using the gilets jaunes as a way to say ‘we exist’ to the elites, to the political class, to those who have forgotten about them for the past 20 years, for the simple reason that they no longer live in the same place.” A map of the planned protests to take place on 17 November, collated by the group 'Blocage 17 Novembre' A Christmas tree overlooks the motorway toll station at La Ciotat, 45 minutes’ drive outside Marseille, its tinsel and baubles catching the light from braziers flaring in the drizzle.  The protesters here, as on other blockades across France, are settling in for Christmas.  Their tents are well stocked with food and drink from local well-wishers, and the noise from supporters honking their horns as they pass along the road frequently drowns out conversation. More than a dozen people stand around in their hi-vis jackets, well wrapped up  in hats and gloves against the cold.  Many protest sites, like this one, have developed into semi-permanent camps, snaking along the roadside, with plenty of cover from the elements, and supplies of basic necessities stacked neatly on wooden pallets. Many are 24-hour operations, and more often than not, there are small rivalries and animated discussions over who should speak for the group. Antonin Olles is a retired technology teacher.  He says social media has played a key role in creating this movement, and restoring to people here a role in the national debate. “The government wasn’t aware of the power of social media in giving a voice to people who weren’t being heard,” he says, beneath the ear-splitting blares of passing lorries.  “Not only does it let people air their grievances, it also lets them communicate with people who feel the same way. These people don’t often get to speak to the TV or the newspapers.  It’s a way for them to mobilise; to show they exist.” Antonin Olles Some have questioned whether the movement was helped by a change toFacebook’s algorithms. Posts from companies and the media became less prominent, with individual contributions given a boost.  But, as with other social media uprisings, the roots of this one run deep. Guilluy says France is no longer just looking at an economic or a social crisis, but a democratic one: “You have here groups that have not been represented for a very long time by the big political parties.  Those who join this movement are those that vote least, the most disengaged from public life. They wanted to have their voice heard, but they haven’t had a way to do it.” Olles thinks that politicians, union leaders and other representatives have all been discounted. “People ask themselves - how can this person stand up for me if they don’t know what my life is like?  They are relocating everything from villages to big cities - there are fewer local schools, fewer local doctors or hospitals.  One woman needed a helicopter ambulance to take her hospital in time to give birth.  It’s no wonder people feel like they’re being abandoned.” The irony, for Emmanuel Macron, is that he came to power promising to rebuild trust in politics, especially among those struggling to thrive in the new, globalised economy.  This is the last chance, he told me on the campaign trail last year - if he was to fail, next time it would be Marine Le Pen. The reforms he promised were designed, he said, to create wealth in order that it could be shared with those who needed it most. It was a policy that aimed to liberalise and protect, but many here feel that the social protection for workers has fallen short compared with the liberal reforms enjoyed by businesses. (From L) French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, French President Emmanuel Macron and French Ecology Minister Francois de Rugy meet with representatives of trade unions President Macron pushed through reforms where previous presidents had feared to tread - reducing the power of the unions in workplace relations, ending the special benefits enjoyed by railway workers, and making it easier for companies to hire and fire staff. He also ended the wealth tax on all assets apart from property, meaning a 70% cut in the tax for France’s millionaires. It was meant to boost investment in the economy, but it was seen by many poorer voters as further proof that this former banker-turned-president was still primarily a friend of business, not of the squeezed working and middle class. Winners and losers in France's 2018-2019 budgetSource: Institut des Politiques Publiques France’s Public Policy Institute recently published a review of who had gained and lost under Macron’s presidency so far. It found that the buying power of the poorest in society had slightly shrunk, while those in the economic middle had slightly gained. But the biggest winners were the richest 1%. This sense of unfairness emerges time and again in the graffiti that has appeared on walls and monuments in Paris.  Much of it calls for the resignation of Macron, or simply the “fall of the regime”.  On the Republic’s famous monument at Republique, someone has changed the revolutionary right of “universal suffrage” to read “universal suffering”. Graffiti reads: ""The people want the fall of the regime"" If the roots of protesters’ frustration lie in the big economic shifts of the 1980s, how far did Macron himself encourage it to bloom into open opposition? “In the last election, many people voted to change their situation and they still find themselves here, so they’ve started to get frustrated,” says protester Antonin Olles.  “They’ve realised that those who govern them don’t know what real life is like - for them, poverty is just a set of numbers.” Despite his warnings against populist nationalism, there have been times when President Macron seemed unaware of the tensions swirling beneath the surface of French society, leading to criticism that he’s aloof and out of touch. At a public event at the Elysee Palace earlier this year, he told a 25-year-old gardener who complained of not finding work that he would easily find a job if he applied to hotels, restaurants or construction sites.  “[If] I crossed the street, I’d find you one,” the president told him.  “So go ahead.” After four weeks of national protest, he addressed the nation in a bid to satisfy demonstrators and drain the movement of momentum.  What he offered was the most significant climb-down of his presidency so far - a monthly bonus of 100 euros for those on the minimum wage, an end to tax and social charges on overtime and workers’ annual bonuses, and a freeze in some pension charges. Protestors take notes as they watch French President Emmanuel Macron's speech on TV on 10 December 2018 There was also an admission that he had sometimes got things wrong. “I know some of the things I’ve said have hurt you,” he said - but there was no formal apology and no change in the government’s economic course.   Further reforms planned for next year - on pensions and unemployment insurance - are still set to go ahead. Instead, the president’s response was to look for solutions at the local level.  He announced an unprecedented national debate - on the environment, immigration, decentralisation and political disengagement.  He also said he wanted to meet France’s mayors “region by region” to build the basis of a “new contract with the nation”. La Penne-sur-Huveaune's town hall The town hall at La Penne-sur-Huveaune, 20 minutes’ drive from La Ciotat, is painted salmon pink. Three huge French flags hang from the poles above the entrance. Dangling from one of them is a hi-vis motorist’s jacket, a gilet jaune. Christine Capdeville is the Communist mayor of La Penne-sur-Huveaune.  When I ask her what she thinks of President Macron’s solution to the crisis, she laughs. Mayor of La Penne-sur-Huveaune, Christine Capdeville “President Macron has ignored us from the moment he came to power,” she says. “And now, all of a sudden, he wants us to come to his rescue! “Can I be honest with you,” she asks. The idea of a national consultation is “absolute rubbish. We’re going to get a piece of paper asking for our grievances, and that’s it. Then everything will carry on just like before.” The call has gone out for another day of national protest - the fifth consecutive weekend for the gilets jaunes, or “Act 5” as it’s being called.  Franck is already planning to come back to Paris with his friends to see more of the action. The violence he saw last week near Republique will stay with him for the rest of his life, he says.  But he liked the atmosphere: “Everyone is together, we are all one, a very good team.  It’s not every day you see that.” That sense of unity among the protesters is what has given the movement its energy, and its power. Sylvie and Christophe arrived on the Champs-Elysees last Saturday by 09:00.  I met them walking up the near-empty boulevard towards the Arc de Triomphe with a group of friends. “She’s far left,” Christophe told me, “and I’m far-right - and we’re here together for the gilets jaunes!” “That’s what Macron doesn’t like,” he continued. “That we’re united.  He’s brought back solidarity among the French.  He’s turned everyone against him.  We’re united in combat - at least for now.  After that, who knows?” Student Sylvie “Our strength is that we’re apolitical,” Sylvie said. “Maybe later when there are new presidential elections, we’ll put together a leaflet, but for the moment we don’t need a leader - that’s our strength.” Are you scared there might be violence here today, I asked her? “No,” she replied.  “We have nothing left to lose.” President Macron won last year’s election by cannibalising France’s traditional centre-right and centre-left parties.  It deepened splits within the remaining opposition - and has helped keep the political opposition in check ever since. Now, that divided opposition has been replaced by a social movement that has also united people from left and right, in the same way that Macron did - along with many of those who are disillusioned with traditional politics altogether. Bruno Bonnell is an MP and founder member of the president’s party, La Republique En Marche. He says the gilets jaunes could emerge as the new opposition to Emmanuel Macron. MP Bruno Bonnell “This [movement] looks like ours did originally,” he said in the lobby of the National Assembly.  “I remember En Marche when people were saying we had no programme and we didn’t know where we were going.  We were debating in bars and cafes, trying to reinvent the world. “This movement is more about resistance, it’s populist like the Five Star movement or Podemos, but if they gather effectively with leaders and representatives, then we’ll finally face a clearer opposition.” He says he had visited protest sites many times to ask, specifically, what demonstrators wanted, but that every proposal he made was rejected. “We are now beyond that.  It’s a political conversation, not a conversation about money or compassion.” Some protesters see a future as a political party.  But so far, diversity has been the movement’s appeal - the right of each of its 10,000 members to speak only for themselves.  Distrust of representatives is so strong that even the few spokespeople to emerge have come under heavy criticism, even death threats. But without a leader, or a cohesive agenda, what future does this movement have? “The leader ought to be the president of France,” Anthony Joubert, one of the founders of the movement, says.  “It’s he who has to understand us.  He should be spending his time listening, instead of creating a situation where restaurants can charge 15 euros for a bottle of water.  As things stand the gilets jaunes are leading ourselves.  We are an assembly.  We are a national assembly.” Back at the barricade at La Ciotat, Antonin Olles has gravitated towards the makeshift barbecue as some of the protesters watch a few small piles of sardines crisp on the coals. There is talk about the next protest - some in La Ciotat say they’re planning to demonstrate here, rather than make the trip up to Paris. Protesters cook sardines at the tollbooth between La Ciotat and Aubagne Many have cautioned against dismissing this movement too quickly, even if the level of protest and violence in the capital falls. “The absence of a complete eruption last Saturday doesn’t mean the protest is easing,” cautioned the daily Le Figaro earlier this week.  “[The president] won’t win over the country by pulling out his cheque-book or flaunting his intellect, he needs to open his heart.” “We want a second French revolution,” Olles says.  “We want to show the rest of Europe that the people have some power.” France was seen from the outside as having avoided a populist revolution 18 months ago - but the election of Emmanuel Macron simply papered over France’s problems.  Fixing them will take a whole lot more. Built with Shorthand",Negative,0.0005436279
"Twenty-eight people were injured when a tram derailed and overturned in Lisbon. Most of the casualties were taken to hospital after the incident on Friday, but none were in a serious condition. It was initially thought that two British children were injured, but the Foreign Office believes no one from the UK was involved. It's understood the children may be American. Reports said the tram came off the rails on a bend at the bottom of a steep hill, before hitting a building. A six-month-old and a seven-year-old were rescued by passers-by, according to local media.

"Tributes have been posted to Ms Papenheim's Facebook page A young woman from the US who moved to the Netherlands to study after a family tragedy has been stabbed to death in her student complex in Rotterdam. Sarah Papenheim, 21, was found dying in her lodgings in the city's Kralingen district on Wednesday, and armed police later seized a suspect in another city. She was studying psychology at Erasmus University, having been affected by her brother's suicide some years ago. Ms Papenheim was also a gifted drummer, well known on Minnesota's music scene. Netherlands country profile Jellybean Johnson, a drummer and guitarist who once played with Prince, told CBS Minnesota he had been so impressed with her playing that he had nicknamed her ""Thumper"" and become a mentor to her. He said he was ""still numb"",externalover the death of ""a great spirit"" asother people paid tribute on Facebook,external. Ms Papenheim, who lost her brother Josh three years ago when he was 21, had been living in the Netherlands for two years when the attack happened. Police arrested a male suspect believed to have been living in the same student complex, at a railway station in Eindhoven, a city 110km (68 miles) south-east of Rotterdam. His dramatic capture by armed officers was caught on video by a bystander. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Iranian national was arrested in the Arthur's Hill area of Newcastle on Tuesday. He was remanded in custody after a brief appearance at Westminster Magistrates' Court and will appear at the Old Bailey on 14 January.

"The French capital is experiencing its fifth Saturday of tear gas and clashes ""Yellow vest"" protesters have gathered in Paris and other cities for a fifth consecutive Saturday of demonstrations. Protesters defied a government call to suspend the action following Tuesday's attack on Strasbourg's Christmas market where a gunman killed four people. However, fewer people turned up - 66,000 altogether, officials said, compared to 125,000 last Saturday. The movement, initially against a rise in fuel taxes, now addresses other issues, including education reforms. The gilets jaunes Macron promises divide protest leaders Are the Yellow Vests spreading beyond France Seven people have died in the ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vest) protests so far, the latest in an accident resulting from a blockade by protesters on Friday. About 69,000 police have been mobilised across France to prevent a repeat of the violence of previous weeks. In Paris, slightly more than 2,000 took to the streets on a cold and rainy day, compared to 10,000 last week. This video can not be played Yellow vests: Is the symbol spreading across Europe? Police stopped and questioned 168 people in the capital, detaining 115. Scuffles broke out on the Champs-ElysÃ©es several times during the day, with police using tear gas and water cannon. However, as night fell, the iconic boulevard was reopened to traffic. Some women dressed as ""Marianne"", a symbol of the French Republic Seven people were injured. Some museums were closed, but both the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower remained open. In Nantes, there were scenes of tension In Marseille, this protester holds a sign demanding a ""citizens referendum"" In Bordeaux, more than 4,500 protesters took to the streets. Police had to use water cannon to disperse them. A similar number protested in Toulouse. In Nantes, some 1,200 protesters saw rounds of tear gas fired at them. Similar scenes occurred in Avignon and BesanÃ§on. In Calais, a group of ""yellow vests"" blocked the access road to the port. Analysis by Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris A few hundred desultory figures in day-glo vests wander up and down the Champs ElysÃ©es.  Occasionally there are whoops and jeers, followed by a bang and a bit of gas.  A group of protesters has got too close to a police cordon, and a show of force pushes them back. The mini-panic lasts about 15 seconds. That is about the extent of the fifth yellow-vest demonstration, which confirms the downward trend of last Saturday.  Maybe the troublemakers will enter the game like they did last week - but it can't be on the same scale, because today there simply aren't enough bona fide protesters around to give them cover. The ""gilets jaunes"" who have turned out seem to be the hardline left-wing element. There is a lot of talk about the ""RIC"" - Citizens' Initiative Referendums. This is a demand of the far-left leader Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon - and a long way from the yellow vests' original call, which was for a simple cut in fuel tax (long since conceded). The movement - or at least the Saturday protest movement - is shrinking and hardening. The impact of the demonstrations has been keenly felt in France. The government has been forced to bow to pressure and adjust its economic course. President Emmanuel Macron responded to the nationwide street protests by scrapping an unpopular fuel tax rise, and promising an extra â¬100 (Â£90; $114) a month for minimum wage earners and tax cuts for pensioners. However, it is far from clear that he has done enough to defuse public anger. The protesters adopted the name after a social-media campaign urging people to take to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow jackets that must be carried in every vehicle in France. They were initially protesting against a rise in duties on diesel, which is widely used by French motorists and has long been less heavily taxed than other types of fuel. Mr Macron had said higher taxes on fossil fuels were needed to fund renewable energy investments. Will the environment be the true victim of France's riots? Who supports the protesters? But protests have also erupted over other issues, including calls for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions and easier university entry requirements. The movement's core aim, to highlight the economic frustration and political distrust of poorer working families, has widespread support. 17 November:282,000 protesters - one dead, 409 wounded - 73 in custody 24 November:166,000 protesters - 84 wounded - 307 in custody 1 December:136,000 protesters - one dead, 263 wounded - 630 in custody 8 December:136,000 protesters - 118 wounded - 1,220 in custody Who are the 'gilets jaunes'?

"Twenty-eight people were injured when a tram derailed and overturned in Lisbon. Most of the casualties were taken to hospital after the incident on Friday, but none were in a serious condition.

"Pupils at Ysgol Gymuned Rhosybol on Anglesey will not be buying staff Christmas gifts A school has asked parents not to buy Christmas presents for teachers in a bid to relieve pressure on families and support those in need. Ysgol Gymuned Rhosybol on Anglesey asked parents who wanted to give gifts to donate to charity instead. One parent said teachers she knew would be ""mortified"" if parents felt pressured to buy presents they could not afford. And another described the move as ""quite a relief"". Claire Hughes, a teaching assistant and parent at the school, said the idea was prompted by the school's head teacher after reading about the financial burden gift giving placed on families. 'I spend Â£400 on each of my five kids' The early Christmas gift many of us now buy Is it ever OK to charge family for Christmas lunch? She said during the festive period, the staff room could be filled with around twenty boxes of chocolates from parents, on top of other gifts. Mrs Hughes said: ""We felt quite guilty receiving gifts and felt that we needed to change what happens here in our school."" She added that a Christmas card was more than enough. Teaching assistant and parent Claire Hughes said a Christmas card was more than enough Mrs Hughes explained that when they told pupils they would not be doing presents, they were ""initially quite disappointed"". However, it led to the decision for children to give to charity instead, such as food banks - although Mrs Hughes explained there is no pressure for them to donate at all. She added that the children are ""realising the importance"" of helping people at Christmas. As a result, her six-year-old son Caleb decided to create his own box for an Anglesey homeless charity. Caleb donating his box to the charity, Digartref Ynys Mon She explained that as a parent, not having the burden of buying gifts for staff is a ""relief"". ""I find it quite a relief myself, not having to worry about what to give them"", she said. ""As staff know I appreciate just a thank you."" Cathryn Scott, who runs parenting blog Cardiff Mummy Says, said that it is ""natural"" for parents to want to thank teachers over Christmas. But the mother-of-three added that although it is not something she experiences, reports of parents competing to buy presents are ""worrying"". ""I have a lot of friends who are teachers and I know they would be mortified if they thought parents were feeling pressure to buy gifts they can't afford."" At her children's school, parents can contribute Â£5 to buy vouchers for the class teacher and teaching assistants, and Ms Scott says there is no way she could buy individual gifts for all her children's teachers. Part of the note sent out by the Anglesey primary school A primary school teacher in Cardiff, Frances Herbert, explained that children enjoy giving the presents to teachers, but said she does feel guilty sometimes. ""Especially when only working part time! But children love watching you open something."" Harriet Warren, a mother from Cardiff, said her children opted to make homemade gifts. ""My three children have each made a bauble for their teachers, instead of joining in with the parents' group collection"", she explained. ""I felt it was a more personal gift which they enjoyed doing and saved me a little bit of money."" Christmas gifts for teachers: Yes or no?

"All households in England may be given a separate caddy for food waste, under plans to be announced next week. Ministers are backing the idea, but will offer it for consultation before any changes happen. The scheme would reduce greenhouse gases from landfill, but could lead to less frequent collections of general household waste. Some councils will oppose the policy unless they are given extra funds to carry out the scheme. At the moment, only around 35% of households in England are obliged to put food waste in its own caddy. That compares with 56% in Scotland and 100% in Wales. The figures exclude food waste mixed with garden waste. While the new rule would force councils to offer separate food caddies, people would not be obliged to use them. Why do we need food caddies? Unwanted food that goes into a general bin rots in landfill and creates methane - a powerful greenhouse gas. When waste food is collected separately, it can be put into an anaerobic digester - a tank in which the food breaks down into sludge, carbon dioxide (COâ) and methane, which can be used for generating energy or running a vehicle. The residual sludge is used as a soil fertiliser. The change will help the government reach its targets on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Some local councils say thereâs a long-term bonus from having food waste separated and collecting it every week. Because when rotting food is safely in the caddy, general waste collections can be reduced to every two or more weeks without providing a feast for flies. What are the drawbacks? The policy has been controversial for people wanting bins emptied every week. Some councils say the scheme is too expensive. It creates a problem with disposing of nappies and the food waste caddies create extra clutter for front gardens or streets. But the plan does fit with the government strategy of changing our relationship with the stuff we throw away. Recyclenow, the government-backed campaign, says: ""Throwing away food is a huge waste of the energy, water and packaging used in its production, transportation and storage. âIf we all stopped wasting the food which could have been eaten, it would have the same COâ impact as taking one in four cars off UK roads.â Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"The Boeing 737 was coming in to land at Stansted Airport A drone flying more than 20 times the allowed height came within 15m (50ft) of a Boeing 737 approaching a runway at Stansted Airport in Essex. The plane was flying at 10,000ft (3km) and coming in to land on 17 August when the captain spotted the drone. The first officer then saw ""a dark-coloured square or rectangle-shaped object pass down the right side of the aircraft with minimal separation"". The UK Airprox Board rated the risk of collision as the highest possible. After the incident, which happened at 16:36 BST, the plane was inspected on the ground and found no evidence of contact or damage. It is not known whether the Boeing 737 was carrying passengers or cargo. The drone operator, who it is understood has not been traced, was in breach of the Air Navigation Order 2009, which refers to flight safety of unmanned craft. Drones must not be flown inairspace above 400ft (121m),externalor in the vicinity of airports without permission from air traffic control and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The Airprox Board, which investigates near misses, said the drone was ""endangering other aircraft at that location"" and that ""providence had played a major part in the incident"".

"The Nigerian military has been battling Islamists in the country's north-east Nigeria's military has revoked its earlier decision to suspend activities of the UN children's agency Unicef in the north-east of the country. The military said this came after ""extensive deliberations"" during emergency talks with Unicef officials. Earlier on Friday, the army had accused the agency of spying for Islamist militants in the restive region. Millions of people displaced by the Boko Haram insurgency in the north-east are dependent on humanitarian aid. IS links with Nigeria militants Who are Boko Haram? In a statement, the army said that it had lifted a three-month ban on Unicef's operations. It said that during the meeting it urged ""Unicef representatives to ensure they share information with relevant authorities whenever induction or training of new staff is being conducted"". The statement came just hours after the military had accused the UN agency of spying for Islamists. ""[Unicef staff] train and deploy spies who support the insurgents and their sympathisers,"" the army said. These were ""unwholesome practices that could further jeopardise the fight against terrorism and insurgency,"" it added. This is not the first time the army has taken dramatic action against the UN agency. In April, the military declared three Unicef workers persona non grata, following leaked allegations of sexual abuse by Nigerian soldiers. That decision was also swiftly reversed. Nigeria's north-east has been devastated by a decade-long insurgency by Boko Haram and its splinter group Islamic State West Africa More than 30,000 people have been killed and many more driven from their homes.

"Ministers are being urged to reverse plans to issue prison officers with a synthetic pepper spray, known as Pava, following a trial. From next year, canisters will be issued to staff in publicly run prisons for men, in a bid to reduce violence. The Prison Reform Trust (PRT) says its own analysis of the six-month trial in four prisons showed the spray was often used ""unsafely and inappropriately"". Ministers have said trials of the pepper spray were ""successful"". The official report gives details of 50 cases where the chemical incapacitant was deployed. The trials took place in four prisons: Hull, Preston, Risley and Wealstun in 2017 and 2018. Officers were trained and issued with Pava, which was intended to be used as a last resort as a personal protection tool ""to prevent harm to self or others"". Prison officer demonstrates pepper spray Prison pepper spray 'will worsen conflict' I'll quit if jails don't improve - minister In guidance, they were told to deploy it only when other techniques were not possible, had already failed or were considered unsafe or insufficient. In a letter to the PRT in November, prisons minister Rory Stewart says the spray is intended for use ""in exceptional circumstances where a member of staff is faced with serious violence or the perceived threat of serious violence"". However, the campaign group says its analysis, carried out by an experienced former prison governor, shows that in almost two-thirds of of these incidents, officers might have contravened the guidance. ""In fact, the use of Pava very rapidly became a routine part of how routine incidents were dealt with,"" says the PRT. Incidents of inappropriate use in the official report include: use against a prisoner who was harming himself an inmate with mental health problems sprayed three times in 10 minutes, including at point blank range through a flap in his cell door an officer spraying the wrong prisoner and a colleague attempting to intervene in a fight use of the spray on a prisoner who had jumped on to the safety netting between the floors Overall, the analysis suggests that of the 50 incidents: almost a quarter involved unsafe use, for example in confined spaces, at height, at point blank range or hitting the wrong prisoner or a prison officer almost a quarter could have been resolved by other means - so Pava was not deployed as a last resort a third involved use without appropriate justification, for example to enforce orders rather than to prevent serious harm Hull prison was one of the four facilities used in the trial The PRT warns that the use of Pava risks undermining trust between prisoners and prison officers and could lead to an escalation in violence as prisoners arm themselves against a perceived threat. ""At the very least, the minister should call a moratorium on the national roll-out until an adequate process of consultation has taken place,"" the group urges. Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, agreed there was no sound evidence to support the roll-out. ""We agree that it is of the highest importance that prison officers are able to protect themselves and others, but such protections must not be at the expense of the basic rights of prisoners,"" she said. ""Everyone has the right to live without fear of inhumane treatment."" A spokesman for the Prison Service said there was no evidence to suggest Pava was used unlawfully during the pilot and it would be wrong to imply that cases of misuse were ignored. The spokesman said only officers who had completed specialist training were allowed to carry the spray, adding that the aim was not to reduce violence ""but to reduce the harm that can occur during violence"". ""We have taken on board lessons learned during the Pava pilot and are putting in place clear rules for its deployment, so it is only used when serious violence occurs or is threatened.""

"This video can not be played Theresa May: 'If we are to leave with a deal this is it' Theresa May has said it is still possible to get the assurances MPs need to back her Brexit deal, despite EU leaders ruling out any renegotiation. At a summit in Brussels, the UK PM said there was ""work to do"" but talks on ""further clarification"" would continue. She admitted a ""robust"" discussion with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, after he complained about ""nebulous and imprecise debate"". Labour said the withdrawal deal was now ""dead in the water"". The UK prime minister travelled to Brussels to make a special plea to EU leaders after delaying Tuesday's Commons vote on the deal, in anticipation of a heavy defeat. She then went on to win a confidence vote brought by her own MPs but vowed to listen to the concerns of the 37% of Tory MPs who voted against her. Kuenssberg: An issue of trust Theresa May's week in charts May at the EU summit, as it happened How could another Brexit referendum work? Many of them are concerned that the controversial ""backstop"" plan in the withdrawal agreement Mrs May has negotiated, which is aimed at preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland, would keep the UK tied to EU rules indefinitely and curb its ability to strike trade deals. Nigel Farage told a Leave Means Leave rally on Friday it was time for Brexit supporters to prepare for another referendum Brexit supporters wait for the speeches at the Leave Means Leave rally in London Elsewhere on Friday, former UKIP leader Nigel Farage told a Leave Means Leave rally in London it was time for Brexit supporters to prepare for the possibility of another referendum. Mr Farage added the treatment of Mrs May in Brussels this week had been a ""shaming moment"" for both the UK and the EU and that the PM's Brexit deal was now ""dead"". Labour MP Kate Hoey and Wetherspoons chairman Tim Martin were among the other speakers at the rally. This video can not be played A quiet word in your ear...but what did Theresa May say to EU's Juncker? After Mrs May addressed EU leaders at the summit on Thursday evening, Mr Juncker urged further clarity from the UK. He said: ""Our UK friends need to say what they want, instead of asking us to say what we want... because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise."" Video footage of the two on Friday morning captured a tense exchange, apparently about his remarks, although the exact words were not audible. Asked about what she had said to him, Mrs May told reporters: ""I had a robust discussion with Jean-Claude Juncker - I think that's the sort of discussion you're able to have when you have developed a working relationship and you work well together. ""And what came out of that was his clarity that actually he'd been talking - when he used that particular phrase - he'd been talking about a general level of debate."" This video can not be played Jean-Claude Juncker: ""We were not dancing...she thought that I did criticise her"" At a later press conference, Mr Juncker described Mrs May as a ""good friend"" who he admired as a ""woman of courage"". He said he hadn't realised nebulous was a word in English and he had been referring, not to her, but to the ""overall state of the debate in Britain"". He said: ""I can't see where the British parliament is heading. That's why I was saying that it was nebulous - foggy in English - I was not addressing her."" He also said: ""We have to bring down the temperature"" of the debate amid ""attacks coming from Westminster against Europe and the European Commission"". Various EU leaders, including European Council President Donald Tusk, Mr Juncker and Irish PM Leo Varadkar, reiterated on Thursday that there could be no renegotiation of the withdrawal deal. And a paragraph which had appeared in the draft conclusions at the start of the summit, saying that the EU ""stands ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided"" did not appear in the final conclusions. Branson: Hard Brexit will bankrupt UK Why isn't Labour trying to topple May now? Reality Check: Does Brussels blink? But Mrs May said that, despite reports that the EU was unwilling to consider further clarification, she had talked to Mr Tusk, Mr Juncker and others that morning which ""have shown that further clarification and discussion following the council's conclusions is in fact possible"". She also welcomed commitments by other EU leaders to try to get a new trade deal in place ""speedily"" so that the backstop would not be needed and said that, as formal conclusions from the summit, they had ""legal status"". But she added: ""There is work to be done. It is clear we can look at this issue of further clarification. We will be working expeditiously over the coming days to seek those further assurances I believe MPs will need."" BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the fact that the EU said it would use its ""best endeavours"" to get a future trade deal that would get rid of the need for a backstop - even if the backstop came into force - was seen as important by British officials who said it meant the UK could go to an independent arbitration panel if they felt the EU was dragging its feet. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The last 24 hours have confirmed that Theresa May's Brexit deal is dead in the water. The prime minister has utterly failed in her attempts to deliver any meaningful changes to her botched deal. ""Rather than ploughing ahead and dangerously running down the clock, the prime minister needs to put her deal to a vote next week so Parliament can take back control."" And Conservative Brexiteer Mark Francois told the BBC: ""It is as plain as a pikestaff that this will never get through the House of Commons... the prime minister, I'm afraid, is completely boxed in."" The Democratic Unionist Party, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, said she must deliver ""legally binding changes"" to the withdrawal agreement if she wants her deal to get through Parliament. Its leader Arlene Foster said the prime minister ""has made commitments"" to the DUP and ""knows what she has to deliver on"". Meanwhile, the UK and Switzerland have provisionally agreed to keep their current trading rules after Brexit, the first of 40 existing EU trade deals with other countries the UK hopes to adopt. The agreement, which will replicate the EU's current arrangement with Switzerland as closely as possible, is due to come into place at the end of 2020 when the Brexit transition phase ends. But it could come into force at the end of March if the UK leaves with no deal. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming Theresa May's mission to Brussels has not been a failure. She has a written statement from her 27 fellow leaders confirming - reconfirming, really - that the Irish backstop is an insurance policy which would only ever be temporary. If the backstop is activated, then the EU would use its ""best endeavours"" to negotiate a trade deal, which would mean it could be deactivated. That wording is crucial, say British officials, because it means the UK could refer the EU to the independent arbitration panel established in the Brexit treaty if London felt Brussels was moving too slowly. The EU dropped a commitment to look for further ways to help the UK, which means there won't be a formal process to find them. But it doesn't mean the search couldn't happen informally, or in private, or at the last minute. The problem is that these commitments are unlikely to impress Theresa May's harshest critics. And they certainly wouldn't fit on the side of the bus as reasons to sign up to Mrs May's Brexit deal. Read Adam's full analysis How could another Brexit referendum work?

"British police are assisting their counterparts conducting the investigation in Ghana A group of UK schoolgirls who were sexually assaulted at gunpoint in Ghana are receiving support, police say.

A Ghanaian security guard was shot and the female victims were ""subjected to serious sexual assaults"". Some of their possessions were also stolen. The victims are now being given support from ""specially trained police officers, their school and other agencies"", police added. The statement continued: ""We are aware that the public will wish to show their support for the victims in this case but it is vital that their anonymity is maintained.
