"At a White House briefing, the president denied he might seek to change the date of November's election Global virus cases pass 3 million, with more than 200,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said bereaved families of NHS staff will get compensation Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK is at point of ""maximum risk"" and he won't ease restrictions too quickly Italy outlined plans to ease restrictions from 4 May as it records its lowest daily death toll since mid-March Germany made it mandatory to wear masks on public transport Edited by Jude Sheerin Thanks for joining us for today's coverage. That's a wrap on things for now, but here is a look back at some of the biggest stories of the day:   Our coverage was brought to you today by Owen Amos, Frances Mao, Yvette Tan, Andreas Illmer, Krutika Pathi, Deirdre Finnerty, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Matthew Davis, Patrick Jackson, David Gritten, Joshua Cheetham, Michael Emons, Jessica Murphy, Ritu Prasad, Robin Levinson-King, Jonathan Jurejko, Jennifer Scott, Gavin Stamp, Hazel Shearing, Toby Luckhurst, Emma Harrison, Ashitha Nagesh, Frank Keogh, Joel Gunter, Boer Deng, Holly Honderich and Jude Sheerin. Here's the final question of the evening. A reporter asks: If an American president loses more Americans over the course of six weeks than died during the entirety of the Vietnam war, does he deserve to be reelected? Trump took the question in stride. ""So, yeah, we've lost a lot of people but if you look at what original projections were, 2.2 million, we're probably heading to 60,000 - 70,000,"" he says. ""It's far too many - one person is too many for this. I think we've made a lot of really good decisions,"" he adds. ""The big decision was closing the border, doing the ban on people coming in from China."" He also brings up the ""unbelievable"" job his administration did with ventilators. ""I think we've done a great job. And I will say this - one person is too many."" And with that, the briefing is concluded. Trump is asked if he has considered delaying the November presidential election. ""I never even thought of changing the date of the election,"" he answers. ""Why would I do that? November 3rd. That's a good number."" Trump calls the suggestion ""made up propaganda"" and says that ""sleepy Joe"" Biden - his presumptive Democratic rival - was likely unaware his campaign had put the statement out. Former Vice-President Joe Biden said at a virtual fundraiser last week that he thought Trump would ""try to kick back the election somehow"". The president has frequently leveled insults at his Democratic opponent by questioning the former vice-president's mental fortitude. ""I look forward to that election,"" Trump says. President Trump says his administration has launched ""very serious investigations"" into China's response to the novel coronavirus. ""And we are not happy with China, we are not happy with that whole situation, because we believe it could have been stopped at the source,"" he says. ""It could have been stopped quickly and it wouldn't have spread all over the world."" Trump has been critical of China as the pandemic has progressed and has frequently touted his decision to close the US borders to China in an effort to curb the outbreak. Some health experts have said the effort bought time for the US to prepare, but the Trump administration has been accused of squandering the opportunity. ""Nobody except one country can be held accountable for what happened,"" Trump says. ""Nobody's blaming anybody here, we're looking at a group of people that should've stopped it at the source."" The US will never forget those who were ""sacrificed for a reason of incompetence or something else other than incompetence,"" he adds. ""They"" - referring to China - ""could've protected the whole world - not just us - the whole world,"" he says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Trump says people who canât open up their stores because of lockdown measures face losing their livelihoods. ""The fact that people arenât allowed to have their freedom causes a tremendous amount of problems, including death,"" he says. A reporter asks Trump about the state of Maryland reporting more emergency calls regarding ingestion of disinfectants after the president suggested that they could be used to treat Covid-19. ""I can't imagine why,"" Trump responds. ""I can't imagine that."" Last week, the Maryland governor's office said it issued an alert warning against ingesting or injecting disinfectants after receiving more than 100 calls. The president has said his comments were made sarcastically. The reporter asks if the president takes any responsibility for the increase in calls. ""No,"" he replies. The president responds to a question criticising Health Secretary Alex Azar's early downplaying of the disease by saying it was ""unfair"". He claims Democrats did the same, including Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. ""I was very fortunate through luck or whatever that we closed the border, we put a ban on China,"" he says. ""But I could tell you that Nancy Pelosi was dancing in the streets in Chinatown. She wanted to go, let's go out and party. That was late in February."" Back in February, Mrs Pelosi had encouraged people to visit San Francisco's Chinatown to help struggling businesses. She did not propose any parties, as the president suggested. The city issued a stay-at-home order in March. White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx and Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir have begun outlining efforts to improve the US testing system. Mr Giroir says the federal government will be able to supply every state with the tests they need. But the fine print on the White House's new guidance for states suggests that the testing burden will fall to states. Documents obtained by CBS News, the BBC's US partner, show that the guidelines direct  governors are expected to craft their own plans for increasing testing. Most sentences begin with the words ""states should"". States ""must be able to proactively monitor for and respond to local outbreaks"", the documents say, ""and develop rapid response programmes that enable quick isolation and contact tracing of individuals who test positive"". The president has suggested an unnamed individual ""a long time ago"" could have stopped the ""unnecessary death[s]"" due to Covid-19. ""There has been so much unnecessary death in this country,"" he said. ""It could've been stopped and it could've been stopped short, but somebody a long time ago, it seems, decided not to do it that way and the whole world is suffering because of it."" He did not say who he was referencing and gave no other details. Industry executives say they are working on expanding testing, including self-swab tests. Executives from retailer Walmart; pharmacy chains Rite Aid, Walgreens, CVS; and health diagnostics company LabCorp, as well as the US Cotton industry group said they would make more tests and testing sites available across the country. LabCorp said it would release an at-home Covid-19 test in the coming weeks. But even as commercial labs say they have expanded the capacity for testing, medical officials throughout the US have said they still face shortages of key materials, including testing swabs, reagents, and pipettes. For example, the Ohio Health Department told CNN that the state is focused on testing the most âvulnerable patientsâ because of a âglobal shortage in suppliesâ. Ohio is due to begin reopening some businesses on Friday, 1 May. The president begins by saying Covid-19 cases are declining or stablising across the country. ""In all cases getting better,"" he says.  ""Really a horrible situation that weâve been confronted with, but theyâre moving along."" He adds there's a ""hunger"" to get back to work. ""Ensuring the health of our economy is vital to ensuring the health of our nation - these goals work in tandem."" President Donald Trump is at the microphone and has begun his revamped news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House. He is joined by the vice-president, Mike Pence. After some heavy criticism of the president's suggestions last week about injecting disinfectant, what will the briefing look like? We're about to find out. You can follow along with our livestream here. We asked three Americans who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 to rate the US president's response to the virus, including his recent comments about disinfectant. The BBC first spoke to these voters before the president's inauguration in January 2017 and we've caught up with them several times since. Here's what they had to say. This video can not be played Coronavirus: What Trump voters think of his handling of crisis Chi Chi IzunduNigeria correspondent The lockdown in Abuja, Lagos and Ogun states will be eased from next week The 28-day lockdown in three parts of Nigeria was due to end tonight but, during a televised address to the nation, President Buhari just announced measures would continue for one more week. And then, from next Monday, a new âphased and gradual easing ofâ restrictions will kick in to allow the restoration of some economic and business activities - but the easing comes with nationwide conditions. It will now be compulsory for everyone to wear face masks in public, there will be an overnight curfew between 20:00 and 06:00 with only essential services allowed to move during those times. President Buhari also said there would be a ban on ânon-essential inter-state passenger travel until further noticeâ and all bans on social and religious gatherings would remain in place. He also expressed his deep concern over the âmysterious deathsâ of a number of people in the northern state of Kano. As well as sending a government team to investigate, he said heâd issued a total lockdown for two weeks with immediate effect. President Trump is expected to hold a news conference on the pandemic in the next 20 minutes or so, having earlier cancelled it. His press secretary said it would be held in the Rose Garden and would ""brief the nation on additional testing guidance and safely opening up America again"". Some of Mr Trump's advisers had called for a pause in his almost daily updates, following amazement at his suggestion last Thursday that injecting disinfectant might be a way of treating Covid-19. Some Republicans have warned that the president's briefings were harming his chances of re election. ""We have to manage and augment our behavior,"" the governor said about busy beaches California Governor
Gavin Newsom has pledged to step-up the enforcement of coronavirus-related measures after images spread of people flocking to the coast over the weekend. A stay-at-home order was implemented statewide last month, but some counties have reopened beaches and thousands flocked there during recent hot weather. âThis virus doesnât take the weekends off. This virus doesnât go home because itâs a beautiful sunny day around our coasts,"" Governor Newsom said on Monday. California, a state of about 40 million people, is one of the heaviest impacted areas in the US.  If youâre working remotely you might be

Jin Russell, a doctor in Auckland, spoke to BBC OS on World Service radio and said: âIâm at the end of a five-week lockdown staying at home with my two little boys and my husband. Iâm really proud of my country. Weâve taken such strong collective action to keep each other safe. âWhen our prime minister, Jacinda Arden, announced five weeks ago the lockdown was going to start I remember crying with relief because my whole family are doctors. My mum is a GP in her 70s, my dad is a full-time pathologist at the hospital, and my brother is a rheumatologist. ""I work at the childrenâs hospital here and when I saw what was happening with healthcare workers overseas catching coronavirus and being at risk, I was so relieved we locked down, went hard and went early. I feel very confident that New Zealand is going to show the world how to do this.â New Zealand has reported fewer than 1,500 confirmed or probable cases of coronavirus and 19 deaths. Belgium is one of the world's top exporters of potato products Some of us may be guilty of using lockdown as an excuse to indulge in our favourite unhealthy foods, but now Belgians are being urged to eat more chips for a good cause. The nation, known for its love of fries, is said to have 750,000 tonnes of potatoes piled up at warehouses because of coronavirus disruption. Now Belgapom, the country's potato growers' union, has presented the ""twice a week"" chips initiative as a matter of survival for farmers. Read more about the campaign. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter A fake news article circulated on social media, claiming that the first volunteer taking in a coronavirus vaccine trial in Oxford had died. She is alive and well â as BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh confirmed when he spoke to her on Skype. The false claim seems to have originated in an article shared on a site with both genuine and fake global news stories. It was set up in March and registered in the US, but thereâs very little information about whoâs behind it. Most articles are written by a mysterious character who is hard to find on social media. Weâve decided not to use their name or the site's at the risk of amplifying false information. The articles have been pushed out by a Facebook account, which has no information but a name. BBC News has contacted the account, but had no response. This specific fake news story was re-shared in big Facebook groups which oppose vaccinations â or support conspiracy theories. BBC Monitoring's Shayan Saradarizadeh said: âIn less than 48 hours, the fake story has been posted to a potential audience of millions.

"Families of front line NHS and social care staff in England who die from coronavirus will be entitled to a Â£60,000 payment, the government says. Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed 82 NHS and 16 social care workers had died so far during the outbreak. He said he felt a ""deep personal sense of duty that we must care for their loved ones"". Unions have welcomed the announcement, but called for the scheme to be applied to more sectors. The Welsh government haspromised the same payment to its NHS and social care staffwhile Scotland is finalising its own arrangements - although all devolved schemes will be paid for by the UK government. The announcement comes ahead of a one minute's silence at 11:00 BST (10:00 GMT) on Tuesday to remember health workers who have died from the virus. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will take part, along with others from across government. Live: Latest from around the world Johnson: This is moment of maximum risk Analysis: Johnson clear there will be no sudden nirvana Minute's silence for fallen key workers Announcing the scheme at the daily government press briefing, Mr Hancock paid tribute to the ""essential work"" of NHS and social care staff. He said: ""Of course, nothing replaces the loss of a loved one. ""But we want to do everything we can to support families who are dealing with this grief."" The general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, Donna Kinnair, said the new scheme would ""bring reassurance to families in difficult situations"". She added: ""No amount of cash can make up for a family member who passes away but financial security should never add to the worries of those in grief."" General secretary of Unison, Dave Prentis, also welcomed the move, saying: ""Providing financial security for the families of all those who've paid the ultimate price for their professionalism and dedication is the very least we can do."" But the unions called for the scheme to be simple and quick, and to be open to more professionals, such as those working in primary care. Labour welcomed the move but urged ministers to now ""get a grip"" on the supply of personal protective equipment to people on the frontline. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran, who has been campaigning for such a scheme, said it was what NHS heroes ""need and deserve"". But, she added: ""Now, the government needs to go further. The scheme should include the families of all key workers - carers, teachers and bus drivers to name a few - who die on the frontline. ""The scheme should also match that given to the Armed Forces, covering pension benefits and funeral costs."" Mr Hancock said the government was looking into other groups of key workers and what schemes are already available to them.

"The government failed to buy crucial protective equipment to cope with a pandemic, a BBC investigation has found. There were no gowns, visors, swabs or body bags in the government's pandemic stockpile when Covid-19 reached the UK. NHS staff say they are being put at risk because of the shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). The government said it has taken the right steps and is doing everything it can to increase stocks. The investigation by BBC Panorama found that vital items were left out of the stockpile when it was set up in 2009 and that the government subsequently ignored a warning from its own advisers to buy missing equipment. Why some NHS workers are wearing bin bags Are NHS staff getting enough protective gear? The expert committee that advises the government on pandemics, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), recommended the purchase of gowns last June. Gowns are currently one of the items in shortest supply in the UK and they are now difficult to source because of the global shortage of PPE. Doctors and nurses have complained that there are also shortages of the life-saving FFP3 respirator masks. Panorama has discovered that millions of FFP3 respirator masks are unaccounted for. There were 33 million on the original 2009 procurement list for the stockpile, but only 12 million have been handed out. The government refuses to explain where the other masks have gone. A government spokesperson said there was ""limited demand"" for the masks coming through the Supply Disruption Line, ""which is one reason why they haven't all been distributed"". They added that gowns were a recent recommendation from the advisory group and would be procured for the ""future stockpile build up alongside all other necessary equipment"". NHS staff have been washing and reusing PPE Panorama has spoken to a number of NHS insiders about PPE who wish to remain anonymous. ""There is a complete lack of transparency from the government. They are creating panic, as we don't know if they can supply us so we are scrambling to get it elsewhere,"" a head of procurement told the programme. The government also failed to stockpile visors, the swabs needed for testing and the body bags needed for the dead. Professor John Ashton, a public health expert and long-standing critic of the government, told the programme the lack of preparation was breathtaking. ""The consequence of not planning; not ordering kit; not having stockpiles is that we are sending into the front line doctors, nurses, other health workers and social care workers without the equipment to keep them safe,"" he said. A government spokesperson said the stockpile was designed for a flu pandemic and that Covid-19 is a different disease with a higher hospitalisation rate. They said swabs and body bags were not recommended by Nervtag historically, but eye protection was, so the stockpile contains safety glasses. Government minister Victoria Atkins told BBC Breakfast she was ""very, very sorry to hear"" of the Panorama report. ""Like every other country in the world, [the virus] is unprecedented and the requirements for PPE have risen exponentially and we are doing our absolute best to address those needs and will continue to do so throughout this crisis,"" she said. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Panorama also investigated changes to the government guidance on what PPE NHS staff should wear. In January this year, Covid-19 was officially designated a High Consequence Infectious Disease (HCID). The decision was made in consultation with a group of British experts. A Health and Safety Executive evaluation of PPE published in 2019 had already recommended that all healthcare workers should wear a gown, FFP3 respirator mask and visor when dealing with HCIDs. Those recommendations were in line with existing UK guidance. An NHS worker is pictured wearing a plastic bag as a hair cover But on 13 March this year, the government downgraded its guidance on PPE and told NHS staff they were safe to wear less protective aprons and basic surgical masks in all but the most high risk circumstances. Panorama understands that on the same day, the government took steps to remove Covid-19 from the list of HCIDs. But the experts who had recommended the coronavirus be put on the list in the first place were not consulted. Instead, the government asked its Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP). Panorama has discovered that the ACDP was only asked to consider the matter on the morning of its 13 March meeting. It was added to the committee's agenda under ""any other business"". The committee backed the decision to remove Covid-19 from the HCID list, but sources on that committee have told Panorama that it had to be, in part, a pragmatic decision based on the availability of PPE. It was another six days before Public Health England announced that the coronavirus was no longer considered an HCID. A government spokesperson said Covid-19 was taken off the list because it has a low overall mortality rate and there is now greater clinical awareness and a specific laboratory test for the virus. They added the committee's advice that Covid-19 no longer be considered an HCID was based entirely on scientific considerations. ""The HCID classification is used for serious infections where there are limited numbers of cases requiring specialist input and facilities,"" the spokesperson said. ""This is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided at all times by the best scientific advice. ""The government has been working day and night to battle against coronavirus, delivering a strategy designed at all times to protect our NHS and save lives.""

"This video can not be played Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem rejects criticism of its request for aid. The owner of P&O ferries has said the government has been ""slow"" to react to the crisis facing vital supply routes. The ferry company, which transports 15% of all goods in and out of the UK, has applied for financial support to see it through the coronavirus lockdown. The head of Dubai-based DP World told the BBC that P&O needs Â£257m in aid to avoid collapse and has applied to the UK government for Â£150m of that. But Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem said he has yet to get a response from the UK. The DP World chairman and chief executive said: ""P&O plays a vital role in the UK and thousands of jobs depend on this company. We have to be sure that when this is over we can bounce back and save these jobs. ""We have applied to the UK government to support the company to save the jobs of these people. The government has been slow. We need to safeguard these jobs - a lot of people's lives depends on this company."" As leisure passenger numbers have collapsed, moving freight only between the EU and the UK has become economically unviable. P&O has taken seven ships out of service. P&O has also furloughed 1,400 workers, which will see the UK government paying 80% of their wages. As well as P&O, DP World owns the ports of Southampton and the London Gateway, as well as dozens of terminals around the world. Last year it made profits of more than Â£1bn on revenues of more than Â£6bn. A dividend of Â£270m is due to be paid out to DP World shareholders this week. However, Mr bin Sulayem defended P&O's plea for financial assistance. ""DP World has never taken a penny out of P&O. Any profits we have made we have reinvested in new vessels,"" he said. ""DP World owns many businesses around the world. You cannot just take money out of them to put into a company in another place - it doesn't make sense."" Coronavirus: Six sectors still crying out for help Ferries 'need financial help to survive pandemic' The UK Treasury may disagree. It is has taken a hard line with airline Virgin Atlantic, which says it may not survive without a Â£500m government support package. The Treasury has insisted it must ask its own shareholders (Delta Airlines and Sir Richard Branson) and exhaust every other private sector fund raising avenue possible. Mr bin Sulayem also said that Covid-19 would change global trade forever. He said that the economic shock of China's manufacturing shutdown has made companies around the world reconsider their supply chains' reliance on it. ""You cannot have everything being made in one place. Supply chains will need to be shorter,"" he said. The Department for Transport said that Â£27m in subsidies have already been announced for critical ferry delivery routes, some of which were operated by P&O.

Last week, the Maryland governor's office said it issued an alert warning against ingesting or injecting disinfectants after receiving more than 100 calls. The president has said his comments were made sarcastically. The reporter asks if the president takes any responsibility for the increase in calls. ""No,"" he replies. The president responds to a question criticising Health Secretary Alex Azar's early downplaying of the disease by saying it was ""unfair"". He claims Democrats did the same, including Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. ""I was very fortunate through luck or whatever that we closed the border, we put a ban on China,"" he says. ""But I could tell you that Nancy Pelosi was dancing in the streets in Chinatown. She wanted to go, let's go out and party. That was late in February."" Back in February, Mrs Pelosi had encouraged people to visit San Francisco's Chinatown to help struggling businesses. She did not propose any parties, as the president suggested. The city issued a stay-at-home order in March. White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx and Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir have begun outlining efforts to improve the US testing system. Mr Giroir says the federal government will be able to supply every state with the tests they need. But the fine print on the White House's new guidance for states suggests that the testing burden will fall to states. Documents obtained by CBS News, the BBC's US partner, show that the guidelines direct  governors are expected to craft their own plans for increasing testing. Most sentences begin with the words ""states should"". States ""must be able to proactively monitor for and respond to local outbreaks"", the documents say, ""and develop rapid response programmes that enable quick isolation and contact tracing of individuals who test positive"". The president has suggested an unnamed individual ""a long time ago"" could have stopped the ""unnecessary death[s]"" due to Covid-19. ""There has been so much unnecessary death in this country,"" he said. ""It could've been stopped and it could've been stopped short, but somebody a long time ago, it seems, decided not to do it that way and the whole world is suffering because of it."" He did not say who he was referencing and gave no other details. Industry executives say they are working on expanding testing, including self-swab tests. Executives from retailer Walmart; pharmacy chains Rite Aid, Walgreens, CVS; and health diagnostics company LabCorp, as well as the US Cotton industry group said they would make more tests and testing sites available across the country. LabCorp said it would release an at-home Covid-19 test in the coming weeks. But even as commercial labs say they have expanded the capacity for testing, medical officials throughout the US have said they still face shortages of key materials, including testing swabs, reagents, and pipettes. For example, the Ohio Health Department told CNN that the state is focused on testing the most âvulnerable patientsâ because of a âglobal shortage in suppliesâ. Ohio is due to begin reopening some businesses on Friday, 1 May. The president begins by saying Covid-19 cases are declining or stablising across the country. ""In all cases getting better,"" he says.  ""Really a horrible situation that weâve been confronted with, but theyâre moving along."" He adds there's a ""hunger"" to get back to work. ""Ensuring the health of our economy is vital to ensuring the health of our nation - these goals work in tandem."" President Donald Trump is at the microphone and has begun his revamped news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House. He is joined by the vice-president, Mike Pence. After some heavy criticism of the president's suggestions last week about injecting disinfectant, what will the briefing look like? We're about to find out. You can follow along with our livestream here. We asked three Americans who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 to rate the US president's response to the virus, including his recent comments about disinfectant. The BBC first spoke to these voters before the president's inauguration in January 2017 and we've caught up with them several times since. Here's what they had to say.

And then, from next Monday, a new âphased and gradual easing ofâ restrictions will kick in to allow the restoration of some economic and business activities - but the easing comes with nationwide conditions. It will now be compulsory for everyone to wear face masks in public, there will be an overnight curfew between 20:00 and 06:00 with only essential services allowed to move during those times. President Buhari also said there would be a ban on ânon-essential inter-state passenger travel until further noticeâ and all bans on social and religious gatherings would remain in place. He also expressed his deep concern over the âmysterious deathsâ of a number of people in the northern state of Kano. As well as sending a government team to investigate, he said heâd issued a total lockdown for two weeks with immediate effect. President Trump is expected to hold a news conference on the pandemic in the next 20 minutes or so, having earlier cancelled it. His press secretary said it would be held in the Rose Garden and would ""brief the nation on additional testing guidance and safely opening up America again"". Some of Mr Trump's advisers had called for a pause in his almost daily updates, following amazement at his suggestion last Thursday that injecting disinfectant might be a way of treating Covid-19. Some Republicans have warned that the president's briefings were harming his chances of re election. ""We have to manage and augment our behavior,"" the governor said about busy beaches California Governor
Gavin Newsom has pledged to step-up the enforcement of coronavirus-related measures after images spread of people flocking to the coast over the weekend. A stay-at-home order was implemented statewide last month, but some counties have reopened beaches and thousands flocked there during recent hot weather. âThis virus doesnât take the weekends off. This virus doesnât go home because itâs a beautiful sunny day around our coasts,"" Governor Newsom said on Monday.

Jin Russell, a doctor in Auckland, spoke to BBC OS on World Service radio and said: âIâm at the end of a five-week lockdown staying at home with my two little boys and my husband. Iâm really proud of my country. Weâve taken such strong collective action to keep each other safe. âWhen our prime minister, Jacinda Arden, announced five weeks ago the lockdown was going to start I remember crying with relief because my whole family are doctors. My mum is a GP in her 70s, my dad is a full-time pathologist at the hospital, and my brother is a rheumatologist. ""I work at the childrenâs hospital here and when I saw what was happening with healthcare workers overseas catching coronavirus and being at risk, I was so relieved we locked down, went hard and went early. I feel very confident that New Zealand is going to show the world how to do this.â New Zealand has reported fewer than 1,500 confirmed or probable cases of coronavirus and 19 deaths. Belgium is one of the world's top exporters of potato products Some of us may be guilty of using lockdown as an excuse to indulge in our favourite unhealthy foods, but now Belgians are being urged to eat more chips for a good cause. The nation, known for its love of fries, is said to have 750,000 tonnes of potatoes piled up at warehouses because of coronavirus disruption. Now Belgapom, the country's potato growers' union, has presented the ""twice a week"" chips initiative as a matter of survival for farmers. Read more about the campaign. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter A fake news article circulated on social media, claiming that the first volunteer taking in a coronavirus vaccine trial in Oxford had died. She is alive and well â as BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh confirmed when he spoke to her on Skype. The false claim seems to have originated in an article shared on a site with both genuine and fake global news stories. It was set up in March and registered in the US, but thereâs very little information about whoâs behind it. Most articles are written by a mysterious character who is hard to find on social media. Weâve decided not to use their name or the site's at the risk of amplifying false information. The articles have been pushed out by a Facebook account, which has no information but a name. BBC News has contacted the account, but had no response. This specific fake news story was re-shared in big Facebook groups which oppose vaccinations â or support conspiracy theories. BBC Monitoring's Shayan Saradarizadeh said: âIn less than 48 hours, the fake story has been posted to a potential audience of millions.

"Plentiful chips at street stalls would be a sign of normality for Belgians Belgians are well known for loving chips (frites), often with a big dollop of mayonnaise, but hard-up farmers now want them to eat chips twice a week. Romain Cools of the potato growers' union Belgapom presented it as a matter of survival, as a major export sector fears ruin in the coronavirus crisis. About 750,000 tonnes of potatoes are piled up in Belgian warehouses, as the lockdown has sent orders plummeting. ""Let's all eat chips twice a week, instead of just once,"" Mr Cools urged. Since mid-March, restaurants in Belgium and many other markets for potato growers have closed. The cancellation of Belgium's many spring and summer festivals has added to their woes. Moreover, the international trade in potatoes has been hit. Belgium is one of the world's top exporters of potato products, including frozen chips. It sends more than 1.5m tonnes annually to more than 100 countries. Belgium unveils plans to lift lockdown Is my constant lockdown snacking normal? Five ways coronavirus is disrupting the food industry One small bright spot in this story is that Belgapom will now deliver 25 tonnes of potatoes a week to food banks in Flanders - produce that will otherwise simply rot, Belgian media report. ""In this way, part of the potato stock will still be used and we can avoid seeing excellent food, for which our farmers have worked so hard, being lost,"" Flemish Agriculture Minister Hilde Crevits told the Brussels Times. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health The potato crisis has also hit Hauts-de-France, the neighbouring French region that includes Calais. There, almost 500,000 tonnes of potatoes are still waiting for customers, and will most likely be lost. A Belgian grower quoted by broadcaster RTBF, John Van Merhaeghe, doubted that he would get any decent offers from potato processing plants for his surplus. ""At best, if they buy any extra it'll be for â¬15 (Â£13; $16) a tonne - 10 times less than the price marked in the contracts. Fifteen euros is the rate they give for turning potatoes into animal feed!"" Another grower, who declined to be named, called on Belgium's federal government to provide aid, saying the Netherlands was providing â¬50 per tonne for Dutch growers, ""and so far we have nothing like that"". Meanwhile, RTBF reports that some surplus stocks might end up as biofuel to generate electricity.

"This video can not be played Sunak: The microloan scheme will be ""100% guaranteed by the government"" Small firms are to get access to 100% taxpayer-backed loans after they raised concerns about slow access to existing coronavirus rescue schemes. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons the scheme would start next week, offering firms loans up to Â£50,000 within days of applying. It aims to unlock a backlog of credit checks by banks amid fears many small firms could fold before getting loans. The scheme requires filling in a two-page self-certification form online. The loan terms mean that no capital or interest repayments will be due for one year. Instead, the government will pay the interest for the first 12 months. Banks have come under fire for delays in handing out loans, but have blamed the heavy workload, need to complete the necessary credit checks, and a shortage of staff. Underwriting the loans removes the risk that banks will not get their money back, which Mr Sunak hopes will speed up the application process. The new ""microloan scheme"" would provide a ""simple, quick, easy"" solution, he told the Commons. In a statement issued on behalf of the major lenders to small firms, including Barclays and Lloyds, trade body UK Finance said the ""welcome changes should enable banks to provide finance to businesses more quickly"". Analysis, Faisal Islam, economics editor: The chancellor said: ""Never before have we been able to do something of this magnitude in such a short space of time."" It's not the end of the economic rescue schemes. They are needed in this ""new normal"" for the economy - which looks set to last for months. For now, the priority is public health, and controlling the pandemic. Without public confidence in that, consumers will not go to shops, workers will not return to offices. Read more from from Faisal: here In another significant change, firms applying for the new loans will now only have to prove that they were viable in the past before the crisis, not that they will viable after the crisis. Companies have complained they struggled to prove their future potential with some much uncertainty over the economic environment. The chancellor had come under pressure to underwrite all loans, not just those up to Â£50,000. But he said he was not prepared to do this as he needed to balance the risk to the taxpayer with the needs of small businesses. He said: ""I've heard some calls for the government to underwrite all our loan schemes with 100% guarantees. I remain unconvinced by the case for doing that universally. ""We should not ask the ordinary taxpayers of today and tomorrow to bear the entire risk of lending almost unlimited sums to businesses who may, in some cases, have very little prospect of paying those loans back and not necessarily because of the impact of the coronavirus."" Some High Street names won't be back, warns Timpson Five firms booming despite the lockdown Pressure mounts on Chancellor to guarantee 100% of loans to firms Earlier this month the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said that slow bank emergency lending ""had to be sorted out"" and that taking on all the risk from banks could ""unblock"" the schemes for small business especially. Unlike the existing loan scheme, banks will not retain any of the risk for these loans, which could stretch into the billions or tens of billions depending on how long the crisis lasts. Business leaders welcomed the move, with Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn calling it transformational for small firms. ""Sole traders, micro-firms and entrepreneurs will now have a simple route to fast finance to stay afloat, without red tape or time-consuming checks,"" she said. ""Thousands of businesses could be saved by this lifeline. Banks now need to continue their work in overdrive to get the loans flowing faster."" And the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, Mike Cherry, said it would ""give hope to thousands"" of firms. ""To date, the existing interruption loan scheme has not been working for the small firms that make-up 99% of our business community. ""The decision by the chancellor to listen to our recommendation for a 100% guarantee on smaller loans, alongside the creation of a new fast-track system for those applying for them, will give hope to thousands.""

"This video can not be played The PM warned the country was at the 'moment of maximum risk' The UK is at the moment of maximum risk in the coronavirus outbreak, Boris Johnson has said, as he urged people not to lose patience with the lockdown. Speaking outside No 10 for the first time since recovering from the virus, Mr Johnson said ""we are now beginning to turn the tide"" on the disease. He said lockdown would not be relaxed too soon and details on any changes will be set out over the ""coming days"". But some paused NHS England services, such as cancer care, are to resume And the families of front-line NHS and social care staff who die with coronavirus will receive a Â£60,000 compensation payment, the government has announced. 'When will I be able to hug my grandchildren?' Bereaved frontline families entitled to Â£60,000 Sunak unveils 100% state-backed loans for small firms Virus response scheme sees 33 prisoners released Minute's silence for key workers who lost lives It comes as the latest daily figures show a further 360 people died with the virus in hospitals, taking the total number of deaths to 21,092. This number includes 82 NHS staff and 16 care workers who have died in hospital in England. The UK deaths figure do not include people who died in the community, for example in care homes, or people who have died in their own homes. The prime minister returned to Downing Street on Sunday after more than three weeks off sick. Mr Johnson said he understood concerns from business owners who were impatient to end the lockdown. But ending it too soon could lead to a second spike in cases and cause more deaths, ""economic disaster"" and restrictions being reintroduced, he said. He said there were ""real signs now that we are passing through the peak"" - including with fewer hospital admissions and fewer Covid-19 patients in intensive care. LIVE:PM urges UK to stick with lockdown A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area And comparing the outbreak to someone being attacked, Mr Johnson said: ""If this virus were a physical assailant, an unexpected and invisible mugger - which I can tell you from personal experience, it is - then this is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor... the moment when we can press home our advantage"". Mr Johnson said once the UK is meeting the five tests for easing restrictions -including a consistent fall in the death rate and making sure the NHS can cope- ""then that will be the time to move on to the second phase"" in the fight against the outbreak. A Downing Street spokesman said there could be more on how the government will judge the country's ability to ""move forward"" by the end of the week. Soldiers give instructions at a drive-through testing centre in Salisbury As people are told to stay at home, triathlete Lloyd Bebbington trains in a pool in his garden in Newcastle-under-Lyme Labour's environment spokesman Luke Pollard welcomed signs the government would be more transparent about exiting lockdown, saying the party had called for the government to publish its strategy. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish government's daily briefing,  it was ""not the time to throw caution to the wind"" and lift lockdown measures - although there had been ""real signs of progress"". Speaking at the Downing Street briefing later, the UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said scientists were trying to asses how ""opening up of different bits of society"" would affect the spread of he virus. He said there was ""no perfect solution"" and ministers would face ""very difficult choices"" about what measures could be lifted. The political could hardly be more personal. But the prime minister's return to work and return to health is far from a metaphor for the country making a quick recovery from the crisis. In contrast, Boris Johnson's statement at the lectern this morning was a request to the public to be patient, to keep going, to hold firm through the frustrations of living life mainly behind closed doors for a while longer. Despite some restlessness among the public, increasing volume in his own party, and from the opposition for a clearer route out of this, for the prime minister it's not yet the time to give more detail - and certainly not yet the time to change any of the restrictions. And when that time is reached, when the infection rate is deemed low enough, he was clear, that there will be no sudden nirvana - life in the 'next phase' will be a slow return of a more familiar rhythm, acknowledging, but not being swayed by demands to open up the economy much more swiftly. Read more from Laura Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced plans at the briefing to restart some NHS services in England, which had been paused to help the health service cope during the outbreak. Mr Hancock said the ""most urgent"" services - such as cancer care and mental health support - would be restored first, starting on Tuesday. ""The exact pace of the restoration will be determined by local circumstances on the ground, according to local need and according to the amount of coronavirus cases that that hospital is having to deal with,"" he said. The health secretary also announced details of a life assurance scheme for NHS and social care workers who die on the front line with Covid 19. He said the government wanted to do ""everything we can to support families"" dealing with their grief and was ""looking at other professions"" the scheme could be expanded to include. This video can not be played Hancock: ""We want to do everything we can to support families dealing with this grief"" Mr Hancock has set a target of carrying out 100,000 tests a day for coronavirus across the UK by 30 April. The latest Department of Health figures show 37,024 tests were carried out on Sunday - still far short of the target. Mr Hancock said he was still confident of reaching the target, which he said would be ""big enough"" to support the next phase of the government's strategy to ""test, track and trace"". Downing Street said it could take a ""couple of days or more"" before it was clear if the 100,000 target has been met as there was a ""time lag"" in collating some of the figures, such as on home testing kits. Mr Hancock said the government is still aiming to eventually conduct 250,000 tests a day. This would include antibody tests, but he said these are yet to be ""clinically valid"". Monday's daily briefing was the first to featurea question from a member of the public. Lynne from Skipton, North Yorkshire, said she missed her grandchildren andwanted to know whether allowing family to hugwould be one of the first steps when restrictions are eventually eased. Mr Hancock said the question ""brought home the emotional impact of lockdown"" and that he hoped it would be allowed ""as soon as possible"". Anyone over the age of 18can now submit a question,externalfor those at the daily briefing which will be chosen by an independent polling organisation. Health secretary Matt Hancock was certainly bullish about the government's testing strategy at the daily briefing. The numbers being tested are going up and there is certainly capacity to process more - three mega labs are now open in Glasgow, Cheshire and Milton Keynes. But the problem in the UK though is more to do with giving people easy access to tests. To date, the UK has relied on hospitals and drive-thru centres to carry out the swab tests. But to make it more convenient home testing kits are now being offered and mobile units staffed by the army are in operation. The smooth rollout of these will be essential if numbers are to continue climbing and ministers then succeed in moving to the ""test, track and trace"" strategy once lockdown restrictions are eased. In terms of testing, this means providing access to tests to the general public - at the moment only hospital patients, care home residents and essential workers are entitled to them. But even these restricted groups have been enough to overwhelm the system - the online booking system has had to be closed at points because demand has been too high. There is, it is fair to say, plenty of work still to do. Elsewhere,the Treasury has announced extra loans for small businesses, after they raised concerns about slow access to existing coronavirus rescue schemes. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the Commons the scheme would start next week, offering loans to small firms for 25% of turnover, up to Â£50,000, within days of applying. The loans would be interest free for the first 12 months, he added. Loans to larger businesses under the coronavirus business interruption loans scheme will continue to get 80% government-backing. In Capel in Surrey, villagers have made scarecrows of key workers Mr Johnson was diagnosed with the virus a month ago. He was admitted to St Thomas' Hospital in central London on 5 April and spent a week there, including three nights in intensive care.

"After Easter, when the government in England announced lockdown was to continue for another three weeks, it set out five tests that had to be met before restrictions were eased. We are now well on the way to lifting them in both England and the rest of the UK. But to what extent are the tests being met? And what is the risk of them lapsing? As soon as images began to emerge in February of hospitals in Italy being overwhelmed with coronavirus cases, making sure the NHS could cope became the first priority. Routine operations were cancelled en masse and large field hospitals - known as Nightingales in England - began to be built. A deal was also struck with the independent sector to use ventilators and beds in private hospitals. Cases peaked in early April - and have been falling ever since. At the peak more than 3,000 Covid admissions were being seen every day. That is now down to under 500 and all the field hospitals are hibernating. Routine work has now been restarted, but the NHS remains on an emergency footing, ready for a second peak. If cases increase again the field hospitals will be re-opened - although with the exception of London, none of these has intensive care facilities. More than 40,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, government data shows. These figure relate to the numbers who die after testing positive for the virus. It does not necessarily mean the virus was the direct cause of their death - although work by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests that in the overwhelming majority of cases it is. Deaths peaked in early-to-mid-April - and have been falling ever since. The downward trend is uneven because the recording of deaths slows at weekends, so the figures tend to drop then before rising during the week. But when you look at the seven-day average, the trend is clear. The number of newly diagnosed cases in the UK is hovering around the 1,500 mark on most days at the moment. Ministers say this shows infection rates are at manageable levels. At the peak there were around 6,000 positive tests a day, but this was when testing was restricted to certain groups, so was not an accurate measure of the true level of infections. It is estimated in late March there were around 100,000 new infections a day. But even now with widespread testing available, doubts remain whether the true level of infections is being identified. A surveillance programme in England run by the ONS suggests around 4,000 new infections a day are being seen. Part of the problem is that for some the virus leads to such mild symptoms or none at all, that they do not even realise they are infected. That poses a problem keeping on top of the virus because if there are significant numbers of silent spreaders, new -  more serious  - cases could keep popping up. Currently the UK has capacity to provide more than 200,000 tests a day, if you include tests posted out to individuals and care homes. That is a significant improvement on the picture at the start of March - when only around 10,000 a day were being done. Three mega-labs have been opened to process tests, while around 50 drive-through testing centres, 100 military-run mobile units and a home-testing service have been launched to complement the testing done in hospitals. That means there is plenty of capacity - anyone who needs a test can certainly get one. Staff - in hospitals, care homes and, to a lesser extent, other public services - also need personal protective equipment (PPE), such as visors, gowns and masks, to protect them from the virus. The more cases there are, the more demand for kit there will be. In the first weeks of the pandemic, there were serious concerns about the availability of PPE. Some hospitals and care homes were reporting they were struggling to get hold of the equipment they needed. The army was brought in to distribute supplies. The stockpile the government holds for pandemics has been used up, but international and domestic supply routes have improved. Local authority and NHS bosses both say the pressure on PPE has eased. Without a vaccine, this will be a very tricky one to navigate. As well as widespread testing, England has set up a contact-tracing system, with separate services being run by the other UK nations. The idea is that this service will help contain any local flare-ups by getting the close contacts of infected people to self-isolate, to stop further spread. It is still early days for the programme - with even its bosses warning it is not yet ""gold standard"". Originally the army of contact-tracers being employed was meant to be complemented by a tracing app that would alert people when they have been in close contact with an infected individual. This could be particularly useful if people have been seated close to someone on a train, for example. The app has been piloted on the Isle of Wight, but is currently not ready for national roll-out. The UK has come a long way in the past few months. But there are concerns the infection rates are still too high and tests are not being turned around quickly enough, while doubts remain about whether the contact-tracing system will be good enough. But at the end of the day, the easing of restrictions comes down to political judgement. The lockdown itself is harmful - economically, socially and for health. Ministers are taking into account more than just these five tests in the decision-making process. Follow Nickon Twitter,external Read more from Nick LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

"Plentiful chips at street stalls would be a sign of normality for Belgians Belgians are well known for loving chips (frites), often with a big dollop of mayonnaise, but hard-up farmers now want them to eat chips twice a week. Romain Cools of the potato growers' union Belgapom presented it as a matter of survival, as a major export sector fears ruin in the coronavirus crisis. About 750,000 tonnes of potatoes are piled up in Belgian warehouses, as the lockdown has sent orders plummeting. ""Let's all eat chips twice a week, instead of just once,"" Mr Cools urged. Since mid-March, restaurants in Belgium and many other markets for potato growers have closed. The cancellation of Belgium's many spring and summer festivals has added to their woes. Moreover, the international trade in potatoes has been hit. Belgium is one of the world's top exporters of potato products, including frozen chips. It sends more than 1.5m tonnes annually to more than 100 countries. Belgium unveils plans to lift lockdown Is my constant lockdown snacking normal? Five ways coronavirus is disrupting the food industry One small bright spot in this story is that Belgapom will now deliver 25 tonnes of potatoes a week to food banks in Flanders - produce that will otherwise simply rot, Belgian media report. ""In this way, part of the potato stock will still be used and we can avoid seeing excellent food, for which our farmers have worked so hard, being lost,"" Flemish Agriculture Minister Hilde Crevits told the Brussels Times.

There, almost 500,000 tonnes of potatoes are still waiting for customers, and will most likely be lost. A Belgian grower quoted by broadcaster RTBF, John Van Merhaeghe, doubted that he would get any decent offers from potato processing plants for his surplus. ""At best, if they buy any extra it'll be for â¬15 (Â£13; $16) a tonne - 10 times less than the price marked in the contracts. Fifteen euros is the rate they give for turning potatoes into animal feed!"" Another grower, who declined to be named, called on Belgium's federal government to provide aid, saying the Netherlands was providing â¬50 per tonne for Dutch growers, ""and so far we have nothing like that"".

"This video can not be played The PM warned the country was at the 'moment of maximum risk' The UK is at the moment of maximum risk in the coronavirus outbreak, Boris Johnson has said, as he urged people not to lose patience with the lockdown. Speaking outside No 10 for the first time since recovering from the virus, Mr Johnson said ""we are now beginning to turn the tide"" on the disease. He said lockdown would not be relaxed too soon and details on any changes will be set out over the ""coming days"". But some paused NHS England services, such as cancer care, are to resume And the families of front-line NHS and social care staff who die with coronavirus will receive a Â£60,000 compensation payment, the government has announced. 'When will I be able to hug my grandchildren?' Bereaved frontline families entitled to Â£60,000 Sunak unveils 100% state-backed loans for small firms Virus response scheme sees 33 prisoners released Minute's silence for key workers who lost lives It comes as the latest daily figures show a further 360 people died with the virus in hospitals, taking the total number of deaths to 21,092. This number includes 82 NHS staff and 16 care workers who have died in hospital in England. The UK deaths figure do not include people who died in the community, for example in care homes, or people who have died in their own homes. The prime minister returned to Downing Street on Sunday after more than three weeks off sick. Mr Johnson said he understood concerns from business owners who were impatient to end the lockdown. But ending it too soon could lead to a second spike in cases and cause more deaths, ""economic disaster"" and restrictions being reintroduced, he said. He said there were ""real signs now that we are passing through the peak"" - including with fewer hospital admissions and fewer Covid-19 patients in intensive care. LIVE:PM urges UK to stick with lockdown A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area And comparing the outbreak to someone being attacked, Mr Johnson said: ""If this virus were a physical assailant, an unexpected and invisible mugger - which I can tell you from personal experience, it is - then this is the moment when we have begun together to wrestle it to the floor... the moment when we can press home our advantage"". Mr Johnson said once the UK is meeting the five tests for easing restrictions -including a consistent fall in the death rate and making sure the NHS can cope- ""then that will be the time to move on to the second phase"" in the fight against the outbreak. A Downing Street spokesman said there could be more on how the government will judge the country's ability to ""move forward"" by the end of the week. Soldiers give instructions at a drive-through testing centre in Salisbury As people are told to stay at home, triathlete Lloyd Bebbington trains in a pool in his garden in Newcastle-under-Lyme Labour's environment spokesman Luke Pollard welcomed signs the government would be more transparent about exiting lockdown, saying the party had called for the government to publish its strategy. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish government's daily briefing,  it was ""not the time to throw caution to the wind"" and lift lockdown measures - although there had been ""real signs of progress"". Speaking at the Downing Street briefing later, the UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said scientists were trying to asses how ""opening up of different bits of society"" would affect the spread of he virus. He said there was ""no perfect solution"" and ministers would face ""very difficult choices"" about what measures could be lifted. The political could hardly be more personal. But the prime minister's return to work and return to health is far from a metaphor for the country making a quick recovery from the crisis. In contrast, Boris Johnson's statement at the lectern this morning was a request to the public to be patient, to keep going, to hold firm through the frustrations of living life mainly behind closed doors for a while longer. Despite some restlessness among the public, increasing volume in his own party, and from the opposition for a clearer route out of this, for the prime minister it's not yet the time to give more detail - and certainly not yet the time to change any of the restrictions. And when that time is reached, when the infection rate is deemed low enough, he was clear, that there will be no sudden nirvana - life in the 'next phase' will be a slow return of a more familiar rhythm, acknowledging, but not being swayed by demands to open up the economy much more swiftly. Read more from Laura Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced plans at the briefing to restart some NHS services in England, which had been paused to help the health service cope during the outbreak. Mr Hancock said the ""most urgent"" services - such as cancer care and mental health support - would be restored first, starting on Tuesday. ""The exact pace of the restoration will be determined by local circumstances on the ground, according to local need and according to the amount of coronavirus cases that that hospital is having to deal with,"" he said. The health secretary also announced details of a life assurance scheme for NHS and social care workers who die on the front line with Covid 19. He said the government wanted to do ""everything we can to support families"" dealing with their grief and was ""looking at other professions"" the scheme could be expanded to include. This video can not be played Hancock: ""We want to do everything we can to support families dealing with this grief"" Mr Hancock has set a target of carrying out 100,000 tests a day for coronavirus across the UK by 30 April. The latest Department of Health figures show 37,024 tests were carried out on Sunday - still far short of the target. Mr Hancock said he was still confident of reaching the target, which he said would be ""big enough"" to support the next phase of the government's strategy to ""test, track and trace"". Downing Street said it could take a ""couple of days or more"" before it was clear if the 100,000 target has been met as there was a ""time lag"" in collating some of the figures, such as on home testing kits. Mr Hancock said the government is still aiming to eventually conduct 250,000 tests a day. This would include antibody tests, but he said these are yet to be ""clinically valid"". Monday's daily briefing was the first to featurea question from a member of the public. Lynne from Skipton, North Yorkshire, said she missed her grandchildren andwanted to know whether allowing family to hugwould be one of the first steps when restrictions are eventually eased. Mr Hancock said the question ""brought home the emotional impact of lockdown"" and that he hoped it would be allowed ""as soon as possible"". Anyone over the age of 18can now submit a question,externalfor those at the daily briefing which will be chosen by an independent polling organisation. Health secretary Matt Hancock was certainly bullish about the government's testing strategy at the daily briefing. The numbers being tested are going up and there is certainly capacity to process more - three mega labs are now open in Glasgow, Cheshire and Milton Keynes. But the problem in the UK though is more to do with giving people easy access to tests. To date, the UK has relied on hospitals and drive-thru centres to carry out the swab tests. But to make it more convenient home testing kits are now being offered and mobile units staffed by the army are in operation. The smooth rollout of these will be essential if numbers are to continue climbing and ministers then succeed in moving to the ""test, track and trace"" strategy once lockdown restrictions are eased. In terms of testing, this means providing access to tests to the general public - at the moment only hospital patients, care home residents and essential workers are entitled to them. But even these restricted groups have been enough to overwhelm the system - the online booking system has had to be closed at points because demand has been too high. There is, it is fair to say, plenty of work still to do. Elsewhere,the Treasury has announced extra loans for small businesses, after they raised concerns about slow access to existing coronavirus rescue schemes. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the Commons the scheme would start next week, offering loans to small firms for 25% of turnover, up to Â£50,000, within days of applying. The loans would be interest free for the first 12 months, he added. Loans to larger businesses under the coronavirus business interruption loans scheme will continue to get 80% government-backing.

"Greggs is to become the latest food retailer to reopen some of its outlets despite the coronavirus lockdown. The bakery chain, which has more than 2,050 shops, said it would open 20 of them in the Newcastle area from Monday 4 May as part of a ""controlled trial"", with more to follow. Greggs closed all its stores more than a month agowhen the lockdown began. Earlier this month, Burger King, KFC and Pret A Manger reopened certain restaurants, mainly for delivery only. Shops preparing ways to reopen Major takeaway chains start to reopen Greggs chief executive Roger Whiteside said the trial, set to last at least two weeks, would involve a limited product range and shorter trading hours. In a letter to staff, he said that from 8 June, he hoped to open about 700 stores, including 150 franchise shops. He intends to have all stores open again by 1 July, when the government's job retention scheme is due to end. However, Mr Whiteside said that timing could change, depending on future government announcements. ""We expect it will only be possible to open this many shops if the government has taken a first step in relaxing the lockdown, which could be to open the schools,"" he added. The company expects sales to be ""significantly lower than normal"" while social distancing measures are in place. A Greggs spokeswoman said: ""We want to play our part in getting the nation back up and running again, so we are planning to conduct a limited trial with volunteers to explore how we can reopen our shops with new measures in place that keep our colleagues and customers as safe as we can when we reopen at scale.""

"Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman spoke to MPs on Monday It is in children's interests to return to school ""as soon as possible"", says the head of England's schools watchdog, Ofsted. Amanda Spielman told a panel of MPs home and online learning were ""imperfect substitutes"" for school. But she acknowledged adult health and infection risk needed to be considered. Ms Spielman also said she expected to see a rise in the number of children needing some form of social care in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Last week, England's Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, said no date had been set for schools to reopen to pupils other than key workers' children and those considered vulnerable - and certain thresholds in fighting coronavirus would have to be met. Speaking at the Downing Street briefing on Monday evening, the UK's chief medical officer Chris Whitty said the reinfection rate, known as the R, was near to three when schools were closed to the majority of pupils in March and is now below one. Prof Whitty said experts were currently trying to establish what the impact of children returning to school would be on the R. ""Whilst it remains the case we think that the contribution of children at school is probably less than, for example, for flu, we do think it certainly contributes. ""And what we're trying to work out is what proportion of the R it [schools being open] contributes and therefore if children went back to school, how much closer to one - and that's in a bad way - would we be and could it even tip us above one, and what we can do, if so, to try and minimise that."" On Monday morning, Ms Spielman told the Education Select Committee: ""We have to accept that what can be done while schools are substantially closed is a very poor substitute for full normal education. ""Children are losing education and it's not just the children who are disadvantaged or academically behind, it's children without motivations. ""And it would be unrealistic for anyone, including me, to expect the vast majority of children to have made the same progress they would have made if they'd been in school, which is why I truly believe that it's in children's interests to be back in school as early as possible."" Heads say 1 June earliest realistic school opening Around '2m children face higher risks' in lockdown Tiny fraction of 'at risk' children going to school Ms Spielman acknowledged ""children's interests alone don't dictate the decision"". ""There are decisions around adults, adult health and infection, there are decisions around medical provision - clearly, this is a balance that is not mine nor the Department for Education's to make,"" she said. But she urged schools to plan for how they could best return to normal education and ""making sure children feel that normality"". The Ofsted boss said she did not expect inspections to resume before the end of the summer term and schools would not be judged on how they had educated children during the current crisis. There were ""clear expectations"" around safeguarding, she said, but ""no expectations from government on learning"". ""We need to recognise that education has been substantially disrupted and will continue to be disrupted for some period after schools reopen, given what we know about likely expectations around social distancing and shielding,"" Ms Spielman said. But, she added: ""We need to make sure that parents get the assurance they need that schools are looking after their children properly and educating them well."" The social-care area of Ofsted's work was ""the very busiest at the moment"", Ms Spielman said. ""We have every reason to think this [pandemic] is putting more pressure on a lot of families - we've all seen the reports around increased domestic violence,"" she said. ""We know some families will be under significant financial pressure - and financial strain does not help families' situations. ""So, yes, it seems very likely that there will be more children needing social care. The Ofsted boss expects a rise in social care referrals ""But at the moment referrals to local authorities are down, not up - many referrals come from schools. ""So my expectation, yes, it's that there will be even more pressure on children's homes [and] home placements [of children needing to be looked after by their local authority], as we come out of this."" The chief inspector also took questions from MPs about unregistered schools, the sex and relationships curriculum and whether schools could study GCSE content over three years rather than the traditional two.

"Malham Cove is a popular beauty spot in the Yorkshire Dales National Park People are ""blatantly ignoring"" lockdown rules by visiting beauty spots and no longer staying at home, police have said. North Yorkshire Police issued 61 fines over the weekend to people travelling to the area from West Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cumbria and Kent. Day-trippers to the Yorkshire Dales accounted for the majority of fines. The force said people should not be trying to find ""loopholes"" to justify having a day out. Seventeen fines were issued in Malham, with 13 written in an hour, police said. One officer posted on Facebook about her experience at Malham Cove over the weekend. ""Politely engaging with folk to go back to where they came from (Kent, Barnsley, Bradford, Dewsbury, Accrington) their sense of entitlement kicked in, and I endured more abuse than I ever have dealing with drunken idiots outside nightclubs,"" she wrote. She said one group had spat on the ground in front of her, another man had hurled abuse at her in front of his children, and she had to break-up one group who decided to have a barbecue on parched ground at the top of Malham Cove. The national park has closed its car parks in a bid to persuade day-trippers not to come Chris Wildman, chair of Kirkby Malham Parish Council, said the good weather had brought more visitors to the area and it was quite disturbing for residents. ""It's our home and so people are genuinely frightened if they start seeing an increase in visitors. ""Everybody here is trying really hard to social distance and are staying away from towns and cities."" North Yorkshire Police said 31 fines were issued on Saturday and 30 on Sunday. Assistant Chief Constable Mike Walker said up to now the majority of residents and visitors had acted responsibly and abided by the rules. ""However, we are definitely starting to see a turning of the tide in some areas, with some blatantly ignoring the reason why we have been in a lockdown situation for the past five weeks and making a decision to no longer stay home and save lives,"" he said. ""As I have previously mentioned, this is not about finding loopholes in the guidance to justify having a day out. ""This is about keeping your elderly, vulnerable grandmother safe, your asthmatic child safe or your diabetic father safe.""

"The Timpson repairs chain will reopen some of its outlets this week amid lockdown Some High Street shops will not survive the coronavirus lockdown, the chairman of the retail chain Timpson has warned. Sir John Timpson said high streets would look ""somewhat different"" after restrictions were eased. The key-cutting and repair firm, which also owns Snappy Snaps and Johnsons dry cleaners, will reopen 40 of its outlets this week. Sir John told the BBC's Today programme: ""There are going to be some other names that don't come back."" UK shops deemed ""non-essential"" have been shutsince the government imposed strict measures,externalto tackle the spread of coronavirus on 23 March. It has come at a bad time for the High Street, which faced a consumer spending slowdown before the virus hit. With other parts of the economy also shut down,a recession is now expected. Timpson, which has over 2,150 shops, says staff will return to outlets based in supermarkets, which are classified as essential retailers, along with a handful of the group's High Street dry-cleaning stores. Sir John, whose family founded the 155-year-old business, said: ""The most important part of this is to get the safety right."" High Street shops preparing ways to reopen Five firms booming despite the lockdown The retailer will give staff face masks and install perspex screens to separate them from customers at the checkout. However, he added: ""Until we get there we don't know how particularly the social distancing is going to work, bearing in mind we've got a shop inside someone else's shop."" It comes as the Trade Unions Congress (TUC) has urged businesses desperate to resume trading to take caution. It is calling for ""tough new measures"" to ensure that all employers carry out a risk assessment before lockdown measures are lifted and staff return to work. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady told the BBC's Today programme: ""Everybody wants people to get back to work safely so that we can get the economy back on its feet. ""But workers have to know, and be confident, that their health and safety is being put first. Otherwise, we're going to see this virus spread again and we'll be back to square one."" Beyond the retail sector, housebuilder Redrow also announced on Monday that it would see a ""phased return"" to construction in May. Steve Morgan, the firm's founder and former chairman said: ""This is a real tricky one, and health and safety has to come first."" However, he dismissed the need for government-mandated risk assessments before a return to work, as outlined by the TUC. ""Most employers are very sensible people. They know what to do and clearly, their employees are the priority. Nobody is going to take risks in this situation, we all want this virus to come to an end."" Meanwhile, business lobby group the Institute of Directors says its members are ""clamouring"" for information on when lockdown restrictions will be lifted. On Monday, its director general John Geldart said: ""It's in everyone's interests to get the economy off life support when it's safe to do so. ""Business leaders know this will not happen all in one go, but that's why it's even more important to tell them what they need to prepare for."" In a new survey of more than 1,000 of its members, more than one-third said they felt ""very pessimistic"" about the wider UK economy in the coming 12 months. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"This video can not be played Sunak: The microloan scheme will be ""100% guaranteed by the government"" Small firms are to get access to 100% taxpayer-backed loans after they raised concerns about slow access to existing coronavirus rescue schemes. Chancellor Rishi Sunak told the House of Commons the scheme would start next week, offering firms loans up to Â£50,000 within days of applying. It aims to unlock a backlog of credit checks by banks amid fears many small firms could fold before getting loans. The scheme requires filling in a two-page self-certification form online. The loan terms mean that no capital or interest repayments will be due for one year. Instead, the government will pay the interest for the first 12 months. Banks have come under fire for delays in handing out loans, but have blamed the heavy workload, need to complete the necessary credit checks, and a shortage of staff. Underwriting the loans removes the risk that banks will not get their money back, which Mr Sunak hopes will speed up the application process. The new ""microloan scheme"" would provide a ""simple, quick, easy"" solution, he told the Commons. In a statement issued on behalf of the major lenders to small firms, including Barclays and Lloyds, trade body UK Finance said the ""welcome changes should enable banks to provide finance to businesses more quickly"". Analysis, Faisal Islam, economics editor: The chancellor said: ""Never before have we been able to do something of this magnitude in such a short space of time."" It's not the end of the economic rescue schemes. They are needed in this ""new normal"" for the economy - which looks set to last for months. For now, the priority is public health, and controlling the pandemic. Without public confidence in that, consumers will not go to shops, workers will not return to offices. Read more from from Faisal: here In another significant change, firms applying for the new loans will now only have to prove that they were viable in the past before the crisis, not that they will viable after the crisis. Companies have complained they struggled to prove their future potential with some much uncertainty over the economic environment. The chancellor had come under pressure to underwrite all loans, not just those up to Â£50,000. But he said he was not prepared to do this as he needed to balance the risk to the taxpayer with the needs of small businesses. He said: ""I've heard some calls for the government to underwrite all our loan schemes with 100% guarantees. I remain unconvinced by the case for doing that universally. ""We should not ask the ordinary taxpayers of today and tomorrow to bear the entire risk of lending almost unlimited sums to businesses who may, in some cases, have very little prospect of paying those loans back and not necessarily because of the impact of the coronavirus."" Some High Street names won't be back, warns Timpson Five firms booming despite the lockdown Pressure mounts on Chancellor to guarantee 100% of loans to firms Earlier this month the Governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey, said that slow bank emergency lending ""had to be sorted out"" and that taking on all the risk from banks could ""unblock"" the schemes for small business especially. Unlike the existing loan scheme, banks will not retain any of the risk for these loans, which could stretch into the billions or tens of billions depending on how long the crisis lasts. Business leaders welcomed the move, with Dame Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general Dame Carolyn Fairbairn calling it transformational for small firms. ""Sole traders, micro-firms and entrepreneurs will now have a simple route to fast finance to stay afloat, without red tape or time-consuming checks,"" she said. ""Thousands of businesses could be saved by this lifeline. Banks now need to continue their work in overdrive to get the loans flowing faster."" And the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, Mike Cherry, said it would ""give hope to thousands"" of firms. ""To date, the existing interruption loan scheme has not been working for the small firms that make-up 99% of our business community.

"Masks are on sale at markets such as here in Berlin Germans have started wearing facemasks outside the home as new rules come into force to curb the spread of coronavirus. The use of cloth masks is now mandatory on public transport and, in most regions, within shops. The rules vary among the 16 German states - Bavaria being the strictest, while in Berlin shoppers do not have to wear masks. But the authorities are moving very cautiously in easing the lockdown. Across the world countries are coming up with their own guidance on mask-wearing. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) advice suggests people should wear protective masks only if they are sick and showing symptoms, or if they are caring for people suspected to have Covid-19. It says masks are not recommended for the general public because they can be contaminated by coughs and sneezes, and might offer a false sense of security. Is the advice on face masks going to change? Italy moves to ease Europe's longest lockdown German media report that mask-wearing is now required in school corridors and when children go on breaks, but not in the classroom. Students sit in class spaced apart and there is more frequent cleaning with disinfectant. Students preparing for their school leaving exams are also back in class. Most German schoolchildren are still at home under lockdown. The German authorities require mask-wearing at stations and on buses and trains, but not yet on long-distance trains. A vending machine for masks in a Berlin U-Bahn (underground) station Home-made cloth masks are acceptable; people are not expected to wear hospital-style intensive care masks. These are now on sale in station vending machines and at markets. Monday also saw some further easing of the lockdowns in the Czech Republic and  Switzerland, while Italy has set out a detailed plan for easing its lockdown which remains one of the strictest in Europe. By DamienMcGuinnessin Berlin Face-masks have become the new toilet paper, quipped one German newspaper commentator, as people across Germany scramble to buy nose-and-mouth coverings. To plug the gap, signs are popping up in shop windows advertising self-made, brightly coloured cloth masks, typically costing around 10 euros. In the hipper parts of town, patterned face-masks are a style accessory. Faces may be covered but Berliners are still keen to show their individuality. ""If I talk to the shop assistant â and if I have the virus without knowing â then it means that I don't pass it on to her,"" said Florian, a graphic designer, who was wearing a simple cloth mask while coming out of a shop. ""It's about being aware and protecting other people."" But Christine, a special needs teacher, who wasn't wearing a mask and uses a scarf around her mouth and nose in shops, worried that mask-wearing is more about virtue-signalling than safety. ""The situation is really confused,"" she said. ""Some people wear masks, some people don't. It makes the whole thing absurd. I think it's a bit of a placebo."" Either way the new rules are having a visible impact. Until recently face-masks were a rarity in Germany, and would attract stares. Now they are suddenly a normal part of daily life. Germany has reported 5,750 deaths from Covid-19 - a much lower toll than in Italy, Spain, France or the UK. Its large-scale testing and strict, early lockdown are believed to have kept the rate of infection down. A Berlin classroom on Monday: The teacher wears a mask but pupils do not Last week the eastern state of Saxony became the first to make mask-wearing compulsory. It is also compulsory in Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, for shoppers and public transport users. And in the Nigerian capital, Lagos,face masks must be worn in public from Monday. The state's governor said it was firmly in the community transmission phase of the pandemic and there was a need for more precautions. In the United States people are advised to wear ""cloth face coverings"" in supermarkets and pharmacies, while in Canada, air passengers must wear a non-medical mask or a face covering. But internationally expert opinion is divided on the effectiveness of home-made masks in curbing Covid-19. Many argue that masks help prevent the wearer spreading infection, but frequent hand-washing and social distancing are deemed essential too. This video can not be played Should I wear a mask to stop coronavirus? In most German states children under six years old do not have to wear masks. And Schleswig-Holstein will not require mask-wearing until Wednesday. The new rules have created huge demand for masks, so faced with a growing shortage the government is planning to manufacture millions of them in Germany. In Bavaria, people still going mask-free can be fined â¬150 (Â£131; $163), but the fine for any shopkeeper who breaks the rules can be â¬5,000, SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung reports. Chancellor Angela Merkel has accepted that regional variations in the lockdown rules are acceptable because some places are virus hotspots, and others not. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

InSwitzerland, garden centres and hairdressers are opening their doors, followed by schools and shops selling items other than food in two weeks' time. But gatherings of more than five people remain banned until 8 June, and it is unclear when bars and restaurants will be allowed to reopen.

"An easing of lockdown restrictions could mean families could socialise together again Drastically limiting people's contact with others seems to be helping many countries stem the spread of the coronavirus. But as economies slump and people become fatigued with rules, governments are weighing up how to ease lockdowns without risking a second wave of infections. One option being touted is to allow people to slightly expand the ""social bubbles"" - meaning they'd be able to see a select few friends and family. According to a memo leaked to local media, authorities in Belgium were considering allowing residents to gather with 10 other people of their choice every weekend. To close the network of possible infection, every member of the group would have to include the other nine people in their top 10. And once chosen, each person would be banned from meeting with anyone outside of their preferred 10. It's unclear how this would be policed. For some, it could also create a new social nightmare - who do you pick? And what if the person you choose for your top 10 doesn't include you in theirs? This idea was not includedwhen Belgium announced its latest measures for lockdown easing on Saturday, but other countries are pondering similar moves. Can you compare how well countries are tackling coronavirus? Are the UK's five tests for ending lockdown being met? Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Radio Scotland last week she was considering expanding the definition of ""households"" to allow small gatherings of people, ""encouraging people who live alone to maybe match up with somebody else who is on their own, or a couple of other people to have almost kind of bubbles of people"". Meanwhile New Zealand, one of the earliest adopters of lockdown measures, has settled on an expansion policy. From next week, New Zealanders will be free to slightly extend their bubbles of contact to include close family, caregivers and those living in isolation - so long as they are living in the same town or city. The country has seen a steady decline in new coronavirus cases in recent weeks. To date, it has had 18 deaths and 1,470 confirmed cases. New Zealand's prime minister said of its lockdown, ""we're going hard and we're going early"" - and the approach has paid dividends Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has also been praised for her compassionate public messaging during the outbreak, addressing the impact of lockdown on people's social lives and mental wellbeing. But while a vaccine is being developed, many nations are hesitant to allow more social contact in case it spurs another wave of infection. England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty has said some socially disruptive measures will have to be in place until the end of this year. But the extent of these steps, and how long they will be enforced, is difficult to predict. When making their decisions, scientists and policymakers look to a key metric known as the effective reproduction rate (Rt) - the rate at which the virus is spreading among the population. Britain's current Rt is one, according to the latest data from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), meaning every person who contracts it, on average, will transmit the virus to one other person. In several countries, governments have refrained from easing lockdown measures until their national Rt is significantly less than one. For this reason, the UK has extended its lockdown for the next few weeks. Stefan Flasche, an associate professor at the LSHTM, agrees it's too early to relax restrictions in the UK. But when it is safe to do so, he says the extended social bubbles may be an important ""coping mechanism"" for people while the search for a vaccine continues. ""It's not designed to solve the pandemic, but it will help the social component,"" he says. ""We will have the risk of Covid for a long time, so anything to keep society functioning would help."" The lockdown's impact on mental wellbeing is already being keenly felt around the world. In the US, a national mental health helpline has seen a dramatic increase in people getting in touch, with an increase in calls close to 900%. Across the Atlantic, the NHS has opened its own hotline to support health workers during the pandemic, as staff face increasing pressure. Andy Bell, deputy chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health in the UK, is unsure if a small expansion of social bubbles will be good for the public's mental health. ""It's important to understand that not everyone is experiencing this equally,"" he told the BBC. ""Lockdown is much harder if you're unsafe, if you're on a very low income, if you are in overcrowded accommodation. The challenges to mental health are far greater when you've got those risk factors anyway. ""We're going to have to learn in real-time now,"" he added. But Brian Dow, the deputy chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness, believes such a policy would be beneficial, so long as it is managed well. ""It allows people to release that anxiety they may be feeling by being trapped indoors,"" he said. ""People have been very creative about [socialising] online but frankly, right now, people just need a hug."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"Wings for all the Airbus commercial planes are made in Wales Aerospace giant Airbus is to furlough 3,200 staff at its north Wales site, the company has announced. It comes hours after Chief Executive Guillaume Faury warned the company was ""bleeding cash at an unprecedented speed"". Airbus said about half of the staff at its Broughton site would be placed on the UK government's job retention scheme, which pays 80% of wages. The company is expected to top up salaries by a further 5-10%. The furlough periods of production and support staff will be staggered over the next three weeks. The remaining staff will stay on site, including 500 who are currently working at the AMRC Cymru facility, building parts for ventilators as part of the Ventilator Challenge UK consortium. This month the firm announced it was cutting aircraft production by a third. It comes as the aviation industry is expected to shrink significantly in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak. Aerospace industry 'will take years' to recover BA reaches deal to suspend thousands of workers In pictures: Grounded planes and empty UK airports Mr Faury also told Airbus' 135,000 staff to brace for potentially deep job cuts and warned that its survival was at stake without immediate action. The Welsh Government said it was working with the company and to support its highly-skilled workers, while the UK government said its furlough scheme would help firms ""to bounce back and get the economy up and running once the coronavirus emergency is over"". Airbus is this week due to deliver financial results for the first quarter of the year. Those figures will be overshadowed by the pandemic that has left global airlines struggling to survive and almost completely halted plane deliveries since lockdowns started in March. Greg Waldron, from the aviation industry news website Flight Global, highlighted the huge impact of coronavirus on Airbus and the sector as a whole, saying: ""Every assumption we had about the industry has been totally upended. ""The outlook for Airbus has gone from very positive to very negative. There's simply no demand for new aircraft at the moment."" In response to the pandemic Airbus had already begun implementing government-assisted furlough schemes starting with 3,000 workers in France and said it would lower output of its narrow-body jets to 40 a month. Airbus has around 13,500 workers in the UK, with most of them making wings at its two major sites in Broughton, in Flintshire, and Filton, Bristol. Despite the major blow the coronavirus has dealt to Airbus, Mr Waldron thinks it will survive this crisis but not without significant layoffs. ""Airbus is a crucially important industrial programme for Europe, I think Europe will be committed to keeping Airbus going,"" he said. ""However, there's going to be a great deal of pain to go through. If they cut production rates quite significantly you're going to see large numbers of layoffs. I would expect in a few years you'll see a smaller leaner Airbus than what we have now."" Meanwhile, Airbus' main rival Boeing is battling another major crisis due to the year-long grounding of its 737 Max passenger jet, which had been its best-selling plane. On Saturday, the US aviation giant scrapped a $4.2bn (Â£3.4bn) tie-up with Brazil's Embraer. Some industry analysts saw the move as being triggered by the crises, although the company cited contractual reasons for the decision.

"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: NHS staff 'have best PPE we can get them' The UK's lockdown needs to be eased carefully, meaning social distancing will remain for ""some time"", Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said. He described the more than 20,000 deaths in the UK as ""heartbreaking"", but said the toll could have been ""much worse"" without the strict measures. However, Mr Raab did hint at some ways schools, sport and businesses could begin to return to ""a new normal"". Meanwhile, the PM has arrived back in Downing Street to resume work. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will chair the morning meeting of the government's coronavirus ""war cabinet"" on Monday, after recovering from Covid-19. It is almost a month since he was diagnosed with the virus. A further 413 people have died with coronavirus in UK hospitals - the lowest number that has been reported in April. However,experts have previously warned againstover-interpreting daily statistics, as they often reflect reporting delays, particularly over weekends - so do not relate directly to the number of deaths that occurred on a certain day. Wales virus death toll rises to 788 Scotland's lockdown exit could differ from UK Are the five tests for ending lockdown being met? Does hospital deaths milestone mean failure for UK? The latest official figures bring the total number of deaths to 20,732. The government's data does not include people who die in care homes, in their own homes, or elsewhere in the community. The government has come under pressure from Labour to set out its ""exit strategy"" for lifting the lockdown. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves said ministers should treat people ""like grown-ups"" and should publish their plans for exiting the lockdown - to give businesses, schools and other organisations time to prepare. But Mr Raab, who has been deputising for Boris Johnson while the PM recovers from coronavirus, said it would not be responsible to start announcing specific proposals until evidence was available to support them as this could risk ""misleading"" the public. PM's return to work 'a boost for the country' How do you social distance in schools? Rather than a complete lifting of all measures, he told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that the country would end up ""moving to a new normal"". Mr Raab said when schools reopened, social distancing measures would need to be in place for pupils and staff. ""I think it's inconceivable that they would come back without further measures, as are already being applied in those schools that are open for key workers,"" he said. But he would not be drawn on a suggestion that this would mean groups of pupils returning to lessons on different days or times to keep pupil numbers down. The death toll rising further above 20,000 is a sobering reality and brings more devastating news for bereaved families. However, the increase of 413 in daily reported deaths was the lowest since late March. There are the usual caveats about weekend reporting of figures and there is likely to be another move up during the week when more data comes in. But, in combination with other statistics today, it all added up to a slightly more positive picture being portrayed at the Downing Street media briefing. New infections are not increasing even though the number of people tested is rising. The total number of patients with Covid-19 in hospitals is falling in most parts of the UK. NHS leaders are talking of coming ""through the peak"". But they don't expect a steady downwards trajectory, more a slowly declining plateau. As Professor James Naismith of Oxford University put it, ""the virus takes us in an express elevator to the top of the peak but we have to find our way back down by the stairs"". Mr Raab suggested social distancing measures already being seen in food shops and other businesses that have remained operating could also be expanded to non-essential businesses if they were to reopen. Asked whether there was any chance of people being able to play sport outside this summer, Mr Raab  saidthis would be ""difficult""due to the ""level and scale of interaction"". But he added: ""I think the professional sport may be different because of the scale of testing that they would be able to introduce."" On the possibility of testing people arriving at UK airports, Mr Raab said this measure might be introduced but he ""can't say it with any certainty yet"". ""The advice that we got - and I checked it with the scientists, with the chief medical officer - at the outset when we took up our social distancing measures, is that it wouldn't make any difference from a public health point of view,"" he said. At that time, the number of people travelling was ""plummeting"" and ""the virus was already at pace"" within the UK, he added. But he said that might need to be reviewed when the number of people with the virus in the UK had dropped significantly. ""Whether it's a quarantine period, or testing, or other measures that might be taken, it's possible - and I ask this question every weekâ¦ and we will keep asking that question."" Supermarkets have remained open with social distancing measures At Sunday's Downing Street briefing, NHS England's Medical Director, Prof Stephen Powis, said efforts by the public to follow social distancing guidelines ""have begun to pay off"", but stressed this would only continue if people continue to comply with the strict measures. He said there was a ""very definite"" trend of a reduced number of people in hospitals - most markedly in London - and said there had been a decline in the number of critical care beds used for Covid-19 patients. But Prof Powis insisted it was too early to ease off lockdown measures. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves: ""Businesses, schools and other organisations need time to plan if they are to reopen"" In his opening remarks at the government briefing, Environment Secretary George Eustice said food availability in UK supermarkets had returned to ""normal levels"" after a period of panic-buying at the start of the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Eustice said the international food chain is continuing to ""work well"", but he said he expected there would be a needto recruit furloughed staffto harvest crops at the start of the summer. He also dismissed reports that travellers returning to the UK will have to be quarantined as ""speculation"", saying ""no decisions"" have yet been taken on measures beyond lockdown. Meanwhile, First Minister Nicola Sturgeonwarned she could delay any lifting of the restrictions in Scotlandif she thought the government at Westminster was moving too quickly. ""If... the UK government took decisions that I thought were premature in terms of coming out of the lockdown then clearly I would want to make sure that Scotland did what I judged was best to protect the population,"" she told the programme. But Ms Sturgeon added she would not take a different path ""for the sake of it"".

"After Easter, when the government in England announced lockdown was to continue for another three weeks, it set out five tests that had to be met before restrictions were eased. We are now well on the way to lifting them in both England and the rest of the UK. But to what extent are the tests being met? And what is the risk of them lapsing? As soon as images began to emerge in February of hospitals in Italy being overwhelmed with coronavirus cases, making sure the NHS could cope became the first priority. Routine operations were cancelled en masse and large field hospitals - known as Nightingales in England - began to be built. A deal was also struck with the independent sector to use ventilators and beds in private hospitals. Cases peaked in early April - and have been falling ever since. At the peak more than 3,000 Covid admissions were being seen every day. That is now down to under 500 and all the field hospitals are hibernating. Routine work has now been restarted, but the NHS remains on an emergency footing, ready for a second peak. If cases increase again the field hospitals will be re-opened - although with the exception of London, none of these has intensive care facilities. More than 40,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, government data shows. These figure relate to the numbers who die after testing positive for the virus. It does not necessarily mean the virus was the direct cause of their death - although work by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests that in the overwhelming majority of cases it is. Deaths peaked in early-to-mid-April - and have been falling ever since. The downward trend is uneven because the recording of deaths slows at weekends, so the figures tend to drop then before rising during the week. But when you look at the seven-day average, the trend is clear. The number of newly diagnosed cases in the UK is hovering around the 1,500 mark on most days at the moment. Ministers say this shows infection rates are at manageable levels. At the peak there were around 6,000 positive tests a day, but this was when testing was restricted to certain groups, so was not an accurate measure of the true level of infections. It is estimated in late March there were around 100,000 new infections a day. But even now with widespread testing available, doubts remain whether the true level of infections is being identified. A surveillance programme in England run by the ONS suggests around 4,000 new infections a day are being seen. Part of the problem is that for some the virus leads to such mild symptoms or none at all, that they do not even realise they are infected. That poses a problem keeping on top of the virus because if there are significant numbers of silent spreaders, new -  more serious  - cases could keep popping up. Currently the UK has capacity to provide more than 200,000 tests a day, if you include tests posted out to individuals and care homes. That is a significant improvement on the picture at the start of March - when only around 10,000 a day were being done. Three mega-labs have been opened to process tests, while around 50 drive-through testing centres, 100 military-run mobile units and a home-testing service have been launched to complement the testing done in hospitals. That means there is plenty of capacity - anyone who needs a test can certainly get one. Staff - in hospitals, care homes and, to a lesser extent, other public services - also need personal protective equipment (PPE), such as visors, gowns and masks, to protect them from the virus. The more cases there are, the more demand for kit there will be. In the first weeks of the pandemic, there were serious concerns about the availability of PPE. Some hospitals and care homes were reporting they were struggling to get hold of the equipment they needed. The army was brought in to distribute supplies. The stockpile the government holds for pandemics has been used up, but international and domestic supply routes have improved. Local authority and NHS bosses both say the pressure on PPE has eased. Without a vaccine, this will be a very tricky one to navigate. As well as widespread testing, England has set up a contact-tracing system, with separate services being run by the other UK nations. The idea is that this service will help contain any local flare-ups by getting the close contacts of infected people to self-isolate, to stop further spread. It is still early days for the programme - with even its bosses warning it is not yet ""gold standard"". Originally the army of contact-tracers being employed was meant to be complemented by a tracing app that would alert people when they have been in close contact with an infected individual. This could be particularly useful if people have been seated close to someone on a train, for example. The app has been piloted on the Isle of Wight, but is currently not ready for national roll-out. The UK has come a long way in the past few months. But there are concerns the infection rates are still too high and tests are not being turned around quickly enough, while doubts remain about whether the contact-tracing system will be good enough. But at the end of the day, the easing of restrictions comes down to political judgement. The lockdown itself is harmful - economically, socially and for health. Ministers are taking into account more than just these five tests in the decision-making process. Follow Nickon Twitter,external Read more from Nick LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

"An easing of lockdown restrictions could mean families could socialise together again Drastically limiting people's contact with others seems to be helping many countries stem the spread of the coronavirus. But as economies slump and people become fatigued with rules, governments are weighing up how to ease lockdowns without risking a second wave of infections. One option being touted is to allow people to slightly expand the ""social bubbles"" - meaning they'd be able to see a select few friends and family. According to a memo leaked to local media, authorities in Belgium were considering allowing residents to gather with 10 other people of their choice every weekend. To close the network of possible infection, every member of the group would have to include the other nine people in their top 10. And once chosen, each person would be banned from meeting with anyone outside of their preferred 10. It's unclear how this would be policed. For some, it could also create a new social nightmare - who do you pick? And what if the person you choose for your top 10 doesn't include you in theirs? This idea was not includedwhen Belgium announced its latest measures for lockdown easing on Saturday, but other countries are pondering similar moves. Can you compare how well countries are tackling coronavirus? Are the UK's five tests for ending lockdown being met? Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Radio Scotland last week she was considering expanding the definition of ""households"" to allow small gatherings of people, ""encouraging people who live alone to maybe match up with somebody else who is on their own, or a couple of other people to have almost kind of bubbles of people"". Meanwhile New Zealand, one of the earliest adopters of lockdown measures, has settled on an expansion policy. From next week, New Zealanders will be free to slightly extend their bubbles of contact to include close family, caregivers and those living in isolation - so long as they are living in the same town or city. The country has seen a steady decline in new coronavirus cases in recent weeks. To date, it has had 18 deaths and 1,470 confirmed cases. New Zealand's prime minister said of its lockdown, ""we're going hard and we're going early"" - and the approach has paid dividends Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has also been praised for her compassionate public messaging during the outbreak, addressing the impact of lockdown on people's social lives and mental wellbeing. But while a vaccine is being developed, many nations are hesitant to allow more social contact in case it spurs another wave of infection. England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty has said some socially disruptive measures will have to be in place until the end of this year. But the extent of these steps, and how long they will be enforced, is difficult to predict. When making their decisions, scientists and policymakers look to a key metric known as the effective reproduction rate (Rt) - the rate at which the virus is spreading among the population. Britain's current Rt is one, according to the latest data from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), meaning every person who contracts it, on average, will transmit the virus to one other person. In several countries, governments have refrained from easing lockdown measures until their national Rt is significantly less than one. For this reason, the UK has extended its lockdown for the next few weeks. Stefan Flasche, an associate professor at the LSHTM, agrees it's too early to relax restrictions in the UK. But when it is safe to do so, he says the extended social bubbles may be an important ""coping mechanism"" for people while the search for a vaccine continues. ""It's not designed to solve the pandemic, but it will help the social component,"" he says. ""We will have the risk of Covid for a long time, so anything to keep society functioning would help."" The lockdown's impact on mental wellbeing is already being keenly felt around the world. In the US, a national mental health helpline has seen a dramatic increase in people getting in touch, with an increase in calls close to 900%. Across the Atlantic, the NHS has opened its own hotline to support health workers during the pandemic, as staff face increasing pressure. Andy Bell, deputy chief executive of the Centre for Mental Health in the UK, is unsure if a small expansion of social bubbles will be good for the public's mental health. ""It's important to understand that not everyone is experiencing this equally,"" he told the BBC. ""Lockdown is much harder if you're unsafe, if you're on a very low income, if you are in overcrowded accommodation. The challenges to mental health are far greater when you've got those risk factors anyway. ""We're going to have to learn in real-time now,"" he added. But Brian Dow, the deputy chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness, believes such a policy would be beneficial, so long as it is managed well. ""It allows people to release that anxiety they may be feeling by being trapped indoors,"" he said. ""People have been very creative about [socialising] online but frankly, right now, people just need a hug."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"At a White House briefing, the president denied he might seek to change the date of November's election Global virus cases pass 3 million, with more than 200,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said bereaved families of NHS staff will get compensation Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK is at point of ""maximum risk"" and he won't ease restrictions too quickly Italy outlined plans to ease restrictions from 4 May as it records its lowest daily death toll since mid-March Germany made it mandatory to wear masks on public transport Edited by Jude Sheerin Thanks for joining us for today's coverage. That's a wrap on things for now, but here is a look back at some of the biggest stories of the day:   Our coverage was brought to you today by Owen Amos, Frances Mao, Yvette Tan, Andreas Illmer, Krutika Pathi, Deirdre Finnerty, Kelly-Leigh Cooper, Matthew Davis, Patrick Jackson, David Gritten, Joshua Cheetham, Michael Emons, Jessica Murphy, Ritu Prasad, Robin Levinson-King, Jonathan Jurejko, Jennifer Scott, Gavin Stamp, Hazel Shearing, Toby Luckhurst, Emma Harrison, Ashitha Nagesh, Frank Keogh, Joel Gunter, Boer Deng, Holly Honderich and Jude Sheerin. Here's the final question of the evening. A reporter asks: If an American president loses more Americans over the course of six weeks than died during the entirety of the Vietnam war, does he deserve to be reelected? Trump took the question in stride. ""So, yeah, we've lost a lot of people but if you look at what original projections were, 2.2 million, we're probably heading to 60,000 - 70,000,"" he says. ""It's far too many - one person is too many for this. I think we've made a lot of really good decisions,"" he adds. ""The big decision was closing the border, doing the ban on people coming in from China."" He also brings up the ""unbelievable"" job his administration did with ventilators. ""I think we've done a great job. And I will say this - one person is too many."" And with that, the briefing is concluded. Trump is asked if he has considered delaying the November presidential election. ""I never even thought of changing the date of the election,"" he answers. ""Why would I do that? November 3rd. That's a good number."" Trump calls the suggestion ""made up propaganda"" and says that ""sleepy Joe"" Biden - his presumptive Democratic rival - was likely unaware his campaign had put the statement out. Former Vice-President Joe Biden said at a virtual fundraiser last week that he thought Trump would ""try to kick back the election somehow"". The president has frequently leveled insults at his Democratic opponent by questioning the former vice-president's mental fortitude. ""I look forward to that election,"" Trump says. President Trump says his administration has launched ""very serious investigations"" into China's response to the novel coronavirus. ""And we are not happy with China, we are not happy with that whole situation, because we believe it could have been stopped at the source,"" he says. ""It could have been stopped quickly and it wouldn't have spread all over the world."" Trump has been critical of China as the pandemic has progressed and has frequently touted his decision to close the US borders to China in an effort to curb the outbreak. Some health experts have said the effort bought time for the US to prepare, but the Trump administration has been accused of squandering the opportunity. ""Nobody except one country can be held accountable for what happened,"" Trump says. ""Nobody's blaming anybody here, we're looking at a group of people that should've stopped it at the source."" The US will never forget those who were ""sacrificed for a reason of incompetence or something else other than incompetence,"" he adds. ""They"" - referring to China - ""could've protected the whole world - not just us - the whole world,"" he says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Trump says people who canât open up their stores because of lockdown measures face losing their livelihoods. ""The fact that people arenât allowed to have their freedom causes a tremendous amount of problems, including death,"" he says. A reporter asks Trump about the state of Maryland reporting more emergency calls regarding ingestion of disinfectants after the president suggested that they could be used to treat Covid-19. ""I can't imagine why,"" Trump responds. ""I can't imagine that."" Last week, the Maryland governor's office said it issued an alert warning against ingesting or injecting disinfectants after receiving more than 100 calls. The president has said his comments were made sarcastically. The reporter asks if the president takes any responsibility for the increase in calls. ""No,"" he replies. The president responds to a question criticising Health Secretary Alex Azar's early downplaying of the disease by saying it was ""unfair"". He claims Democrats did the same, including Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi. ""I was very fortunate through luck or whatever that we closed the border, we put a ban on China,"" he says. ""But I could tell you that Nancy Pelosi was dancing in the streets in Chinatown. She wanted to go, let's go out and party. That was late in February."" Back in February, Mrs Pelosi had encouraged people to visit San Francisco's Chinatown to help struggling businesses. She did not propose any parties, as the president suggested. The city issued a stay-at-home order in March. White House coronavirus task force co-ordinator Dr Deborah Birx and Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir have begun outlining efforts to improve the US testing system. Mr Giroir says the federal government will be able to supply every state with the tests they need. But the fine print on the White House's new guidance for states suggests that the testing burden will fall to states. Documents obtained by CBS News, the BBC's US partner, show that the guidelines direct  governors are expected to craft their own plans for increasing testing. Most sentences begin with the words ""states should"". States ""must be able to proactively monitor for and respond to local outbreaks"", the documents say, ""and develop rapid response programmes that enable quick isolation and contact tracing of individuals who test positive"". The president has suggested an unnamed individual ""a long time ago"" could have stopped the ""unnecessary death[s]"" due to Covid-19. ""There has been so much unnecessary death in this country,"" he said. ""It could've been stopped and it could've been stopped short, but somebody a long time ago, it seems, decided not to do it that way and the whole world is suffering because of it."" He did not say who he was referencing and gave no other details. Industry executives say they are working on expanding testing, including self-swab tests. Executives from retailer Walmart; pharmacy chains Rite Aid, Walgreens, CVS; and health diagnostics company LabCorp, as well as the US Cotton industry group said they would make more tests and testing sites available across the country. LabCorp said it would release an at-home Covid-19 test in the coming weeks. But even as commercial labs say they have expanded the capacity for testing, medical officials throughout the US have said they still face shortages of key materials, including testing swabs, reagents, and pipettes. For example, the Ohio Health Department told CNN that the state is focused on testing the most âvulnerable patientsâ because of a âglobal shortage in suppliesâ. Ohio is due to begin reopening some businesses on Friday, 1 May. The president begins by saying Covid-19 cases are declining or stablising across the country. ""In all cases getting better,"" he says.  ""Really a horrible situation that weâve been confronted with, but theyâre moving along."" He adds there's a ""hunger"" to get back to work. ""Ensuring the health of our economy is vital to ensuring the health of our nation - these goals work in tandem."" President Donald Trump is at the microphone and has begun his revamped news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House. He is joined by the vice-president, Mike Pence. After some heavy criticism of the president's suggestions last week about injecting disinfectant, what will the briefing look like? We're about to find out. You can follow along with our livestream here. We asked three Americans who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 to rate the US president's response to the virus, including his recent comments about disinfectant. The BBC first spoke to these voters before the president's inauguration in January 2017 and we've caught up with them several times since. Here's what they had to say.

And then, from next Monday, a new âphased and gradual easing ofâ restrictions will kick in to allow the restoration of some economic and business activities - but the easing comes with nationwide conditions. It will now be compulsory for everyone to wear face masks in public, there will be an overnight curfew between 20:00 and 06:00 with only essential services allowed to move during those times. President Buhari also said there would be a ban on ânon-essential inter-state passenger travel until further noticeâ and all bans on social and religious gatherings would remain in place. He also expressed his deep concern over the âmysterious deathsâ of a number of people in the northern state of Kano. As well as sending a government team to investigate, he said heâd issued a total lockdown for two weeks with immediate effect. President Trump is expected to hold a news conference on the pandemic in the next 20 minutes or so, having earlier cancelled it. His press secretary said it would be held in the Rose Garden and would ""brief the nation on additional testing guidance and safely opening up America again"". Some of Mr Trump's advisers had called for a pause in his almost daily updates, following amazement at his suggestion last Thursday that injecting disinfectant might be a way of treating Covid-19. Some Republicans have warned that the president's briefings were harming his chances of re election. ""We have to manage and augment our behavior,"" the governor said about busy beaches California Governor
Gavin Newsom has pledged to step-up the enforcement of coronavirus-related measures after images spread of people flocking to the coast over the weekend. A stay-at-home order was implemented statewide last month, but some counties have reopened beaches and thousands flocked there during recent hot weather. âThis virus doesnât take the weekends off. This virus doesnât go home because itâs a beautiful sunny day around our coasts,"" Governor Newsom said on Monday.

Jin Russell, a doctor in Auckland, spoke to BBC OS on World Service radio and said: âIâm at the end of a five-week lockdown staying at home with my two little boys and my husband. Iâm really proud of my country. Weâve taken such strong collective action to keep each other safe. âWhen our prime minister, Jacinda Arden, announced five weeks ago the lockdown was going to start I remember crying with relief because my whole family are doctors. My mum is a GP in her 70s, my dad is a full-time pathologist at the hospital, and my brother is a rheumatologist. ""I work at the childrenâs hospital here and when I saw what was happening with healthcare workers overseas catching coronavirus and being at risk, I was so relieved we locked down, went hard and went early. I feel very confident that New Zealand is going to show the world how to do this.â New Zealand has reported fewer than 1,500 confirmed or probable cases of coronavirus and 19 deaths. Belgium is one of the world's top exporters of potato products Some of us may be guilty of using lockdown as an excuse to indulge in our favourite unhealthy foods, but now Belgians are being urged to eat more chips for a good cause. The nation, known for its love of fries, is said to have 750,000 tonnes of potatoes piled up at warehouses because of coronavirus disruption. Now Belgapom, the country's potato growers' union, has presented the ""twice a week"" chips initiative as a matter of survival for farmers. Read more about the campaign. Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter A fake news article circulated on social media, claiming that the first volunteer taking in a coronavirus vaccine trial in Oxford had died. She is alive and well â as BBC medical correspondent Fergus Walsh confirmed when he spoke to her on Skype. The false claim seems to have originated in an article shared on a site with both genuine and fake global news stories. It was set up in March and registered in the US, but thereâs very little information about whoâs behind it. Most articles are written by a mysterious character who is hard to find on social media. Weâve decided not to use their name or the site's at the risk of amplifying false information. The articles have been pushed out by a Facebook account, which has no information but a name. BBC News has contacted the account, but had no response. This specific fake news story was re-shared in big Facebook groups which oppose vaccinations â or support conspiracy theories.

"The PM last attended the government's daily briefing on 26 March Boris Johnson has returned to Downing Street to take charge of the UK's response to the coronavirus outbreak. The prime minister will chair the regular morning cabinet meeting on Covid-19 before holding talks with senior ministers and officials. He arrived back at No 10 on Sunday evening amid mounting pressure from Tory MPs to begin lifting the lockdown. But Health Minister Edward Argar said ""now is not the time to ease up"" even if people were feeling frustrated. The latest official figures bring the total number of deaths in UK hospitals to 20,732, after a further 413 were announced on Sunday. Raab: UK must find 'new normal' to ease lockdown Are the five tests for ending lockdown being met? Scotland's lockdown exit could differ from UK It is a month since Mr Johnson was diagnosed with the virus. He spent a week in St Thomas' Hospital in central London, includingthree nights in intensive care,after being admitted on 5 April. Mr Johnson has not been doing any official government work during his convalescence at his country residence, Chequers, although last week he did speak to the Queen and US President Donald Trump, as well as meeting senior ministers. He will now resume full-time duties, although it is unclear at this stage whether he will lead Monday's press briefing. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said he thought it would be ""extraordinary"" if Boris Johnson's own coronavirus experience had not shaped his views on ""how lethal"" the virus is. The public debate around easing the lockdown could ""begin in the next few days"", he added, but we are ""still some way off getting any easing of the lockdown"". Strict limits on daily life,external- such as requiring people to stay at home, shutting many businesses and preventing gatherings of more than two people - were introduced on 23 March, as the government tried to limit the spread of the virus. Ministers are required by law to assess whether the rules are working, based on expert advice, every three weeks. The next review is due by next Thursday 7 May. Our correspondent Norman Smith added Mr Johnson will need to ""convince people ahead of then"" that the government's approach is the right way to go. Supermarkets have remained open with social distancing measures Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Argar said he could ""understand the frustration people are having with these measures"". He said there had been much press ""speculation"" about when the lockdown might end, but: ""The reality is we're not there yet. ""We're not in a place where the science says it is safe to ease the restrictions. We need to keep these in place to keep that infection under control, and not to lose the gains we've all made."" Mr Johnson last attended the government's daily briefing on 26 March There are a huge range of decisions facing Boris Johnson after a race in government in the last month or so to keep up with the demands of this crisis. The biggest collection of decisions though is how and when to start the move out of the lockdown that Boris Johnson brought in from a desk in Downing Street on 23 March. In cabinet of course, there are different tones, different emphases. The Treasury, for example, is focused on the profound economic harm, eager to know the timetable of when restrictions might start to ease off. They all of course want to minimise the loss of life but, as you'd expect, the Department of Health is particularly concerned about how the NHS is coping. And, of course, if there were to be a second wave, what would happen in that kind of circumstance? It is clear the prime minister himself sees the prevention of a second deadly spike, which could be worse than the first, to be the absolute top of the list. But I don't think this is a question of either you prioritise people's health or you prioritise the nation's wealth. It is an almost impossible balancing act. And partly for that reason, I don't think there will be any big moves of substance this week. Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee, said there was a limit to how long people would tolerate restrictions. He said: ""If there is a question over whether something is necessary or not, I think we should err on the side of openness and trying to make sure that more people can get on with their lives and more people can get on with getting back to their jobs."" Frances O'Grady, head of the umbrella group for unions the Trades Union Congress (TUC), said when people do return to work, social distancing should continue, along with risk assessments in every workplace, staggered shifts and safe transport. The 'social bubble' approach to lockdown easing Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been standing in for the PM, said on Sunday that social distancing would remain for ""some time"" in the UK. Rather than a complete lifting of all measures, he said the country would end up ""moving to a new normal"". He suggested social distancing measures already being seen in food shops and other businesses that have remained operating could also be expanded to non-essential businesses if they were to reopen. Labour's Rachel Reeves said the UK should ""potentially"" be following the example of countries like Belgium, Germany and Denmark which have already signalled partial re-opening of some businesses and schools. ""We want to work with the government in bringing forward a plan and getting it right,"" she said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Scientists advising the government have warned any relaxation risks a renewed flare-up just as the numbers of patients in hospital with the disease is beginning to fall. NHS England medical director Professor Stephen Powis told the daily No 10 briefing: ""My fear is that those curves won't continue to be on a downward trend, but will start to go on an upward trend. ""We are not at a point where any of us can be absolutely confident that that's not going to be the case."" A further 413 coronavirus deaths in UK hospitals were announced on Sunday - the lowest number that has been reported in April. However, experts have previously warned against over-interpreting daily statistics, as they often reflect reporting delays, particularly over weekends - so do not relate directly to the number of deaths that occurred on a certain day. Meanwhile, Mr Raab insisted the government remained ""on track"" to hit its target of carrying out 100,000 tests for coronavirus per day by Thursday. There were 29,058 tests carried out on Saturday, far short of the government's target - which it aimed to achieve by the end of April. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the capacity for testing had risen to more than 50,000 a day, adding that ""significant numbers"" of people in care homes were obtaining tests. Since Friday, millions of key workers and people they live withhave been able to book appointments online to be tested. However, the British Medical Association said testing for healthcare staff should not be on a ""first come, first served"" basis after slots ran out for the third day in a row. Appointments to visit a test site in England ran out about seven hours after the website opened on Sunday, much later than in the previous two days. Spaces remained available in Scotland throughout the day. Key workers in Wales and Northern Ireland cannot currently book tests online. Those too ill to travel should also be able to order home kits - although numbers are limited. On Sunday morning home kits were no longer available within 15 minutes of the site reopening at 08:00 BST.

Pembrokeshire council has decided to resume grass cutting from early next month. It was delayed in March due to lockdown measures, but after talks with
managers and other local authorities, the council has decided to go ahead as it
was considered the âbest option to ensure the health and wellbeing of the residentsâ. Cutting is expected to be time consuming due to excessive growth in some

More than 380 beds have been made available at a new Â£350m hospital in Torfaen, if needed for the coronavirus outbreak. A number of wards at the Grange University Hospital, in Llanfrechfa, have been handed over months ahead of schedule. The hospital is scheduled to open fully in 2021, but 384 beds are now available for use. The health board said its contractors had worked ""around the clock"" to get the extra capacity at the new hospital ready in just four weeks. It said that, fortunately, it had not seen ""the surge in cases it expected"" so the beds would not be needed at the moment.  Chief executive Judith Paget thanked residents and said she hoped the extra beds would not need to be opened early at all. âAt the beginning of the Coronavirus outbreak we needed to plan for the worst-case scenario,â she said. âThankfully the general public have observed the advice on staying at home and social distancing, so we donât need to open the extra beds just yet. âI would urge people to keep following the government guidance to protect themselves, to ease the pressure on our NHS services, and to save lives.â Angela Burns AM said she looked forward to full details of the plan being released ""as soon as possible.â Families of Welsh NHS and social care workers who die in service as a result of Covid-19 will be entitled to a lump-sum payment of Â£60,000,under a plan unveiled today. But, while the Welsh Conservatives broadly welcomed the plan, they said they wanted to hear more about how it would work. Angela Burns AM, the party's health spokesperson, said: âOur front-line NHS and social are staff are doing a magnificent job as the pandemic progresses, so naturally, I welcome â in broad terms - this announcement, which will no doubt offer some comfort to those frontline staff and their families. ""However, the devil is always in the detail, and we need to see more of it before it can reasonably be fully welcomed.""  Bridgend County Borough Council has confirmed that restrictions on accessing cemeteries are set to be lifted. The entrances to council-maintained cemeteries, including the grounds of Coychurch Crematorium, will be unlocked so that access can be reinstated from tomorrow.

Vaughan Gething praised health and care workers during today's announcement Mr Gething said: ""Our frontline workers in the NHS and social care sector are going above and beyond to deliver care and services for patients and to the most vulnerable in our communities across Wales. ""Their bravery on the frontline of this pandemic is something the whole nation is thankful and proud of.""

"The PM last attended the government's daily briefing on 26 March Boris Johnson has returned to Downing Street to take charge of the UK's response to the coronavirus outbreak. The prime minister will chair the regular morning cabinet meeting on Covid-19 before holding talks with senior ministers and officials. He arrived back at No 10 on Sunday evening amid mounting pressure from Tory MPs to begin lifting the lockdown. But Health Minister Edward Argar said ""now is not the time to ease up"" even if people were feeling frustrated. The latest official figures bring the total number of deaths in UK hospitals to 20,732, after a further 413 were announced on Sunday. Raab: UK must find 'new normal' to ease lockdown Are the five tests for ending lockdown being met? Scotland's lockdown exit could differ from UK It is a month since Mr Johnson was diagnosed with the virus. He spent a week in St Thomas' Hospital in central London, includingthree nights in intensive care,after being admitted on 5 April. Mr Johnson has not been doing any official government work during his convalescence at his country residence, Chequers, although last week he did speak to the Queen and US President Donald Trump, as well as meeting senior ministers. He will now resume full-time duties, although it is unclear at this stage whether he will lead Monday's press briefing. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said he thought it would be ""extraordinary"" if Boris Johnson's own coronavirus experience had not shaped his views on ""how lethal"" the virus is. The public debate around easing the lockdown could ""begin in the next few days"", he added, but we are ""still some way off getting any easing of the lockdown"". Strict limits on daily life,external- such as requiring people to stay at home, shutting many businesses and preventing gatherings of more than two people - were introduced on 23 March, as the government tried to limit the spread of the virus. Ministers are required by law to assess whether the rules are working, based on expert advice, every three weeks. The next review is due by next Thursday 7 May. Our correspondent Norman Smith added Mr Johnson will need to ""convince people ahead of then"" that the government's approach is the right way to go. Supermarkets have remained open with social distancing measures Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Argar said he could ""understand the frustration people are having with these measures"". He said there had been much press ""speculation"" about when the lockdown might end, but: ""The reality is we're not there yet. ""We're not in a place where the science says it is safe to ease the restrictions. We need to keep these in place to keep that infection under control, and not to lose the gains we've all made."" Mr Johnson last attended the government's daily briefing on 26 March There are a huge range of decisions facing Boris Johnson after a race in government in the last month or so to keep up with the demands of this crisis. The biggest collection of decisions though is how and when to start the move out of the lockdown that Boris Johnson brought in from a desk in Downing Street on 23 March. In cabinet of course, there are different tones, different emphases. The Treasury, for example, is focused on the profound economic harm, eager to know the timetable of when restrictions might start to ease off. They all of course want to minimise the loss of life but, as you'd expect, the Department of Health is particularly concerned about how the NHS is coping. And, of course, if there were to be a second wave, what would happen in that kind of circumstance? It is clear the prime minister himself sees the prevention of a second deadly spike, which could be worse than the first, to be the absolute top of the list. But I don't think this is a question of either you prioritise people's health or you prioritise the nation's wealth. It is an almost impossible balancing act. And partly for that reason, I don't think there will be any big moves of substance this week. Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservative backbench 1922 committee, said there was a limit to how long people would tolerate restrictions. He said: ""If there is a question over whether something is necessary or not, I think we should err on the side of openness and trying to make sure that more people can get on with their lives and more people can get on with getting back to their jobs."" Frances O'Grady, head of the umbrella group for unions the Trades Union Congress (TUC), said when people do return to work, social distancing should continue, along with risk assessments in every workplace, staggered shifts and safe transport. The 'social bubble' approach to lockdown easing Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been standing in for the PM, said on Sunday that social distancing would remain for ""some time"" in the UK. Rather than a complete lifting of all measures, he said the country would end up ""moving to a new normal"". He suggested social distancing measures already being seen in food shops and other businesses that have remained operating could also be expanded to non-essential businesses if they were to reopen. Labour's Rachel Reeves said the UK should ""potentially"" be following the example of countries like Belgium, Germany and Denmark which have already signalled partial re-opening of some businesses and schools. ""We want to work with the government in bringing forward a plan and getting it right,"" she said. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Scientists advising the government have warned any relaxation risks a renewed flare-up just as the numbers of patients in hospital with the disease is beginning to fall. NHS England medical director Professor Stephen Powis told the daily No 10 briefing: ""My fear is that those curves won't continue to be on a downward trend, but will start to go on an upward trend. ""We are not at a point where any of us can be absolutely confident that that's not going to be the case."" A further 413 coronavirus deaths in UK hospitals were announced on Sunday - the lowest number that has been reported in April. However, experts have previously warned against over-interpreting daily statistics, as they often reflect reporting delays, particularly over weekends - so do not relate directly to the number of deaths that occurred on a certain day. Meanwhile, Mr Raab insisted the government remained ""on track"" to hit its target of carrying out 100,000 tests for coronavirus per day by Thursday. There were 29,058 tests carried out on Saturday, far short of the government's target - which it aimed to achieve by the end of April. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the capacity for testing had risen to more than 50,000 a day, adding that ""significant numbers"" of people in care homes were obtaining tests. Since Friday, millions of key workers and people they live withhave been able to book appointments online to be tested. However, the British Medical Association said testing for healthcare staff should not be on a ""first come, first served"" basis after slots ran out for the third day in a row. Appointments to visit a test site in England ran out about seven hours after the website opened on Sunday, much later than in the previous two days. Spaces remained available in Scotland throughout the day. Key workers in Wales and Northern Ireland cannot currently book tests online. Those too ill to travel should also be able to order home kits - although numbers are limited. On Sunday morning home kits were no longer available within 15 minutes of the site reopening at 08:00 BST.

"This video can not be played Dominic Raab: NHS staff 'have best PPE we can get them' The UK's lockdown needs to be eased carefully, meaning social distancing will remain for ""some time"", Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said. He described the more than 20,000 deaths in the UK as ""heartbreaking"", but said the toll could have been ""much worse"" without the strict measures. However, Mr Raab did hint at some ways schools, sport and businesses could begin to return to ""a new normal"". Meanwhile, the PM has arrived back in Downing Street to resume work. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will chair the morning meeting of the government's coronavirus ""war cabinet"" on Monday, after recovering from Covid-19. It is almost a month since he was diagnosed with the virus. A further 413 people have died with coronavirus in UK hospitals - the lowest number that has been reported in April. However,experts have previously warned againstover-interpreting daily statistics, as they often reflect reporting delays, particularly over weekends - so do not relate directly to the number of deaths that occurred on a certain day. Wales virus death toll rises to 788 Scotland's lockdown exit could differ from UK Are the five tests for ending lockdown being met? Does hospital deaths milestone mean failure for UK? The latest official figures bring the total number of deaths to 20,732. The government's data does not include people who die in care homes, in their own homes, or elsewhere in the community. The government has come under pressure from Labour to set out its ""exit strategy"" for lifting the lockdown. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? Shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves said ministers should treat people ""like grown-ups"" and should publish their plans for exiting the lockdown - to give businesses, schools and other organisations time to prepare. But Mr Raab, who has been deputising for Boris Johnson while the PM recovers from coronavirus, said it would not be responsible to start announcing specific proposals until evidence was available to support them as this could risk ""misleading"" the public. PM's return to work 'a boost for the country' How do you social distance in schools? Rather than a complete lifting of all measures, he told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that the country would end up ""moving to a new normal"". Mr Raab said when schools reopened, social distancing measures would need to be in place for pupils and staff. ""I think it's inconceivable that they would come back without further measures, as are already being applied in those schools that are open for key workers,"" he said. But he would not be drawn on a suggestion that this would mean groups of pupils returning to lessons on different days or times to keep pupil numbers down. The death toll rising further above 20,000 is a sobering reality and brings more devastating news for bereaved families. However, the increase of 413 in daily reported deaths was the lowest since late March. There are the usual caveats about weekend reporting of figures and there is likely to be another move up during the week when more data comes in. But, in combination with other statistics today, it all added up to a slightly more positive picture being portrayed at the Downing Street media briefing. New infections are not increasing even though the number of people tested is rising. The total number of patients with Covid-19 in hospitals is falling in most parts of the UK. NHS leaders are talking of coming ""through the peak"". But they don't expect a steady downwards trajectory, more a slowly declining plateau. As Professor James Naismith of Oxford University put it, ""the virus takes us in an express elevator to the top of the peak but we have to find our way back down by the stairs"". Mr Raab suggested social distancing measures already being seen in food shops and other businesses that have remained operating could also be expanded to non-essential businesses if they were to reopen. Asked whether there was any chance of people being able to play sport outside this summer, Mr Raab  saidthis would be ""difficult""due to the ""level and scale of interaction"". But he added: ""I think the professional sport may be different because of the scale of testing that they would be able to introduce."" On the possibility of testing people arriving at UK airports, Mr Raab said this measure might be introduced but he ""can't say it with any certainty yet"". ""The advice that we got - and I checked it with the scientists, with the chief medical officer - at the outset when we took up our social distancing measures, is that it wouldn't make any difference from a public health point of view,"" he said. At that time, the number of people travelling was ""plummeting"" and ""the virus was already at pace"" within the UK, he added. But he said that might need to be reviewed when the number of people with the virus in the UK had dropped significantly. ""Whether it's a quarantine period, or testing, or other measures that might be taken, it's possible - and I ask this question every weekâ¦ and we will keep asking that question."" Supermarkets have remained open with social distancing measures At Sunday's Downing Street briefing, NHS England's Medical Director, Prof Stephen Powis, said efforts by the public to follow social distancing guidelines ""have begun to pay off"", but stressed this would only continue if people continue to comply with the strict measures. He said there was a ""very definite"" trend of a reduced number of people in hospitals - most markedly in London - and said there had been a decline in the number of critical care beds used for Covid-19 patients. But Prof Powis insisted it was too early to ease off lockdown measures. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves: ""Businesses, schools and other organisations need time to plan if they are to reopen"" In his opening remarks at the government briefing, Environment Secretary George Eustice said food availability in UK supermarkets had returned to ""normal levels"" after a period of panic-buying at the start of the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Eustice said the international food chain is continuing to ""work well"", but he said he expected there would be a needto recruit furloughed staffto harvest crops at the start of the summer. He also dismissed reports that travellers returning to the UK will have to be quarantined as ""speculation"", saying ""no decisions"" have yet been taken on measures beyond lockdown. Meanwhile, First Minister Nicola Sturgeonwarned she could delay any lifting of the restrictions in Scotlandif she thought the government at Westminster was moving too quickly. ""If... the UK government took decisions that I thought were premature in terms of coming out of the lockdown then clearly I would want to make sure that Scotland did what I judged was best to protect the population,"" she told the programme. But Ms Sturgeon added she would not take a different path ""for the sake of it"".
