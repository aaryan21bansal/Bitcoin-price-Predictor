"Renewables may be booming but the Committee on Climate Change says the government isn't moving fast enough The UK has been dealt a ""brutal reality check"" on its climate change ambitions, environmentalists have said. The government's official climate change advisers warn ministers are failing to cut emissions fast enough, and adapt to rising temperatures. Committee on Climate Change,externalchair John Gummer likened them to the hapless characters in 1970s comedy Dad's Army. The government said it would soon set out plans to tackle emissions from aviation, heat, energy and transport. Trees 'most effective solution' for climate change Attenborough: Climate risks Africa turmoil Water and green energy produced by a single device The prime minister recently announced that the UK would lead the world by cutting almost all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 - so-callednet zero. Theresa May also aspired to the UK hosting a hugely importantglobal climate summit next year. But the CCC said that the UK was already stumbling over measures needed to achieve the previous target of an 80% emissions cut. Its report says new policies must be found to help people lead good lives without fuelling global warming. This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly Policies are needed to ensure that people living in care homes, hospitals and flats can stay cool in increasingly hot summers. And ministers must show how funds will be found to protect critical infrastructure - like ports - from rising sea levels. The committee said unless it delivered on these issues, the government would not have the credibility to host a global climate change summit of world leaders, likely to be held in the UK next year. Doug Parr from Greenpeace UK said: ""This is a truly brutal reality check on the government's current progress in tackling the climate emergency. ""It paints the government as a sleeper who's woken up, seen the house is on fire, raised the alarm and gone straight back to sleep"". The committee's deputy chairwoman Baroness Brown told BBC News: ""There's an increasing sense of frustration that the government knows what it has to do - but it's just not doing it."" The committee said the government's 2040 goal to eliminate emissions from cars and vans was too late. New ways must be found to nudge some drivers into walking, cycling and taking public transport, it believes. This video can not be played Climate change: Why are governments taking so long to take action? There's palpable annoyance from the committee that their recommendations are often ignored. In the list of actions needed to meet emission targets, such as improving insulation of buildings and increasing the market share of electric vehicles, the committee found only seven out of 24 goals were on track. Outside the power and industry sectors, only two indicators were on track. Committee chairman Lord Deben, the former agriculture minister John Gummer, said: ""The whole thing is really run by the government like a Dad's Army. We can't go on with this ramshackle system."" At current rates of global emissions cuts, the world may be heading for a temperature rise of more than 3C by the end of this century - but the report says England appears unprepared for even a 2C rise in global temperature. It warns that the UK is failing to insulate itself from the knock-on effects of climate change overseas, such as colonisations by new species, changes in the suitability of land for agriculture or forestry, and risks to health from changes in air quality driven by rising temperatures. The report says: ""Last June, we advised that 25 headline policy actions were needed for the year ahead. Twelve months later, only one has been delivered by the government in full."" It complains that in some ways the UK is going backwards. Green space in parks and gardens cools cities and helps reduce flood risks. But as more homes are crammed into cities, green spaces have shrunk from 63% of urban area in 2001 to 55% in 2018. Heat magnifies the production of pollutants, so more people are expected to suffer breathing problems. Meanwhile, the proportion of hard surfaces in towns has risen by 22% since 2001, even though they make floods worse. The report says the government's planning should consider the risks that the world may warm by as much as 4C by 2100. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world It warns that the new net zero target requires an annual rate of emissions reduction that is 50% higher than under the UK's previous target. It is 30% higher than what's been achieved on average since 1990 - a period when the UK has benefited from a relatively simple switch from coal to gas for electricity. The report says: ""The need for action has rarely been clearer. Our message to government is simple: 'Now, do it.'"" As new homes have been built green spaces have shrunk in urban areas over the past 20 years A government spokesman said the UK had cut emissions faster than any other G7 country and set a strong example for other countries to follow. ""We know there is more to do - and legislating for net zero will help to drive further action, as well as further measures to protect the environment from extreme weather, including flood protection, tree planting and peat-land management,"" the spokesman added. Shadow business and energy secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said the government efforts were lagging far behind what is required. She said the report was a ""remarkable, damning assessment"". Friends of the Earth's Mike Childs said: ""Theresa May keeps talking about the need for climate action, while giving the green light to fracking and more roads and runways. ""Reining in the rogue Department for Transport is crucial. Billions of pounds are being squandered on gas-guzzling developments, while trams, trains, buses and cycling are starved of investment."" Climate change policy is devolved. Scotland faces slightly tougher targets for emissions cuts than England, and Wales faces a slightly more lax target. Northern Ireland polices are not yet determined.

"The pound is heading for two-year lows against the dollar as markets react to continuing Brexit uncertainty and signs that the UK economy is slowing. The currency fell sharply after data showed slowing sales at UK retailers and economists forecast a contraction in the economy in the second quarter. Against the dollar, the pound fell below $1.25 and was close to its lowest level since April 2017. The pound was also at a six-month low against the euro at just above â¬1.11. With the holiday season getting underway, it means travellers from the UK will getting fewer dollars and euros for their pounds. Sterling has been swayed by uncertainty in the aftermath of the EU referendum, but has been more stable in recent months because of confidence about the UK economy. However, recent economic surveys have suggested that the economy may now be weakening and Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank, said this was being factored into the market. ""The economic picture is not particularly pretty,"" she said. The pound fell 0.5% against the dollar at $1.2455, marking the lowest point for it since April 2017, excluding a brief ""flash fall"" in January this year. Back in May, the pound had been trading at around $1.27. Last week, a survey suggested the UK's manufacturing sector contracted at the fastest pace for more than six years. On Tuesday, figures from the British Retail Consortium showed average sales growth slowed to 0.6% in the 12 months to June, the weakest reading since its records began in 1995. Ms Foley also citeda survey by Bloomberg,externalwhich showed that economists are expecting the economy to contract in the second quarter - for the first time since 2012. Pre-order cash on the internet Use specialist cards with low fees to take money abroad Avoid buying cash at the airport Shop around for the best rate Find out fees on cash machine withdrawals overseas An update on the UK economy is due on Wednesday when growth data for the three-month period to May will be released, and economists polled by Reuters expect growth of 0.1%. That wouldbe slower than the 0.5% rate seen in the first quarter of the year. The market is also focusing on the Conservative leadership contest.  Under Theresa May's premiership, the market had thought the chances of a no-deal were slim, but Ms Foley said that was not the expectation if Boris Johnson wins the leadership battle. ""That's what the market is worried about,"" she said. Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said that another factor at play was a strengthening in the dollar ahead of testimony by the head of the US central bank. This was helping to push the pound lower. Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, testifies to the US Congress on Wednesday. Mr Mellor said he could provide a more hawkish tone - meaning interest rate cuts were less likely - than previously expected. Can no-deal Brexit be stopped?

"The debate was chaired by Julie Etchingham The Reality Check team has been fact-checking claims by Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt who appeared on an ITV debate as part of the race to succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader and prime minister. Here are some of the claims they made. The debate started with questions about Brexit and how they planned to ensure that the UK leaves the European Union (EU) on the Brexit deadline of 31 October. The candidates were asked about the Irish border (which will become the only land border between the UK and the EU after Brexit) and the controversial backstop plan. The backstop is the insurance policy, in Theresa May's deal, designed to prevent a ""hard"" Irish border by keeping the UK in a close trading relationship with the EU. This was opposed by many Conservative MPs who feared the UK would become trapped in it for years, leading to her deal being voted down three times. Boris Johnson said in the debate that the solution to the border issue could be found during - what he called - the ""implementation period"" after Brexit. Verdict:Mr Johnson says the Irish border issue can be dealt with during the implementation period. You only get an implementation period if you pass a withdrawal agreement. The EU says it is not prepared to renegotiate the withdrawal agreement, which includes the backstop for the Irish border. Jeremy Hunt said there were ways of avoiding checks at the Irish border after Brexit, including technology. ""Not new technology, but technology that already exists,"" he said. But the EU has said that such a solution does not currently exist. ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls,"" its director-general for trade, Sabine Weyand, said in January. After Brexit, the 310-mile Irish border would represent the only land border between the UK and the EU Even if the EU agreed to implement a solution using existing technology (such as one based on mobile phone tracking) - there's no guarantee it could be designed and put in place by 31 October. Some trade expertsthink border technology is 10 years away. A further challenge is that EU law requires some products to be physically checked at the point when they enter its single market - chemicals and food are among them. Mr Hunt says that these inspections should be allowed to take place using ""mobile"" units away from the border and that a trusted trader scheme could allow some businesses to by-pass checks. However, that would require the EU to agree to change its own rules. The use of ""alternative arrangements"" as a solution to the Irish border was also echoed by Boris Johnson in the debate. You can read more about the potential fortechnology to solve the issue of the Irish border here. Jeremy Hunt criticised Boris Johnson for having referred in the past to Article 24 - which is part of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) - as a possible solution to the problems of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson had previously said that it would allow the UK to continue to trade with the EU without tariffs (taxes on imports) while both sides negotiated a permanent future trade deal. Mr Hunt said: ""You could only get that agreement [GATT 24] to waive tariffs if the other sides agrees and they have made absolutely clear they won't agree."" He's right that Article 24 only stands if there is an agreement from both sides, at least in principle, and a no-deal scenario would imply that there wasn't.You can read more about it here. The UK government agreed to pay the EU a settlement - widely estimated as Â£39bn - as part of Theresa May's withdrawal deal. The agreement was rejected by Parliament. Boris Johnson said that if the UK left without a deal, it would have this Â£39bn to spend. He said in the past that leaving a question mark over the sum would incentivise the EU to shift its stance in the UK's favour in order to get a deal. Not paying the bill could lead to a legal challenge and it would also risk souring relations when it comes to future trade talks. The EU has said it will not open talks on the future relationship until the agreement over the money has been settled (along with the Irish border and EU citizens' rights). You can read more about the money here. Mr Hunt referred to his record as health secretary saying that more patients were being treated in ""good"" or ""outstanding"" hospitals: Verdict:Between 2016 when ratings were introduced and 2018 when Jeremy Hunt ended his time as health secretary, the proportion of hospitals rated ""good"" or ""outstanding"" went from 56% to 66%, treating about 2.7 million more patients. But there was also a 1.6 million increase in total hospital admissions, so some of this rise was down to there being more patients, not more good hospitals. Mr Hunt also defended the change to the benefits system called Universal Credit and said it had got ""a lot of people back into work"". He went on to make this claim about job creation: Verdict:According to the Office for National Statistics there were 3.7 million more people in work in 2019 compared with 2010. Divide that by the 3,346 days since David Cameron became prime minister and you get about 1,106 people a day. This tells you how employment has risen, but not how many jobs have been created. It also doesn't factor in the growing population or the type of work being created. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Passengers were stranded at Gatwick and others due to land were redirected Police at Gatwick Airport were not prepared for an attack by more than one drone, a senior officer has said. Flights were suspended for 30 hours after the drone sightings in December, causing chaos for 140,000 passengers. Sussex Police Supt Justin Burtenshaw said its ""drone plan"" had been based ""around a single drone incursion and not a multiple one"". He said the airport industry was left ""playing catch up"", but Gatwick's defences were ""now fit for purpose"". ""We have now got the mitigation technology in place, I wish we had that in December,"" he added. Anti-drone equipment was deployed by the RAF at Gatwick Airport Supt Burtenshaw was speaking to Philip Ingram, a former British Army intelligence officer, at the Interpol World conference in Singapore on 3 July. He said: ""We had a number of witnesses who saw two drones at the same time, so we're happy that on at least a couple of those occasions there were two drones flying."" No-one has been charged over the disruption, described as a ""sustained"" drone attack. Supt Burtenshaw said this was a ""reflection of how complex it is"" and was ""certainly not a failing in my officers"". Gatwick drone chaos was 'foreseeable' Anti-drone equipment for airports Gatwick drones were in critical areas The officer also said that ""jamming technology"" - intended to remotely bring down a drone - was ""just not tested"". ""All this stuff is built for theatre of war. We are introducing something that is great in a desert into an urban environment and saying we are not quite sure what it's going to do,"" he said. ""I still don't know what effect a jamming technology is going to have on a hospital that is four kilometres away, so we have to be really careful."" Passengers faced long waits inside the airport's terminal Supt Burtenshaw said the technology, which was installed in January at a cost of Â£5m, would only be used if there were ""no aircraft in the sky"". He added: ""[It's] not something we would use very quickly."" Footage of Supt Burtenshaw being interviewed by Mr Ingram had been uploaded on YouTube, but was removed after a journalist contacted Sussex Police. The force said the interview had been carried out ""on the understanding that it would be shared only among those attending the private conference"". It added: ""Once the organisers realised their error in broadcasting the interview on YouTube, they removed it.""

"The safety of the public is being put at risk by thousands of prisoners being released without proper assessments, the government has been told. Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, also found suicides had risen by 15% in a year in England and Wales. In his 2018-19 annual report,,externalMr Clarke described the rising number of prisoner suicides and self-harm as a ""scandal"". He also found the response to the ""deluge of drugs"" in prisons had been ""too slow"" and ""unsophisticated"". In his report, Mr Clarke said thousands of prisoners who were potentially a ""high risk of harm"" to the public were being released ""without proper assessment"". An inmate's assessment should be regularly updated, he said, but sometimes there was no document at all or the paperwork was out of date. He added that the response to the problem, which had been raised repeatedly, had been ""poor"". Reality Check: What's the problem with prisons? How Norway turns criminals into good neighbours There were 83 suicides in male prisons in 2018-19, an increase from 72 the previous year, the report said. Mr Clarke said levels of self-harm were ""disturbingly high"", rising in two thirds of the adult male prisons inspected. He suggested that it was time for an independent inquiry to tackle the ""scandal"" of people dying in state care in ""preventable circumstances"". Mr Clarke said he would ""never forget"" the squalid conditions he encountered on a visit to Birmingham prison. He recalled a blood-stained shower, which was littered with rat droppings. Birmingham had the worst examples of living conditions, his report said, with cells ""dirty, cramped and overcrowded"". Vulnerable prisoners were found living in squalid cells which were not fit for habitation. ""Rubbish was left lying around in bags and there were problems with fleas, cockroaches and rodents,"" the report said. One prisoner lived in a ""filthy flooded cell"" and the blood of another - who had self-harmed two days earlier - had not been cleaned from the floor. The report warned the ""appalling impact"" of illicit drugs in prisons had been underestimated. Mr Clarke said there was a ""reluctance"" to invest in available technology to detect drugs which was a ""great shame"" given their ""destructive impact"". The report also found: Out of 28 prisons inspected, 22 were found to be unsafe Outcomes for women prisoners was better than for men A ""large cohort"" of sex offenders could not access rehabilitation programmes in prisons Half of the children in custody surveyed said they had been restrained during their time in detention - the highest figure since records began in 2002 Levels of violence also remained high at young offender institutions and secure training centres with bullying a ""constant concern"" Mr Clarke praised the ""bravery"" of prison staff, saying their work was ""difficult, often dangerous, largely unseen by the public and, as a result, little understood"". The Ministry of Justice said it had improved its ""risk assessment and sentencing planning processes"" and high-risk prisoners were subject to ""various strict risk assessments"". It also said it had improved the provision of mental health support and trained staff on how to care for inmates at risk of self-harm. Deborah Coles, director of charity Inquest, said ""self-harm, violence and deaths"" were endemic in the prison system and recommendations were ""systemically ignored"". She called for urgent action to reduce the use of prison, redirect resources into community alternatives and ""hold those involved legally accountable for deaths across all state institutions"".

"Donald Trump has been ""disrespectful"" towards the prime minister and the UK, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. His comments come after President Trump called Sir Kim Darroch, the UK ambassador to the US, ""a very stupid guy"" amid a row over leaked emails. He went on to criticise Theresa May over Brexit, saying she had ignored his advice and gone her ""own foolish way"". On Sunday emails revealed the ambassador had called the Trump administration ""clumsy and inept"". Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox's scheduled meeting with the US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in the US was cancelled on Tuesday. Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? Trump: We won't deal with UK ambassador Trump attack ambassador 'has PM's full support' Mr Hunt responded to Mr Trump's latest outburst by tweeting: ""Friends speak frankly so I will: these comments are disrespectful and wrong to our prime minister and my country."" The Tory leadership hopeful also said he would keep Sir Kim in his post until he retires at Christmas. This video can not be played Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US in a TV debate During a televised debate, Boris Johnson, the current Tory leadership frontrunner, was pushed on whether he would keep the ambassador, but said he ""wouldn't be so presumptuous"" as to think he would be in a position to do that. Mr Johnson said he had ""a good relationship"" with the White House and that it was important to have a ""close partnership"" with the US. Allow Twitter content?

"The safety of the public is being put at risk by thousands of prisoners being released without proper assessments, the government has been told. Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, also found suicides had risen by 15% in a year in England and Wales. In his 2018-19 annual report,,externalMr Clarke described the rising number of prisoner suicides and self-harm as a ""scandal"". He also found the response to the ""deluge of drugs"" in prisons had been ""too slow"" and ""unsophisticated"". In his report, Mr Clarke said thousands of prisoners who were potentially a ""high risk of harm"" to the public were being released ""without proper assessment"". An inmate's assessment should be regularly updated, he said, but sometimes there was no document at all or the paperwork was out of date. He added that the response to the problem, which had been raised repeatedly, had been ""poor"". Reality Check: What's the problem with prisons? How Norway turns criminals into good neighbours There were 83 suicides in male prisons in 2018-19, an increase from 72 the previous year, the report said. Mr Clarke said levels of self-harm were ""disturbingly high"", rising in two thirds of the adult male prisons inspected. He suggested that it was time for an independent inquiry to tackle the ""scandal"" of people dying in state care in ""preventable circumstances"". Mr Clarke said he would ""never forget"" the squalid conditions he encountered on a visit to Birmingham prison. He recalled a blood-stained shower, which was littered with rat droppings. Birmingham had the worst examples of living conditions, his report said, with cells ""dirty, cramped and overcrowded"". Vulnerable prisoners were found living in squalid cells which were not fit for habitation. ""Rubbish was left lying around in bags and there were problems with fleas, cockroaches and rodents,"" the report said. One prisoner lived in a ""filthy flooded cell"" and the blood of another - who had self-harmed two days earlier - had not been cleaned from the floor. The report warned the ""appalling impact"" of illicit drugs in prisons had been underestimated. Mr Clarke said there was a ""reluctance"" to invest in available technology to detect drugs which was a ""great shame"" given their ""destructive impact"". The report also found: Out of 28 prisons inspected, 22 were found to be unsafe Outcomes for women prisoners was better than for men A ""large cohort"" of sex offenders could not access rehabilitation programmes in prisons Half of the children in custody surveyed said they had been restrained during their time in detention - the highest figure since records began in 2002 Levels of violence also remained high at young offender institutions and secure training centres with bullying a ""constant concern"" Mr Clarke praised the ""bravery"" of prison staff, saying their work was ""difficult, often dangerous, largely unseen by the public and, as a result, little understood"". The Ministry of Justice said it had improved its ""risk assessment and sentencing planning processes"" and high-risk prisoners were subject to ""various strict risk assessments"". It also said it had improved the provision of mental health support and trained staff on how to care for inmates at risk of self-harm. Deborah Coles, director of charity Inquest, said ""self-harm, violence and deaths"" were endemic in the prison system and recommendations were ""systemically ignored"". She called for urgent action to reduce the use of prison, redirect resources into community alternatives and ""hold those involved legally accountable for deaths across all state institutions"".

"Lord Turnberg, Lord Triesman and Lord Darzi have resigned the Labour whip Three peers have left the Labour group in the Lords, accusing the party of anti-Semitism, Newsnight has learned. Lord Triesman, general secretary between 2001 and 2004, accused Jeremy Corbyn of anti-Semitism and said the party was no longer ""a safe environment"" for Jewish people. Lord Darzi, meanwhile, will sit as an independent and Lord Turnberg said he feared ""for the future"" of the party. Labour said it ""completely rejects these false and offensive claims"". ""The Labour Party at all levels is implacably opposed to anti-Semitism and is determined to root out this social cancer from our movement and society,""  a party spokeswoman said. Former Health Minister Lord Darzi said that as an Armenian descendant of a ""survivor of the Armenian genocide"", he had ""zero tolerance to anti-Semitism,"" adding that his decision to resign the whip ""has not been lightly taken"". Former president of the Royal College of Physicians Lord Turnberg told BBC Newsnight that his differences ""lie with the party leadership and machine and not with my very supportive colleagues in the Lords who share my values"". ""It is not just the policies on foreign affairs... and Brexit vacillation and bypassing parliamentary opinion but the overt anti-Semitism that permeates the party machine that is no longer possible for me to tolerate,"" he said. Labour said it was taking ""decisive action against anti-Semitism"" and had doubled the number of staff dedicated to dealing with complaints and cases. ""Our records show that anti-Semitism cases that have gone through the stages of our disciplinary procedures since September 2015 account for about 0.06% of the party's membership,"" the spokeswoman said. ""This represents a tiny minority - but one anti-Semite is one too many and we will continue to act against this repugnant form of racism."" But, in his resignation letter to Labour's leader in the House of Lords, Baroness Smith, Lord Triesman said Mr Corbyn ""and his circle are anti-Semitic, having never once made the right judgement call about an issue reflecting deep prejudice"". ""My sad conclusion is that the Labour party is very plainly institutionally anti-Semitic,"" he wrote. Anti-Semites were ""shielded"", while ""serious party members are thrown out unceremoniously"", he said. ""The experience of life in the party has become sickening."" The remarks represent the strongest personal attack on the Labour leader from within the party since Margaret Hodge reportedly called Mr Corbyn an anti-Semitic racist last year. A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims Gordon Brown: Automatically expel anti-Semites in Labour Labour must 'act more quickly' on anti-Semitism Lord Triesman told Newsnight the party had been ""a central plank of my political life for over 50 years"". But it had now ""slipped into the familiar gutter of so many of the hard left"". ""It is a painful decision,"" the former trade union leader told Newsnight. ""I remain completely aligned to the values I've had over all these years but I can no longer take direction from a leadership that is institutionally anti-Semitic."" Lord Triesman wrote: ""I always said it was worth hanging on to fight so long as there was a prospect of winning. ""I now don't believe with this leadership there is."" He said hoping ""something will turn up to change it all"" was a ""unicorn delusion"". The resignations came as Labour's disputes panel met to discuss the suspension of MP Chris Williamson. Mr Williamsonwas suspendedearlier this year after saying Labour had ""given too much ground"" over anti-Semitism. In February,nine MPs quit Labour, some citing the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism as their reason for leaving. Luciana Berger said she had come to the ""sickening conclusion"" the party had become institutionally anti-Semitic and she was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" to stay. Joan Ryanclaimed Labour's leadership had allowed ""Jews to be abused with impunity"". AndIan Austin said Jeremy Corbyn was ""incapable""of dealing with anti-Semitism. In his letter, Lord Triesman also cited Labour's policy position on Brexit, which he said had ""encouraged xenophobia"", and on defence and Nato, which he called ""worse than ambiguous"".

"Donald Trump has been ""disrespectful"" towards the prime minister and the UK, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. His comments come after President Trump called Sir Kim Darroch, the UK ambassador to the US, ""a very stupid guy"" amid a row over leaked emails. He went on to criticise Theresa May over Brexit, saying she had ignored his advice and gone her ""own foolish way"". On Sunday emails revealed the ambassador had called the Trump administration ""clumsy and inept"". Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox's scheduled meeting with the US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in the US was cancelled on Tuesday. Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? Trump: We won't deal with UK ambassador Trump attack ambassador 'has PM's full support' Mr Hunt responded to Mr Trump's latest outburst by tweeting: ""Friends speak frankly so I will: these comments are disrespectful and wrong to our prime minister and my country."" The Tory leadership hopeful also said he would keep Sir Kim in his post until he retires at Christmas. This video can not be played Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US in a TV debate During a televised debate, Boris Johnson, the current Tory leadership frontrunner, was pushed on whether he would keep the ambassador, but said he ""wouldn't be so presumptuous"" as to think he would be in a position to do that. Mr Johnson said he had ""a good relationship"" with the White House and that it was important to have a ""close partnership"" with the US. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt traded jibes in a feisty debate on ITV Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have clashed on Brexit and UK relations with Donald Trump in a lively and occasionally bad-tempered TV debate. Mr Hunt accused his rival of not being willing to ""put his neck on the line"" by saying he would quit as PM if he did not hit the 31 October deadline. Mr Johnson said he admired his rival's ability ""to change his mind"" so often - a dig at the fact Mr Hunt voted Remain. Mr Johnson declined to condemn Mr Trump for his response tothe emails row. He refused to confirm whether he would keep the UK's top diplomat in the US, Sir Kim Darroch, in his post until his scheduled retirement in December, afterMr Trump said he was no longer prepared to deal with him. The US president has lambasted Sir Kim, and criticised Theresa May, after the diplomat described the White House as ""inept and dysfunctional"" in leaked cables. While stressing the value of the ""special relationship"" with the US, Mr Johnson insisted that only he, as prime minister, would take ""important and politically sensitive"" decisions such as who should represent the UK in the US. As it happened: Leaders debate Johnson v Hunt fact-checked Tory leadership: Compare the candidates During the first head-to-head debate of the leadership campaign, the two clashed over their different Brexit strategies, political styles and why they were best equipped to be prime minister. The exchanges were pointed and personal in nature at times, with former Mayor of London Mr Johnson dismissing his opponent's ""managerial"" style of politics and accusing him of flip-flopping on certain issues. This video can not be played Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt said the UK needed a leader not a ""newspaper columnist"" - a reference to his rival's work for the Daily Telegraph. He joked that he admired Mr Johnson's ""ability to answer the question"", adding: ""He puts a smile on your face and you forget what the question was, a great quality for a politician but not necessarily a prime minister."" After an opening speech from each contender, the foreign secretary immediately went on the attack over Brexit, pressing his rival on whether he would quit Downing Street if he failed to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October. He said by failing to answer the question, Mr Johnson - who previously said the deadline was a ""do or die"" issue for him - showed he was motivated by personal ambition not leadership. ""It is not do or die,"" Mr Hunt said. ""It is Boris in Number 10 that matters."" Accusing his rival of not being straight with the electorate, he said: ""Being prime minister is about telling people what they need to hear, not just what they want to hear."" Mr Johnson, in turn, said it was clear his rival was ""not absolutely committed"" to the deadline himself, branding him ""defeatist"". He urged Mr Hunt to guarantee that Brexit would happen by Christmas, adding that the EU would not take a ""papier mache deadline"" seriously. What's Jeremy Hunt's track record? And how does Boris Johnson's record compare? Do the people choosing the next PM think like you? ""If we are going to have a 31 October deadline, we must stick to it,"" he said. ""The EU will understand we are ready and will give us the deal we need. ""I don't want to hold out to the EU the prospect that they might encourage my resignation by refusing to agree a deal. ""I think it is extraordinary we should be telling the British electorate we are willing to kick the can down the road. ""I would like to know how many more days my opponent would be willing to delay."" Both men have said they would be prepared to leave the EU without a deal, but Mr Johnson has been far more relaxed about the impact that could have. Bid to make no deal more difficult scrapes through Do MPs have the power to stop no deal? What would no deal look like? Mr Hunt suggested his rival was ""minimising the risk of a no-deal Brexit"" and ""peddling optimism"", but Mr Johnson said the UK had had a ""bellyful of defeatism"" and the UK could look forward to a bright future outside the EU. The pair also disagreed over whether they might be prepared to suspend Parliament to force through a no-deal exit - so-called prorogation. While Mr Hunt categorically ruled this out, Mr Johnson said he would ""not take anything off the table"". Both teams will leave Salford content with their candidates' performance. The gaffe prone former foreign secretary avoided slipping on any banana skins, and managing not to commit on some of the more controversial issues before him. And the current foreign secretary managed to land his blows on his opponent. There was perhaps though no jaw dropper, no moment that turned this race upside down. Mr Johnson arrived the favourite and leaves in the same position. Mr Hunt turned up keen to show that he is ready to use sharp elbows to scrap and to make himself heard with attacks on his rival that are a contrast to his normal careful style. Their respective status as the front runner and challenger may not have changed. Yet while Jeremy Hunt may not, from this performance alone, manage to stop Boris Johnson's journey to No 10, he has at least shown that if he gets there, he is likely to face a very tricky time. Read more from Laura On the escalating diplomatic row with the US, Mr Hunt said the president's criticism of Sir Kim Darroch had been ill-judged and he would, if he became PM, not be forced into recalling the diplomat early. He also took issue with Mr Trump for saying the prime minister had failed to listen to his advice and been made to look ""foolish"" over Brexit. ""His comments about Theresa May were unacceptable and I don't think he should have made them,"" he said, remarks which prompted audience applause. Mr Johnson said the US president had been ""dragged into a British political debate"" not of his making, but did suggest his outburst on Twitter - in which he called Sir Kim a ""pompous fool"" - had ""not necessarily been the right thing to do"". While civil servants must be able to give confidential advice, he declined to comment on Sir Kim's future, only asking Mr Hunt to rule out ""extending his term out of sympathy"". Both men have been criticised for making uncosted spending promises and offers of tax cuts during the campaign. Mr Hunt sought to make capital out of Mr Johnson's pledge to give a tax cut to higher earners by raising the threshold at which people pay 40% tax from Â£50,000 to Â£80,000. ""It was a mistake, tax cuts for the rich,"" he said. ""I have spent my life trying to persuade people that we are not the party of the rich."" Mr Johnson defended what he said was a ""package"" of measures to reduce the tax burden for both low and middle earners and which he said would boost the economy. The show, entitled Britain's Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate, was hosted by journalist Julie Etchingham in front of a studio audience of 200 people at MediaCityUK in Salford. It took place as 160,000 or so party members get the chance to vote by post on who should succeed Theresa May. The winner and next PM will be revealed on 23 July - it will be the first time a sitting prime minister has been chosen by party members.

"Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson go head-to-head for the first time on TV Britain's Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate began at 20:00 BST It is taking place in front of a studio audience of 200 people The winner of the leadership contest and next PM to be revealed on 23 July Emma Harrison and Matt Cannon That's the end of our live coverage from this evening's TV head-to-head. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt clashed on a number of key issues and, when asked, each appeared to struggle to praise their rival. Among some of those key disputes were: Brexit  Would they suspend Parliament?  UK ambassador row  A reminder that Tory members have begun voting, with the winner and next PM to be revealed on 23 July. It will be the first time a sitting prime minister has been chosen by party members. A former Tory MP and private secretary to Mr Hunt has said his man ""landed some really powerful blows"" on his rival. Speaking after the debate, Rob Wilson said: ""I don't think there was a knockout but it came close on a couple of times because clearly Boris wasn't across the detail and relied too often on laughter and bluster which exactly confirmed what Jeremy Hunt has been saying through the campaign."" Mr Wilson added that he thought it was ""too early"" to say who would win the leadership race. This video can not be played Tory leadership TV debate: Johnson v Hunt on Brexit date Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson duked it out on a range of topics tonight. Here is how their answers to questions over the biggest topics - Brexit and the diplomatic row with US President Donald Trump - compared. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Both men went in with a clear idea of what they wanted to get across. Boris Johnson says Brexit has been handled badly up until now by someone who didn't really believe in it. Jeremy Hunt's message is that optimism isn't enough, you need realism too, to get this thing over the line. ITV political editor Robert Peston says it was a ""great debate"" but may not have changed the result. Speaking on ITV's live Twitter broadcast, he said that although it may have swayed some Tory members, most may have already cast their vote. He said: ""Truthfully, I think Boris Johnson's probably won it"". Here's a reminder from one Tory MP - in case you're one of the 160,000 or so who can vote but still haven't had your ballot paper.

Reality Check Mr Johnson tells the TV audience that if the UK leaves with no deal, it will have Â£39bn to spend, ""which would be very helpful in lubricating the consequences of a no-deal Brexit"". The UK has agreed to pay the EU a settlement - widely estimated as Â£39bn - as it leaves. The so-called ""divorce bill"". Not paying the bill would not necessarily be illegal - although it would be open to legal challenge. But it would risk souring relations when it comes to future trade. The EU has said it will not open talks on the future relationship until the agreement over the money has been settled. BBC News Channel Boris Johnson supporter Jason McCartney, who lost his seat in 2017, argues for his man in the so-called ""spin room"" after the debate. On the issue of tax cuts, he insists Mr Johnson ""really understands"" that the government needs to help the less well-off and proved that with some of the things he did as London mayor. Mr McCartney says his candidate is the only one vowing to end the Brexit uncertainty by 31 October - and has the ""can-do attitude"" to achieve it. Sky News presenter tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Despite the many jibes made towards each other, the men shake hands at the end. Maybe there's no hard feelings after all.  Mr Hunt says: ""Boris promised money for the NHS - I delivered it. ""I only keep promises I can keep and our country deserves no less."" That's a thinly veiled reference to the infamous Brexit bus and the Â£350m a week for the NHS promise made by Leave supporters. Mr Johnson says the ""only way to get this country off the hamster wheel of doom"" is to ""get Brexit delivered"", fight crime and get rid of the ""defeatism"". He says he has ""the energy and credentials for the job"". And with that the debate is over and the two men shake hands as the credits roll. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Conor McGinn's proposal says if Stormont is not restored by 21 October, the government should legislate for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland MPs have backed amendments which require the government to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland if devolution is not restored. It was part of a Commons debate aimed at keeping NI running in the absence of devolved government. Its main purpose was to extend the government's legal power todelay a fresh Stormont election. MPs had tabled a series of other amendments. What does vote on Northern Ireland bill mean? Why there's more to the Northern Ireland bill Stormont election delay bill debated by MPs 10 ways in which gay rights have changed They argued those issues should not be stalled due to the lack of devolution, which collapsed in January 2017. MPs backed the same-sex marriage amendment by 383 votes to 73, while the abortion amendment was backed 332 to 99. Neither amendment automatically changes the law in Northern Ireland, where same-sex marriage is not legal and abortion is only allowed in very limited circumstances. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks at the history of Northern Ireland's same-sex marriage debate Labour's Conor McGinn, originally from County Armagh, put forward a proposal to the NI Executive Formation Bill that if Stormont is not restored by 21 October, then the government should legislate for same-sex marriage - on the condition that a future assembly could overturn or amend the law. The abortion amendment, put forward by his Labour colleague Stella Creasy, is subject to the same condition. The two contenders vying to become the next prime minister were asked about Tuesday's vote during a leadership debate on ITV. Jeremy Hunt said he would support the move, while Boris Johnson said it should remain a devolved issue. ""I think it's a matter for the people of Northern Ireland and one of the most important reasons for getting the Stormont government back up and running,"" Mr Johnson said. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Political Reporter Campaigners for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland say this is a watershed moment. Others may see it as the biggest step yet by Westminster towards enacting direct rule. But it does not automatically change the law - the caveat is that it can only happen if Stormont hasn't been restored by 21 October. The Northern Ireland Office minister, John Penrose, also said even if we get to that stage, time constraints mean they may be unlikely to be able to implement the law change right away. The DUP was angry that Parliament was voting on issues it deems devolved matters, saying the bill had been ""hijacked"". But the MP behind the amendment - Conor McGinn - said the DUP should see it as an ""incentive"" to get Stormont restored so it never has to come into effect. ""My priority, and what I want to see, is an assembly up and running and functioning in Stormont, so it is my strong view that the way that this amendment is crafted doesn't impinge on the devolved settlement because it explicitly recognises that this is a devolved power,"" Mr McGinn said. ""At the minute, the assembly and executive exists in the ether or as a concept, not in reality."" Read more from Jaynehere. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If the Stormont assembly has not been restored by 21 October, the government must bring regulations to Parliament to amend the law in Northern Ireland on same-sex marriage. There would not have to be a further vote on the matter, as it would come in the form of secondary legislation - statutory instruments - which would not be put to a vote on the Commons floor. The bill still has to go to the House of Lords for approval, but it is very unlikely it will be overturned there. Former Number 10 Director of Legislative Affairs Nikki Da Costa told BBC News NI MPs could ask for a resolution to overturn it - but given the majority in favour of the amendment, that seemed unlikely to happen too. This video can not be played The law on abortion in Northern Ireland explained The DUP voted against both amendments, but two of its MPs, Gavin Robinson and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, were tellers, meaning they did not vote. Independent unionist MP for North Down, Lady Hermon, backed the same-sex marriage amendment, as did Northern Ireland Office Minister John Penrose. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and the prime minister abstained. Another hour of debate on other amendments, with some tabled by the DUP looking at the implementation of the Military Covenant in NI, also took place. MPs also backed an amendment tabled by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, which requires the government to submit regular progress reports to Parliament, giving updates on the talks process at Stormont. It passed by just one vote. The DUP's Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said the amendment would ""drive a coach and horses through the principle of devolution"". The DUP reacted angrily to the decision to allow the abortion and same-sex marriage amendments to be debated in Parliament. Speaking before the same-sex marriage amendment was approved, the party's Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, said if approved by MPs, the amendment would ""drive a coach and horses through the principle of devolution"". During the debate, he said there were many issues - such as the health service, education, infrastructure investment, jobs -  that were having ""massive detrimental effects by not having progress made through legislation and executive decisions. ""Yet nobody is addressing that point today, instead we're picking out certain issues, which I think is a fundamentally wrong approach especially when talks are under way currently."" Party colleague Gavin Robinson said that if the assembly was restored tomorrow, the issue of same-sex marriage could be legislated on as the DUP does not have the numbers to stop it. He said the party stopping this happening was Sinn FÃ©in. However, Sinn FÃ©in MP Elisha McCallion said: ""It was inevitable that the British government's failure to defend basic rights available everywhere else on these islands would be confronted. ""This was the message coming out of Westminster today."" John O'Doherty of the Rainbow Project, said: ""Parliament has always had the power to legislate for marriage equality in Northern Ireland and we are glad the House of Commons has seen sense and voted to give people in Northern Ireland the same freedoms enjoyed by everyone else in these islands."" Conservative MPs and Labour MPs were given free vote on the issue. The Scottish National Party (SNP), which has traditionally abstained on devolved matters in other nations, said on Tuesday morning that its MPs would be given a free vote on the issue and 25 of its MPs backed it. England and Wales legalised same-sex marriage in July 2013and came into force inMarch 2014 Scotland legislated for same-sex marriage inFebruary 2014which came into effect inDecemberthat year The Republic of Ireland legalised same-sex marriage in areferendum in May 2015- becoming the only country in the world to do so by popular vote.Ireland's first same-sex marriage took place in November 2015. Northern Ireland has been without a government for more than two and a half years, after a bitter row over a financial scandal split the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The Northern Ireland secretary has twice pushed back her obligation to call an election at Stormont, with it due to end on 25 August. This new legislation would delay another poll until 21 October, with another possible extension to 13 January 2020. It also provides greater clarity about decision-making to civil servants at Stormont, in the absence of functioning ministers.

"Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson go head-to-head for the first time on TV Britain's Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate began at 20:00 BST It is taking place in front of a studio audience of 200 people The winner of the leadership contest and next PM to be revealed on 23 July Emma Harrison and Matt Cannon That's the end of our live coverage from this evening's TV head-to-head. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt clashed on a number of key issues and, when asked, each appeared to struggle to praise their rival. Among some of those key disputes were: Brexit  Would they suspend Parliament?  UK ambassador row  A reminder that Tory members have begun voting, with the winner and next PM to be revealed on 23 July. It will be the first time a sitting prime minister has been chosen by party members. A former Tory MP and private secretary to Mr Hunt has said his man ""landed some really powerful blows"" on his rival. Speaking after the debate, Rob Wilson said: ""I don't think there was a knockout but it came close on a couple of times because clearly Boris wasn't across the detail and relied too often on laughter and bluster which exactly confirmed what Jeremy Hunt has been saying through the campaign."" Mr Wilson added that he thought it was ""too early"" to say who would win the leadership race. This video can not be played Tory leadership TV debate: Johnson v Hunt on Brexit date Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson duked it out on a range of topics tonight. Here is how their answers to questions over the biggest topics - Brexit and the diplomatic row with US President Donald Trump - compared. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Both men went in with a clear idea of what they wanted to get across. Boris Johnson says Brexit has been handled badly up until now by someone who didn't really believe in it. Jeremy Hunt's message is that optimism isn't enough, you need realism too, to get this thing over the line. ITV political editor Robert Peston says it was a ""great debate"" but may not have changed the result. Speaking on ITV's live Twitter broadcast, he said that although it may have swayed some Tory members, most may have already cast their vote. He said: ""Truthfully, I think Boris Johnson's probably won it"". Here's a reminder from one Tory MP - in case you're one of the 160,000 or so who can vote but still haven't had your ballot paper.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt traded jibes in a feisty debate on ITV Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have clashed on Brexit and UK relations with Donald Trump in a lively and occasionally bad-tempered TV debate. Mr Hunt accused his rival of not being willing to ""put his neck on the line"" by saying he would quit as PM if he did not hit the 31 October deadline. Mr Johnson said he admired his rival's ability ""to change his mind"" so often - a dig at the fact Mr Hunt voted Remain. Mr Johnson declined to condemn Mr Trump for his response tothe emails row. He refused to confirm whether he would keep the UK's top diplomat in the US, Sir Kim Darroch, in his post until his scheduled retirement in December, afterMr Trump said he was no longer prepared to deal with him. The US president has lambasted Sir Kim, and criticised Theresa May, after the diplomat described the White House as ""inept and dysfunctional"" in leaked cables. While stressing the value of the ""special relationship"" with the US, Mr Johnson insisted that only he, as prime minister, would take ""important and politically sensitive"" decisions such as who should represent the UK in the US. As it happened: Leaders debate Johnson v Hunt fact-checked Tory leadership: Compare the candidates During the first head-to-head debate of the leadership campaign, the two clashed over their different Brexit strategies, political styles and why they were best equipped to be prime minister. The exchanges were pointed and personal in nature at times, with former Mayor of London Mr Johnson dismissing his opponent's ""managerial"" style of politics and accusing him of flip-flopping on certain issues. This video can not be played Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt said the UK needed a leader not a ""newspaper columnist"" - a reference to his rival's work for the Daily Telegraph. He joked that he admired Mr Johnson's ""ability to answer the question"", adding: ""He puts a smile on your face and you forget what the question was, a great quality for a politician but not necessarily a prime minister."" After an opening speech from each contender, the foreign secretary immediately went on the attack over Brexit, pressing his rival on whether he would quit Downing Street if he failed to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October. He said by failing to answer the question, Mr Johnson - who previously said the deadline was a ""do or die"" issue for him - showed he was motivated by personal ambition not leadership. ""It is not do or die,"" Mr Hunt said. ""It is Boris in Number 10 that matters."" Accusing his rival of not being straight with the electorate, he said: ""Being prime minister is about telling people what they need to hear, not just what they want to hear."" Mr Johnson, in turn, said it was clear his rival was ""not absolutely committed"" to the deadline himself, branding him ""defeatist"". He urged Mr Hunt to guarantee that Brexit would happen by Christmas, adding that the EU would not take a ""papier mache deadline"" seriously. What's Jeremy Hunt's track record? And how does Boris Johnson's record compare? Do the people choosing the next PM think like you? ""If we are going to have a 31 October deadline, we must stick to it,"" he said. ""The EU will understand we are ready and will give us the deal we need. ""I don't want to hold out to the EU the prospect that they might encourage my resignation by refusing to agree a deal. ""I think it is extraordinary we should be telling the British electorate we are willing to kick the can down the road. ""I would like to know how many more days my opponent would be willing to delay."" Both men have said they would be prepared to leave the EU without a deal, but Mr Johnson has been far more relaxed about the impact that could have. Bid to make no deal more difficult scrapes through Do MPs have the power to stop no deal? What would no deal look like? Mr Hunt suggested his rival was ""minimising the risk of a no-deal Brexit"" and ""peddling optimism"", but Mr Johnson said the UK had had a ""bellyful of defeatism"" and the UK could look forward to a bright future outside the EU. The pair also disagreed over whether they might be prepared to suspend Parliament to force through a no-deal exit - so-called prorogation. While Mr Hunt categorically ruled this out, Mr Johnson said he would ""not take anything off the table"". Both teams will leave Salford content with their candidates' performance. The gaffe prone former foreign secretary avoided slipping on any banana skins, and managing not to commit on some of the more controversial issues before him. And the current foreign secretary managed to land his blows on his opponent. There was perhaps though no jaw dropper, no moment that turned this race upside down. Mr Johnson arrived the favourite and leaves in the same position. Mr Hunt turned up keen to show that he is ready to use sharp elbows to scrap and to make himself heard with attacks on his rival that are a contrast to his normal careful style. Their respective status as the front runner and challenger may not have changed. Yet while Jeremy Hunt may not, from this performance alone, manage to stop Boris Johnson's journey to No 10, he has at least shown that if he gets there, he is likely to face a very tricky time. Read more from Laura On the escalating diplomatic row with the US, Mr Hunt said the president's criticism of Sir Kim Darroch had been ill-judged and he would, if he became PM, not be forced into recalling the diplomat early. He also took issue with Mr Trump for saying the prime minister had failed to listen to his advice and been made to look ""foolish"" over Brexit. ""His comments about Theresa May were unacceptable and I don't think he should have made them,"" he said, remarks which prompted audience applause. Mr Johnson said the US president had been ""dragged into a British political debate"" not of his making, but did suggest his outburst on Twitter - in which he called Sir Kim a ""pompous fool"" - had ""not necessarily been the right thing to do"". While civil servants must be able to give confidential advice, he declined to comment on Sir Kim's future, only asking Mr Hunt to rule out ""extending his term out of sympathy"". Both men have been criticised for making uncosted spending promises and offers of tax cuts during the campaign. Mr Hunt sought to make capital out of Mr Johnson's pledge to give a tax cut to higher earners by raising the threshold at which people pay 40% tax from Â£50,000 to Â£80,000. ""It was a mistake, tax cuts for the rich,"" he said. ""I have spent my life trying to persuade people that we are not the party of the rich."" Mr Johnson defended what he said was a ""package"" of measures to reduce the tax burden for both low and middle earners and which he said would boost the economy. The show, entitled Britain's Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate, was hosted by journalist Julie Etchingham in front of a studio audience of 200 people at MediaCityUK in Salford. It took place as 160,000 or so party members get the chance to vote by post on who should succeed Theresa May. The winner and next PM will be revealed on 23 July - it will be the first time a sitting prime minister has been chosen by party members.

"This video can not be played Strycova stuns Konta to reach last four - highlights Wimbledon 2019 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:1-14 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app.Full details Johanna Konta failed in her bid to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals after an error-strewn display in a straight-set defeat by Czech Barbora Strycova. The British number one started strongly, racing to a 4-1 lead, before collapsing to lose 7-6 (7-5) 6-1. Let down by her previously dominant serve, Konta could not find a way back as - like in June's French Open semis - she crumbled when expectation was high. ""I did my best, and my best today wasn't good enough,"" Konta, 28, said. ""Every decision I made, every thought process, every opportunity I gave myself, I have no regrets in doing."" Strycova, who has reached her maiden Grand Slam singles semi-final just days after saying this could be her last Wimbledon, will face 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams next. ""I think this was one of the best matches I have played,"" the 33-year-old said. 'I don't think you need to pick on me' - Konta responds to 'harsh' questions about defeat In pictures - Lionesses enjoy day out at Wimbledon Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Konta came into the match boasting an incredible record of having lost just three of her 47 service games at these championships. Despite the fact she got an early break, the warning signs that her biggest weapon might not be firing properly were there in the opening game when she had to save a break point. The errors began to creep in at 4-2 when she sent two forehands wide and wild backhand long to allow Strycova to get the break back. It became a theme as Konta went on to produce 22 unforced errors in that opening set, with the Czech increasing in confidence as she gave Konta a lesson in effective drop shots to take it to a tie-break. There Konta could not find a rhythm, sending a forehand into the net to hand the set to the world number world number 54. Konta is well versed in losing opening sets and winning in a third - with a record of 13 wins from 15 three-setters this year - but this time an early break in the second put a comeback out of reach. The game was up for the Briton when she went long with a backhand - summing up everything that was wrong with this performance. ""I couldn't quite find the level that I needed to make it difficult and challenging for the kind of player she is,"" said Konta, who had lost to Strycova in 2017 in Tokyo in their only other meeting. ""She's a very difficult player to play on this surface, and in general. She's a very good player. It's just unfortunate I couldn't quite find the level needed to come through."" This video can not be played Konta reacts to a journalist's 'patronising' question after her defeat by Strycova Konta had been hoping to emulate her 2017 feat of reaching the last four and getting closer to becoming the first British women's singles finalist since Virginia Wade won the title in 1977. She has enjoyed a successful year, reaching the French Open semi-finals and two WTA finals on clay, before transferring her good form on to grass. Her serve has been the key but against Strycova she won just 51% of her first-serve points. In the previous two rounds she came past 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens and two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in three sets with accomplished displays but against the unseeded Strycova - where the Briton was now favourite - her game fell apart. Her mental strength has often been questioned and it will be once again, with this defeat echoing her Roland Garros semi-final loss to another unseeded Czech, Marketa Vondrousova. Konta, who was bidding to reach a fourth Grand Slam semi-final, denied that the pressure of expectation had got to her and refused to blame tiredness from back-to-back three-set matches. ""I was obviously nervous going into the match. But good nerves, excitement, anticipation,"" she said. ""I wouldn't say that had anything to do with the level that I played or any difficulty. ""I think it was a combination of just not finding my level, and her not giving me the opportunity to find my level more than anything."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller This was a clever, skilful and tactically astute performance by Barbora Strycova. At the age of 33, she seized the opportunity to reach a first Grand Slam semi-final magnificently. Johanna Konta, though, was unable to play with anything like the freedom of earlier rounds. Thirty four unforced errors in two sets tells its own story: Strycova's spins and relative lack of pace threw her out of kilter, but nerves and expectations also seemed to play a part. Konta played brilliantly to win her other Wimbledon quarter-final against Simona Halep two years ago, and also her recent French Open quarter-final with Sloane Stephens. But just as in her Roland Garros semi-final with Marketa Vondrousova, Konta was the favourite here - and unable to play to the level she is capable of.

"Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson go head-to-head for the first time on TV Britain's Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate began at 20:00 BST It is taking place in front of a studio audience of 200 people The winner of the leadership contest and next PM to be revealed on 23 July Emma Harrison and Matt Cannon That's the end of our live coverage from this evening's TV head-to-head. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt clashed on a number of key issues and, when asked, each appeared to struggle to praise their rival. Among some of those key disputes were: Brexit  Would they suspend Parliament?  UK ambassador row  A reminder that Tory members have begun voting, with the winner and next PM to be revealed on 23 July. It will be the first time a sitting prime minister has been chosen by party members. A former Tory MP and private secretary to Mr Hunt has said his man ""landed some really powerful blows"" on his rival. Speaking after the debate, Rob Wilson said: ""I don't think there was a knockout but it came close on a couple of times because clearly Boris wasn't across the detail and relied too often on laughter and bluster which exactly confirmed what Jeremy Hunt has been saying through the campaign."" Mr Wilson added that he thought it was ""too early"" to say who would win the leadership race. This video can not be played Tory leadership TV debate: Johnson v Hunt on Brexit date Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson duked it out on a range of topics tonight. Here is how their answers to questions over the biggest topics - Brexit and the diplomatic row with US President Donald Trump - compared. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Both men went in with a clear idea of what they wanted to get across. Boris Johnson says Brexit has been handled badly up until now by someone who didn't really believe in it. Jeremy Hunt's message is that optimism isn't enough, you need realism too, to get this thing over the line. ITV political editor Robert Peston says it was a ""great debate"" but may not have changed the result. Speaking on ITV's live Twitter broadcast, he said that although it may have swayed some Tory members, most may have already cast their vote. He said: ""Truthfully, I think Boris Johnson's probably won it"". Here's a reminder from one Tory MP - in case you're one of the 160,000 or so who can vote but still haven't had your ballot paper.

"Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson go head-to-head for the first time on TV Britain's Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate began at 20:00 BST It is taking place in front of a studio audience of 200 people The winner of the leadership contest and next PM to be revealed on 23 July Emma Harrison and Matt Cannon That's the end of our live coverage from this evening's TV head-to-head. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt clashed on a number of key issues and, when asked, each appeared to struggle to praise their rival. Among some of those key disputes were: Brexit  Would they suspend Parliament?  UK ambassador row  A reminder that Tory members have begun voting, with the winner and next PM to be revealed on 23 July. It will be the first time a sitting prime minister has been chosen by party members. A former Tory MP and private secretary to Mr Hunt has said his man ""landed some really powerful blows"" on his rival. Speaking after the debate, Rob Wilson said: ""I don't think there was a knockout but it came close on a couple of times because clearly Boris wasn't across the detail and relied too often on laughter and bluster which exactly confirmed what Jeremy Hunt has been saying through the campaign."" Mr Wilson added that he thought it was ""too early"" to say who would win the leadership race. This video can not be played Tory leadership TV debate: Johnson v Hunt on Brexit date Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson duked it out on a range of topics tonight. Here is how their answers to questions over the biggest topics - Brexit and the diplomatic row with US President Donald Trump - compared. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Both men went in with a clear idea of what they wanted to get across. Boris Johnson says Brexit has been handled badly up until now by someone who didn't really believe in it. Jeremy Hunt's message is that optimism isn't enough, you need realism too, to get this thing over the line. ITV political editor Robert Peston says it was a ""great debate"" but may not have changed the result. Speaking on ITV's live Twitter broadcast, he said that although it may have swayed some Tory members, most may have already cast their vote. He said: ""Truthfully, I think Boris Johnson's probably won it"". Here's a reminder from one Tory MP - in case you're one of the 160,000 or so who can vote but still haven't had your ballot paper.

Reality Check Mr Johnson tells the TV audience that if the UK leaves with no deal, it will have Â£39bn to spend, ""which would be very helpful in lubricating the consequences of a no-deal Brexit"". The UK has agreed to pay the EU a settlement - widely estimated as Â£39bn - as it leaves. The so-called ""divorce bill"". Not paying the bill would not necessarily be illegal - although it would be open to legal challenge. But it would risk souring relations when it comes to future trade. The EU has said it will not open talks on the future relationship until the agreement over the money has been settled. BBC News Channel Boris Johnson supporter Jason McCartney, who lost his seat in 2017, argues for his man in the so-called ""spin room"" after the debate. On the issue of tax cuts, he insists Mr Johnson ""really understands"" that the government needs to help the less well-off and proved that with some of the things he did as London mayor. Mr McCartney says his candidate is the only one vowing to end the Brexit uncertainty by 31 October - and has the ""can-do attitude"" to achieve it. Sky News presenter tweets... Allow Twitter content?

"Donald Trump has been ""disrespectful"" towards the prime minister and the UK, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. His comments come after President Trump called Sir Kim Darroch, the UK ambassador to the US, ""a very stupid guy"" amid a row over leaked emails. He went on to criticise Theresa May over Brexit, saying she had ignored his advice and gone her ""own foolish way"". On Sunday emails revealed the ambassador had called the Trump administration ""clumsy and inept"". Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox's scheduled meeting with the US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in the US was cancelled on Tuesday. Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? Trump: We won't deal with UK ambassador Trump attack ambassador 'has PM's full support' Mr Hunt responded to Mr Trump's latest outburst by tweeting: ""Friends speak frankly so I will: these comments are disrespectful and wrong to our prime minister and my country."" The Tory leadership hopeful also said he would keep Sir Kim in his post until he retires at Christmas. This video can not be played Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US in a TV debate During a televised debate, Boris Johnson, the current Tory leadership frontrunner, was pushed on whether he would keep the ambassador, but said he ""wouldn't be so presumptuous"" as to think he would be in a position to do that. Mr Johnson said he had ""a good relationship"" with the White House and that it was important to have a ""close partnership"" with the US. Allow Twitter content?

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the row was a reminder of the ""tricky and sensitive"" nature of the UK's relationship with the US and the challenge facing the Tory leadership hopefuls in dealing with a president ""who seems to love stirring up controversy"". ""It's Jeremy Hunt, normally seen as the more cautious of the two, who's speaking much more plainly and directly to Donald Trump on the matter, while Boris Johnson has said only that he's not embarrassed about being close to the White House,"" she said. Following Mr Trump's comments on Monday that the US would ""no longer deal"" with Sir Kim, the US State Department said it would continue ""to deal with any accredited individuals until we get any further guidance from the White House or the president"". ""We have an incredibly special and strategic relationship with the United Kingdom that has gone on for quite a long time - it's bigger than any individual or government,"" the department added. Earlier, Downing Street reaffirmed its ""full support"" for Sir Kim. A spokesman for Theresa May said that Sir Kim is ""a dutiful, respected government official"" and confirmed there were no plans for Mrs May and Mr Trump to hold a call to discuss relations following the leak. Number 10 also confirmed that Sir Kim would not be attending a meeting between Ivanka Trump and the International Trade Secretary Liam Fox in Washington. The spokesman said: ""He isn't attending that meeting but he is supporting Liam Fox in other ways on his trip."" Earlier on Tuesday Mr Trump tweeted: ""The wacky Ambassador that the U.K. foisted upon the United States is not someone we are thrilled with, a very stupid guy. ""He should speak to his country, and Prime Minister May, about their failed Brexit negotiation, and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was handled.

"Conor McGinn's proposal says if Stormont is not restored by 21 October, the government should legislate for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland MPs have backed amendments which require the government to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland if devolution is not restored. It was part of a Commons debate aimed at keeping NI running in the absence of devolved government. Its main purpose was to extend the government's legal power todelay a fresh Stormont election. MPs had tabled a series of other amendments. What does vote on Northern Ireland bill mean? Why there's more to the Northern Ireland bill Stormont election delay bill debated by MPs 10 ways in which gay rights have changed They argued those issues should not be stalled due to the lack of devolution, which collapsed in January 2017. MPs backed the same-sex marriage amendment by 383 votes to 73, while the abortion amendment was backed 332 to 99. Neither amendment automatically changes the law in Northern Ireland, where same-sex marriage is not legal and abortion is only allowed in very limited circumstances. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks at the history of Northern Ireland's same-sex marriage debate Labour's Conor McGinn, originally from County Armagh, put forward a proposal to the NI Executive Formation Bill that if Stormont is not restored by 21 October, then the government should legislate for same-sex marriage - on the condition that a future assembly could overturn or amend the law. The abortion amendment, put forward by his Labour colleague Stella Creasy, is subject to the same condition. The two contenders vying to become the next prime minister were asked about Tuesday's vote during a leadership debate on ITV. Jeremy Hunt said he would support the move, while Boris Johnson said it should remain a devolved issue. ""I think it's a matter for the people of Northern Ireland and one of the most important reasons for getting the Stormont government back up and running,"" Mr Johnson said. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Political Reporter Campaigners for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland say this is a watershed moment. Others may see it as the biggest step yet by Westminster towards enacting direct rule. But it does not automatically change the law - the caveat is that it can only happen if Stormont hasn't been restored by 21 October. The Northern Ireland Office minister, John Penrose, also said even if we get to that stage, time constraints mean they may be unlikely to be able to implement the law change right away. The DUP was angry that Parliament was voting on issues it deems devolved matters, saying the bill had been ""hijacked"". But the MP behind the amendment - Conor McGinn - said the DUP should see it as an ""incentive"" to get Stormont restored so it never has to come into effect. ""My priority, and what I want to see, is an assembly up and running and functioning in Stormont, so it is my strong view that the way that this amendment is crafted doesn't impinge on the devolved settlement because it explicitly recognises that this is a devolved power,"" Mr McGinn said. ""At the minute, the assembly and executive exists in the ether or as a concept, not in reality."" Read more from Jaynehere. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If the Stormont assembly has not been restored by 21 October, the government must bring regulations to Parliament to amend the law in Northern Ireland on same-sex marriage. There would not have to be a further vote on the matter, as it would come in the form of secondary legislation - statutory instruments - which would not be put to a vote on the Commons floor. The bill still has to go to the House of Lords for approval, but it is very unlikely it will be overturned there. Former Number 10 Director of Legislative Affairs Nikki Da Costa told BBC News NI MPs could ask for a resolution to overturn it - but given the majority in favour of the amendment, that seemed unlikely to happen too. This video can not be played The law on abortion in Northern Ireland explained The DUP voted against both amendments, but two of its MPs, Gavin Robinson and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, were tellers, meaning they did not vote. Independent unionist MP for North Down, Lady Hermon, backed the same-sex marriage amendment, as did Northern Ireland Office Minister John Penrose. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and the prime minister abstained. Another hour of debate on other amendments, with some tabled by the DUP looking at the implementation of the Military Covenant in NI, also took place. MPs also backed an amendment tabled by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, which requires the government to submit regular progress reports to Parliament, giving updates on the talks process at Stormont. It passed by just one vote. The DUP's Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said the amendment would ""drive a coach and horses through the principle of devolution"". The DUP reacted angrily to the decision to allow the abortion and same-sex marriage amendments to be debated in Parliament. Speaking before the same-sex marriage amendment was approved, the party's Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, said if approved by MPs, the amendment would ""drive a coach and horses through the principle of devolution"". During the debate, he said there were many issues - such as the health service, education, infrastructure investment, jobs -  that were having ""massive detrimental effects by not having progress made through legislation and executive decisions. ""Yet nobody is addressing that point today, instead we're picking out certain issues, which I think is a fundamentally wrong approach especially when talks are under way currently."" Party colleague Gavin Robinson said that if the assembly was restored tomorrow, the issue of same-sex marriage could be legislated on as the DUP does not have the numbers to stop it. He said the party stopping this happening was Sinn FÃ©in. However, Sinn FÃ©in MP Elisha McCallion said: ""It was inevitable that the British government's failure to defend basic rights available everywhere else on these islands would be confronted. ""This was the message coming out of Westminster today."" John O'Doherty of the Rainbow Project, said: ""Parliament has always had the power to legislate for marriage equality in Northern Ireland and we are glad the House of Commons has seen sense and voted to give people in Northern Ireland the same freedoms enjoyed by everyone else in these islands."" Conservative MPs and Labour MPs were given free vote on the issue. The Scottish National Party (SNP), which has traditionally abstained on devolved matters in other nations, said on Tuesday morning that its MPs would be given a free vote on the issue and 25 of its MPs backed it. England and Wales legalised same-sex marriage in July 2013and came into force inMarch 2014 Scotland legislated for same-sex marriage inFebruary 2014which came into effect inDecemberthat year The Republic of Ireland legalised same-sex marriage in areferendum in May 2015- becoming the only country in the world to do so by popular vote.Ireland's first same-sex marriage took place in November 2015. Northern Ireland has been without a government for more than two and a half years, after a bitter row over a financial scandal split the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The Northern Ireland secretary has twice pushed back her obligation to call an election at Stormont, with it due to end on 25 August. This new legislation would delay another poll until 21 October, with another possible extension to 13 January 2020. It also provides greater clarity about decision-making to civil servants at Stormont, in the absence of functioning ministers.

"Lord Turnberg, Lord Triesman and Lord Darzi have resigned the Labour whip Three peers have left the Labour group in the Lords, accusing the party of anti-Semitism, Newsnight has learned. Lord Triesman, general secretary between 2001 and 2004, accused Jeremy Corbyn of anti-Semitism and said the party was no longer ""a safe environment"" for Jewish people. Lord Darzi, meanwhile, will sit as an independent and Lord Turnberg said he feared ""for the future"" of the party. Labour said it ""completely rejects these false and offensive claims"". ""The Labour Party at all levels is implacably opposed to anti-Semitism and is determined to root out this social cancer from our movement and society,""  a party spokeswoman said. Former Health Minister Lord Darzi said that as an Armenian descendant of a ""survivor of the Armenian genocide"", he had ""zero tolerance to anti-Semitism,"" adding that his decision to resign the whip ""has not been lightly taken"". Former president of the Royal College of Physicians Lord Turnberg told BBC Newsnight that his differences ""lie with the party leadership and machine and not with my very supportive colleagues in the Lords who share my values"". ""It is not just the policies on foreign affairs... and Brexit vacillation and bypassing parliamentary opinion but the overt anti-Semitism that permeates the party machine that is no longer possible for me to tolerate,"" he said. Labour said it was taking ""decisive action against anti-Semitism"" and had doubled the number of staff dedicated to dealing with complaints and cases. ""Our records show that anti-Semitism cases that have gone through the stages of our disciplinary procedures since September 2015 account for about 0.06% of the party's membership,"" the spokeswoman said. ""This represents a tiny minority - but one anti-Semite is one too many and we will continue to act against this repugnant form of racism."" But, in his resignation letter to Labour's leader in the House of Lords, Baroness Smith, Lord Triesman said Mr Corbyn ""and his circle are anti-Semitic, having never once made the right judgement call about an issue reflecting deep prejudice"". ""My sad conclusion is that the Labour party is very plainly institutionally anti-Semitic,"" he wrote. Anti-Semites were ""shielded"", while ""serious party members are thrown out unceremoniously"", he said. ""The experience of life in the party has become sickening."" The remarks represent the strongest personal attack on the Labour leader from within the party since Margaret Hodge reportedly called Mr Corbyn an anti-Semitic racist last year. A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims Gordon Brown: Automatically expel anti-Semites in Labour Labour must 'act more quickly' on anti-Semitism Lord Triesman told Newsnight the party had been ""a central plank of my political life for over 50 years"". But it had now ""slipped into the familiar gutter of so many of the hard left"". ""It is a painful decision,"" the former trade union leader told Newsnight. ""I remain completely aligned to the values I've had over all these years but I can no longer take direction from a leadership that is institutionally anti-Semitic."" Lord Triesman wrote: ""I always said it was worth hanging on to fight so long as there was a prospect of winning. ""I now don't believe with this leadership there is."" He said hoping ""something will turn up to change it all"" was a ""unicorn delusion"". The resignations came as Labour's disputes panel met to discuss the suspension of MP Chris Williamson. Mr Williamsonwas suspendedearlier this year after saying Labour had ""given too much ground"" over anti-Semitism. In February,nine MPs quit Labour, some citing the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism as their reason for leaving. Luciana Berger said she had come to the ""sickening conclusion"" the party had become institutionally anti-Semitic and she was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" to stay. Joan Ryanclaimed Labour's leadership had allowed ""Jews to be abused with impunity"". AndIan Austin said Jeremy Corbyn was ""incapable""of dealing with anti-Semitism. In his letter, Lord Triesman also cited Labour's policy position on Brexit, which he said had ""encouraged xenophobia"", and on defence and Nato, which he called ""worse than ambiguous"".

"The pound is heading for two-year lows against the dollar as markets react to continuing Brexit uncertainty and signs that the UK economy is slowing. The currency fell sharply after data showed slowing sales at UK retailers and economists forecast a contraction in the economy in the second quarter. Against the dollar, the pound fell below $1.25 and was close to its lowest level since April 2017. The pound was also at a six-month low against the euro at just above â¬1.11. With the holiday season getting underway, it means travellers from the UK will getting fewer dollars and euros for their pounds. Sterling has been swayed by uncertainty in the aftermath of the EU referendum, but has been more stable in recent months because of confidence about the UK economy. However, recent economic surveys have suggested that the economy may now be weakening and Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank, said this was being factored into the market. ""The economic picture is not particularly pretty,"" she said. The pound fell 0.5% against the dollar at $1.2455, marking the lowest point for it since April 2017, excluding a brief ""flash fall"" in January this year. Back in May, the pound had been trading at around $1.27. Last week, a survey suggested the UK's manufacturing sector contracted at the fastest pace for more than six years. On Tuesday, figures from the British Retail Consortium showed average sales growth slowed to 0.6% in the 12 months to June, the weakest reading since its records began in 1995. Ms Foley also citeda survey by Bloomberg,externalwhich showed that economists are expecting the economy to contract in the second quarter - for the first time since 2012. Pre-order cash on the internet Use specialist cards with low fees to take money abroad Avoid buying cash at the airport Shop around for the best rate Find out fees on cash machine withdrawals overseas An update on the UK economy is due on Wednesday when growth data for the three-month period to May will be released, and economists polled by Reuters expect growth of 0.1%. That wouldbe slower than the 0.5% rate seen in the first quarter of the year. The market is also focusing on the Conservative leadership contest.  Under Theresa May's premiership, the market had thought the chances of a no-deal were slim, but Ms Foley said that was not the expectation if Boris Johnson wins the leadership battle. ""That's what the market is worried about,"" she said. Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said that another factor at play was a strengthening in the dollar ahead of testimony by the head of the US central bank. This was helping to push the pound lower. Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, testifies to the US Congress on Wednesday. Mr Mellor said he could provide a more hawkish tone - meaning interest rate cuts were less likely - than previously expected. Can no-deal Brexit be stopped?

"This video can not be played Strycova stuns Konta to reach last four - highlights Wimbledon 2019 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:1-14 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app.Full details Johanna Konta failed in her bid to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals after an error-strewn display in a straight-set defeat by Czech Barbora Strycova. The British number one started strongly, racing to a 4-1 lead, before collapsing to lose 7-6 (7-5) 6-1. Let down by her previously dominant serve, Konta could not find a way back as - like in June's French Open semis - she crumbled when expectation was high. ""I did my best, and my best today wasn't good enough,"" Konta, 28, said. ""Every decision I made, every thought process, every opportunity I gave myself, I have no regrets in doing."" Strycova, who has reached her maiden Grand Slam singles semi-final just days after saying this could be her last Wimbledon, will face 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams next. ""I think this was one of the best matches I have played,"" the 33-year-old said. 'I don't think you need to pick on me' - Konta responds to 'harsh' questions about defeat In pictures - Lionesses enjoy day out at Wimbledon Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Konta came into the match boasting an incredible record of having lost just three of her 47 service games at these championships. Despite the fact she got an early break, the warning signs that her biggest weapon might not be firing properly were there in the opening game when she had to save a break point. The errors began to creep in at 4-2 when she sent two forehands wide and wild backhand long to allow Strycova to get the break back. It became a theme as Konta went on to produce 22 unforced errors in that opening set, with the Czech increasing in confidence as she gave Konta a lesson in effective drop shots to take it to a tie-break. There Konta could not find a rhythm, sending a forehand into the net to hand the set to the world number world number 54. Konta is well versed in losing opening sets and winning in a third - with a record of 13 wins from 15 three-setters this year - but this time an early break in the second put a comeback out of reach. The game was up for the Briton when she went long with a backhand - summing up everything that was wrong with this performance. ""I couldn't quite find the level that I needed to make it difficult and challenging for the kind of player she is,"" said Konta, who had lost to Strycova in 2017 in Tokyo in their only other meeting. ""She's a very difficult player to play on this surface, and in general. She's a very good player. It's just unfortunate I couldn't quite find the level needed to come through."" This video can not be played Konta reacts to a journalist's 'patronising' question after her defeat by Strycova Konta had been hoping to emulate her 2017 feat of reaching the last four and getting closer to becoming the first British women's singles finalist since Virginia Wade won the title in 1977. She has enjoyed a successful year, reaching the French Open semi-finals and two WTA finals on clay, before transferring her good form on to grass. Her serve has been the key but against Strycova she won just 51% of her first-serve points. In the previous two rounds she came past 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens and two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in three sets with accomplished displays but against the unseeded Strycova - where the Briton was now favourite - her game fell apart. Her mental strength has often been questioned and it will be once again, with this defeat echoing her Roland Garros semi-final loss to another unseeded Czech, Marketa Vondrousova. Konta, who was bidding to reach a fourth Grand Slam semi-final, denied that the pressure of expectation had got to her and refused to blame tiredness from back-to-back three-set matches. ""I was obviously nervous going into the match. But good nerves, excitement, anticipation,"" she said. ""I wouldn't say that had anything to do with the level that I played or any difficulty. ""I think it was a combination of just not finding my level, and her not giving me the opportunity to find my level more than anything."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller This was a clever, skilful and tactically astute performance by Barbora Strycova. At the age of 33, she seized the opportunity to reach a first Grand Slam semi-final magnificently. Johanna Konta, though, was unable to play with anything like the freedom of earlier rounds. Thirty four unforced errors in two sets tells its own story: Strycova's spins and relative lack of pace threw her out of kilter, but nerves and expectations also seemed to play a part. Konta played brilliantly to win her other Wimbledon quarter-final against Simona Halep two years ago, and also her recent French Open quarter-final with Sloane Stephens. But just as in her Roland Garros semi-final with Marketa Vondrousova, Konta was the favourite here - and unable to play to the level she is capable of.

"Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson go head-to-head for the first time on TV Britain's Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate began at 20:00 BST It is taking place in front of a studio audience of 200 people The winner of the leadership contest and next PM to be revealed on 23 July Emma Harrison and Matt Cannon That's the end of our live coverage from this evening's TV head-to-head. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt clashed on a number of key issues and, when asked, each appeared to struggle to praise their rival. Among some of those key disputes were: Brexit  Would they suspend Parliament?  UK ambassador row  A reminder that Tory members have begun voting, with the winner and next PM to be revealed on 23 July. It will be the first time a sitting prime minister has been chosen by party members. A former Tory MP and private secretary to Mr Hunt has said his man ""landed some really powerful blows"" on his rival. Speaking after the debate, Rob Wilson said: ""I don't think there was a knockout but it came close on a couple of times because clearly Boris wasn't across the detail and relied too often on laughter and bluster which exactly confirmed what Jeremy Hunt has been saying through the campaign."" Mr Wilson added that he thought it was ""too early"" to say who would win the leadership race. This video can not be played Tory leadership TV debate: Johnson v Hunt on Brexit date Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson duked it out on a range of topics tonight. Here is how their answers to questions over the biggest topics - Brexit and the diplomatic row with US President Donald Trump - compared. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Both men went in with a clear idea of what they wanted to get across. Boris Johnson says Brexit has been handled badly up until now by someone who didn't really believe in it. Jeremy Hunt's message is that optimism isn't enough, you need realism too, to get this thing over the line. ITV political editor Robert Peston says it was a ""great debate"" but may not have changed the result. Speaking on ITV's live Twitter broadcast, he said that although it may have swayed some Tory members, most may have already cast their vote. He said: ""Truthfully, I think Boris Johnson's probably won it"". Here's a reminder from one Tory MP - in case you're one of the 160,000 or so who can vote but still haven't had your ballot paper.

Reality Check Mr Johnson tells the TV audience that if the UK leaves with no deal, it will have Â£39bn to spend, ""which would be very helpful in lubricating the consequences of a no-deal Brexit"". The UK has agreed to pay the EU a settlement - widely estimated as Â£39bn - as it leaves. The so-called ""divorce bill"". Not paying the bill would not necessarily be illegal - although it would be open to legal challenge. But it would risk souring relations when it comes to future trade. The EU has said it will not open talks on the future relationship until the agreement over the money has been settled. BBC News Channel Boris Johnson supporter Jason McCartney, who lost his seat in 2017, argues for his man in the so-called ""spin room"" after the debate. On the issue of tax cuts, he insists Mr Johnson ""really understands"" that the government needs to help the less well-off and proved that with some of the things he did as London mayor. Mr McCartney says his candidate is the only one vowing to end the Brexit uncertainty by 31 October - and has the ""can-do attitude"" to achieve it. Sky News presenter tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Despite the many jibes made towards each other, the men shake hands at the end. Maybe there's no hard feelings after all.  Mr Hunt says: ""Boris promised money for the NHS - I delivered it. ""I only keep promises I can keep and our country deserves no less."" That's a thinly veiled reference to the infamous Brexit bus and the Â£350m a week for the NHS promise made by Leave supporters. Mr Johnson says the ""only way to get this country off the hamster wheel of doom"" is to ""get Brexit delivered"", fight crime and get rid of the ""defeatism"".

"Donald Trump has been ""disrespectful"" towards the prime minister and the UK, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. His comments come after President Trump called Sir Kim Darroch, the UK ambassador to the US, ""a very stupid guy"" amid a row over leaked emails. He went on to criticise Theresa May over Brexit, saying she had ignored his advice and gone her ""own foolish way"". On Sunday emails revealed the ambassador had called the Trump administration ""clumsy and inept"". Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox's scheduled meeting with the US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in the US was cancelled on Tuesday. Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? Trump: We won't deal with UK ambassador Trump attack ambassador 'has PM's full support' Mr Hunt responded to Mr Trump's latest outburst by tweeting: ""Friends speak frankly so I will: these comments are disrespectful and wrong to our prime minister and my country."" The Tory leadership hopeful also said he would keep Sir Kim in his post until he retires at Christmas. This video can not be played Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US in a TV debate During a televised debate, Boris Johnson, the current Tory leadership frontrunner, was pushed on whether he would keep the ambassador, but said he ""wouldn't be so presumptuous"" as to think he would be in a position to do that. Mr Johnson said he had ""a good relationship"" with the White House and that it was important to have a ""close partnership"" with the US. Allow Twitter content?

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the row was a reminder of the ""tricky and sensitive"" nature of the UK's relationship with the US and the challenge facing the Tory leadership hopefuls in dealing with a president ""who seems to love stirring up controversy"". ""It's Jeremy Hunt, normally seen as the more cautious of the two, who's speaking much more plainly and directly to Donald Trump on the matter, while Boris Johnson has said only that he's not embarrassed about being close to the White House,"" she said. Following Mr Trump's comments on Monday that the US would ""no longer deal"" with Sir Kim, the US State Department said it would continue ""to deal with any accredited individuals until we get any further guidance from the White House or the president"".

"Donald Trump has been ""disrespectful"" towards the prime minister and the UK, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. His comments come after President Trump called Sir Kim Darroch, the UK ambassador to the US, ""a very stupid guy"" amid a row over leaked emails. He went on to criticise Theresa May over Brexit, saying she had ignored his advice and gone her ""own foolish way"". On Sunday emails revealed the ambassador had called the Trump administration ""clumsy and inept"". Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox's scheduled meeting with the US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in the US was cancelled on Tuesday. Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? Trump: We won't deal with UK ambassador Trump attack ambassador 'has PM's full support' Mr Hunt responded to Mr Trump's latest outburst by tweeting: ""Friends speak frankly so I will: these comments are disrespectful and wrong to our prime minister and my country."" The Tory leadership hopeful also said he would keep Sir Kim in his post until he retires at Christmas. This video can not be played Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US in a TV debate During a televised debate, Boris Johnson, the current Tory leadership frontrunner, was pushed on whether he would keep the ambassador, but said he ""wouldn't be so presumptuous"" as to think he would be in a position to do that. Mr Johnson said he had ""a good relationship"" with the White House and that it was important to have a ""close partnership"" with the US. Allow Twitter content?

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the row was a reminder of the ""tricky and sensitive"" nature of the UK's relationship with the US and the challenge facing the Tory leadership hopefuls in dealing with a president ""who seems to love stirring up controversy"". ""It's Jeremy Hunt, normally seen as the more cautious of the two, who's speaking much more plainly and directly to Donald Trump on the matter, while Boris Johnson has said only that he's not embarrassed about being close to the White House,"" she said. Following Mr Trump's comments on Monday that the US would ""no longer deal"" with Sir Kim, the US State Department said it would continue ""to deal with any accredited individuals until we get any further guidance from the White House or the president"".

"Is the end nigh for babies called Craig and Gemma? Did seeing Craig David on Love Island over the weekend make you think ""that would be a great name for a baby""? If it didn't, turns out you're not alone. The amount of baby Craigs being born has fallen by 96% since 1996. Other names like Gemma, Kirsty and Jordan have all faced similar fates. This is according to analysis of baby naming data compiled between 1996 and 2017 in England and Wales. If you're in your twenties you may well have shared a classroom with boys called Ross, Kieran or Lee - and girls called Danielle, Lauren and Jade. But you won't find many newborn babies with those names - because all six have plummeted in popularity by over 90% since the mid-nineties. Not even Dr Geller could inspire a new generation of Rosses. The names growing fastest in popularity are Jaxon for boys and Aria for girls. Other names, such as Ameerah and Imaan for girls and Dawud and Zayn for boys are also fast-rising, representing the UK's growing Muslim population. TV has had an influence too. Khaleesi has become popular thanks to Game of Thrones,with 76 being born in 2017. There were even 11 newborns named Tyrion. Drogon, Rhaegal and Viserion do not feature on the list of popular baby names. Researchers at Oxford University have analysed 170 years of UK names. They found parents are often keen to seek out unique names, leading to some unusual choices which become more accepted over time. That desire to be individual is partly why different spellings arise too. The report found Abigail spelt as Abbiegayle, Abagael, Abygayle, Abaigael and Abbygael between 1998 and 2013. Oxford's Dr Stephen Bush said inspiration for names comes from many different places. ""We can speculate that the comparatively greater range of media, freedom of movement, and ability to maintain globally distributed social networks increases the number of possible names, but also ensures they may more quickly be perceived as commonplace,"" he said. In good company: Zayn is growing in popularity in the UK Whilst UK parents might face difficult decisions about what to name their children, certain rules do still apply - the name can't contain numbers, swear words or be impossible to pronounce. However, some parents around the world have even less choice than that when it comes to naming their children. In Germany, parents have to have their children's names approved to make sure it is possible to tell a gender from their name. And in Denmark parents have a list of pre-approved names to pick from - though the current list shows over 40,000 so there's plenty of choice. But surely the burning question is... is Craig on there?

"Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson go head-to-head for the first time on TV Britain's Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate began at 20:00 BST It is taking place in front of a studio audience of 200 people The winner of the leadership contest and next PM to be revealed on 23 July Emma Harrison and Matt Cannon That's the end of our live coverage from this evening's TV head-to-head. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt clashed on a number of key issues and, when asked, each appeared to struggle to praise their rival. Among some of those key disputes were: Brexit  Would they suspend Parliament?  UK ambassador row  A reminder that Tory members have begun voting, with the winner and next PM to be revealed on 23 July. It will be the first time a sitting prime minister has been chosen by party members. A former Tory MP and private secretary to Mr Hunt has said his man ""landed some really powerful blows"" on his rival. Speaking after the debate, Rob Wilson said: ""I don't think there was a knockout but it came close on a couple of times because clearly Boris wasn't across the detail and relied too often on laughter and bluster which exactly confirmed what Jeremy Hunt has been saying through the campaign."" Mr Wilson added that he thought it was ""too early"" to say who would win the leadership race. This video can not be played Tory leadership TV debate: Johnson v Hunt on Brexit date Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson duked it out on a range of topics tonight.

Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Both men went in with a clear idea of what they wanted to get across. Boris Johnson says Brexit has been handled badly up until now by someone who didn't really believe in it. Jeremy Hunt's message is that optimism isn't enough, you need realism too, to get this thing over the line. ITV political editor Robert Peston says it was a ""great debate"" but may not have changed the result. Speaking on ITV's live Twitter broadcast, he said that although it may have swayed some Tory members, most may have already cast their vote. He said: ""Truthfully, I think Boris Johnson's probably won it"". Here's a reminder from one Tory MP - in case you're one of the 160,000 or so who can vote but still haven't had your ballot paper.

Reality Check Mr Johnson tells the TV audience that if the UK leaves with no deal, it will have Â£39bn to spend, ""which would be very helpful in lubricating the consequences of a no-deal Brexit"". The UK has agreed to pay the EU a settlement - widely estimated as Â£39bn - as it leaves. The so-called ""divorce bill"". Not paying the bill would not necessarily be illegal - although it would be open to legal challenge. But it would risk souring relations when it comes to future trade. The EU has said it will not open talks on the future relationship until the agreement over the money has been settled. BBC News Channel Boris Johnson supporter Jason McCartney, who lost his seat in 2017, argues for his man in the so-called ""spin room"" after the debate. On the issue of tax cuts, he insists Mr Johnson ""really understands"" that the government needs to help the less well-off and proved that with some of the things he did as London mayor. Mr McCartney says his candidate is the only one vowing to end the Brexit uncertainty by 31 October - and has the ""can-do attitude"" to achieve it. Sky News presenter tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Despite the many jibes made towards each other, the men shake hands at the end. Maybe there's no hard feelings after all.  Mr Hunt says: ""Boris promised money for the NHS - I delivered it. ""I only keep promises I can keep and our country deserves no less."" That's a thinly veiled reference to the infamous Brexit bus and the Â£350m a week for the NHS promise made by Leave supporters. Mr Johnson says the ""only way to get this country off the hamster wheel of doom"" is to ""get Brexit delivered"", fight crime and get rid of the ""defeatism"". He says he has ""the energy and credentials for the job"". And with that the debate is over and the two men shake hands as the credits roll. Â© 2025 BBC.

Reality Check Mr Johnson tells the TV audience that if the UK leaves with no deal, it will have Â£39bn to spend, ""which would be very helpful in lubricating the consequences of a no-deal Brexit"". The UK has agreed to pay the EU a settlement - widely estimated as Â£39bn - as it leaves. The so-called ""divorce bill"". Not paying the bill would not necessarily be illegal - although it would be open to legal challenge. But it would risk souring relations when it comes to future trade. The EU has said it will not open talks on the future relationship until the agreement over the money has been settled. BBC News Channel Boris Johnson supporter Jason McCartney, who lost his seat in 2017, argues for his man in the so-called ""spin room"" after the debate. On the issue of tax cuts, he insists Mr Johnson ""really understands"" that the government needs to help the less well-off and proved that with some of the things he did as London mayor. Mr McCartney says his candidate is the only one vowing to end the Brexit uncertainty by 31 October - and has the ""can-do attitude"" to achieve it. Sky News presenter tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Despite the many jibes made towards each other, the men shake hands at the end. Maybe there's no hard feelings after all.  Mr Hunt says: ""Boris promised money for the NHS - I delivered it. ""I only keep promises I can keep and our country deserves no less."" That's a thinly veiled reference to the infamous Brexit bus and the Â£350m a week for the NHS promise made by Leave supporters. Mr Johnson says the ""only way to get this country off the hamster wheel of doom"" is to ""get Brexit delivered"", fight crime and get rid of the ""defeatism"". He says he has ""the energy and credentials for the job"". And with that the debate is over and the two men shake hands as the credits roll. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The pound is heading for two-year lows against the dollar as markets react to continuing Brexit uncertainty and signs that the UK economy is slowing. The currency fell sharply after data showed slowing sales at UK retailers and economists forecast a contraction in the economy in the second quarter. Against the dollar, the pound fell below $1.25 and was close to its lowest level since April 2017. The pound was also at a six-month low against the euro at just above â¬1.11. With the holiday season getting underway, it means travellers from the UK will getting fewer dollars and euros for their pounds. Sterling has been swayed by uncertainty in the aftermath of the EU referendum, but has been more stable in recent months because of confidence about the UK economy. However, recent economic surveys have suggested that the economy may now be weakening and Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank, said this was being factored into the market. ""The economic picture is not particularly pretty,"" she said. The pound fell 0.5% against the dollar at $1.2455, marking the lowest point for it since April 2017, excluding a brief ""flash fall"" in January this year. Back in May, the pound had been trading at around $1.27. Last week, a survey suggested the UK's manufacturing sector contracted at the fastest pace for more than six years. On Tuesday, figures from the British Retail Consortium showed average sales growth slowed to 0.6% in the 12 months to June, the weakest reading since its records began in 1995. Ms Foley also citeda survey by Bloomberg,externalwhich showed that economists are expecting the economy to contract in the second quarter - for the first time since 2012. Pre-order cash on the internet Use specialist cards with low fees to take money abroad Avoid buying cash at the airport Shop around for the best rate Find out fees on cash machine withdrawals overseas An update on the UK economy is due on Wednesday when growth data for the three-month period to May will be released, and economists polled by Reuters expect growth of 0.1%. That wouldbe slower than the 0.5% rate seen in the first quarter of the year. The market is also focusing on the Conservative leadership contest.  Under Theresa May's premiership, the market had thought the chances of a no-deal were slim, but Ms Foley said that was not the expectation if Boris Johnson wins the leadership battle. ""That's what the market is worried about,"" she said. Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said that another factor at play was a strengthening in the dollar ahead of testimony by the head of the US central bank. This was helping to push the pound lower. Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, testifies to the US Congress on Wednesday. Mr Mellor said he could provide a more hawkish tone - meaning interest rate cuts were less likely - than previously expected. Can no-deal Brexit be stopped?

"This video can not be played Strycova stuns Konta to reach last four - highlights Wimbledon 2019 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:1-14 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app.Full details Johanna Konta failed in her bid to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals after an error-strewn display in a straight-set defeat by Czech Barbora Strycova. The British number one started strongly, racing to a 4-1 lead, before collapsing to lose 7-6 (7-5) 6-1. Let down by her previously dominant serve, Konta could not find a way back as - like in June's French Open semis - she crumbled when expectation was high. ""I did my best, and my best today wasn't good enough,"" Konta, 28, said. ""Every decision I made, every thought process, every opportunity I gave myself, I have no regrets in doing."" Strycova, who has reached her maiden Grand Slam singles semi-final just days after saying this could be her last Wimbledon, will face 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams next. ""I think this was one of the best matches I have played,"" the 33-year-old said. 'I don't think you need to pick on me' - Konta responds to 'harsh' questions about defeat In pictures - Lionesses enjoy day out at Wimbledon Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Konta came into the match boasting an incredible record of having lost just three of her 47 service games at these championships. Despite the fact she got an early break, the warning signs that her biggest weapon might not be firing properly were there in the opening game when she had to save a break point. The errors began to creep in at 4-2 when she sent two forehands wide and wild backhand long to allow Strycova to get the break back. It became a theme as Konta went on to produce 22 unforced errors in that opening set, with the Czech increasing in confidence as she gave Konta a lesson in effective drop shots to take it to a tie-break. There Konta could not find a rhythm, sending a forehand into the net to hand the set to the world number world number 54. Konta is well versed in losing opening sets and winning in a third - with a record of 13 wins from 15 three-setters this year - but this time an early break in the second put a comeback out of reach. The game was up for the Briton when she went long with a backhand - summing up everything that was wrong with this performance. ""I couldn't quite find the level that I needed to make it difficult and challenging for the kind of player she is,"" said Konta, who had lost to Strycova in 2017 in Tokyo in their only other meeting. ""She's a very difficult player to play on this surface, and in general. She's a very good player. It's just unfortunate I couldn't quite find the level needed to come through."" This video can not be played Konta reacts to a journalist's 'patronising' question after her defeat by Strycova Konta had been hoping to emulate her 2017 feat of reaching the last four and getting closer to becoming the first British women's singles finalist since Virginia Wade won the title in 1977. She has enjoyed a successful year, reaching the French Open semi-finals and two WTA finals on clay, before transferring her good form on to grass. Her serve has been the key but against Strycova she won just 51% of her first-serve points. In the previous two rounds she came past 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens and two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in three sets with accomplished displays but against the unseeded Strycova - where the Briton was now favourite - her game fell apart. Her mental strength has often been questioned and it will be once again, with this defeat echoing her Roland Garros semi-final loss to another unseeded Czech, Marketa Vondrousova. Konta, who was bidding to reach a fourth Grand Slam semi-final, denied that the pressure of expectation had got to her and refused to blame tiredness from back-to-back three-set matches. ""I was obviously nervous going into the match. But good nerves, excitement, anticipation,"" she said. ""I wouldn't say that had anything to do with the level that I played or any difficulty. ""I think it was a combination of just not finding my level, and her not giving me the opportunity to find my level more than anything."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller This was a clever, skilful and tactically astute performance by Barbora Strycova. At the age of 33, she seized the opportunity to reach a first Grand Slam semi-final magnificently. Johanna Konta, though, was unable to play with anything like the freedom of earlier rounds. Thirty four unforced errors in two sets tells its own story: Strycova's spins and relative lack of pace threw her out of kilter, but nerves and expectations also seemed to play a part. Konta played brilliantly to win her other Wimbledon quarter-final against Simona Halep two years ago, and also her recent French Open quarter-final with Sloane Stephens. But just as in her Roland Garros semi-final with Marketa Vondrousova, Konta was the favourite here - and unable to play to the level she is capable of.

"Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson go head-to-head for the first time on TV Britain's Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate began at 20:00 BST It is taking place in front of a studio audience of 200 people The winner of the leadership contest and next PM to be revealed on 23 July Emma Harrison and Matt Cannon That's the end of our live coverage from this evening's TV head-to-head. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt clashed on a number of key issues and, when asked, each appeared to struggle to praise their rival. Among some of those key disputes were: Brexit  Would they suspend Parliament?  UK ambassador row  A reminder that Tory members have begun voting, with the winner and next PM to be revealed on 23 July. It will be the first time a sitting prime minister has been chosen by party members. A former Tory MP and private secretary to Mr Hunt has said his man ""landed some really powerful blows"" on his rival. Speaking after the debate, Rob Wilson said: ""I don't think there was a knockout but it came close on a couple of times because clearly Boris wasn't across the detail and relied too often on laughter and bluster which exactly confirmed what Jeremy Hunt has been saying through the campaign."" Mr Wilson added that he thought it was ""too early"" to say who would win the leadership race. This video can not be played Tory leadership TV debate: Johnson v Hunt on Brexit date Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson duked it out on a range of topics tonight. Here is how their answers to questions over the biggest topics - Brexit and the diplomatic row with US President Donald Trump - compared. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Both men went in with a clear idea of what they wanted to get across. Boris Johnson says Brexit has been handled badly up until now by someone who didn't really believe in it. Jeremy Hunt's message is that optimism isn't enough, you need realism too, to get this thing over the line. ITV political editor Robert Peston says it was a ""great debate"" but may not have changed the result. Speaking on ITV's live Twitter broadcast, he said that although it may have swayed some Tory members, most may have already cast their vote. He said: ""Truthfully, I think Boris Johnson's probably won it"". Here's a reminder from one Tory MP - in case you're one of the 160,000 or so who can vote but still haven't had your ballot paper.

"Donald Trump has been ""disrespectful"" towards the prime minister and the UK, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. His comments come after President Trump called Sir Kim Darroch, the UK ambassador to the US, ""a very stupid guy"" amid a row over leaked emails. He went on to criticise Theresa May over Brexit, saying she had ignored his advice and gone her ""own foolish way"". On Sunday emails revealed the ambassador had called the Trump administration ""clumsy and inept"". Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox's scheduled meeting with the US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in the US was cancelled on Tuesday. Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? Trump: We won't deal with UK ambassador Trump attack ambassador 'has PM's full support' Mr Hunt responded to Mr Trump's latest outburst by tweeting: ""Friends speak frankly so I will: these comments are disrespectful and wrong to our prime minister and my country."" The Tory leadership hopeful also said he would keep Sir Kim in his post until he retires at Christmas. This video can not be played Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US in a TV debate During a televised debate, Boris Johnson, the current Tory leadership frontrunner, was pushed on whether he would keep the ambassador, but said he ""wouldn't be so presumptuous"" as to think he would be in a position to do that. Mr Johnson said he had ""a good relationship"" with the White House and that it was important to have a ""close partnership"" with the US. Allow Twitter content?

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the row was a reminder of the ""tricky and sensitive"" nature of the UK's relationship with the US and the challenge facing the Tory leadership hopefuls in dealing with a president ""who seems to love stirring up controversy"". ""It's Jeremy Hunt, normally seen as the more cautious of the two, who's speaking much more plainly and directly to Donald Trump on the matter, while Boris Johnson has said only that he's not embarrassed about being close to the White House,"" she said. Following Mr Trump's comments on Monday that the US would ""no longer deal"" with Sir Kim, the US State Department said it would continue ""to deal with any accredited individuals until we get any further guidance from the White House or the president"". ""We have an incredibly special and strategic relationship with the United Kingdom that has gone on for quite a long time - it's bigger than any individual or government,"" the department added. Earlier, Downing Street reaffirmed its ""full support"" for Sir Kim. A spokesman for Theresa May said that Sir Kim is ""a dutiful, respected government official"" and confirmed there were no plans for Mrs May and Mr Trump to hold a call to discuss relations following the leak. Number 10 also confirmed that Sir Kim would not be attending a meeting between Ivanka Trump and the International Trade Secretary Liam Fox in Washington. The spokesman said: ""He isn't attending that meeting but he is supporting Liam Fox in other ways on his trip."" Earlier on Tuesday Mr Trump tweeted: ""The wacky Ambassador that the U.K. foisted upon the United States is not someone we are thrilled with, a very stupid guy. ""He should speak to his country, and Prime Minister May, about their failed Brexit negotiation, and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was handled. ""I told @theresa_may how to do that deal, but she went her own foolish way-was unable to get it done. A disaster! ""I don't know the Ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool. Tell him the USA now has the best Economy & Military anywhere in the World, by far...and they are both only getting bigger, better and stronger...Thank you, Mr. President!"" Allow Twitter content?

Number 10 previously called the leak,reported in the Mail on Sunday,external, ""unfortunate"" andhas begun a formal investigation. It said the UK and US still shared a ""special and enduring"" relationship. Confidential emails from the UK's ambassador contained a string of criticisms of Mr Trump and his administration, and said the White House was ""uniquely dysfunctional"" and divided under his presidency. Sir Kim, who became ambassador to the US in January 2016 about a year before Mr Trump took office, also questioned whether the White House ""will ever look competent"" but also warned that the US president should not be written off. The emails, dating from 2017, said rumours of ""infighting and chaos"" in the White House were mostly true and policy on sensitive issues such as Iran was ""incoherent, chaotic"".

"Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson go head-to-head for the first time on TV Britain's Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate began at 20:00 BST It is taking place in front of a studio audience of 200 people The winner of the leadership contest and next PM to be revealed on 23 July Emma Harrison and Matt Cannon That's the end of our live coverage from this evening's TV head-to-head. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt clashed on a number of key issues and, when asked, each appeared to struggle to praise their rival. Among some of those key disputes were: Brexit  Would they suspend Parliament?  UK ambassador row  A reminder that Tory members have begun voting, with the winner and next PM to be revealed on 23 July. It will be the first time a sitting prime minister has been chosen by party members. A former Tory MP and private secretary to Mr Hunt has said his man ""landed some really powerful blows"" on his rival. Speaking after the debate, Rob Wilson said: ""I don't think there was a knockout but it came close on a couple of times because clearly Boris wasn't across the detail and relied too often on laughter and bluster which exactly confirmed what Jeremy Hunt has been saying through the campaign."" Mr Wilson added that he thought it was ""too early"" to say who would win the leadership race. This video can not be played Tory leadership TV debate: Johnson v Hunt on Brexit date Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson duked it out on a range of topics tonight. Here is how their answers to questions over the biggest topics - Brexit and the diplomatic row with US President Donald Trump - compared. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Both men went in with a clear idea of what they wanted to get across. Boris Johnson says Brexit has been handled badly up until now by someone who didn't really believe in it. Jeremy Hunt's message is that optimism isn't enough, you need realism too, to get this thing over the line. ITV political editor Robert Peston says it was a ""great debate"" but may not have changed the result. Speaking on ITV's live Twitter broadcast, he said that although it may have swayed some Tory members, most may have already cast their vote. He said: ""Truthfully, I think Boris Johnson's probably won it"". Here's a reminder from one Tory MP - in case you're one of the 160,000 or so who can vote but still haven't had your ballot paper.

"The pound is heading for two-year lows against the dollar as markets react to continuing Brexit uncertainty and signs that the UK economy is slowing. The currency fell sharply after data showed slowing sales at UK retailers and economists forecast a contraction in the economy in the second quarter. Against the dollar, the pound fell below $1.25 and was close to its lowest level since April 2017. The pound was also at a six-month low against the euro at just above â¬1.11. With the holiday season getting underway, it means travellers from the UK will getting fewer dollars and euros for their pounds. Sterling has been swayed by uncertainty in the aftermath of the EU referendum, but has been more stable in recent months because of confidence about the UK economy. However, recent economic surveys have suggested that the economy may now be weakening and Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank, said this was being factored into the market. ""The economic picture is not particularly pretty,"" she said. The pound fell 0.5% against the dollar at $1.2455, marking the lowest point for it since April 2017, excluding a brief ""flash fall"" in January this year. Back in May, the pound had been trading at around $1.27. Last week, a survey suggested the UK's manufacturing sector contracted at the fastest pace for more than six years. On Tuesday, figures from the British Retail Consortium showed average sales growth slowed to 0.6% in the 12 months to June, the weakest reading since its records began in 1995. Ms Foley also citeda survey by Bloomberg,externalwhich showed that economists are expecting the economy to contract in the second quarter - for the first time since 2012. Pre-order cash on the internet Use specialist cards with low fees to take money abroad Avoid buying cash at the airport Shop around for the best rate Find out fees on cash machine withdrawals overseas An update on the UK economy is due on Wednesday when growth data for the three-month period to May will be released, and economists polled by Reuters expect growth of 0.1%. That wouldbe slower than the 0.5% rate seen in the first quarter of the year. The market is also focusing on the Conservative leadership contest.  Under Theresa May's premiership, the market had thought the chances of a no-deal were slim, but Ms Foley said that was not the expectation if Boris Johnson wins the leadership battle. ""That's what the market is worried about,"" she said. Neil Mellor, currency strategist at Bank of New York Mellon, said that another factor at play was a strengthening in the dollar ahead of testimony by the head of the US central bank. This was helping to push the pound lower. Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, testifies to the US Congress on Wednesday. Mr Mellor said he could provide a more hawkish tone - meaning interest rate cuts were less likely - than previously expected. Can no-deal Brexit be stopped?

"This video can not be played Strycova stuns Konta to reach last four - highlights Wimbledon 2019 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:1-14 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app.Full details Johanna Konta failed in her bid to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals after an error-strewn display in a straight-set defeat by Czech Barbora Strycova. The British number one started strongly, racing to a 4-1 lead, before collapsing to lose 7-6 (7-5) 6-1. Let down by her previously dominant serve, Konta could not find a way back as - like in June's French Open semis - she crumbled when expectation was high. ""I did my best, and my best today wasn't good enough,"" Konta, 28, said. ""Every decision I made, every thought process, every opportunity I gave myself, I have no regrets in doing."" Strycova, who has reached her maiden Grand Slam singles semi-final just days after saying this could be her last Wimbledon, will face 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams next. ""I think this was one of the best matches I have played,"" the 33-year-old said. 'I don't think you need to pick on me' - Konta responds to 'harsh' questions about defeat In pictures - Lionesses enjoy day out at Wimbledon Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Konta came into the match boasting an incredible record of having lost just three of her 47 service games at these championships. Despite the fact she got an early break, the warning signs that her biggest weapon might not be firing properly were there in the opening game when she had to save a break point. The errors began to creep in at 4-2 when she sent two forehands wide and wild backhand long to allow Strycova to get the break back. It became a theme as Konta went on to produce 22 unforced errors in that opening set, with the Czech increasing in confidence as she gave Konta a lesson in effective drop shots to take it to a tie-break. There Konta could not find a rhythm, sending a forehand into the net to hand the set to the world number world number 54. Konta is well versed in losing opening sets and winning in a third - with a record of 13 wins from 15 three-setters this year - but this time an early break in the second put a comeback out of reach. The game was up for the Briton when she went long with a backhand - summing up everything that was wrong with this performance. ""I couldn't quite find the level that I needed to make it difficult and challenging for the kind of player she is,"" said Konta, who had lost to Strycova in 2017 in Tokyo in their only other meeting. ""She's a very difficult player to play on this surface, and in general. She's a very good player. It's just unfortunate I couldn't quite find the level needed to come through."" This video can not be played Konta reacts to a journalist's 'patronising' question after her defeat by Strycova Konta had been hoping to emulate her 2017 feat of reaching the last four and getting closer to becoming the first British women's singles finalist since Virginia Wade won the title in 1977. She has enjoyed a successful year, reaching the French Open semi-finals and two WTA finals on clay, before transferring her good form on to grass. Her serve has been the key but against Strycova she won just 51% of her first-serve points. In the previous two rounds she came past 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens and two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in three sets with accomplished displays but against the unseeded Strycova - where the Briton was now favourite - her game fell apart. Her mental strength has often been questioned and it will be once again, with this defeat echoing her Roland Garros semi-final loss to another unseeded Czech, Marketa Vondrousova. Konta, who was bidding to reach a fourth Grand Slam semi-final, denied that the pressure of expectation had got to her and refused to blame tiredness from back-to-back three-set matches. ""I was obviously nervous going into the match. But good nerves, excitement, anticipation,"" she said. ""I wouldn't say that had anything to do with the level that I played or any difficulty. ""I think it was a combination of just not finding my level, and her not giving me the opportunity to find my level more than anything."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller This was a clever, skilful and tactically astute performance by Barbora Strycova. At the age of 33, she seized the opportunity to reach a first Grand Slam semi-final magnificently. Johanna Konta, though, was unable to play with anything like the freedom of earlier rounds. Thirty four unforced errors in two sets tells its own story: Strycova's spins and relative lack of pace threw her out of kilter, but nerves and expectations also seemed to play a part. Konta played brilliantly to win her other Wimbledon quarter-final against Simona Halep two years ago, and also her recent French Open quarter-final with Sloane Stephens. But just as in her Roland Garros semi-final with Marketa Vondrousova, Konta was the favourite here - and unable to play to the level she is capable of.

"Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson go head-to-head for the first time on TV Britain's Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate began at 20:00 BST It is taking place in front of a studio audience of 200 people The winner of the leadership contest and next PM to be revealed on 23 July Emma Harrison and Matt Cannon That's the end of our live coverage from this evening's TV head-to-head. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt clashed on a number of key issues and, when asked, each appeared to struggle to praise their rival. Among some of those key disputes were: Brexit  Would they suspend Parliament?  UK ambassador row  A reminder that Tory members have begun voting, with the winner and next PM to be revealed on 23 July. It will be the first time a sitting prime minister has been chosen by party members. A former Tory MP and private secretary to Mr Hunt has said his man ""landed some really powerful blows"" on his rival. Speaking after the debate, Rob Wilson said: ""I don't think there was a knockout but it came close on a couple of times because clearly Boris wasn't across the detail and relied too often on laughter and bluster which exactly confirmed what Jeremy Hunt has been saying through the campaign."" Mr Wilson added that he thought it was ""too early"" to say who would win the leadership race. This video can not be played Tory leadership TV debate: Johnson v Hunt on Brexit date Mr Hunt and Mr Johnson duked it out on a range of topics tonight. Here is how their answers to questions over the biggest topics - Brexit and the diplomatic row with US President Donald Trump - compared. Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent Both men went in with a clear idea of what they wanted to get across. Boris Johnson says Brexit has been handled badly up until now by someone who didn't really believe in it. Jeremy Hunt's message is that optimism isn't enough, you need realism too, to get this thing over the line. ITV political editor Robert Peston says it was a ""great debate"" but may not have changed the result. Speaking on ITV's live Twitter broadcast, he said that although it may have swayed some Tory members, most may have already cast their vote. He said: ""Truthfully, I think Boris Johnson's probably won it"". Here's a reminder from one Tory MP - in case you're one of the 160,000 or so who can vote but still haven't had your ballot paper.

Reality Check Mr Johnson tells the TV audience that if the UK leaves with no deal, it will have Â£39bn to spend, ""which would be very helpful in lubricating the consequences of a no-deal Brexit"". The UK has agreed to pay the EU a settlement - widely estimated as Â£39bn - as it leaves. The so-called ""divorce bill"". Not paying the bill would not necessarily be illegal - although it would be open to legal challenge. But it would risk souring relations when it comes to future trade. The EU has said it will not open talks on the future relationship until the agreement over the money has been settled. BBC News Channel Boris Johnson supporter Jason McCartney, who lost his seat in 2017, argues for his man in the so-called ""spin room"" after the debate. On the issue of tax cuts, he insists Mr Johnson ""really understands"" that the government needs to help the less well-off and proved that with some of the things he did as London mayor. Mr McCartney says his candidate is the only one vowing to end the Brexit uncertainty by 31 October - and has the ""can-do attitude"" to achieve it. Sky News presenter tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Despite the many jibes made towards each other, the men shake hands at the end. Maybe there's no hard feelings after all.  Mr Hunt says: ""Boris promised money for the NHS - I delivered it. ""I only keep promises I can keep and our country deserves no less."" That's a thinly veiled reference to the infamous Brexit bus and the Â£350m a week for the NHS promise made by Leave supporters.

"This video can not be played Corbyn: 'We will give people a choice' Jeremy Corbyn has challenged the next Tory leader to hold another referendum before taking Britain out of the EU, saying Labour will campaign for Remain. Mr Corbyn says the party will take this position to stop ""no deal or a damaging Tory Brexit"". But he does not say what he would do if he won a general election and was placed in charge of the Brexit process. Some senior members of his team want him to take a pro-Remain stance in all circumstances. In an interview with the BBC's John Pienaar, Mr Corbyn saidLabour was now the ""party of choice"" when it came to Brexit. He said he had done ""what I think a leader should do... an awful lot of listening"" - to party members, unions and the wider Labour movement - before coming to a revised position. He said he would ""make a case"" to Parliament in September to get another referendum and in the meantime, Labour will ""do everything we can to take no deal off the table or stop a damaging deal of the sort Hunt or Johnson propose"". Labour's long and winding road to another referendum Asked if he had changed his position because of pressure from colleagues, Mr Corbyn said: ""Not a bit of it. I've been listening and I've enjoyed it."" Mr Corbyn said he could not say what Labour's position would be at a general election, but would decide it ""very quickly"", depending on the circumstances at the time, whenever one was called. In a letter to members, he said Labour continued to believe the ""compromise plan"" set out for Brexit during cross-party talks with the government earlier this year was a ""sensible alternative that could bring the country together"". This included a customs union, a strong single market relationship and the protection of environmental regulations and rights at work. Can the next PM force through a no-deal Brexit? What is 'no deal'? How could another Brexit referendum work? Mr Corbyn's statement followed a shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, and a meeting with trade union leaders on Monday. The bosses of Labour's five-biggest affiliated unions called for the move the party has made - but also for it to hold a ""confirmatory vote"" on any new deal it negotiated if Labour won a general election. The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said there was disagreement about the second part of the unions' stance in shadow cabinet, with deputy leader Tom Watson wanting a ""straight Remain stance"", meaning a decision on it was ""kicked down the road"". The deputy leader is among leading figures who have argued that confusion over Labour's message on Brexit contributed to its poor performance in the recent European Parliament elections. Mr Watson said he was ""happy"" with the new Brexit position ""up to the election"", but the party had ""yet to cross that bridge"" when it comes to its manifesto for the next election. ""Our members have been telling us for some time now that they want us to be a Remain party and that they want us to put the new deal to the people,"" he added. ""We're now going to campaign for that and I'm very proud that the shadow cabinet have now listened to their concerns."" Unions agree Brexit vote stance Labour must 'get on with' changing Brexit policy Don't panic over Brexit, McCluskey tells Labour Shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis said if a snap election was called, Labour would try to renegotiate the Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May, despite saying it ""very much looks like"" Labour is now the party of Remain. He told the BBC's Politics Live: ""If we win that general election, we will come into power, and if we can renegotiate that deal - a Labour deal - we will, because that's what people asked for."" Some Labour MPs, including Brexit-backing John Mann and Emma Lewell-Buck, said the party could lose votes in Leave-supporting areas as a result of the policy. Ms Lewell-Buck, who quit her shadow minister rolein opposition to a further referendum, said she was ""concerned"" and had a ""heavy heart"" over the decision. ""But I am also very clear that I am representing my constituents and I will continue to do that no matter what because they are the people who put me where I am,"" she said. By Nick Eardley, BBC political correspondent There's always a ""but"", it seems, when it comes to Labour and Brexit. What the party is saying explicitly is that it'll try to force the new PM to hold another referendum and if that happens it will back Remain. But we don't know what Labour would do in the event of a general election. The feeling among some Labour people is, ""If you think it was hard to get here, trying to come to a manifesto position is going to be even harder,"" so they're just not going there yet. Sometimes it feels Labour has been dragged kicking and screaming towards positions on Brexit, but it has at least got to a new one today. The question is whether it'll have to go further at some point. Some on the Remain wing will be delighted with Jeremy Corbyn's shift, but others will feel there's more to do. Former Labour MP Chris Leslie - who left the party to found Remain-backing Change UK - said Mr Corbyn's stance had ""confirmed that if you vote Labour, you'll get Brexit"". He said the position ""wasn't good enough"", adding: ""Brexit - whether a Labour Brexit or a Conservative Brexit - will cost people's jobs, put businesses in jeopardy, and diminish Britain in the eyes of our neighbours. ""Corbyn's refusal to be honest about that fact is a deep betrayal of the people Labour used to represent."" The Liberal Democrat's Brexit spokesperson, Tom Brake, said Labour ""are still a party of Brexit"". He added: ""Jeremy Corbyn can pretend all he likes that the Labour Party are finally moving towards backing the Liberal Democrat policy of a People's Vote, but it is clear it is still his intention to negotiate a damaging Brexit deal if he gets the keys to No 10."" But Miriam Mirwitch, chair of Young Labour, welcomed the move, adding: ""This vital shift shows that Labour is a party centred around democracy that has listened to what it's members have wanted for some time: a People's Vote in which Labour campaigns to Remain."" June 2017- Labour's general election manifesto accepts referendum result 28 September 2018- Labour agrees if a general election cannot be achieved it ""must support all optionsâ¦ including campaigning for a public vote"" November 2018- Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says Labour will ""inevitably"" back a second referendum if unable to secure general election 16 January 2019- 71 Labour MPs say they support a public vote 6 February 2019- Mr Corbyn writes a letter to Mrs May seeking five changes to her Brexit policy with no mention of a ""People's Vote"" 25 February 2019- Labour says it will back a public vote if its proposed Brexit deal is rejected 14 March 2019- Labour orders its MPs to abstain on an amendment calling for a second referendum 27 March 2019- The party instructs its MPs to support Margaret Beckett's amendment which calls for a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal 30 April 2019- NEC agrees that the European election manifesto will commit to a further referendum under certain circumstances 9 July 2019- Labour calls on the next PM to hold a referendum and pledges to campaign for Remain against ""no deal or a damaging Tory Brexit"" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Lord Turnberg, Lord Triesman and Lord Darzi have resigned the Labour whip Three peers have left the Labour group in the Lords, accusing the party of anti-Semitism, Newsnight has learned. Lord Triesman, general secretary between 2001 and 2004, accused Jeremy Corbyn of anti-Semitism and said the party was no longer ""a safe environment"" for Jewish people. Lord Darzi, meanwhile, will sit as an independent and Lord Turnberg said he feared ""for the future"" of the party. Labour said it ""completely rejects these false and offensive claims"". ""The Labour Party at all levels is implacably opposed to anti-Semitism and is determined to root out this social cancer from our movement and society,""  a party spokeswoman said. Former Health Minister Lord Darzi said that as an Armenian descendant of a ""survivor of the Armenian genocide"", he had ""zero tolerance to anti-Semitism,"" adding that his decision to resign the whip ""has not been lightly taken"". Former president of the Royal College of Physicians Lord Turnberg told BBC Newsnight that his differences ""lie with the party leadership and machine and not with my very supportive colleagues in the Lords who share my values"". ""It is not just the policies on foreign affairs... and Brexit vacillation and bypassing parliamentary opinion but the overt anti-Semitism that permeates the party machine that is no longer possible for me to tolerate,"" he said. Labour said it was taking ""decisive action against anti-Semitism"" and had doubled the number of staff dedicated to dealing with complaints and cases. ""Our records show that anti-Semitism cases that have gone through the stages of our disciplinary procedures since September 2015 account for about 0.06% of the party's membership,"" the spokeswoman said. ""This represents a tiny minority - but one anti-Semite is one too many and we will continue to act against this repugnant form of racism."" But, in his resignation letter to Labour's leader in the House of Lords, Baroness Smith, Lord Triesman said Mr Corbyn ""and his circle are anti-Semitic, having never once made the right judgement call about an issue reflecting deep prejudice"". ""My sad conclusion is that the Labour party is very plainly institutionally anti-Semitic,"" he wrote. Anti-Semites were ""shielded"", while ""serious party members are thrown out unceremoniously"", he said. ""The experience of life in the party has become sickening."" The remarks represent the strongest personal attack on the Labour leader from within the party since Margaret Hodge reportedly called Mr Corbyn an anti-Semitic racist last year. A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims Gordon Brown: Automatically expel anti-Semites in Labour Labour must 'act more quickly' on anti-Semitism Lord Triesman told Newsnight the party had been ""a central plank of my political life for over 50 years"". But it had now ""slipped into the familiar gutter of so many of the hard left"". ""It is a painful decision,"" the former trade union leader told Newsnight. ""I remain completely aligned to the values I've had over all these years but I can no longer take direction from a leadership that is institutionally anti-Semitic."" Lord Triesman wrote: ""I always said it was worth hanging on to fight so long as there was a prospect of winning. ""I now don't believe with this leadership there is."" He said hoping ""something will turn up to change it all"" was a ""unicorn delusion"". The resignations came as Labour's disputes panel met to discuss the suspension of MP Chris Williamson. Mr Williamsonwas suspendedearlier this year after saying Labour had ""given too much ground"" over anti-Semitism. In February,nine MPs quit Labour, some citing the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism as their reason for leaving. Luciana Berger said she had come to the ""sickening conclusion"" the party had become institutionally anti-Semitic and she was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" to stay. Joan Ryanclaimed Labour's leadership had allowed ""Jews to be abused with impunity"". AndIan Austin said Jeremy Corbyn was ""incapable""of dealing with anti-Semitism. In his letter, Lord Triesman also cited Labour's policy position on Brexit, which he said had ""encouraged xenophobia"", and on defence and Nato, which he called ""worse than ambiguous"".

"The 3,000-year-old, brown quartzite head of Tutankhamun was part of a statue of the God Amun Egypt says it will instruct a law firm in the UK to file a civil suit over the sale last week of a Tutankhamun bust. The sculpture of the pharaoh was bought for Â£4.7m ($6m) at Christie's auction house in London, despite Egypt warning it was probably stolen in the 1970s. Antiquities Minister Khaled al-Enany told the BBC that he would try to repatriate the artefact. Christie's said all necessary checks were made over the bust's provenance, and that its sale was legal and valid. It stated that Germany's Prince Wilhelm von Thurn und Taxis reputedly had it in his collection by the 1960s, and that it was acquired by an Austrian dealer in 1973-4. Tutankhamun tomb restoration completed King Tut secret chamber theory dismissed 'Eight accused' over King Tut's botched beard job The 3,000-year-old, brown quartzite bust was part of a statue of the God Amun,external, the most important deity of the New Kingdom, according to Christie's. The auction house said the facial features were the same as those of the young pharaoh, who ruled between 1333 and 1323BC. Similar representations of Amun, also with Tutankhamun's facial features, were carved for the Temple of Karnak in the city of Thebes (modern-day Luxor), it added. Before Thursday's auction, at which 32 other Egyptian artefacts were also sold, Christie's said the bust had been ""well published and exhibited in the last 30 years"", and that it had established the recent ownership. Butthe Egyptian embassy in London complained to the UK Foreign Office,externalthat the sale was ""inconsistent with relevant international treaties and conventions"". Egypt's former antiquities chief, Zahi Hawass, said the bust appeared to have been ""stolen"" in the 1970s from the Temple of Karnak. ""The owners have given false information,"" he told AFP news agency. ""They have not shown any legal papers to prove its ownership."" On Monday night, the Egyptian National Committee for Antiquities Repatriation (NCAR) expressed its ""deep discontent of the unprofessional way in which the Egyptian artefacts were sold without the provision of the ownership documents and proof that that the artefacts left Egypt in a legitimate manner"". ""The NCAR also expressed deep bewilderment that the British authorities failed to provide the support expected from it in this regard,"" a statement said. Egypt's government had called for the auction to be cancelled The committee announced that it had decided to instruct a British law firm to file a civil lawsuit over the sale of bust, and that it would also ask Interpol to issue a circular to ""track down the illegal sale of Egyptian artefacts worldwide"". ""They left us with no other option but to go to court to restore our smuggled antiquities,"" Mr Enany told the BBC. ""We will leave no stone unturned until we repatriate the Tutankhamun bust and the other 32 pieces sold by Christie's. This is human heritage that should be on public display in its country of origin."" The BBC understands that a number of Egyptian businessmen and civil society groups have pledged to fund the lawsuit. The UK has also been asked to prevent the export of Egyptian artefacts before Egyptian authorities have checked ownership documents, Egyptian sources say. Christie's reiterated on Tuesday that it had ""clearly carried out extensive due diligence"" on the Tutankhamun bust. ""We recognise historic objects can give rise to complex discussions about the past; our role today is to continue to provide a transparent, legitimate marketplace upholding the highest standards for the transfer of objects from one generation of collectors to the next,"" a statement said.

"Donald Trump has been ""disrespectful"" towards the prime minister and the UK, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. His comments come after President Trump called Sir Kim Darroch, the UK ambassador to the US, ""a very stupid guy"" amid a row over leaked emails. He went on to criticise Theresa May over Brexit, saying she had ignored his advice and gone her ""own foolish way"". On Sunday emails revealed the ambassador had called the Trump administration ""clumsy and inept"". Meanwhile, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox's scheduled meeting with the US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in the US was cancelled on Tuesday. Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? Trump: We won't deal with UK ambassador Trump attack ambassador 'has PM's full support' Mr Hunt responded to Mr Trump's latest outburst by tweeting: ""Friends speak frankly so I will: these comments are disrespectful and wrong to our prime minister and my country."" The Tory leadership hopeful also said he would keep Sir Kim in his post until he retires at Christmas. This video can not be played Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US in a TV debate During a televised debate, Boris Johnson, the current Tory leadership frontrunner, was pushed on whether he would keep the ambassador, but said he ""wouldn't be so presumptuous"" as to think he would be in a position to do that. Mr Johnson said he had ""a good relationship"" with the White House and that it was important to have a ""close partnership"" with the US. Allow Twitter content?

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the row was a reminder of the ""tricky and sensitive"" nature of the UK's relationship with the US and the challenge facing the Tory leadership hopefuls in dealing with a president ""who seems to love stirring up controversy"". ""It's Jeremy Hunt, normally seen as the more cautious of the two, who's speaking much more plainly and directly to Donald Trump on the matter, while Boris Johnson has said only that he's not embarrassed about being close to the White House,"" she said. Following Mr Trump's comments on Monday that the US would ""no longer deal"" with Sir Kim, the US State Department said it would continue ""to deal with any accredited individuals until we get any further guidance from the White House or the president"". ""We have an incredibly special and strategic relationship with the United Kingdom that has gone on for quite a long time - it's bigger than any individual or government,"" the department added. Earlier, Downing Street reaffirmed its ""full support"" for Sir Kim. A spokesman for Theresa May said that Sir Kim is ""a dutiful, respected government official"" and confirmed there were no plans for Mrs May and Mr Trump to hold a call to discuss relations following the leak. Number 10 also confirmed that Sir Kim would not be attending a meeting between Ivanka Trump and the International Trade Secretary Liam Fox in Washington. The spokesman said: ""He isn't attending that meeting but he is supporting Liam Fox in other ways on his trip."" Earlier on Tuesday Mr Trump tweeted: ""The wacky Ambassador that the U.K. foisted upon the United States is not someone we are thrilled with, a very stupid guy. ""He should speak to his country, and Prime Minister May, about their failed Brexit negotiation, and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was handled. ""I told @theresa_may how to do that deal, but she went her own foolish way-was unable to get it done. A disaster! ""I don't know the Ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool.

Number 10 previously called the leak,reported in the Mail on Sunday,external, ""unfortunate"" andhas begun a formal investigation. It said the UK and US still shared a ""special and enduring"" relationship. Confidential emails from the UK's ambassador contained a string of criticisms of Mr Trump and his administration, and said the White House was ""uniquely dysfunctional"" and divided under his presidency. Sir Kim, who became ambassador to the US in January 2016 about a year before Mr Trump took office, also questioned whether the White House ""will ever look competent"" but also warned that the US president should not be written off. The emails, dating from 2017, said rumours of ""infighting and chaos"" in the White House were mostly true and policy on sensitive issues such as Iran was ""incoherent, chaotic"".

"This video can not be played Philip Rycroft, who resigned after 18 months as the Brexit boss, told the BBC no deal was ""fraught with risk"" Everyone should worry about no deal, the civil servant who was, until March, head of the Brexit department has said. Philip Rycroft, who resigned after 18 months, told the BBC's Panorama no deal was ""fraught with risk"". And NI police said no deal could help recruitment for paramilitary groups. Both the candidates in the race to replace Theresa May as prime minister - Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson - have said they would be prepared to leave the EU without a deal. Former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said there was ""no reason at all"" why new negotiations with the EU could not be completed in ""the next three months"". But the EU has repeatedly refused to re-open negotiations. The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March but this date was delayed after MPs repeatedly rejected Mrs May's deal. Currently, Brexit is set to take place on 31 October. In a no-deal scenario, the UK would immediately leave the EU with no agreement about the ""divorce"" process, immediately coming out of the single market and customs union and institutions like law enforcement body Europol. Those against say it would damage the economy, especially industries like farming, and cause widespread disruption, but some politicians insist problems could be quickly overcome. The government says it has been preparing for almost three years to minimise that disruption and to provide people and businesses with information they need to get ready. The UK would leave the single market and customs union - arrangements designed to help trade between EU members Checks at UK-EU borders could cause bottlenecks at ports No deal also means immediately leaving EU institutions, such as the European Court of Justice Many politicians and businesses say no deal would damage the economy. Others say the risks are exaggerated No-deal Brexit: All you need to know In his first broadcast interview since stepping down as permanent secretary at the Brexit department, Mr Rycroft said the planning operation for exiting the EU was ""an unprecedented situation"" and ""the biggest exercise across government over the last few decades"". He told Panorama: ""This has been an extraordinary exercise to which the civil service is responding brilliantly wellâ¦ The planning I think is in good shape, absolutelyâ¦ but of course what that doesn't mean is that there won't be an impact from Brexit, and particularly a no-deal Brexit, because that is a very major change and it would be a very abrupt change to our major trading relationship."" ""The rational outcome over the next few months is to get a deal because that is overwhelmingly in the economic interest of both the EU and the UK."" Brexit: What's the plan for no deal? Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? How the Brexit timetable could unfold Mr Rycroft continued: ""It's not in the UK's interest to have no deal, it's not in the EU's interest to have a no deal. ""I think everybody should be worried about what happens in a no-deal situation. We would be taking a step into the unknown."" But Sir Michael told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said no deal was the ""ultimate fall back"" and needed to be prepared for ""so that our partners are convinced that this is a deadly serious negotiation"". ""We have got three months to do this with a fresh approach,"" he said. ""We need some alternative arrangements for Northern Ireland - some of that technology is already in place - we need the right to exit the backstop if the negotiations fail, we need some improvements to the political declaration. ""These aren't the biggest things, but what they do require is some optimism and ambition and above all some energy. ""We will have a fresh team, a fresh prime minister and there is no reason at all why this can't be done in the next three months."" A line of lorries seen in Kent during a trial of how routes from major ferry terminals will cope in case of a no-deal Brexit In the event of a no-deal Brexit, additional checks on goods being delivered across the UK-EU border could result in delays on the roads - especially around the Port of Dover in Kent, which handles 17% of the UK's goods trade. Richard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said working with the government to prepare for no deal had been ""a frustrating process"". He said: ""We have no clarity of the processes  - what's actually going to happen on day one."" Mr Burnett told Panorama that Transport Secretary Chris Grayling had left him a voicemail expressing his disappointment after the RHA issued a press release following a private briefing. Brexit: What would no deal mean for lorry drivers? No-deal Brexit: What you need to know In response, Mr Grayling said the haulage industry had been heavily involved in EU preparatory work and would continue to be so. ""It is obviously disappointing when someone issues a press release on the back of what was a private working group to discuss how we best approach both a deal and a no deal,"" he told the BBC. ""But we have continued to meet and engage with them."" The Police Service of Northern Ireland also told the BBC of its concern at the impact on security of a no-deal Brexit. There are fears that one could lead to the introduction of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - a situation Sinn Fein has said would lead to further calls for a referendum on Irish unification. PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Tim Mairs told Panorama: ""We know that the New IRA and other groups continue to recruit people and we believe that Brexit provides an opportunity for them to encourage people to recruit."" But he added that, despite their worries, to date the PSNI had not seen ""any upsurge"" in violence or recruitment being driven by Brexit. Can 'alternative arrangements' secure Brexit deal? How the PM hopefuls view Brexit and the border Mr Mairs also expressed fears price differences on the border could create ""new opportunities"" for criminal gangs, claiming: ""We would see, traditionally, connections between some of those groups and more violent groups. ""The potential impact of a no deal on the economy in Northern Ireland is significant, and that would, in our view, present potentially significant security concerns."" The handling of Brexit has been the key issue in the Conservative leadership race. Frontrunner Mr Johnson has said the UK should prepare ""confidently and seriously"" for a no-deal Brexit, but believes the chances of it happening are ""one million to one against"". He has said he will try to get a new deal negotiated with the EU, but has promised to leave the EU with or without one on 31 October. His rival, Mr Hunt, also wants to change the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Mrs May and thinks this can be achieved by the end of October. He has said he is prepared to delay Brexit beyond that date, if there is a prospect of getting a deal. If not, he would be prepared to leave without one but with ""a heavy heart"". Meanwhile MPs opposed to no deal are seeking ways to block such an outcome. Tory MP and ex-minister Sam Gyimah says there are ""30 plus"" Conservative MPs who would vote to block a no-deal Brexit.

"This video can not be played Strycova stuns Konta to reach last four - highlights Wimbledon 2019 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:1-14 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app.Full details Johanna Konta failed in her bid to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals after an error-strewn display in a straight-set defeat by Czech Barbora Strycova. The British number one started strongly, racing to a 4-1 lead, before collapsing to lose 7-6 (7-5) 6-1. Let down by her previously dominant serve, Konta could not find a way back as - like in June's French Open semis - she crumbled when expectation was high. ""I did my best, and my best today wasn't good enough,"" Konta, 28, said. ""Every decision I made, every thought process, every opportunity I gave myself, I have no regrets in doing."" Strycova, who has reached her maiden Grand Slam singles semi-final just days after saying this could be her last Wimbledon, will face 23-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams next. ""I think this was one of the best matches I have played,"" the 33-year-old said. 'I don't think you need to pick on me' - Konta responds to 'harsh' questions about defeat In pictures - Lionesses enjoy day out at Wimbledon Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Konta came into the match boasting an incredible record of having lost just three of her 47 service games at these championships. Despite the fact she got an early break, the warning signs that her biggest weapon might not be firing properly were there in the opening game when she had to save a break point. The errors began to creep in at 4-2 when she sent two forehands wide and wild backhand long to allow Strycova to get the break back. It became a theme as Konta went on to produce 22 unforced errors in that opening set, with the Czech increasing in confidence as she gave Konta a lesson in effective drop shots to take it to a tie-break. There Konta could not find a rhythm, sending a forehand into the net to hand the set to the world number world number 54. Konta is well versed in losing opening sets and winning in a third - with a record of 13 wins from 15 three-setters this year - but this time an early break in the second put a comeback out of reach. The game was up for the Briton when she went long with a backhand - summing up everything that was wrong with this performance. ""I couldn't quite find the level that I needed to make it difficult and challenging for the kind of player she is,"" said Konta, who had lost to Strycova in 2017 in Tokyo in their only other meeting. ""She's a very difficult player to play on this surface, and in general. She's a very good player. It's just unfortunate I couldn't quite find the level needed to come through."" This video can not be played Konta reacts to a journalist's 'patronising' question after her defeat by Strycova Konta had been hoping to emulate her 2017 feat of reaching the last four and getting closer to becoming the first British women's singles finalist since Virginia Wade won the title in 1977. She has enjoyed a successful year, reaching the French Open semi-finals and two WTA finals on clay, before transferring her good form on to grass. Her serve has been the key but against Strycova she won just 51% of her first-serve points. In the previous two rounds she came past 2017 US Open champion Sloane Stephens and two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in three sets with accomplished displays but against the unseeded Strycova - where the Briton was now favourite - her game fell apart. Her mental strength has often been questioned and it will be once again, with this defeat echoing her Roland Garros semi-final loss to another unseeded Czech, Marketa Vondrousova. Konta, who was bidding to reach a fourth Grand Slam semi-final, denied that the pressure of expectation had got to her and refused to blame tiredness from back-to-back three-set matches. ""I was obviously nervous going into the match. But good nerves, excitement, anticipation,"" she said. ""I wouldn't say that had anything to do with the level that I played or any difficulty. ""I think it was a combination of just not finding my level, and her not giving me the opportunity to find my level more than anything."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller This was a clever, skilful and tactically astute performance by Barbora Strycova. At the age of 33, she seized the opportunity to reach a first Grand Slam semi-final magnificently. Johanna Konta, though, was unable to play with anything like the freedom of earlier rounds. Thirty four unforced errors in two sets tells its own story: Strycova's spins and relative lack of pace threw her out of kilter, but nerves and expectations also seemed to play a part. Konta played brilliantly to win her other Wimbledon quarter-final against Simona Halep two years ago, and also her recent French Open quarter-final with Sloane Stephens. But just as in her Roland Garros semi-final with Marketa Vondrousova, Konta was the favourite here - and unable to play to the level she is capable of.

"This video can not be played Texas billionaire and political outsider Ross Perot said he had lived the American Dream Texan billionaire Ross Perot, who in the 1990s twice ran for US president against candidates from the two main parties, has died at the age of 89. Described as idiosyncratic and feisty, he pioneered the computer data industry by founding his own company in 1962. But he was best known for running in the 1992 campaign, advocating balanced budgets and calling for an end to the outsourcing of jobs abroad. Perot took almost a fifth of the popular vote in the three-way race. That made him one of the most successful independent candidates in US history, and was believed to have helped Democrat Bill Clinton defeat incumbent George HW Bush. Perot ran for president again in 1996, after forming the Reform Party. He was diagnosed with leukaemia earlier this year. Ross Perot: The political outsider H Ross Perot was an American original. A self-made billionaire with a penchant for plain-speaking in his clipped north Texas twang, he built a reputation as a savvy technology entrepreneur and spent a small fortune helping US veterans and attempting to free American hostages abroad. He was also a political harbinger. His 1992 independent presidential bid - the most successful third-party candidacy in eight decades - exposed fault lines in the US political system that would someday result in electoral earthquakes. He capitalised on the thirst of American voters for an outsider who could disrupt two-party government and built a dedicated following with his populist, small-government, anti-trade, anti-globalist rhetoric. His unconventional candidacy, announced on a US talk show, straddled the line between entertainment and politics and contributed to the defeat of incumbent Republican President George HW Bush. Although his second presidential bid in 1996 faltered and the Reform Party he founded crumbled once he scaled back his involvement, the ideological themes he built it on would later be adopted by Donald Trump to bring the establishment of the Republican Party as it existed for decades crashing down. This video can not be played How Ross Perot helped lead to President Trump The Perot family said in a statement on Tuesday: ""Ross Perot, the ground-breaking businessman and loving husband, brother, father and grandfather, passed away early Tuesday at his home in Dallas, surrounded by his devoted family."" Reacting to the news, Vice-President Mike Pence said Perot had been ""a great American, a true patriot and a steadfast supporter of our military"". Bill Clinton said: ""Although we were opponents in 1992 and 1996, I respected Ross for his support for our veterans, the business he built, and the passion he brought to his politics."" Born in 1930, during the Great Depression, Perot grew up in poverty. He began his technology career working in sales for IBM, before founding Electronic Data Systems (EDS) in 1962, at the age of 32. The company - which was later sold to Hewlett-Packard - made him rich. In the 1980s he set up Perot Systems which was eventually acquired by Dell for $3.9bn. Perot (centre) gained prominence by running against heavyweights Bill Clinton and George HW Bush As an employer, Perot was known for his quirks - particularly his strict dress code. Workers had to wear white shirts and ties, and beards were banned. When two of his employees were jailed in Iran in 1979 over a contract dispute - just before the Islamic Revolution - he financed a private commando rescue in a raid that inspired a book and a film. He championed patriotic causes, and in the late 1970s and 1980s claimed that hundreds of missing US soldiers had been left behind and imprisoned after the Vietnam War. The 1992 campaign - during which Perot spent $63m (Â£50m) of his own money - made him a household name. At one point in June that year, he had a lead over both his mainstream rivals. Perot finished a strong third in the November election. His second campaign in 1996 was less successful. He did not take part in presidential debates and got just 8% of the vote.

"The battleship Markgraf was among those scuttled Four World War One warships sunk in Scapa Flow in Orkney in 1919 have been sold on eBay for a combined total of Â£85,000. The Markgraf, Karlsruhe, Konig and Kronprinz Wilhelm are scheduled monuments, which recreational divers are not supposed to enter. The asking price was over Â£800,000. The three battleships sold for Â£25,500 each to a Middle Eastern company. The cruiser, Karlsruhe, sold for Â£8,500 to a private bidder in England. Sunken WW1 battleships up for sale on eBay The day the entire German fleet surrendered The vessels, which were part of the German High Seas fleet, were deliberately scuttled 100 years ago. They cannot be removed from the seabed. When the listing first appeared on online auction site eBay, some assumed the advert was a hoax. But the seller explained that they had been bought from a defunct salvage company. Drew Crawford, mediating agent for owner of the wrecks - retired Tayside diving contractor Tommy Clark - said they were not certain as to the long-term intentions of the new owners, and the sale would depend on terms and conditions being met. He said: ""We're finalising details of the sale with them. ""We hope to know more, ultimately, later this week. ""It's not very often ships or shipwrecks like this come up for sale, especially with the history these vessels have. ""It's a very rare occurrence and not something you see often at all."" The listing described the ships as ""pre-owned"" The fleet had been interned in Scapa Flow after surrendering in the Firth of Forth. Admiral Ludwig von Reuter ordered the deliberate sinking of his ships in WW1 because he feared either the resumption of hostilities if treaty negotiations in Paris broke down, or the seizing of the fleet by the Allies as war reparations. During the 1920s and 30s a number of the vessels were lifted from the sea bed by commercial contractors, and broken up. Some historians argue that saved Orkney from the worst effects of the post-war recession. And the presence of the wrecks in Scapa Flow has made the area a destination of choice for divers, keen to see the remains on the sea bed.

"Conor McGinn's proposal says if Stormont is not restored by 21 October, the government should legislate for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland MPs have backed amendments which require the government to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland if devolution is not restored. It was part of a Commons debate aimed at keeping NI running in the absence of devolved government. Its main purpose was to extend the government's legal power todelay a fresh Stormont election. MPs had tabled a series of other amendments. What does vote on Northern Ireland bill mean? Why there's more to the Northern Ireland bill Stormont election delay bill debated by MPs 10 ways in which gay rights have changed They argued those issues should not be stalled due to the lack of devolution, which collapsed in January 2017. MPs backed the same-sex marriage amendment by 383 votes to 73, while the abortion amendment was backed 332 to 99. Neither amendment automatically changes the law in Northern Ireland, where same-sex marriage is not legal and abortion is only allowed in very limited circumstances. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks at the history of Northern Ireland's same-sex marriage debate Labour's Conor McGinn, originally from County Armagh, put forward a proposal to the NI Executive Formation Bill that if Stormont is not restored by 21 October, then the government should legislate for same-sex marriage - on the condition that a future assembly could overturn or amend the law. The abortion amendment, put forward by his Labour colleague Stella Creasy, is subject to the same condition. The two contenders vying to become the next prime minister were asked about Tuesday's vote during a leadership debate on ITV. Jeremy Hunt said he would support the move, while Boris Johnson said it should remain a devolved issue. ""I think it's a matter for the people of Northern Ireland and one of the most important reasons for getting the Stormont government back up and running,"" Mr Johnson said. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Political Reporter Campaigners for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland say this is a watershed moment. Others may see it as the biggest step yet by Westminster towards enacting direct rule. But it does not automatically change the law - the caveat is that it can only happen if Stormont hasn't been restored by 21 October. The Northern Ireland Office minister, John Penrose, also said even if we get to that stage, time constraints mean they may be unlikely to be able to implement the law change right away. The DUP was angry that Parliament was voting on issues it deems devolved matters, saying the bill had been ""hijacked"". But the MP behind the amendment - Conor McGinn - said the DUP should see it as an ""incentive"" to get Stormont restored so it never has to come into effect. ""My priority, and what I want to see, is an assembly up and running and functioning in Stormont, so it is my strong view that the way that this amendment is crafted doesn't impinge on the devolved settlement because it explicitly recognises that this is a devolved power,"" Mr McGinn said. ""At the minute, the assembly and executive exists in the ether or as a concept, not in reality."" Read more from Jaynehere. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If the Stormont assembly has not been restored by 21 October, the government must bring regulations to Parliament to amend the law in Northern Ireland on same-sex marriage. There would not have to be a further vote on the matter, as it would come in the form of secondary legislation - statutory instruments - which would not be put to a vote on the Commons floor. The bill still has to go to the House of Lords for approval, but it is very unlikely it will be overturned there. Former Number 10 Director of Legislative Affairs Nikki Da Costa told BBC News NI MPs could ask for a resolution to overturn it - but given the majority in favour of the amendment, that seemed unlikely to happen too. This video can not be played The law on abortion in Northern Ireland explained The DUP voted against both amendments, but two of its MPs, Gavin Robinson and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, were tellers, meaning they did not vote. Independent unionist MP for North Down, Lady Hermon, backed the same-sex marriage amendment, as did Northern Ireland Office Minister John Penrose. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and the prime minister abstained. Another hour of debate on other amendments, with some tabled by the DUP looking at the implementation of the Military Covenant in NI, also took place. MPs also backed an amendment tabled by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, which requires the government to submit regular progress reports to Parliament, giving updates on the talks process at Stormont. It passed by just one vote. The DUP's Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said the amendment would ""drive a coach and horses through the principle of devolution"". The DUP reacted angrily to the decision to allow the abortion and same-sex marriage amendments to be debated in Parliament. Speaking before the same-sex marriage amendment was approved, the party's Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, said if approved by MPs, the amendment would ""drive a coach and horses through the principle of devolution"". During the debate, he said there were many issues - such as the health service, education, infrastructure investment, jobs -  that were having ""massive detrimental effects by not having progress made through legislation and executive decisions. ""Yet nobody is addressing that point today, instead we're picking out certain issues, which I think is a fundamentally wrong approach especially when talks are under way currently."" Party colleague Gavin Robinson said that if the assembly was restored tomorrow, the issue of same-sex marriage could be legislated on as the DUP does not have the numbers to stop it. He said the party stopping this happening was Sinn FÃ©in. However, Sinn FÃ©in MP Elisha McCallion said: ""It was inevitable that the British government's failure to defend basic rights available everywhere else on these islands would be confronted. ""This was the message coming out of Westminster today."" John O'Doherty of the Rainbow Project, said: ""Parliament has always had the power to legislate for marriage equality in Northern Ireland and we are glad the House of Commons has seen sense and voted to give people in Northern Ireland the same freedoms enjoyed by everyone else in these islands."" Conservative MPs and Labour MPs were given free vote on the issue. The Scottish National Party (SNP), which has traditionally abstained on devolved matters in other nations, said on Tuesday morning that its MPs would be given a free vote on the issue and 25 of its MPs backed it. England and Wales legalised same-sex marriage in July 2013and came into force inMarch 2014 Scotland legislated for same-sex marriage inFebruary 2014which came into effect inDecemberthat year The Republic of Ireland legalised same-sex marriage in areferendum in May 2015- becoming the only country in the world to do so by popular vote.Ireland's first same-sex marriage took place in November 2015. Northern Ireland has been without a government for more than two and a half years, after a bitter row over a financial scandal split the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The Northern Ireland secretary has twice pushed back her obligation to call an election at Stormont, with it due to end on 25 August. This new legislation would delay another poll until 21 October, with another possible extension to 13 January 2020. It also provides greater clarity about decision-making to civil servants at Stormont, in the absence of functioning ministers.

"This video can not be played Texas billionaire and political outsider Ross Perot said he had lived the American Dream Texan billionaire Ross Perot, who in the 1990s twice ran for US president against candidates from the two main parties, has died at the age of 89. Described as idiosyncratic and feisty, he pioneered the computer data industry by founding his own company in 1962. But he was best known for running in the 1992 campaign, advocating balanced budgets and calling for an end to the outsourcing of jobs abroad. Perot took almost a fifth of the popular vote in the three-way race. That made him one of the most successful independent candidates in US history, and was believed to have helped Democrat Bill Clinton defeat incumbent George HW Bush. Perot ran for president again in 1996, after forming the Reform Party. He was diagnosed with leukaemia earlier this year. Ross Perot: The political outsider H Ross Perot was an American original. A self-made billionaire with a penchant for plain-speaking in his clipped north Texas twang, he built a reputation as a savvy technology entrepreneur and spent a small fortune helping US veterans and attempting to free American hostages abroad. He was also a political harbinger. His 1992 independent presidential bid - the most successful third-party candidacy in eight decades - exposed fault lines in the US political system that would someday result in electoral earthquakes. He capitalised on the thirst of American voters for an outsider who could disrupt two-party government and built a dedicated following with his populist, small-government, anti-trade, anti-globalist rhetoric. His unconventional candidacy, announced on a US talk show, straddled the line between entertainment and politics and contributed to the defeat of incumbent Republican President George HW Bush. Although his second presidential bid in 1996 faltered and the Reform Party he founded crumbled once he scaled back his involvement, the ideological themes he built it on would later be adopted by Donald Trump to bring the establishment of the Republican Party as it existed for decades crashing down. This video can not be played How Ross Perot helped lead to President Trump The Perot family said in a statement on Tuesday: ""Ross Perot, the ground-breaking businessman and loving husband, brother, father and grandfather, passed away early Tuesday at his home in Dallas, surrounded by his devoted family."" Reacting to the news, Vice-President Mike Pence said Perot had been ""a great American, a true patriot and a steadfast supporter of our military"". Bill Clinton said: ""Although we were opponents in 1992 and 1996, I respected Ross for his support for our veterans, the business he built, and the passion he brought to his politics."" Born in 1930, during the Great Depression, Perot grew up in poverty. He began his technology career working in sales for IBM, before founding Electronic Data Systems (EDS) in 1962, at the age of 32. The company - which was later sold to Hewlett-Packard - made him rich. In the 1980s he set up Perot Systems which was eventually acquired by Dell for $3.9bn. Perot (centre) gained prominence by running against heavyweights Bill Clinton and George HW Bush As an employer, Perot was known for his quirks - particularly his strict dress code. Workers had to wear white shirts and ties, and beards were banned. When two of his employees were jailed in Iran in 1979 over a contract dispute - just before the Islamic Revolution - he financed a private commando rescue in a raid that inspired a book and a film. He championed patriotic causes, and in the late 1970s and 1980s claimed that hundreds of missing US soldiers had been left behind and imprisoned after the Vietnam War. The 1992 campaign - during which Perot spent $63m (Â£50m) of his own money - made him a household name. At one point in June that year, he had a lead over both his mainstream rivals. Perot finished a strong third in the November election. His second campaign in 1996 was less successful. He did not take part in presidential debates and got just 8% of the vote.

"Lord Turnberg, Lord Triesman and Lord Darzi have resigned the Labour whip Three peers have left the Labour group in the Lords, accusing the party of anti-Semitism, Newsnight has learned. Lord Triesman, general secretary between 2001 and 2004, accused Jeremy Corbyn of anti-Semitism and said the party was no longer ""a safe environment"" for Jewish people. Lord Darzi, meanwhile, will sit as an independent and Lord Turnberg said he feared ""for the future"" of the party. Labour said it ""completely rejects these false and offensive claims"". ""The Labour Party at all levels is implacably opposed to anti-Semitism and is determined to root out this social cancer from our movement and society,""  a party spokeswoman said. Former Health Minister Lord Darzi said that as an Armenian descendant of a ""survivor of the Armenian genocide"", he had ""zero tolerance to anti-Semitism,"" adding that his decision to resign the whip ""has not been lightly taken"". Former president of the Royal College of Physicians Lord Turnberg told BBC Newsnight that his differences ""lie with the party leadership and machine and not with my very supportive colleagues in the Lords who share my values"". ""It is not just the policies on foreign affairs... and Brexit vacillation and bypassing parliamentary opinion but the overt anti-Semitism that permeates the party machine that is no longer possible for me to tolerate,"" he said. Labour said it was taking ""decisive action against anti-Semitism"" and had doubled the number of staff dedicated to dealing with complaints and cases. ""Our records show that anti-Semitism cases that have gone through the stages of our disciplinary procedures since September 2015 account for about 0.06% of the party's membership,"" the spokeswoman said. ""This represents a tiny minority - but one anti-Semite is one too many and we will continue to act against this repugnant form of racism."" But, in his resignation letter to Labour's leader in the House of Lords, Baroness Smith, Lord Triesman said Mr Corbyn ""and his circle are anti-Semitic, having never once made the right judgement call about an issue reflecting deep prejudice"". ""My sad conclusion is that the Labour party is very plainly institutionally anti-Semitic,"" he wrote. Anti-Semites were ""shielded"", while ""serious party members are thrown out unceremoniously"", he said. ""The experience of life in the party has become sickening."" The remarks represent the strongest personal attack on the Labour leader from within the party since Margaret Hodge reportedly called Mr Corbyn an anti-Semitic racist last year. A guide to Labour Party anti-Semitism claims Gordon Brown: Automatically expel anti-Semites in Labour Labour must 'act more quickly' on anti-Semitism Lord Triesman told Newsnight the party had been ""a central plank of my political life for over 50 years"". But it had now ""slipped into the familiar gutter of so many of the hard left"". ""It is a painful decision,"" the former trade union leader told Newsnight. ""I remain completely aligned to the values I've had over all these years but I can no longer take direction from a leadership that is institutionally anti-Semitic."" Lord Triesman wrote: ""I always said it was worth hanging on to fight so long as there was a prospect of winning. ""I now don't believe with this leadership there is."" He said hoping ""something will turn up to change it all"" was a ""unicorn delusion"". The resignations came as Labour's disputes panel met to discuss the suspension of MP Chris Williamson. Mr Williamsonwas suspendedearlier this year after saying Labour had ""given too much ground"" over anti-Semitism. In February,nine MPs quit Labour, some citing the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism as their reason for leaving. Luciana Berger said she had come to the ""sickening conclusion"" the party had become institutionally anti-Semitic and she was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" to stay. Joan Ryanclaimed Labour's leadership had allowed ""Jews to be abused with impunity"". AndIan Austin said Jeremy Corbyn was ""incapable""of dealing with anti-Semitism.

"Chinese and Indian ethnic group workers have higher average earnings than their white British counterparts, the first detailed official figures show. But the dataon the ethnicity pay gap,external, showed all other ethnic groups have lower wages than white British workers. The Office for National Statistics said employees in the Bangladeshi ethnic group have the largest pay gap, earning 20% less than white British employees. On average, ethnic minorities earn 3.8% less than white ethnic groups. The categories are the official ones used by ONS. In 2018, employees from the Chinese ethnic group earned 30.9% more than white British employees. Hugh Stickland, senior ONS analyst, said: ""Overall, employees from certain ethnic groups such as Indian and Chinese, have higher average earnings than their white British counterparts. ""However, all other ethnic groups have average wages lower than for white British employees, with employees from the Bangladeshi ethnic group having the largest pay gap. ""However, once characteristics such as education and occupation are taken into account, the pay gap between white British and most other ethnic groups becomes narrower, though significant differences still remain."" The data - based on median gross hourly earnings between 2012 and 2018 - shows that the Chinese ethnicity group is the highest paid, receiving Â£15.75 an hour in 2018. That group is followed by the Indian ethic group - which earns Â£13.47 an hour - and mixed/multiple ethnicity group, with a Â£12.33 hourly pay rate. The median pay of the white British group was Â£12.03. The Bangladeshi group had the lowest median hourly pay of Â£9.60 with the second-lowest paid group being of Pakistani origin at Â£10 an hour. The data comes after areport last year from the Resolution Foundation foundblack and ethnic minority workers were paid significantly less than their white counterparts. ""The harsh reality is that even today race still plays a real role in determining pay,"" said Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC. ""Ministers must take bold action to confront inequality and racism in the labour market. The obvious first step is to introduce mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting without delay,"" she said. The governmenthas consulted on whether mandatory reportingwill help address disparities between the pay and career prospects of minorities. The government has already introduced mandatory reporting on the gender pay gap - which standsat 9.6% in favour of men- and the ONS data also shows discrepancies in male and female earnings in the ethnic groups. The Chinese and Indian groups, which both have the highest rate of hourly pay, were among those with the biggest gender gaps. Chinese men on average earned 19.1% more than women and Indian men earned 23.2% more than women. But women in the Bangladeshi ethnic group earn more than their male counterparts - with a 10.5% gap. The ONS said, though, that the sample size for the Bangladeshi group was smaller and susceptible to inaccuracy compared with other ethnic groups. London, which has the highest proportion of its population classified as an ethnic minority group, also has the largest pay gap of 21.7%. The ONS found this gap was reversed in other parts of Britain.  In the north-east of England, for instance, employees from an ethnic minority group had average earnings that were 6.5% more than the average earnings of white employees. The ONS says that where someone is born can have an influence on how much they are paid. ""By comparing those who were born in the UK and those who were not, it may give us an idea of what sort of effect having a UK education and the higher likelihood of speaking English as a first language may have on those from an ethnic minority background,"" the ONS said. It found those in the Bangladeshi ethnic group - who had been born in the UK - earned 8% less than white British employees. But for Bangladeshi  employees born outside the UK the gap was 26.8%. When taking other factors into account, such as education, UK-born employees in the Indian and Chinese ethnic groups do not have pay gaps that are ""statistically different"" from the UK-born white British employees, the ONS found. For example, almost a third of workers in the Indian ethnic group work in professional roles which means they tend to be higher-paid.

"The Fish and The Chip opened two years ago A fish and chip restaurant has closed down after the owners said they felt ""uncomfortable"" about the environmental impact of their business. The Fish and The Chip, in St Nicholas Place, Leicester, was billed as a modern take on traditional fish and chips when it opened in 2017. However, its owners said a recent fishing trip had got them thinking about its green footprint. They said they were working on a new food-based venture. The building has now been put up for sale A notice placed in the restaurant's window said: ""Our fishing trip was great but turned out to be a bit of an eye-opener. ""We saw the impact pollution is having on the oceans and fish stocks and we are not comfortable running a restaurant that has an impact on our environment."" The owners posted a sign explaining their decision to close They did not say what form their new venture would take but said it would be based around ""gluten-free, plant-based food"". Owner Aatkin Anadkat said his main concerns were declining fish numbers around the world and fish eating plastic particles found in the water. He said: ""Effectively you're serving your customers that and they're consuming it."" The WWF has described overfishing as one of the most significant drivers of declines in ocean wildlife populations and scientists recently said cod levels in the North Seahad fallen to critical levels. Owner Aatkin Anadkat said he was worried about serving fish that had eaten plastic particles Mr Anadkat said he also understood some people might suspect the restaurant was actually being closed for business reasons. He said: ""There is more than one reason - as with most things - but I've learned along the way that if something doesn't feel good, then you shouldn't do it. ""We're not going to be opening another site but we're certainly in the plant-based food business and it's a nice place to be."" The Fish and The Chip described itself as ""the modern chippy"" when it opened in 2017 A spokeswoman for The Vegan Society said: ""The number of vegans has quadrupled in the last four years and there are also increasing numbers of consumers looking for a more sustainable and compassionate diet who are keen to try more vegan food. ""This is the perfect moment for this business to move to being a full-time vegan one."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Veggie farmer gives away beef herd 'Cancer on your family' sign left for butcher The fishy ingredient in beer that bothers vegetarians Mr Anadkat said he was also concerned about falling fish numbers Malcolm Hunter, from Friends of the Earth in Leicester, said: ""Halting climate change and protecting biodiversity doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up eating fish - or meat and dairy entirely - but we do need to substantially reduce our consumption.

"Chinese and Indian ethnic group workers have higher average earnings than their white British counterparts, the first detailed official figures show. But the dataon the ethnicity pay gap,external, showed all other ethnic groups have lower wages than white British workers. The Office for National Statistics said employees in the Bangladeshi ethnic group have the largest pay gap, earning 20% less than white British employees. On average, ethnic minorities earn 3.8% less than white ethnic groups. The categories are the official ones used by ONS. In 2018, employees from the Chinese ethnic group earned 30.9% more than white British employees. Hugh Stickland, senior ONS analyst, said: ""Overall, employees from certain ethnic groups such as Indian and Chinese, have higher average earnings than their white British counterparts. ""However, all other ethnic groups have average wages lower than for white British employees, with employees from the Bangladeshi ethnic group having the largest pay gap. ""However, once characteristics such as education and occupation are taken into account, the pay gap between white British and most other ethnic groups becomes narrower, though significant differences still remain."" The data - based on median gross hourly earnings between 2012 and 2018 - shows that the Chinese ethnicity group is the highest paid, receiving Â£15.75 an hour in 2018. That group is followed by the Indian ethic group - which earns Â£13.47 an hour - and mixed/multiple ethnicity group, with a Â£12.33 hourly pay rate. The median pay of the white British group was Â£12.03. The Bangladeshi group had the lowest median hourly pay of Â£9.60 with the second-lowest paid group being of Pakistani origin at Â£10 an hour. The data comes after areport last year from the Resolution Foundation foundblack and ethnic minority workers were paid significantly less than their white counterparts. ""The harsh reality is that even today race still plays a real role in determining pay,"" said Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC. ""Ministers must take bold action to confront inequality and racism in the labour market. The obvious first step is to introduce mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting without delay,"" she said. The governmenthas consulted on whether mandatory reportingwill help address disparities between the pay and career prospects of minorities. The government has already introduced mandatory reporting on the gender pay gap - which standsat 9.6% in favour of men- and the ONS data also shows discrepancies in male and female earnings in the ethnic groups. The Chinese and Indian groups, which both have the highest rate of hourly pay, were among those with the biggest gender gaps. Chinese men on average earned 19.1% more than women and Indian men earned 23.2% more than women. But women in the Bangladeshi ethnic group earn more than their male counterparts - with a 10.5% gap. The ONS said, though, that the sample size for the Bangladeshi group was smaller and susceptible to inaccuracy compared with other ethnic groups. London, which has the highest proportion of its population classified as an ethnic minority group, also has the largest pay gap of 21.7%. The ONS found this gap was reversed in other parts of Britain.  In the north-east of England, for instance, employees from an ethnic minority group had average earnings that were 6.5% more than the average earnings of white employees. The ONS says that where someone is born can have an influence on how much they are paid. ""By comparing those who were born in the UK and those who were not, it may give us an idea of what sort of effect having a UK education and the higher likelihood of speaking English as a first language may have on those from an ethnic minority background,"" the ONS said. It found those in the Bangladeshi ethnic group - who had been born in the UK - earned 8% less than white British employees. But for Bangladeshi  employees born outside the UK the gap was 26.8%. When taking other factors into account, such as education, UK-born employees in the Indian and Chinese ethnic groups do not have pay gaps that are ""statistically different"" from the UK-born white British employees, the ONS found. For example, almost a third of workers in the Indian ethnic group work in professional roles which means they tend to be higher-paid.

"The Fish and The Chip opened two years ago A fish and chip restaurant has closed down after the owners said they felt ""uncomfortable"" about the environmental impact of their business. The Fish and The Chip, in St Nicholas Place, Leicester, was billed as a modern take on traditional fish and chips when it opened in 2017. However, its owners said a recent fishing trip had got them thinking about its green footprint. They said they were working on a new food-based venture. The building has now been put up for sale A notice placed in the restaurant's window said: ""Our fishing trip was great but turned out to be a bit of an eye-opener. ""We saw the impact pollution is having on the oceans and fish stocks and we are not comfortable running a restaurant that has an impact on our environment."" The owners posted a sign explaining their decision to close They did not say what form their new venture would take but said it would be based around ""gluten-free, plant-based food"". Owner Aatkin Anadkat said his main concerns were declining fish numbers around the world and fish eating plastic particles found in the water. He said: ""Effectively you're serving your customers that and they're consuming it."" The WWF has described overfishing as one of the most significant drivers of declines in ocean wildlife populations and scientists recently said cod levels in the North Seahad fallen to critical levels. Owner Aatkin Anadkat said he was worried about serving fish that had eaten plastic particles Mr Anadkat said he also understood some people might suspect the restaurant was actually being closed for business reasons. He said: ""There is more than one reason - as with most things - but I've learned along the way that if something doesn't feel good, then you shouldn't do it. ""We're not going to be opening another site but we're certainly in the plant-based food business and it's a nice place to be."" The Fish and The Chip described itself as ""the modern chippy"" when it opened in 2017 A spokeswoman for The Vegan Society said: ""The number of vegans has quadrupled in the last four years and there are also increasing numbers of consumers looking for a more sustainable and compassionate diet who are keen to try more vegan food. ""This is the perfect moment for this business to move to being a full-time vegan one."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Veggie farmer gives away beef herd 'Cancer on your family' sign left for butcher The fishy ingredient in beer that bothers vegetarians Mr Anadkat said he was also concerned about falling fish numbers Malcolm Hunter, from Friends of the Earth in Leicester, said: ""Halting climate change and protecting biodiversity doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up eating fish - or meat and dairy entirely - but we do need to substantially reduce our consumption.

"The UK and the European Union have agreed to continue talks to try to reach a deal on their future relationship Even though ""major unresolved topics"" remain, both sides said it was important discussions continued. Failure to reach an agreement by 31 December would result in a no-deal Brexit. It would mean significant differences in the way we live and work. Prices could go upfor the goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU. That's because the UK and EU would trade onWorld Trade Organization (WTO) terms- the basic rules for countries without trade deals. The EU would impose taxes (known as tariffs) on goods coming from the UK. The average is about 2.8% for non-agricultural products, but 10% for cars and more than 35% for dairy products. That would put some industries under pressure. With the UK alsoimposing tariffs on some EU goods,external- they could become more expensive. But the price of some things imported from the rest of the world could fall because their tariffs are being cut. Food standardsfor UK exports could also be a problem. Without agreement that UK rules are acceptable in the EU, produce being sold by the UK could be stopped at the border, causing delays. Long queues for lorriesare possible because there would bemore border checks. The UK is delaying having full checks for goods arriving from the EU until 1 July. But it is feared EU lorry drivers might want to avoid the UK altogether if there are long delays. Less choice of foodis a danger, according to some supermarket chains, who have said fresh food will be particularly affected. They might try to fly replacements in from elsewhere, but that would increase costs. Northern Irelandhas been the subject of separate talks on howan agreement to avoid a hard border would work. An agreement has been reached 'in principle', but a free trade deal would make new arrangements easier. But across the UK it's not just trade that would be affected by no deal, as further details were expected in other areas. Fishinghas beenparticularly importantduring the trade talks. Without a deal, non-UK fishing boats would lose access to UK waters and vice versa. It is feared there could be confrontations if boats try to continue to fish where they have traditionally done so. There are also concerns UK fish exports to the EU would be badly hit by tariffs. Co-operation on security and data-sharingwould become much more difficult, causing problems for cross-border investigations. The UK would immediately lose access to databases of things like fingerprints, criminal records and wanted persons. There arebig questions about services. The UK has been waiting for a decision about whether the EU will recognise UK rules for financial services. Without that it will be more difficult for UK firms to operate in the EU. Some banks have already moved offices and staff to EU countries. The supply of medicines could be vulnerableto disruption at Channel ports, with particular worries about those with a short shelf life. There are plans in placeto ensure coronavirus vaccines reach the UK. Talks separate to the main trade deal were also being worked on. They cover areas including: Healthcare:The government is in talks for a healthcare arrangement thatwould replace EHIC, which helps people in need of treatment in EU countries. Education:It was also in talks about the possibility of continuing to participate inErasmus, which helps students study in other countries. Driving:Talks are still going on about whether UK nationalswill need International Driving Permitsfor short visits to EU countries. And the European Commission is understood to be considering whether green cards to prove people have valid insurance are required. Pensions:There has not yet been an agreement for peopleclaiming their UK state pensions in an EU countrythat would mean their pensions increase every year. If the UK gets to the end of the year without a trade deal with the EU, that does not mean there will never be one. It has been suggested all the problems it would cause would focus minds on reaching a deal as soon as possible. But there are those on both sides who say it could be many months into 2021 before talks were to resume in this scenario. Whether or not there is a trade deal, several things will change on 1 January. Fortrips to Europe, you'll have to make sure there is at least six months left on your passport and wait in a different queue at the border. Duty free shoppingwill return, but there will be limits on the amount of alcohol and tobacco you can bring into the UK from the EU without paying extra duty. The right to live and work in the EUwill no longer be automatic for UK nationals, unless they already live in an EU country by the end of 2020. A new immigration systemwill come into force in the UK, involvinga points-based systemfor people wanting to work. Trade with the EUfor UK companies will involve customs declarations, extra border checks, certificates, licences and special labelling for some types of foods, plants and live animals. Correction 8 December: A previous version of this story said UK nationals would not need International Driving Permits in EU countries from 1 January next year.

"Frances Shiels, 67, from Londonderry was entitled to her state pension in May 2014, years earlier than she would have as a man A transgender woman has settled a case against the Department for Communities to back pay state pension entitlements. Frances Shiels, 67, from Londonderry, was entitled to her state pension in May 2014, years earlier than she would have as a man. However, as she had transitioned she needed proof that she was a woman. To do this, she was required to obtain a Gender Recognition Certificate to legally change her gender and get a new birth certificate. However, in Northern Ireland, unlike the rest of the UK, a person cannot receive such a certificate if they are married. As Frances was, she needed to get a divorce first. When Frances eventually received her Gender Recognition Certificate in May 2015 and applied for her state pension, she was told it would only be backdated to the date of the certificate and not the date she was entitled to start receiving her state pension, resulting in nine months of missed payments. This financial loss was the reason Frances took the case. ""Society in general discriminates, however unconsciously, about being transgender and I suppose this case that I took is an example of that in that I took it quite personally that as a genetic female I would have been allowed to claim my state retirement pension from age 63,"" she said. ""When I went to do that, I discovered that it could not be backdated until then because of my late transition and my inability up until then to get a Gender Recognition Certificate. ""I had never really thought of going for a Gender Recognition Certificate because I was in a marriage and I took those vows very seriously and it was not until the need for other people as well as myself to get that divorce that I was able to embark on that recognition process."" Frances did not start her transition until she turned 60. ""I had more than enough contributions to claim my state pension as a woman and I did not see why I could not claim it at the same age as every other woman,"" she said, She approached the Human Rights Commission to help fight her case. ""As transgender individuals we are not looking for additional rights or anything more favourable than anybody else in society,"" she said. ""However it is very, very important that those rights that we do have are enforced. For me it is not enough to be tolerated. ""I want to be accepted and respected in the same way as you would expect."" Les Allamby, chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, backed Frances' case as ""we felt it was discriminatory"". ""It's yet another example of a legislative change we need to make once the assembly and the executive is reconvened,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Communities said they noted the statement from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, ""however the department does not comment on individual cases"".

"Mr Trump said he will ""no longer deal with"" Sir Kim Darroch Downing Street has reaffirmed its ""full support"" for the UK's ambassador to the US after Donald Trump said he will no longer work with him. The US president was responding after leaked emails revealed Sir Kim Darroch had called his administration inept. Ina series of tweets,externalMr Trump also criticised Theresa May's handling of Brexit saying she had created ""a mess"". Number 10 called the leak ""unfortunate"" but said Sir Kim was continuing to carry out his duties. BBC New York correspondent Nick Bryant said Sir Kim was still planning to join International Trade Secretary Liam Fox for a scheduled meeting with the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump, on Tuesday. Mrs May told members of the Cabinet the leaked memos did not reflect the closeness of the relationship between the UK and the US. She told ministers they were ""absolutely right"" to give their support to Sir Kim and stressed the importance of ambassadors being able to give ""honest and unvarnished"" assessments to ministers. ""The UK has a special and enduring relationship with the US based on our long history and commitment to shared values and that will continue to be the case,"" the prime minister's official spokesman added. Trump: We won't deal with UK ambassador What we've learned from Trump's visit Former Conservative leader and ex-foreign secretary Lord Hague urged the UK government to be ""patient"" and ""not escalate things"". However, he also toldRadio 4's Todayprogramme: ""You would never have any honest report from any ambassador in the world if you said: 'Well, if any of their communications are released, we'll then have to remove them from their position.'"" ""That is well understood by US diplomats... I think there will be a strong enough relationship between a new prime minister and the president to have that conversation,"" he added. An ex-British ambassador to the US and a close friend of Sir Kim's said there was a ""possible range of villains"" who potentially could have made the leak. Sir Christopher Meyer told Today: ""It was clearly somebody who set out deliberately to sabotage Sir Kim's ambassadorship, to make his position untenable and to have him replaced by somebody more congenial to the leaker."" Ivanka Trump, pictured arriving at a dinner Sir Kim was disinvited from on Monday, is due to meet the ambassador later Speaking on Monday following Mr Trump's initial commentson the leaked emails, Downing Street said the prime minister did not agree with Sir Kim's assessment but had ""full faith"" in him. Police were urged to open a criminal investigationinto the leak in addition to an internal inquiry launched by the government. Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the foreign affairs committee, told MPs he had made the request in a letter to the Met Police. The Met said it had received Mr Tugendhat's request but had not received an official governmental referral of allegations in relation to the Official Secrets Act. Such a referral would be required for a criminal investigation to be considered, a Met spokesman said. Downing Street's response is a classically formal ""thanks, but no thanks"". A stiff brush-off in riposte to the US president's digital tirade, which was extraordinary even by his standards. With the current prime minister almost out of the door, and the UK ambassador in Washington leaving too, the remarks are unlikely to change much directly, and this allows Number 10 to try to shrug off the criticism. Less officially, though, there is real frustration. One senior Tory warned that ""we cannot bow down to this form of lunacy"" where the leader of another country tries to use online swagger to seek revenge on one of the UK's diplomats - not least from one of our most important allies. Read more from Laura Confidential emails from the UK's ambassador,leaked to the Mail on Sunday,,externalcontained a string of criticisms of Mr Trump and his administration, describing the White House as ""clumsy and inept"". Sir Kim, who became ambassador to the US in January 2016 about a year before Mr Trump took office, questioned whether this White House ""will ever look competent"" but also warned that the US president should not be written off. The emails, dating from 2017, said rumours of ""infighting and chaos"" in the White House were mostly true and policy on sensitive issues such as Iran was ""incoherent, chaotic"". This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""The ambassador has not served the UK well"" The US president responded to Sir Kim's comments published in the Mail on Sunday article by saying ""we're not big fans of that man and he has not served the UK well"". But on Monday Mr Trump escalated his response with a series of tweets criticising Mrs May and her handling of Brexit. ""What a mess she and her representatives have created,"" the US president said. ""I do not know the ambassador, but he is not liked or well thought of within the US. We will no longer deal with him."" He said that it was ""good news"" for the UK that it would soon have a new prime minister. The US state department declined to comment on Mr Trump's remarks, but the ambassador was disinvited from a dinner held at the White House on Monday night for the Emir of Qatar. Analysis by James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent By saying he won't deal with Sir Kim Darroch any more, Donald Trump is apparently all but declaring the ambassador to be persona non grata. That is the formal legal process by which a host government expels a foreign diplomat. The key question now is what the president means by the word ""deal"". If the royal ""we"" used by Mr Trump means that his entire administration will no longer deal with Sir Kim or any of his staff then the British government may have to decide to fast track the retirement of their man in Washington. Sir Kim, who is an honourable man and was stepping down anyway in a few months, may decide to resign. If, however, Mr Trump merely means he won't deal personally with Sir Kim then the ambassador may stay on until the new prime minister can make his own appointment. This all presents the British government with an awkward dilemma - to buckle under US pressure and bring Sir Kim home, risking accusations of abject weakness, or to stand firm and defend their ambassador for doing his job and telling the truth as he sees it, risking even further damage to the UK-US relationship.

"The safety of the public is being put at risk by thousands of prisoners being released without proper assessments, the government has been told. Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, also found suicides had risen by 15% in a year in England and Wales. In his 2018-19 annual report,,externalMr Clarke described the rising number of prisoner suicides and self-harm as a ""scandal"". He also found the response to the ""deluge of drugs"" in prisons had been ""too slow"" and ""unsophisticated"". In his report, Mr Clarke said thousands of prisoners who were potentially a ""high risk of harm"" to the public were being released ""without proper assessment"". An inmate's assessment should be regularly updated, he said, but sometimes there was no document at all or the paperwork was out of date. He added that the response to the problem, which had been raised repeatedly, had been ""poor"". Reality Check: What's the problem with prisons? How Norway turns criminals into good neighbours There were 83 suicides in male prisons in 2018-19, an increase from 72 the previous year, the report said. Mr Clarke said levels of self-harm were ""disturbingly high"", rising in two thirds of the adult male prisons inspected. He suggested that it was time for an independent inquiry to tackle the ""scandal"" of people dying in state care in ""preventable circumstances"". Mr Clarke said he would ""never forget"" the squalid conditions he encountered on a visit to Birmingham prison. He recalled a blood-stained shower, which was littered with rat droppings. Birmingham had the worst examples of living conditions, his report said, with cells ""dirty, cramped and overcrowded"". Vulnerable prisoners were found living in squalid cells which were not fit for habitation. ""Rubbish was left lying around in bags and there were problems with fleas, cockroaches and rodents,"" the report said. One prisoner lived in a ""filthy flooded cell"" and the blood of another - who had self-harmed two days earlier - had not been cleaned from the floor. The report warned the ""appalling impact"" of illicit drugs in prisons had been underestimated. Mr Clarke said there was a ""reluctance"" to invest in available technology to detect drugs which was a ""great shame"" given their ""destructive impact"". The report also found: Out of 28 prisons inspected, 22 were found to be unsafe Outcomes for women prisoners was better than for men A ""large cohort"" of sex offenders could not access rehabilitation programmes in prisons Half of the children in custody surveyed said they had been restrained during their time in detention - the highest figure since records began in 2002 Levels of violence also remained high at young offender institutions and secure training centres with bullying a ""constant concern"" Mr Clarke praised the ""bravery"" of prison staff, saying their work was ""difficult, often dangerous, largely unseen by the public and, as a result, little understood"". The Ministry of Justice said it had improved its ""risk assessment and sentencing planning processes"" and high-risk prisoners were subject to ""various strict risk assessments"". It also said it had improved the provision of mental health support and trained staff on how to care for inmates at risk of self-harm. Deborah Coles, director of charity Inquest, said ""self-harm, violence and deaths"" were endemic in the prison system and recommendations were ""systemically ignored"". She called for urgent action to reduce the use of prison, redirect resources into community alternatives and ""hold those involved legally accountable for deaths across all state institutions"".

Instagram has been under pressure to deal with its bullying problem after high profile cases,including the suicide of British teenager Molly Russell. In a blog post,external, the firmâs chief executive Adam Mosseri said his firm âcould do moreâ on the issue. ""We can do more to prevent bullying from happening on Instagram, and we can do more to empower the targets of bullying to stand up for themselves,â Mr Mosseri wrote. ""These tools are grounded in a deep understanding of how people bully each other and how they respond to bullying on Instagram, but theyâre only two steps on a longer path.â âRethinkâ Instagram said it was using artificial intelligence to recognise when text resembles the kind of posts that are most often reported as inappropriate by users. In one example, a person types âyou are so ugly and stupidâ, only to be interrupted with a notice saying: âAre you sure you want to post this? Learn moreâ. If the user taps âlearn moreâ, a notice informs: âWe are asking people to rethink comments that seem similar to others that have been reported.â Molly Russell, 14, took her own life in 2017 The user can ignore the message and post anyway, but Instagram said in early tests that ""we have found that it encourages some people to undo their comment and share something less hurtful once they have had a chance to reflect.â The tool is being rolled out to English-speaking users at first, with plans to eventually make it available globally, Instagram told the BBC. Restricted The company said it will soon roll out an additional tool, called Restrict, designed to help teens filter abusive comments without resorting to blocking others - a blunt move that could have repercussions in the real world. ""Weâve heard from young people in our community that theyâre reluctant to block, unfollow, or report their bully because it could escalate the situation, especially if they interact with their bully in real life,â Mr Mosseri said. ""Some of these actions also make it difficult for a target to keep track of their bullyâs behaviour.â Once a user has been restricted, their comments will appear only to themselves. Crucially, a restricted person will not know they have been restricted. ""You can choose to make a restricted personâs comments visible to others by approving their comments,â Mr Mosseri explained. ""Restricted people wonât be able to see when youâre active on Instagram or when youâve read their direct messages.â âNo excuseâ Bullying on social media, particularly Instagram, was brought into tragic focus earlier this year. The father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life, said distressing content about depression and suicide on Instagram were partly responsible for his daughter's death. In April, the British government published itsOnline Harms white paper,external, a policy proposal that sought tighter controls on technology firms. It suggests the creation of an independent regulator to direct ways in which firms should deal with all manner of abuse, including bullying. The paper was met with a mixed response, withsome questioning its efficacy, and fears it could be overreaching,external. This video can not be played WATCH: Instagram boss Adam Mosseri discussed its anti-bullying plans in an interview in June At Facebookâs recent developer conference, Mr Mosseri said a key focus of Instagram - which Facebook owns - is to tackle the bullying issue. âItâs really encouraging to see that the new feature has been rolled out,â said Alex Holmes, deputy chief executive of the Anti-Bullying at the Diana Award, and a long-time anti-bullying advocate. The group has received some funding from Facebook for real-world anti-bullying initiatives in schools. Mr Holmes told the BBC he felt social media firms could still do more to actively teach users about decent behaviour. ""If you are under 18, you should have to go through awareness building when you sign up,â he said. ""I think it would be a pretty simple thing, for the first five minutes, to go through. Platforms should be able to make the issue of safety more appealing, more engaging.""

"Chinese and Indian ethnic group workers have higher average earnings than their white British counterparts, the first detailed official figures show. But the dataon the ethnicity pay gap,external, showed all other ethnic groups have lower wages than white British workers. The Office for National Statistics said employees in the Bangladeshi ethnic group have the largest pay gap, earning 20% less than white British employees. On average, ethnic minorities earn 3.8% less than white ethnic groups. The categories are the official ones used by ONS. In 2018, employees from the Chinese ethnic group earned 30.9% more than white British employees. Hugh Stickland, senior ONS analyst, said: ""Overall, employees from certain ethnic groups such as Indian and Chinese, have higher average earnings than their white British counterparts. ""However, all other ethnic groups have average wages lower than for white British employees, with employees from the Bangladeshi ethnic group having the largest pay gap. ""However, once characteristics such as education and occupation are taken into account, the pay gap between white British and most other ethnic groups becomes narrower, though significant differences still remain."" The data - based on median gross hourly earnings between 2012 and 2018 - shows that the Chinese ethnicity group is the highest paid, receiving Â£15.75 an hour in 2018. That group is followed by the Indian ethic group - which earns Â£13.47 an hour - and mixed/multiple ethnicity group, with a Â£12.33 hourly pay rate. The median pay of the white British group was Â£12.03. The Bangladeshi group had the lowest median hourly pay of Â£9.60 with the second-lowest paid group being of Pakistani origin at Â£10 an hour. The data comes after areport last year from the Resolution Foundation foundblack and ethnic minority workers were paid significantly less than their white counterparts. ""The harsh reality is that even today race still plays a real role in determining pay,"" said Frances O'Grady, general secretary of the TUC. ""Ministers must take bold action to confront inequality and racism in the labour market. The obvious first step is to introduce mandatory ethnicity pay gap reporting without delay,"" she said. The governmenthas consulted on whether mandatory reportingwill help address disparities between the pay and career prospects of minorities. The government has already introduced mandatory reporting on the gender pay gap - which standsat 9.6% in favour of men- and the ONS data also shows discrepancies in male and female earnings in the ethnic groups. The Chinese and Indian groups, which both have the highest rate of hourly pay, were among those with the biggest gender gaps. Chinese men on average earned 19.1% more than women and Indian men earned 23.2% more than women. But women in the Bangladeshi ethnic group earn more than their male counterparts - with a 10.5% gap. The ONS said, though, that the sample size for the Bangladeshi group was smaller and susceptible to inaccuracy compared with other ethnic groups. London, which has the highest proportion of its population classified as an ethnic minority group, also has the largest pay gap of 21.7%. The ONS found this gap was reversed in other parts of Britain.  In the north-east of England, for instance, employees from an ethnic minority group had average earnings that were 6.5% more than the average earnings of white employees. The ONS says that where someone is born can have an influence on how much they are paid. ""By comparing those who were born in the UK and those who were not, it may give us an idea of what sort of effect having a UK education and the higher likelihood of speaking English as a first language may have on those from an ethnic minority background,"" the ONS said. It found those in the Bangladeshi ethnic group - who had been born in the UK - earned 8% less than white British employees. But for Bangladeshi  employees born outside the UK the gap was 26.8%. When taking other factors into account, such as education, UK-born employees in the Indian and Chinese ethnic groups do not have pay gaps that are ""statistically different"" from the UK-born white British employees, the ONS found. For example, almost a third of workers in the Indian ethnic group work in professional roles which means they tend to be higher-paid.

"This video can not be played Corbyn: 'We will give people a choice' Jeremy Corbyn has challenged the next Tory leader to hold another referendum before taking Britain out of the EU, saying Labour will campaign for Remain. Mr Corbyn says the party will take this position to stop ""no deal or a damaging Tory Brexit"". But he does not say what he would do if he won a general election and was placed in charge of the Brexit process. Some senior members of his team want him to take a pro-Remain stance in all circumstances. In an interview with the BBC's John Pienaar, Mr Corbyn saidLabour was now the ""party of choice"" when it came to Brexit. He said he had done ""what I think a leader should do... an awful lot of listening"" - to party members, unions and the wider Labour movement - before coming to a revised position. He said he would ""make a case"" to Parliament in September to get another referendum and in the meantime, Labour will ""do everything we can to take no deal off the table or stop a damaging deal of the sort Hunt or Johnson propose"". Labour's long and winding road to another referendum Asked if he had changed his position because of pressure from colleagues, Mr Corbyn said: ""Not a bit of it. I've been listening and I've enjoyed it."" Mr Corbyn said he could not say what Labour's position would be at a general election, but would decide it ""very quickly"", depending on the circumstances at the time, whenever one was called. In a letter to members, he said Labour continued to believe the ""compromise plan"" set out for Brexit during cross-party talks with the government earlier this year was a ""sensible alternative that could bring the country together"". This included a customs union, a strong single market relationship and the protection of environmental regulations and rights at work. Can the next PM force through a no-deal Brexit? What is 'no deal'? How could another Brexit referendum work? Mr Corbyn's statement followed a shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, and a meeting with trade union leaders on Monday. The bosses of Labour's five-biggest affiliated unions called for the move the party has made - but also for it to hold a ""confirmatory vote"" on any new deal it negotiated if Labour won a general election. The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said there was disagreement about the second part of the unions' stance in shadow cabinet, with deputy leader Tom Watson wanting a ""straight Remain stance"", meaning a decision on it was ""kicked down the road"". The deputy leader is among leading figures who have argued that confusion over Labour's message on Brexit contributed to its poor performance in the recent European Parliament elections. Mr Watson said he was ""happy"" with the new Brexit position ""up to the election"", but the party had ""yet to cross that bridge"" when it comes to its manifesto for the next election. ""Our members have been telling us for some time now that they want us to be a Remain party and that they want us to put the new deal to the people,"" he added. ""We're now going to campaign for that and I'm very proud that the shadow cabinet have now listened to their concerns."" Unions agree Brexit vote stance Labour must 'get on with' changing Brexit policy Don't panic over Brexit, McCluskey tells Labour Shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis said if a snap election was called, Labour would try to renegotiate the Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May, despite saying it ""very much looks like"" Labour is now the party of Remain. He told the BBC's Politics Live: ""If we win that general election, we will come into power, and if we can renegotiate that deal - a Labour deal - we will, because that's what people asked for."" Some Labour MPs, including Brexit-backing John Mann and Emma Lewell-Buck, said the party could lose votes in Leave-supporting areas as a result of the policy. Ms Lewell-Buck, who quit her shadow minister rolein opposition to a further referendum, said she was ""concerned"" and had a ""heavy heart"" over the decision. ""But I am also very clear that I am representing my constituents and I will continue to do that no matter what because they are the people who put me where I am,"" she said. By Nick Eardley, BBC political correspondent There's always a ""but"", it seems, when it comes to Labour and Brexit. What the party is saying explicitly is that it'll try to force the new PM to hold another referendum and if that happens it will back Remain. But we don't know what Labour would do in the event of a general election. The feeling among some Labour people is, ""If you think it was hard to get here, trying to come to a manifesto position is going to be even harder,"" so they're just not going there yet. Sometimes it feels Labour has been dragged kicking and screaming towards positions on Brexit, but it has at least got to a new one today. The question is whether it'll have to go further at some point. Some on the Remain wing will be delighted with Jeremy Corbyn's shift, but others will feel there's more to do. Former Labour MP Chris Leslie - who left the party to found Remain-backing Change UK - said Mr Corbyn's stance had ""confirmed that if you vote Labour, you'll get Brexit"". He said the position ""wasn't good enough"", adding: ""Brexit - whether a Labour Brexit or a Conservative Brexit - will cost people's jobs, put businesses in jeopardy, and diminish Britain in the eyes of our neighbours. ""Corbyn's refusal to be honest about that fact is a deep betrayal of the people Labour used to represent."" The Liberal Democrat's Brexit spokesperson, Tom Brake, said Labour ""are still a party of Brexit"". He added: ""Jeremy Corbyn can pretend all he likes that the Labour Party are finally moving towards backing the Liberal Democrat policy of a People's Vote, but it is clear it is still his intention to negotiate a damaging Brexit deal if he gets the keys to No 10."" But Miriam Mirwitch, chair of Young Labour, welcomed the move, adding: ""This vital shift shows that Labour is a party centred around democracy that has listened to what it's members have wanted for some time: a People's Vote in which Labour campaigns to Remain."" June 2017- Labour's general election manifesto accepts referendum result 28 September 2018- Labour agrees if a general election cannot be achieved it ""must support all optionsâ¦ including campaigning for a public vote"" November 2018- Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says Labour will ""inevitably"" back a second referendum if unable to secure general election 16 January 2019- 71 Labour MPs say they support a public vote 6 February 2019- Mr Corbyn writes a letter to Mrs May seeking five changes to her Brexit policy with no mention of a ""People's Vote"" 25 February 2019- Labour says it will back a public vote if its proposed Brexit deal is rejected 14 March 2019- Labour orders its MPs to abstain on an amendment calling for a second referendum 27 March 2019- The party instructs its MPs to support Margaret Beckett's amendment which calls for a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal 30 April 2019- NEC agrees that the European election manifesto will commit to a further referendum under certain circumstances 9 July 2019- Labour calls on the next PM to hold a referendum and pledges to campaign for Remain against ""no deal or a damaging Tory Brexit"" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Russian President Vladimir Putin presents flowers to editor-in-chief of Russian broadcaster RT Margarita Simonyan at an award ceremony in May Russia's RT and Sputnik news agencies have been banned from attending a conference on media freedom in London for playing an ""active role in spreading disinformation"". Around 60 ministers and 1,000 reporters and members of civil society are due to attend the event this week. But the UK Foreign Office refused accreditation to both RT and Sputnik. The Russian Embassy called the decision ""direct politically motivated discrimination"". A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office, which organised the conference, said: ""We have not accredited RT or Sputnik because of their active role in spreading disinformation. While it's not possible to accommodate all requests for accreditation, journalists from across the world's media are attending the conference, including from Russia."" The Russian Embassy said it had complained to the Foreign Office over the decision, accusing the UK of a ""months-long smear campaign"" against RT. RT said in a statement: ""It takes a particular brand of hypocrisy to advocate for freedom of press while banning inconvenient voices and slandering alternative media."" Sputnik said: ""Our goals are clearly indicated in our charter and spreading disinformation is not one of them."" This video can not be played What's so different about Russia Today? RT, which is backed by the Russian state and was formerly known as Russia Today, has in recent years increased its coverage of UK and US news, attempting to position itself as an alternative to mainstream media outlets in both countries. In December, the channel was found by UK broadcast regulator Ofcom to have committed seven breaches of the UK's broadcasting code during its coverage of the Novichok poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. Ofcom said RT failed to give due weight to a range of voices and called the breaches ""a serious failure of compliance"". Russian news channel RT broke TV impartiality rules, Ofcom says The Foreign Office said the international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney would attend this week's event as Britain's special envoy on media freedom.

"Environmental work could include reducing the risk of flooding by restoring floodplain woodlands Farmers in Wales would be offered money to carry out work which protects and enhances the environment, under new post-Brexit farming proposals. Ministers had proposed two grant schemes to replace EU funding, but the latest proposal rolls them into one. Welsh farmers receive subsidies worth about Â£300m a year from the EU, making up 80% of their income on average. However, it is not known how much money will be available to support agriculture after the UK leaves the EU. The Welsh Government is asking people's views on its new plans afteran earlier consultation attracted a record-breaking number of responses. The Sustainable Farming Scheme will pay for work to cut greenhouse gas emissions, create habitats for wildlife and improve water quality. Boris Johnson wants say in spending post-Brexit aid cash Suspicions over 'rewilding' scheme Food producers have 'major post-Brexit worries' Farms will be visited by an adviser who will draw up a contract based on the environmental benefits they agree the farmer is, or could be delivering. They will be rewarded for new environmental work - like planting new woodlands - but also for maintaining and enhancing what is already there. Farmers will also be able to access a range of business support, such as help with skills development or loans for new equipment. Environment and rural affairs minister Lesley Griffiths says the scheme will help pay farmers while protecting the environment The scheme will help address challenges in sustainable food production, responding to climate change and increasing biodiversity, according to minister for the environment and rural affairs Lesley Griffiths. ""We believe future farm support should reflect this and reward farmers who take action to meet these challenges,"" she explained. Ms Griffiths had initially hoped the new funding scheme would be phased in from 2021. That aim has been dropped due to ongoing uncertainty around Brexit - which Ms Griffiths described as ""incredibly frustrating"" - but a multi-year transition is still promised. Dairy farmer Abi Reader said uncertainty around Brexit made it difficult to plan for the future Dairy farmer Abi Reader from Wenvoe, Vale of Glamorgan, said it was ""complicated to plan when we don't know what is happening with Brexit"". She said the subsidy was a ""safety net"" that helped her business to remain viable. ""We have high costs of production here because of things like our welfare standards, our environmental standards - which are world leading - and we need that little bit of protection to make sure that we can continue trading,"" she told BBC Radio Wales. Farmers have until 30 October to respond to the latest consultation, and have been offered the chance to ""co-design"" the final proposals in the autumn. More than 12,000 responses were received the last time views were sought on farming after Brexit - a record for the rural affairs department. Reversing a decline in biodiversity is one of the three challenges the Welsh Government says it is trying to address The Farmers' Union of Wales (FUW) warned that removingdirect support payments based on how much land is farmedcould see Welsh farmers disadvantaged compared with their counterparts in the EU. ""This concern would also relate to competition with farmers in Scotland and Northern Ireland if those countries retain some form of direct support,"" said Glyn Roberts, FUW president. Plaid Cymru's rural affairs spokesman Llyr Gruffydd said the Welsh Government had been ""stung into a change in tone"" after a ""hostile reaction"" to its earlier consultation.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt traded jibes in a feisty debate on ITV Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt have clashed on Brexit and UK relations with Donald Trump in a lively and occasionally bad-tempered TV debate. Mr Hunt accused his rival of not being willing to ""put his neck on the line"" by saying he would quit as PM if he did not hit the 31 October deadline. Mr Johnson said he admired his rival's ability ""to change his mind"" so often - a dig at the fact Mr Hunt voted Remain. Mr Johnson declined to condemn Mr Trump for his response tothe emails row. He refused to confirm whether he would keep the UK's top diplomat in the US, Sir Kim Darroch, in his post until his scheduled retirement in December, afterMr Trump said he was no longer prepared to deal with him. The US president has lambasted Sir Kim, and criticised Theresa May, after the diplomat described the White House as ""inept and dysfunctional"" in leaked cables. While stressing the value of the ""special relationship"" with the US, Mr Johnson insisted that only he, as prime minister, would take ""important and politically sensitive"" decisions such as who should represent the UK in the US. As it happened: Leaders debate Johnson v Hunt fact-checked Tory leadership: Compare the candidates During the first head-to-head debate of the leadership campaign, the two clashed over their different Brexit strategies, political styles and why they were best equipped to be prime minister. The exchanges were pointed and personal in nature at times, with former Mayor of London Mr Johnson dismissing his opponent's ""managerial"" style of politics and accusing him of flip-flopping on certain issues. This video can not be played Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt said the UK needed a leader not a ""newspaper columnist"" - a reference to his rival's work for the Daily Telegraph. He joked that he admired Mr Johnson's ""ability to answer the question"", adding: ""He puts a smile on your face and you forget what the question was, a great quality for a politician but not necessarily a prime minister."" After an opening speech from each contender, the foreign secretary immediately went on the attack over Brexit, pressing his rival on whether he would quit Downing Street if he failed to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October. He said by failing to answer the question, Mr Johnson - who previously said the deadline was a ""do or die"" issue for him - showed he was motivated by personal ambition not leadership. ""It is not do or die,"" Mr Hunt said. ""It is Boris in Number 10 that matters."" Accusing his rival of not being straight with the electorate, he said: ""Being prime minister is about telling people what they need to hear, not just what they want to hear."" Mr Johnson, in turn, said it was clear his rival was ""not absolutely committed"" to the deadline himself, branding him ""defeatist"". He urged Mr Hunt to guarantee that Brexit would happen by Christmas, adding that the EU would not take a ""papier mache deadline"" seriously. What's Jeremy Hunt's track record? And how does Boris Johnson's record compare? Do the people choosing the next PM think like you? ""If we are going to have a 31 October deadline, we must stick to it,"" he said. ""The EU will understand we are ready and will give us the deal we need. ""I don't want to hold out to the EU the prospect that they might encourage my resignation by refusing to agree a deal. ""I think it is extraordinary we should be telling the British electorate we are willing to kick the can down the road. ""I would like to know how many more days my opponent would be willing to delay."" Both men have said they would be prepared to leave the EU without a deal, but Mr Johnson has been far more relaxed about the impact that could have. Bid to make no deal more difficult scrapes through Do MPs have the power to stop no deal? What would no deal look like? Mr Hunt suggested his rival was ""minimising the risk of a no-deal Brexit"" and ""peddling optimism"", but Mr Johnson said the UK had had a ""bellyful of defeatism"" and the UK could look forward to a bright future outside the EU. The pair also disagreed over whether they might be prepared to suspend Parliament to force through a no-deal exit - so-called prorogation. While Mr Hunt categorically ruled this out, Mr Johnson said he would ""not take anything off the table"". Both teams will leave Salford content with their candidates' performance. The gaffe prone former foreign secretary avoided slipping on any banana skins, and managing not to commit on some of the more controversial issues before him. And the current foreign secretary managed to land his blows on his opponent. There was perhaps though no jaw dropper, no moment that turned this race upside down. Mr Johnson arrived the favourite and leaves in the same position. Mr Hunt turned up keen to show that he is ready to use sharp elbows to scrap and to make himself heard with attacks on his rival that are a contrast to his normal careful style. Their respective status as the front runner and challenger may not have changed. Yet while Jeremy Hunt may not, from this performance alone, manage to stop Boris Johnson's journey to No 10, he has at least shown that if he gets there, he is likely to face a very tricky time. Read more from Laura On the escalating diplomatic row with the US, Mr Hunt said the president's criticism of Sir Kim Darroch had been ill-judged and he would, if he became PM, not be forced into recalling the diplomat early. He also took issue with Mr Trump for saying the prime minister had failed to listen to his advice and been made to look ""foolish"" over Brexit. ""His comments about Theresa May were unacceptable and I don't think he should have made them,"" he said, remarks which prompted audience applause. Mr Johnson said the US president had been ""dragged into a British political debate"" not of his making, but did suggest his outburst on Twitter - in which he called Sir Kim a ""pompous fool"" - had ""not necessarily been the right thing to do"". While civil servants must be able to give confidential advice, he declined to comment on Sir Kim's future, only asking Mr Hunt to rule out ""extending his term out of sympathy"". Both men have been criticised for making uncosted spending promises and offers of tax cuts during the campaign. Mr Hunt sought to make capital out of Mr Johnson's pledge to give a tax cut to higher earners by raising the threshold at which people pay 40% tax from Â£50,000 to Â£80,000. ""It was a mistake, tax cuts for the rich,"" he said. ""I have spent my life trying to persuade people that we are not the party of the rich."" Mr Johnson defended what he said was a ""package"" of measures to reduce the tax burden for both low and middle earners and which he said would boost the economy. The show, entitled Britain's Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate, was hosted by journalist Julie Etchingham in front of a studio audience of 200 people at MediaCityUK in Salford. It took place as 160,000 or so party members get the chance to vote by post on who should succeed Theresa May. The winner and next PM will be revealed on 23 July - it will be the first time a sitting prime minister has been chosen by party members.

"The Fish and The Chip opened two years ago A fish and chip restaurant has closed down after the owners said they felt ""uncomfortable"" about the environmental impact of their business. The Fish and The Chip, in St Nicholas Place, Leicester, was billed as a modern take on traditional fish and chips when it opened in 2017. However, its owners said a recent fishing trip had got them thinking about its green footprint. They said they were working on a new food-based venture. The building has now been put up for sale A notice placed in the restaurant's window said: ""Our fishing trip was great but turned out to be a bit of an eye-opener. ""We saw the impact pollution is having on the oceans and fish stocks and we are not comfortable running a restaurant that has an impact on our environment."" The owners posted a sign explaining their decision to close They did not say what form their new venture would take but said it would be based around ""gluten-free, plant-based food"". Owner Aatkin Anadkat said his main concerns were declining fish numbers around the world and fish eating plastic particles found in the water. He said: ""Effectively you're serving your customers that and they're consuming it."" The WWF has described overfishing as one of the most significant drivers of declines in ocean wildlife populations and scientists recently said cod levels in the North Seahad fallen to critical levels. Owner Aatkin Anadkat said he was worried about serving fish that had eaten plastic particles Mr Anadkat said he also understood some people might suspect the restaurant was actually being closed for business reasons. He said: ""There is more than one reason - as with most things - but I've learned along the way that if something doesn't feel good, then you shouldn't do it. ""We're not going to be opening another site but we're certainly in the plant-based food business and it's a nice place to be."" The Fish and The Chip described itself as ""the modern chippy"" when it opened in 2017 A spokeswoman for The Vegan Society said: ""The number of vegans has quadrupled in the last four years and there are also increasing numbers of consumers looking for a more sustainable and compassionate diet who are keen to try more vegan food. ""This is the perfect moment for this business to move to being a full-time vegan one."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Veggie farmer gives away beef herd 'Cancer on your family' sign left for butcher The fishy ingredient in beer that bothers vegetarians Mr Anadkat said he was also concerned about falling fish numbers Malcolm Hunter, from Friends of the Earth in Leicester, said: ""Halting climate change and protecting biodiversity doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up eating fish - or meat and dairy entirely - but we do need to substantially reduce our consumption.

"This video can not be played Corbyn: 'We will give people a choice' Jeremy Corbyn has challenged the next Tory leader to hold another referendum before taking Britain out of the EU, saying Labour will campaign for Remain. Mr Corbyn says the party will take this position to stop ""no deal or a damaging Tory Brexit"". But he does not say what he would do if he won a general election and was placed in charge of the Brexit process. Some senior members of his team want him to take a pro-Remain stance in all circumstances. In an interview with the BBC's John Pienaar, Mr Corbyn saidLabour was now the ""party of choice"" when it came to Brexit. He said he had done ""what I think a leader should do... an awful lot of listening"" - to party members, unions and the wider Labour movement - before coming to a revised position. He said he would ""make a case"" to Parliament in September to get another referendum and in the meantime, Labour will ""do everything we can to take no deal off the table or stop a damaging deal of the sort Hunt or Johnson propose"". Labour's long and winding road to another referendum Asked if he had changed his position because of pressure from colleagues, Mr Corbyn said: ""Not a bit of it. I've been listening and I've enjoyed it."" Mr Corbyn said he could not say what Labour's position would be at a general election, but would decide it ""very quickly"", depending on the circumstances at the time, whenever one was called. In a letter to members, he said Labour continued to believe the ""compromise plan"" set out for Brexit during cross-party talks with the government earlier this year was a ""sensible alternative that could bring the country together"". This included a customs union, a strong single market relationship and the protection of environmental regulations and rights at work. Can the next PM force through a no-deal Brexit? What is 'no deal'? How could another Brexit referendum work? Mr Corbyn's statement followed a shadow cabinet meeting on Tuesday morning, and a meeting with trade union leaders on Monday. The bosses of Labour's five-biggest affiliated unions called for the move the party has made - but also for it to hold a ""confirmatory vote"" on any new deal it negotiated if Labour won a general election. The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said there was disagreement about the second part of the unions' stance in shadow cabinet, with deputy leader Tom Watson wanting a ""straight Remain stance"", meaning a decision on it was ""kicked down the road"". The deputy leader is among leading figures who have argued that confusion over Labour's message on Brexit contributed to its poor performance in the recent European Parliament elections. Mr Watson said he was ""happy"" with the new Brexit position ""up to the election"", but the party had ""yet to cross that bridge"" when it comes to its manifesto for the next election. ""Our members have been telling us for some time now that they want us to be a Remain party and that they want us to put the new deal to the people,"" he added. ""We're now going to campaign for that and I'm very proud that the shadow cabinet have now listened to their concerns."" Unions agree Brexit vote stance Labour must 'get on with' changing Brexit policy Don't panic over Brexit, McCluskey tells Labour Shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis said if a snap election was called, Labour would try to renegotiate the Brexit deal agreed by Theresa May, despite saying it ""very much looks like"" Labour is now the party of Remain. He told the BBC's Politics Live: ""If we win that general election, we will come into power, and if we can renegotiate that deal - a Labour deal - we will, because that's what people asked for."" Some Labour MPs, including Brexit-backing John Mann and Emma Lewell-Buck, said the party could lose votes in Leave-supporting areas as a result of the policy. Ms Lewell-Buck, who quit her shadow minister rolein opposition to a further referendum, said she was ""concerned"" and had a ""heavy heart"" over the decision. ""But I am also very clear that I am representing my constituents and I will continue to do that no matter what because they are the people who put me where I am,"" she said. By Nick Eardley, BBC political correspondent There's always a ""but"", it seems, when it comes to Labour and Brexit. What the party is saying explicitly is that it'll try to force the new PM to hold another referendum and if that happens it will back Remain. But we don't know what Labour would do in the event of a general election. The feeling among some Labour people is, ""If you think it was hard to get here, trying to come to a manifesto position is going to be even harder,"" so they're just not going there yet. Sometimes it feels Labour has been dragged kicking and screaming towards positions on Brexit, but it has at least got to a new one today. The question is whether it'll have to go further at some point. Some on the Remain wing will be delighted with Jeremy Corbyn's shift, but others will feel there's more to do. Former Labour MP Chris Leslie - who left the party to found Remain-backing Change UK - said Mr Corbyn's stance had ""confirmed that if you vote Labour, you'll get Brexit"". He said the position ""wasn't good enough"", adding: ""Brexit - whether a Labour Brexit or a Conservative Brexit - will cost people's jobs, put businesses in jeopardy, and diminish Britain in the eyes of our neighbours. ""Corbyn's refusal to be honest about that fact is a deep betrayal of the people Labour used to represent."" The Liberal Democrat's Brexit spokesperson, Tom Brake, said Labour ""are still a party of Brexit"". He added: ""Jeremy Corbyn can pretend all he likes that the Labour Party are finally moving towards backing the Liberal Democrat policy of a People's Vote, but it is clear it is still his intention to negotiate a damaging Brexit deal if he gets the keys to No 10."" But Miriam Mirwitch, chair of Young Labour, welcomed the move, adding: ""This vital shift shows that Labour is a party centred around democracy that has listened to what it's members have wanted for some time: a People's Vote in which Labour campaigns to Remain."" June 2017- Labour's general election manifesto accepts referendum result 28 September 2018- Labour agrees if a general election cannot be achieved it ""must support all optionsâ¦ including campaigning for a public vote"" November 2018- Shadow chancellor John McDonnell says Labour will ""inevitably"" back a second referendum if unable to secure general election 16 January 2019- 71 Labour MPs say they support a public vote 6 February 2019- Mr Corbyn writes a letter to Mrs May seeking five changes to her Brexit policy with no mention of a ""People's Vote"" 25 February 2019- Labour says it will back a public vote if its proposed Brexit deal is rejected 14 March 2019- Labour orders its MPs to abstain on an amendment calling for a second referendum 27 March 2019- The party instructs its MPs to support Margaret Beckett's amendment which calls for a confirmatory public vote on any Brexit deal 30 April 2019- NEC agrees that the European election manifesto will commit to a further referendum under certain circumstances 9 July 2019- Labour calls on the next PM to hold a referendum and pledges to campaign for Remain against ""no deal or a damaging Tory Brexit"" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"The government is pumping nearly Â£40m into improving the infrastructure for electric vehicles despite a sharp drop in hybrid car sales. The Department for Transport will invest in UK engineering to ""transform"" the network of electric charge points. Wireless charging and ""pop-up"" pavement technology are among the investments being made. Sales of plug-in hybrid vehicles slumped by 50.4% in June after the government scrapped a Â£2,500 grant. But the DfT said it was ""focusing on the cleanest, zero emission models"". New UK car registrations for battery electric cars rose by 61.7% to 2,461 in June compared with the same month last year, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). However, the drop in demand for plug-in hybrid cars, which fell from sales of 4,571 vehicles last June to 2,268 vehicles last month, meant that overall the alternatively fuelled vehicle sector shrank for the first time since April 2017. Jaguar Land Rover announces electric car investment 'Grave concern' as sales of low emission cars fall Lack of electric car charging points 'putting off drivers' A DfT spokeswoman said: ""The plug-in car grant has supported the purchase of 180,000 new cars with over Â£700m, including 100,000 plug-in hybrids."" As well as scrapping the grant for plug-in hybrid models last year, the government also reduced the subsidy for pure electric cars from Â£4,500 to Â£3,500. It also announced last year that it would end the sale of all new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2040. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Nevertheless, the government is now investing Â£37m in a number of projects to make it easier for electric car owners to charge up their vehicles. The government's new investment marks the first anniversary of the launch of the government's Road to Zero strategy, which wants ""almost every car and van"" in the UK to be zero emission by 2050. It has handed Â£2.3m to a company called Char.gy, which is developing ways to deploy wireless charging technology on residential streets which would remove the need for trailing cables and additional infrastructure. Urban Foresight has been awarded Â£3m to roll out ""pop-up"" chargers which are built into the pavement, which are designed to help drivers without access to off-street parking. By Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent Wireless charging for electric vehicles - which means getting rid of cables - could be arriving on a small number of UK streets relatively soon, according to Char.gy, one of the firms that has received development funding from the government. ""We are mimicking a cable being plugged in"", says Richard Stobart, chief executive of Char.gy, the company behind the project which has been awarded Â£2.3m by the DfT. It works by installing a pad on the underside of an electric car. Once that aligns with another pad hidden underneath the road surface, electricity is passed to the car via a process known as induction. For now, virtually any fully electric car would have to be modified and fitted with a pad, costing around Â£1,000. That's where the government cash comes in. Under the pilot, some people will get the induction pads for free. Other residents in parts of Buckinghamshire, Milton Keynes and the London borough of Redbridge, where the scheme is being trialled, will be able to share the use of several car-club cars which will be fitted-out with induction pads. This wireless charging project should start running in 2020. At present, the UK has a network of more than 24,000 public charging connectors in nearly 9,000 locations, according to figures from the Department for Transport. Jaguar Land Rover recently announced that it would invest millions of pounds in the UK to build a range of electric cars at its Castle Bromwich plant in Birmingham. However, its chief executive Professor Ralph Speth criticised the number of charging points for electric cars in the UK. ""The current charging infrastructure is not really sufficient to cover the country, nor the hotspots of the cities. The government has to govern the process,"" he told the BBC.

"The government's attempts to find a technological solution to its Irish border Brexit problem have run into immediate difficulties with its own business advisers. The BBC has obtained internal documents, including the terms of reference which some of its business experts are refusing to sign off on. They are concerned the terms could be used to endorse a plan of action in the event of a no-deal Brexit. They are now asking for alterations. Brexit and the Irish border: A simple explanation Brexit: Can 'alternative arrangements' on Irish border secure a deal? Former Brexit chief: We should all worry about no deal Backstop 'replacement' rejected by business groups The Business and Trade Union Alternative Arrangements Advisory Group -mostly made up of Northern Ireland business leaders,external- is one of three committees recently appointed by the government to come up with and test ideas for ""alternative arrangements"" to the so-called backstop. They have been appointed by the Department for Exiting the European Union to advise on the feasibility of new technologies that could maintain the current free flowing Irish border after Brexit occurs. The document says that the ""purpose and objective"" of the group is that ""alternative arrangements should be considered without prejudice to the UK's future customs and regulatory relationship with the EU"". At a meeting, members of the committee asked ministers who were present to alter that objective to ensure their conclusions could not be used to endorse a no-deal Brexit. The document also ruled that the likely response of the Irish government and the European Union to new technological ideas were ""out of scope"". ""The focus of discussions should not be on the negotiability of proposals,"" the document says. Some participants at the meeting expressed concerns that there was no concrete commitment in the internal document to abide by the Joint Report - the 2017 agreement by the UK government and EU to avoid a hard border ""including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls"". Some dairy farmers are concerned they will have to cull their herds The Joint Report is not mentioned directly in the terms of reference nor in the background context paper prepared for all three advisory groups on alternative arrangements. It is only referred to in an accompanying presentation, also seen by BBC News, that says the need to comply with international obligations and commitments ""includes considering the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the 2017 Joint Report"". A source present at the meeting said that a number of concerns about the government approach to Northern Ireland were articulated at the meeting, including dairy farmers who process over a third of their milk across the border, warning that their herds would have to be culled. A government spokesperson said: 'We do not recognise this account of what have been a very constructive set of meetings with business leaders and technical experts. ""As is normal in a first meeting of advisory groups, some general comments were provided on our terms of reference, which we are finalising at present."" However, both Conservative leadership candidates, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, say they plan to use technology to replace the backstop - an insurance policy that dealt with the Irish border by assuming a period of UK alignment with Europe on most customs and regulations issues, even after Brexit. The Irish government and the EU have indicated openness to talk about technological solution, but expressed doubts that they will exist for many years, insisting that the backstop must be part of a negotiated EU exit.

"Frances Shiels, 67, from Londonderry was entitled to her state pension in May 2014, years earlier than she would have as a man A transgender woman has settled a case against the Department for Communities to back pay state pension entitlements. Frances Shiels, 67, from Londonderry, was entitled to her state pension in May 2014, years earlier than she would have as a man. However, as she had transitioned she needed proof that she was a woman. To do this, she was required to obtain a Gender Recognition Certificate to legally change her gender and get a new birth certificate. However, in Northern Ireland, unlike the rest of the UK, a person cannot receive such a certificate if they are married. As Frances was, she needed to get a divorce first. When Frances eventually received her Gender Recognition Certificate in May 2015 and applied for her state pension, she was told it would only be backdated to the date of the certificate and not the date she was entitled to start receiving her state pension, resulting in nine months of missed payments. This financial loss was the reason Frances took the case. ""Society in general discriminates, however unconsciously, about being transgender and I suppose this case that I took is an example of that in that I took it quite personally that as a genetic female I would have been allowed to claim my state retirement pension from age 63,"" she said. ""When I went to do that, I discovered that it could not be backdated until then because of my late transition and my inability up until then to get a Gender Recognition Certificate. ""I had never really thought of going for a Gender Recognition Certificate because I was in a marriage and I took those vows very seriously and it was not until the need for other people as well as myself to get that divorce that I was able to embark on that recognition process."" Frances did not start her transition until she turned 60. ""I had more than enough contributions to claim my state pension as a woman and I did not see why I could not claim it at the same age as every other woman,"" she said, She approached the Human Rights Commission to help fight her case. ""As transgender individuals we are not looking for additional rights or anything more favourable than anybody else in society,"" she said. ""However it is very, very important that those rights that we do have are enforced. For me it is not enough to be tolerated. ""I want to be accepted and respected in the same way as you would expect."" Les Allamby, chief commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, backed Frances' case as ""we felt it was discriminatory"". ""It's yet another example of a legislative change we need to make once the assembly and the executive is reconvened,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Communities said they noted the statement from the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, ""however the department does not comment on individual cases"".

"The government is pumping nearly Â£40m into improving the infrastructure for electric vehicles despite a sharp drop in hybrid car sales. The Department for Transport will invest in UK engineering to ""transform"" the network of electric charge points. Wireless charging and ""pop-up"" pavement technology are among the investments being made. Sales of plug-in hybrid vehicles slumped by 50.4% in June after the government scrapped a Â£2,500 grant. But the DfT said it was ""focusing on the cleanest, zero emission models"". New UK car registrations for battery electric cars rose by 61.7% to 2,461 in June compared with the same month last year, according to figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). However, the drop in demand for plug-in hybrid cars, which fell from sales of 4,571 vehicles last June to 2,268 vehicles last month, meant that overall the alternatively fuelled vehicle sector shrank for the first time since April 2017. Jaguar Land Rover announces electric car investment 'Grave concern' as sales of low emission cars fall Lack of electric car charging points 'putting off drivers' A DfT spokeswoman said: ""The plug-in car grant has supported the purchase of 180,000 new cars with over Â£700m, including 100,000 plug-in hybrids."" As well as scrapping the grant for plug-in hybrid models last year, the government also reduced the subsidy for pure electric cars from Â£4,500 to Â£3,500. It also announced last year that it would end the sale of all new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans by 2040. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Nevertheless, the government is now investing Â£37m in a number of projects to make it easier for electric car owners to charge up their vehicles. The government's new investment marks the first anniversary of the launch of the government's Road to Zero strategy, which wants ""almost every car and van"" in the UK to be zero emission by 2050. It has handed Â£2.3m to a company called Char.gy, which is developing ways to deploy wireless charging technology on residential streets which would remove the need for trailing cables and additional infrastructure. Urban Foresight has been awarded Â£3m to roll out ""pop-up"" chargers which are built into the pavement, which are designed to help drivers without access to off-street parking. By Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent Wireless charging for electric vehicles - which means getting rid of cables - could be arriving on a small number of UK streets relatively soon, according to Char.gy, one of the firms that has received development funding from the government. ""We are mimicking a cable being plugged in"", says Richard Stobart, chief executive of Char.gy, the company behind the project which has been awarded Â£2.3m by the DfT. It works by installing a pad on the underside of an electric car. Once that aligns with another pad hidden underneath the road surface, electricity is passed to the car via a process known as induction. For now, virtually any fully electric car would have to be modified and fitted with a pad, costing around Â£1,000. That's where the government cash comes in. Under the pilot, some people will get the induction pads for free. Other residents in parts of Buckinghamshire, Milton Keynes and the London borough of Redbridge, where the scheme is being trialled, will be able to share the use of several car-club cars which will be fitted-out with induction pads. This wireless charging project should start running in 2020. At present, the UK has a network of more than 24,000 public charging connectors in nearly 9,000 locations, according to figures from the Department for Transport. Jaguar Land Rover recently announced that it would invest millions of pounds in the UK to build a range of electric cars at its Castle Bromwich plant in Birmingham. However, its chief executive Professor Ralph Speth criticised the number of charging points for electric cars in the UK. ""The current charging infrastructure is not really sufficient to cover the country, nor the hotspots of the cities. The government has to govern the process,"" he told the BBC.

"Writing on the school wall in Senegal: Progress to widening access to education has stalled, says UN report Promises by world leaders to raise global education standards by 2030 are unlikely to be kept, warns the United Nations' education agency. Unesco says on current trends, 30% of adults and 20% of young people will still be illiterate in poor countries. There are 262 million young people without access to school, with the worst problems in sub-Saharan Africa. The UN agency warns that the numbers missing out on education are unlikely to fall much in the next decade. The report examines progress towards global targets, the ""sustainable development goals"", which in 2015 the international community committed to achieve by 2030. These included promises on education - but after four years, the projections from Unesco show, they are already off track and unlikely to be achieved without a significant change of direction. About 18% of children are without school places - and Unesco's report says on current trends this will have fallen to 14% by the end of the next decade, which will still mean 225 million out of school. World fails to reach millennium education targets 10 toughest places in the world for girls to go to school What's it like to start reading at 60? There had been more progress in the early years of the century, particularly in reducing the number of primary age children who do not even get the first basics of an education. Refugees in Chad: Conflicts have disrupted the educations of tens of millions The out-of-school rate for primary years had fallen from 15% to 9% between 2000 and 2008 - but, the report says, progress then seemed to stall. This has been linked to a reduction in overseas aid in the wake of the financial crash. But it also reflects the fact there is a hard-to-reach group of children whose chances of going to school have been disrupted by war and violence, being forced to become refugees, corruption and political failure. There are inequalities of access - such as barriers to girls and rural families getting an education. But the biggest gap is related to poverty - with only 4% of youngsters in low-income families staying on to the end of secondary school. A classroom in Uganda: The biggest challenges to get all children in school are in sub-Saharan Africa The report also highlights practical problems, such as an acute lack of trained teachers. The proportion of teachers with at least basic training has fallen in sub-Saharan Africa, so the problem is worse now than at the beginning of the century. The growing population has also been a challenge in this region - and 54% of all the children without school are now in sub-Saharan Africa, compared with 41% in 2000. Across the world, the Unesco report says, by 2030 about 90% of adults will be literate. But in low-income countries, there will still be 30% of adults who are illiterate. Unesco also highlights the differences in outcomes between developing countries. Liberia is among the least likely to provide education for all its children, with many school buildings being damaged by conflict and many teachers leaving the country. Ethiopia has seen an increase in access to schools But Ethiopia is seen as making much better progress, investing more than a quarter of its budget on education and raising the numbers of girls in school and female teachers. Nepal and Afghanistan are also seen as making considerable improvements in access to education. This is the latest in a series of missed education targets after high-profile international pledges - despite education being seen as important for improving health and prosperity in poorer countries and preventing extremism. Promises made in 1990 to ensure access to primary education were not achieved by the deadline of 2000. Despite hardships, Afghanistan is commended for widening access to school These were replaced by millennium goals for improving global education, which were missed by the 2015 deadline. These were followed by the sustainable development goals set in 2015. These promised that all children would be able to complete primary and secondary education by 2030. But, the report from Unesco says, after almost a third of the 15-year target has elapsed, the trends suggest these goals are likely to be missed. ""The world is far off track on achieving international commitments to education,"" the report says. ""For several years now, no progress has been made on access into primary and secondary education. Only one in two young people complete secondary school."" Global education targets missed 10 toughest places for girls to go to school What's it like to start reading at 60?
