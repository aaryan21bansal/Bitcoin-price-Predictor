He loved the club and epitomised the values we hold true â humility and pride in our community. ""On behalf of everyone at the Scarlets, we send our heartfelt condolences to Pat, Steven. James and all of Phil's family and friends at this incredibly sad time.""

"Beijing has reported 1,997 local Covid cases since 22 April A total of 166 Covid infections in China have been linked to a single bar in the capital Beijing, officials say. A government spokesman described the outbreak as ""ferocious"". All residents living in the area where the bar is located will be tested over the next three days. The number of infections in the city is low by international standards but high for China, which is the world's only major economy still maintaining a ""zero Covid"" policy. The outbreak was traced to a venue called the Heaven Supermarket Bar, in the well-known entertainment area of Sanlitun in Chaoyang district. Two buildings housing hundreds of people in Chaoyang were put under strict lockdown on Sunday after a positive case was reported, a residential committee worker told Reuters news agency. Some people in Beijing said they were sent texts telling them to report to authorities if they had recently visited Sanlitun's bars. Chinese officials have reversed the relaxation of some Covid rules in Beijing because of the outbreak. Most children in the capital will not return to school next week as originally planned, officials said. The capital has reported 1,997 local Covid cases since 22 April. Relief and caution as Shanghai returns to life China's overall policy of ""zero Covid"" remains in place and people catching Covid face quarantine or hospital.

"Wilson revealed her new relationship on Friday, describing her partner as her ""Disney princess"" An Australian newspaper has denied outing actress Rebel Wilson amid a storm of criticism over its reporting of her new relationship with a woman. On Friday, Wilson said she had found her ""Disney princess"" as she shared a selfie with her partner onInstagram,external. But on Saturday theSydney Morning Herald,externalrevealed it had known about the relationship before it was public and had given Wilson two days to comment. The Herald denied pressuring Wilson, saying it had ""simply asked questions"". But the paper has faced criticism on social media, with LGBTQ+ campaigners saying it was unacceptable to put pressure on people to come out. In response to a Twitter post saying it wasn't Wilson's choice to come out, the 42-year-old Australian actress, who is known for roles in Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect among others,said,externalit was a ""very hard situation but trying to handle it with grace"".

Wilson's post about her relationship with leisurewear designer Ramona Agruma prompted a wave of congratulations from fans and famous friends - along with more than 1.6 million likes. But a day later Andrew Hornery, a columnist at the Herald, revealed the paper had known about the relationship and contacted Wilson's representatives on Thursday morning - ""with an abundance of caution and respect"" - to request a comment. Writing in the Private Sydney column, Hornery said: ""In a perfect world, 'outing' same-sex celebrity relationships should be a redundant concept in 2022. Love is love, right? ""As Rebel Wilson knows, we do not live in a perfect world. ""So, it was with an abundance of caution and respect that this media outlet emailed Rebel Wilson's representatives on Thursday morning, giving her two days to comment on her new relationship with LA leisure wear designer Ramona Agruma, before publishing a single word."" Hornery went on to criticise Wilson, saying she instead ""opted to gazump the story"", adding that ""her choice to ignore our discreet, genuine and honest queries was, in our view, underwhelming"". BBC reporter Megha Mohan was among those on social media to criticise the paper's journalistic methods and the tone of the piece, saying: ""Still reeling from the fact that a publication gave someone a deadline to out them in 2022. Maybe I'm incredibly naive but this is what I imagined 90s gutter press was like and most journalists had huge standards change since then."" LGBTQ+ campaigners also criticised the paper. A Stonewall spokesperson said: ""Coming out is a deeply personal decision. Whether, when and how to come out should be decided by the individual, entirely on their terms. ""It is simply not OK to 'out' LGBTQ+ people or put pressure on us to come out. Media outlets should take care not to sensationalise LGBTQ+ lives and relationships."" Allow Twitter content?

But the Herald's editor, Bevan Shields,denied the paper had outed Wilson,external, saying it had made no decision about what it would have published. He wrote: ""Like other mastheads do every day, we simply asked questions and as standard practice included a deadline for a response. ""I had made no decision about whether or what to publish, and the Herald's decision about what to do would have been informed by any response Wilson supplied."" Shields added that the Private Sydney was a column ""in which the writer's interaction with his subjects is often part of the story"", adding it was not a ""standard news story"". Last month, Wilson told People magazine she had been set up with a new partner ""through a friend"" but refused to reveal their identity. She said: ""We spoke on the phone for weeks before meeting. And that was a really good way to get to know each other. ""It was a bit old-school in that sense - very romantic."" Wilson was previously in a relationship with businessman Jacob Busch. They made their red carpet debut as a couple in September 2020 at a gala in Monaco but appeared to confirm their split the following February. Earlier this year, Wilson followed in the footsteps of Graham Norton, Dame Joanna Lumley and Stephen Fry by hosting the Bafta film awards at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

"The Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he was confident new legislation would not break international law New legislation to change post-Brexit trade arrangements will not break international law, the Northern Ireland secretary has said. Brandon Lewis said he was confident the changes would be lawful. The UK government is due to publish legislation on Monday that wouldallow ministers to override parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocolkeeps Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. It prevents a hard border with the Republic of Ireland but means checks on some goods arriving from other parts of the UK. Critics of the move, including the Irish government, have said any unilateral action could breach international law. However Mr Lewis said that when people see the legislation ""they'll see it's focused on fixing the problems with the implementation of the protocol"". ""Doing so is not only within international law but works for people across the United Kingdom and respects the EU single market,"" he told BBC News NI's Sunday Politics programme. Earlier, Mr Lewis told the Sunday Morning programme the UK government would also set out its legal position when introducing the legislation. He said the legal position would ""make sure people see it is within international law"". On Saturday, BBC News NI economic editor John Campbell wrote that representatives from the food industry in Northern Ireland warned thatscrapping the protocol could damage businesses. The Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association (NIFDA) told BBC News NI the protocol was working for the majority of its members. But Mr Lewis said businesses did not want to see ""uncertainty and instability"" and some industries, including hospitality, had been ""consistently clear that parts of the protocol are causing issues"". He added: ""When people see what we're proposing tomorrow, it is sensible solutions to the very issues that have been detrimental to businesses."" The trade deal governs how goods enter Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and was agreed by the UK government and the European Union following the Brexit vote in 2019. It was designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland when the UK left the European Union. The protocol led to the creation of new goods checks at Northern Ireland sea ports on some products from Great Britain, effectively creating a new trade border in the Irish Sea. Unionist parties, including the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), argue that this has led to extra costs and unnecessary delays, as well as undermining the union between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Read more:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem On Sunday, Irish newspaper theBusiness Post,externalreported that officials from the UK's Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) have written to agri-food businesses setting out what the changes will mean. The letter reportedly said ministers would remove all customs processes for goods moving within the United Kingdom and enable the frictionless movement of agri-food goods staying within the UK. It also indicated that businesses in Northern Ireland could have the ability to choose whether to follow UK or EU regulations, depending on who they are trading with. When asked on the Sunday Politics programme about the possibility of moving to a dual-regulatory system, Mr Lewis said the UK government wants a system ""where products that are moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland to be consumed or used within the UK can do so freely and flexibly"". The new law may allow for firms to choose whether goods follow UK or EU regulations, depending on who they are trading with ""That means giving businesses in Northern Ireland options and the ability to trade both ways as part of the United Kingdom, but have that free ability to trade with the (EU) single market. ""We think we've got a proposal that's very sensible and does that and can give confidence to the EU that there is no risk to the single market."" Any legislation would have to be approved by Parliament, a process which could take months. The legislation could also face challenges by both rebel MPs from within the Conservative Party - after therecent revolt against Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership- and in the House of Lords. The EU has previously acknowledged issues with the protocols and, last October, put forward its own proposals which it said would cut paperwork and checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. However, the UK rejected these plans saying they would make things worse. A row over the impact of the protocol has created ablock on forming a devolved government in Northern Ireland, with the DUP stopping the assembly from sitting or a new executive being formed since Sinn FÃ©in emerged as the largest party inMay's election. The DUP, which has the second highest number of Stormont seats,has refused to support the election of a new speaker or first and deputy first ministeruntil there is ""action"" on the protocol. Asked whether Monday's legislation could tempt the party to return to power-sharing, Mr Lewis said he hoped the DUP would see it ""resolves the issues they've been concerned about"". ""If the DUP are true to what they have said and the reason they withdrew around wanting to see positive progress on fixing the problems of the protocol, this legislation will do that,"" he added. But DUP MP Sammy Wilson said it was too early to make a final judgement on the legislation. ""It was supposed to be published on Thursday, it wasn't because there were still arguments within the cabinet and the Conservative Party on what should be contained in the legislation,"" he said. ""We have seen and have been told bits and pieces of what is there but since it has been a changing feast all week, until we see the final draft, then it's impossible for me to judge on."" During the past week, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson defended his party's saying that ""there is not cross-community support for the protocol"". Sinn FÃ©in has said any move by the UK government to change the protocol would be ""unacceptable to the wider public and majority of MLAs (Northern Ireland Assembly members) who support the protocol"". Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary-Lou McDonald said that the UK legislation would break international law and cause ""huge, huge damage"" to the Northern Irish and Irish economies. On Wednesday, the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) saidunilateral action on the protocol would mark a ""historic low"". Speaking at the European Parliament, MichÃ©al Martin said it was ""perfectly reasonable"" to want to make improvements to the protocol but warned that any attempt to do so outside the agreed joint mechanisms would damage the rule of law.

"The UK's competition watchdog has been asked to conduct an urgent review into whether a 5p fuel duty cut is being passed on quickly enough to drivers. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has urged the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to examine the fuel market and whether there are local variations in petrol and diesel prices. The cost of filling an average family car has now hit a record Â£100. It comes as the CBI warned households will go into recession later this year. The Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent fuel retailers, said it ""welcomed transparency regarding fuel pricing"" and would co-operate with the CMA's investigation. Pump prices have been rising since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February led to oil supply fears. Last week, the RAC motoring organisation said the cost of filling a 55-litre tank reached Â£100.27 for petrol and Â£103.43 for diesel. Fuel prices: Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Calls for more help as cost to fill a tank hits Â£100 In a letter to the CMA,external, Mr Kwarteng said that despite introducing a fuel duty cut ""there remains widespread concern about the pace of the increase in prices at the forecourt and, that prices may not fall as much or as fast as they rise"". As well as looking at whether the duty cut is being passed on to consumers, Mr Kwarteng has also asked the CMA to examine ""whether the retail fuel market has adversely affected consumer interests"". This will include investigating whether there are price variations for petrol and diesel at local forecourts. ""Drivers should be getting a fair deal for fuel across the UK,"" said Mr Kwarteng. ""Healthy competition between forecourts is key to achieving this, with competition working to keep pressure on prices."" He has asked for the CMA to report back to him by 7 July. The Petrol Retailers Association says its members passed on the 5p fuel duty cut after it was announced in March, but wholesale fuel prices have continued to rise since then. It has left retailers ""operating on extremely tight margins"", it says. Boss Gordon Balmer said the association had requested several meetings with Mr Kwarteng ""to explain how the fuel market works"" but had not heard back. ""Our members have had to endure several [unfair] headlines in the press,"" he added. ""Therefore, the news that the minister has contacted the CMA to conduct an urgent review of the fuel market is timely."" Jack Cousens, head of roads policy at the AA, said while the group welcomed the review, ""more urgent action is needed"". ""To relieve pressure at the pumps we need an immediate 10p cut to fuel duty. That would help restore some balance ahead of the initial CMA findings due in early July."" Edmund King OBE, president of the AA, maintains that there is space for a further fuel duty cut. ""The government is still making 8.74p more in VAT than they were this time last year,"" he told the BBC's Today programme, ""so there is money there for another possible duty cut."" He added that retailers should publish fuel wholesale prices alongside pump prices. ""That does seem to increase competition locally in places where it's currently done, like Austria and Northern Ireland."" Mr King said price differences of up to 8p a litre were found between local garages and supermarkets. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told the BBC: ""Once we get the review of that then it will be right to look at what more, if we need to, we can do to help people to make sure it's actually getting to where we want to see that support."" Labour said it had been calling for a CMA investigation into pump prices for some time. Setting out measures to tackle the rising cost of living, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told Times Radio: ""We know that the market for petrol and diesel is not working properly, and even when the government reduced duty back in March it was not passed onto consumers."" The Liberal Democrats urged the government to cut fuel duty in rural areas to help families bearing the brunt of record petrol prices. Analysis of official figures by the party suggests households in rural areas pay Â£114 a week on transport costs, almost Â£40 more than those in urban areas. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit a 40-year high of 9% in April, with higher energy bills and fuel prices contributing to the increase. The head of the UK's largest business group warned on Sunday that households will go into recession later this year as people cut spending to combat rising living costs. Tony Danker, director-general of the CBI, forecast that spending on the High Street and on discretionary items will ""go negative"" and that Britons were already ""trading down"". ""It is a well-known behaviour when there's high inflation,"" Mr Danker told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme. ""They're not buying as many discretionary goods or they're buying the cheaper option in the supermarkets."" The CBI has significantly downgraded its growth outlook for the UK this year from 5.1% to 3.7%, blaming inflation as the ""primary source"" of the slowdown. It predicts growth of just 1% in 2023 compared with a previous forecast of 3%. Mr Danker said: ""The only real thing stopping us from having a full-blown recession this year is that at the moment business investment levels are quite high."" A recession is defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive quarters. He said: ""The risk is if business investment starts to fall then the whole country could go into recession sooner than some are predicting, ie next year so I think that's why at the moment there's not a lot you can do about household spending when inflation is this high but you do need to stabilise confidence among firms so they don't stop spending too.""

"The government is preparing plans to repeal a legal ban on agency staff filling in for striking workers. Transport SecretaryGrant Shapps told the Sunday Telegraph,externala potential change in legislation could allow companies to hire temporary workers to cover some roles and prevent disruption. Any intervention would not affect therail strikes across Britain this month. But Mr Shapps said changes could be brought in quickly to minimise future action in rail or other sectors. Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told BBC One's Sunday Morning programme the proposals would make it ""less safe to travel"" and accused ministers of ""sowing chaos and sowing division"". ""The government is acting like arsonists rather than firefighters,"" she said. When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? A war of words between rail unions and ministers has been escalating since the RMT union announced three days of strikes, after talks about pay, terms and conditions, and redundancies fell through. Mr Shapps said should the action continue then ""further measures certainly would come in during this particular dispute, if it can't be resolved"". ""We will be looking at the full suite of modernisation that's required,"" he told the Telegraph.  ""The country must not continue to be held to ransom."" The transport secretary said any change could involve secondary legislation, which can be signed off by ministers ""very fast"". Meanwhile,writing in the Sun on Sunday,external, Mr Shapps warned rail workers who plan to strike this month that they will not be able to work overtime on subsequent days to top-up pay they will lose as a result of taking part in the action.  It is is understood this is because rail companies may decide to run restricted timetables after the strike days. Describing the strikes as a ""disruptive and unnecessary stoppage"", he wrote: ""Rail managers and ministers are determined to ensure strikers cannot milk the system to maintain their income while inflicting misery on the public."" Days are passing quickly until this first wave of crippling train strikes start, with no current sign of a resolution. The suggested legislative changes won't happen for the first wave of strikes in just over a week, but if there are more, Grant Shapps hopes agency workers can fill gaps. But 40,000 workers are walking out, and 10,000 more on London Underground. There are a few problems. Firstly, the UK economy has a huge recruitment problem at the moment. There are record numbers of vacancies, and not enough workers to fill them. So finding 50,000 agency workers for the railways when we can't fully resource UK airports could be a challenge. Secondly, both sides of this fractious industrial dispute have said that safety problems with agency workers make this plan impossible. Unions and the rail industry say safety-critical roles like signallers, guards, drivers can't easily be covered. They say these workers don't work for agencies, they already work in the railway. Mr Shapps' comments come less than a month afterrail unions reacted with fury to a government threatto make strike action illegal unless a minimum number of train staff remained working during a walkout. In response, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: ""We already have the most restrictive anti-democratic trade union laws in Western Europe and if the government attempts to reduce our rights further, the RMT along with the rest of the trade union movement will mount the fiercest resistance possible."" More than 40,000 RMT members working for Network Rail and 13 train operating companies across Britain will strike on 21, 23 and 25 June. The RMT says train company workers had been subject to ""pay freezes, threats to jobs and attacks on their terms and conditions"". Network Rail plans to cut 2,500 maintenance jobs in a bid to make Â£2bn of savings, but the RMT argues such a move would make accidents more likely. The union's members voted by 87% to 11% in favour of industrial action. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the country ""must not continue to be held to ransom"" Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis criticised the strike action and told the Sunday Morning programme that staff in the rail industry were already ""very well rewarded"". ""The median salary in the rail industry is about Â£46,000â¦ against an average wage in this country of closer to Â£26,000,"" he said. Asked about the proposals to replace striking workers with agency staff, he said the government was ""not taking anything off the table""  but would make sure the railways were ""running properly and safely"". In a separate dispute over pensions and job losses, the RMT's London Underground members will also strike on 21 June. The RMT is calling it the biggest dispute for over three decades and put the industrial action down to the ""inability of the rail employers to come to a negotiated settlement"". Train and tram drivers,part of the Aslef union, are also set to strike in three locations this month. Aslef's general secretary Mick Whelan called Mr Shapps' idea ""impractical"" and asked where the agency workers would come from. ""You can't just ship in a load of signallers and train drivers,"" he said adding: ""If they are not working for the railway now they are either not medically fit, have been dismissed or don't want to do it anymore."" Christina McAnea - general secretary of Unison - predicted the move would prompt a backlash. She warned that her union, which represents public service workers including nurses and social workers, would be ""campaigning - doing more than campaigning - to make sure that it doesn't happen"".

"The group of abuse survivors group outside the Vatican before the Papal meeting A victim of child sexual abuse at a priest training school has said meeting the Pope was a ""healing"" experience. Mark Murray was among eight abuse survivors granted a private meeting with Pope Francis on Monday. They said the Pope now intends to ask the order that ran St Peter Claver College in west Yorkshire in the 1960s and 70s to engage with the group. Mr Murray, from St Asaph, Denbighshire, said he came away from the Vatican meeting with renewed hope. He endured repeated abuse by a priest at the former junior seminary between 1969, when he joined aged 13, and 1974. Mr Murray, now 66, had said before the meeting that he just wanted the Pope to listen. Afterwards he added: ""It was such a healing and transformative meeting. ""He was extremely attentive to what we were saying. ""I come away with hope; hope that things can carry on changing in the church and that safeguarding can carry on changing."" Mark Murray was one of 11 men who settled out of court for alleged abuse in the 1960s and 70s Mr Murray was one of 11 former trainee priestswho shared a Â£120,000 settlement from The Verona Fathers, a Roman Catholic mission now known as Comboni Missionaries, over abuse suffered in the 1960s and 70s. The men have also received anapology from the Bishop of Leeds, but have now shared their testimonies with Pope Francis after the body responsible for dealing with child sexual abuse in the Church helped set up the meeting. They came 5,000 miles - to ask Pope to say sorry Cardinal 'protected Church ahead of victims' Priest's 'harasser' will not face trial ""I don't think we could have expected a better outcome,"" said Bede Mullen, of the Comboni Survivors Group. ""He [the Pope] said he's immediately going to ring the superior general of the Comboni Missionaries personally and get him to engage with the survivors' group."" Pope Francis heard testimonies from seven victims of sexual abuse at a Catholic church priest training school Among the stories the pope listened to was that of father-of-two Mr Murray. He said he couldn't talk about his ordeal for more than 20 years before he began civil action in 1995 to fight for an acknowledgment of what happened to him from the order which ran the seminary. Ahead of the meeting he said: ""I don't want an apology. A forced apology isn't a true one. I want them to listen. ""My statement will come from a more personal aspect - what their treatment has done to me as a person and to my family. ""I dealt with the abuse I suffered as a child through years of psychotherapy. It's much harder to deal with the response of some of the institutions towards me."" Bede Mullen (left) and Mark Murray (right) were two boys abused at St Peter Claver College ""Where I'm coming from is the impact of the Combonis having no engagement with us."" Mr Murray added. ""They know what happened - but there's never been an admission that abuse took place. ""This should've been sorted decades ago. If the Comboni Order had listened with their hearts in 1995 this could have been sorted,"" he said. ""We didn't want what happened to us happening to other people, so you push for a meeting with the highest person in the Catholic Church."" The abuse took place in the 1960s and 70s before St Peter Claver College in Mirfield was shut in 1984 Cardinal Vincent Nichols, the head of the Roman Catholic Church in England and Wales whose leadership has been criticised in the child sexual abuse scandal, also attended Monday's meeting with the Pope. The Bishop of Leeds, Marcus Stock, in whose diocese the college in Mirfield was situated, will also be at the meeting after he offered the victims a ""heartfelt and unreserved apology"" last year. The Right Reverend Stock said sorry for the ""pain and trauma experienced when you were students at Mirfield and for the spiritual suffering and emotional distress which continues to affect you to this day"". Members of the Comboni Survivors' Group say they still want justice from the Order. The congregation, now known as the Comboni Missionaries, was founded in 1867 by Daniele Comboni and is a Catholic clerical male religious group. The Bishop of Leeds said the Pope was aware the men had not had an ""adequate pastoral response"" from the leadership of the Comboni Order They have ""publicly apologised for any abuse suffered by former seminarians"" and acknowledge the harm caused by child abuse. ""It was with great sadness and regret that we learned about the allegations of non-recent abuse relating to our former junior seminary which closed in 1984,"" said a Comboni Missionaries spokesperson. ""We have worked hard to respond with seriousness and sensitivity to the complaints and claims made, have fully supported and cooperated with the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse - and are working with a respected specialist charity to provide counselling and facilitate meetings."" The Catholic Safeguarding Standards Agency (CSSA) has said they will do ""everything in their power"" to help with ""any issue of Church-related abuse and suffering"". ""We are acutely aware of the survivors' concerns and we are actively engaged with them and with representatives of the Order to bring them together to address these concerns,"" said CSSA chairman Nazir Afzal.

"Beijing has reported 1,997 local Covid cases since 22 April A total of 166 Covid infections in China have been linked to a single bar in the capital Beijing, officials say. A government spokesman described the outbreak as ""ferocious"". All residents living in the area where the bar is located will be tested over the next three days. The number of infections in the city is low by international standards but high for China, which is the world's only major economy still maintaining a ""zero Covid"" policy. The outbreak was traced to a venue called the Heaven Supermarket Bar, in the well-known entertainment area of Sanlitun in Chaoyang district. Two buildings housing hundreds of people in Chaoyang were put under strict lockdown on Sunday after a positive case was reported, a residential committee worker told Reuters news agency. Some people in Beijing said they were sent texts telling them to report to authorities if they had recently visited Sanlitun's bars. Chinese officials have reversed the relaxation of some Covid rules in Beijing because of the outbreak. Most children in the capital will not return to school next week as originally planned, officials said. The capital has reported 1,997 local Covid cases since 22 April. Relief and caution as Shanghai returns to life China's overall policy of ""zero Covid"" remains in place and people catching Covid face quarantine or hospital.

"Women embrace at a memorial to those killed in the Uvalde mass shooting A cross-party group of US senators have agreed a framework for potential legislation on gun safety, following a spate of mass shootings. This would include support for tougher checks for buyers aged under 21 and cracking down on illegal gun purchases. Crucially, the proposals are supported by 10 Republicans, meaning they have the numbers to be voted into law. President Biden said the plans were ""steps in the right direction"" but they fall far short of what he called for. Previous attempts to tighten gun laws failed to get the required support in Congress. Tens of thousands of protestersrallied across the US on Saturdayto call for stricter gun laws in the wake of two mass shootings. ""Today, we are announcing a common sense, bipartisan proposal to protect America's children, keep our schools safe, and reduce the threat of violence across our country,"" the Senate group said in a statement. ""Families are scared, and it is our duty to come together and get something done that will help restore their sense of safety and security in their communities."" The senators also called for increased investment in mental health services and school safety resources, as well as including domestic violence convictions and restraining orders in the national background check database for people buying firearms. Where does US gun control go from here? US gun control claims fact-checked America's gun culture - in seven charts President Biden urged lawmakers to pass the proposals quickly, while making clear that they did not go as far as he wanted. The president has pushed for far bigger reforms - including a ban on assault rifles, which were used in the Texas and Buffalo mass shootings - or at least an increase in the age at which they can be purchased. ""Obviously, it does not do everything that I think is needed, but it reflects important steps in the right direction, and would be the most significant gun safety legislation to pass Congress in decades,"" he said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat who said the plans were ""a good first step"", said he wanted to move a bill quickly to a Senate vote once legislative details were worked out. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said the measures showed ""the value of dialogue and cooperation"". He added: ""I continue to hope their discussions yield a bipartisan product that makes significant headway on key issues like mental health and school safety, respects the Second Amendment, earns broad support in the Senate, and makes a difference for our country."" Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said a ""substantial"" part of the deal had been nailed down by negotiators, allowing the drafting of legislation to get under way on Monday, Reuters news agency reported. The news has also been welcomed by some gun control activists. ""This is a first step and it's actually a lot more than I thought it would be. This is progress even if small,"" tweeted David Hogg, a survivor of the 2018 Parkland school shooting and co-founder of March for Our Lives, a student-led movement focused on gun violence prevention. ""Even if it stops one Parkland it's worth it."" ""Our grassroots army is ready to fight like hell to make sure it becomes law. 26 years for federal action on gun safety is unacceptable,"" tweeted Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy organisation. The National Rifle Association of America (NRA) said it would respond once the full text is released but said it would ""continue to oppose any effort to insert gun control policies, initiatives that override constitutional due process protections & efforts to deprive law-abiding citizens of their fundamental right to protect themselves/loved ones into this or any other legislation"". This video can not be played Watch: Thousands join gun control rallies across the US The US has the highest rate of firearms deaths among the world's wealthy nations, but is a country where many cherish gun rights that are protected by the Constitution's Second Amendment to ""keep and bear arms"". These are the first gun safety laws to receive bipartisan support of this kind in decades, with previous attempts by Democrats for strengthened controls frustrated by Republicans. Attempts to tighten the laws in the wake of a previous school shooting at Sandy Hook in Connecticut nearly a decade ago - in which 20 children and six adults were killed - failed to get the required votes in Congress. The Senate, or upper chamber of Congress, is currently split - with 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans - and legislation must have 60 votes to overcome a manoeuvre known as the filibuster. Ten of the 20 senators who proposed the new measures are Republicans, meaning the proposals have the numbers needed to overcome the filibuster. The Democrat-controlled lower chamber, the House of Representatives, this weekvoted through a series of measures regulating the sale of guns. But Republican opposition in the Senate means the bill has little chance of entering law, leaving the bipartisan deal agreed on Sunday as the only realistic hope for federal measures to address firearms violence.

"Fellow Dragons from the BBC show have paid tribute to Hilary Devey Former Dragons' Den star Hilary Devey has died aged 65. Devey, who grew up in Leeds, died after a long illness on Saturday night, her publicist Benjamin Webb said. The Bolton-born entrepreneur, who founded the multimillion-pound freight distribution business Pall-Ex in the 1990s, died at her holiday home in Morocco. Mr Webb said Devey was a ""remarkable lady and an inspiration"" who was ""so proud"" of her work on Dragons' Den. Hannah Wyatt, managing director for Factual Entertainment and Events at BBC Studios, said: ""Hilary Devey will always hold a unique place in the hearts of Dragons' Den viewers and the programme team.

She joined the popular BBC TV show in 2011 and left in 2012, going on to present Channel 4's The Intern. In 2013 she was made a CBE for her career in business and her contribution to charity. Devey's charitable work included her position as vice-president of the Carers Trust and she was also a patron of the Stroke Association, having herself suffered a stroke in 2009. From age seven, Devey started helping out in the pubs and corner shop run by her parents. She left school at 16 and later moved to London.

"Jordan Gatley's family shared a picture of him in Ukraine A former British soldier has been killed fighting for the Ukrainian armed forces, his family has said. Jordan Gatley, who left the British army in March and travelled to Ukraine, was described as ""a hero"" by his father Dean in a tribute on social media. He died in the battle for the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which has seen intense fighting in recent days. The Foreign Office has said it is ""supporting the family of a British man who has died in Ukraine"". Mr Gatley's father wrote in a Facebook post that his son had been helping train local forces. He added that Jordan was fatally shot on the front line while defending the city and they were informed of his death on Friday. He had gone to Ukraine to help ""after careful consideration"", he said. Chemical plant hit as fighting rages in Severodonetsk Analysis: Five ways Russia's invasion may play out According to the Facebook post, the family ""had several messages from his team out there telling us of his wealth of knowledge, his skills as a soldier and his love of his job"". ""His team say they all loved him, as did we, and he made a massive difference to many people's lives, not only soldiering, but also by training the Ukrainian forces,"" the statement continued. Dean Gatley posted a picture of him with his son in British army uniform ""Jordan and his team were so proud of the work they were doing and he often told me that the missions they were going on were dangerous, but necessary. ""He loved his job and we are so proud of him,"" Mr Gatley wrote, adding: ""He truly was a hero and will forever be in our hearts."" Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky,tweeted that Jordan Gatley was a ""true hero"",external. ""We will always remember his contribution to the protection of Ukraine and the free world,"" Mr Podolyak wrote. The BBC understands Mr Gatley served in the British army as a rifleman with the Edinburgh-based third battalion of The Rifles and was discharged from the forces in March before travelling to Ukraine. There has been fierce street fighting in Severodonetsk with heavy artillery said to be causing huge casualties for both Russian and Ukrainian forces. The region's governor Serhiy Haidai has told Ukrainian TV that Russian shelling has caused a huge fire at a chemical plant in the city. Up to 800 civilians are hiding in underground bomb shelters at the plant, Ukrainian officials have estimated. Fighting around Severodonetsk has lasted for more than three months, as Russia shifted its focus from trying to take the capital Kyiv to capturing the Luhansk and the Donetsk regions of eastern Ukraine - a mostly industrial area known as Donbas. Seizing Severodonetsk and its twin city of Lysychansk would move Russia closer to its goal as it would give them control over Luhansk. Mr Gatley is the second Briton to be killed in the conflict afterthe death of Scott Sibleyin April. Mr Sibley was described as a ""friend like no other"". A post on the Logistics Support Squadron Facebook page described him as a ""former serving soldier"" of the squadron and said he had ""showed Commando spirit until the end"". The Foreign Office advises against all travel to Ukraine and the Ministry of Defence has said that Britons who go to join the fighting following the Russian invasion may be committing a criminal offence and would be liable to prosecution. In March, the head of the British armed forces said that Britons should not go to Ukraine to fight and should find other ways to help.

"Phil Bennett scored 166 points in 29 internationals for Wales and 44 points in eight Tests for the British and Irish Lions Phil Bennett, the legendary Wales and British and Irish Lions captain and fly-half who has died at the age of 73, elevated rugby union to an art form. Fleet of foot and blessed with a brilliant rugby mind, he is regarded as one of the game's all-time greats. In an age when international rugby was played less frequently, Bennett packed two Five Nations Grand Slams and three Triple Crowns into his 29 Wales caps. He also captained his country and the Lions, and dazzled for the Barbarians. During the Baa-Baas' 1973 victory over New Zealand, Bennett demonstrated his spellbinding footwork to spark the move which culminated in a try for Gareth Edwards which is often described as the greatest in rugby union history. The audacity to take on four All Blacks just a few metres from his own try line - and the dexterity to dance past them and leave them floundering in his wake - illustrated Bennett's genius. So too did his try for Wales against Scotland in 1977, another sweeping team move which Bennett finished with a trademark step and run. As the esteemed commentator Bill McLaren said at the time, it was ""absolute magic"". Wales and Lions great Bennett dies aged 73 Statue of Llanelli rugby legend Phil Bennett unveiled Bennett was born in Felinfoel, a village near Llanelli, on 24 October, 1948. He worked in the local steel works during his teens and, as a promising schoolboy footballer, he was offered a trial by West Ham. Once Bennett committed to rugby, he quickly rose to prominence with his beloved Llanelli and was a part of the team which beat the mighty All Blacks in 1972. By that point, he was already a fully-fledged international, having made his Wales debut as the country's first replacement in 1969. Bennett had to bide his time to establish himself as Wales' first-choice fly-half because the 10 jersey at the time belonged to another giant of the game, the great Barry John. When John retired aged only 27 in 1972, Bennett emerged from his shadow and made the fly-half position his own. He wore 10 for the Lions on their historic unbeaten 1974 tour of South Africa, amassing 103 points and scoring a spectacular solo try in the second Test in Pretoria. This video can not be played Phil Bennett's days of glory Even Bennett's place in the Wales side was not guaranteed, though. In 1975 he was dropped for John Bevan, but an injury to the Aberavon fly-half opened the door for his return. With Bennett back in the team, Wales won the Five Nations Grand Slam in 1976 and, when the career of Wales skipper Mervyn Davies ended the following year, it was Bennett who assumed the captaincy. A cheery and affable character, Bennett gave a glimpse of his tougher side when he delivered a memorable team talk before Wales' Five Nations match against England in 1977. ""They've taken our coal, our water, our steel. They buy our homes and live in them for a fortnight every year. What have they given us? Absolutely nothing,"" went his passionate rallying cry. ""We've been exploited, controlled and punished by the English - and that's who you are playing this afternoon."" Later that year, Bennett led the Lions on their tour of New Zealand and, although that series ended in defeat, there was still time for a glorious closing chapter. With a Grand Slam on the line as France came to Cardiff on the final weekend of the 1978 Five Nations, captain Bennett rose to the occasion magnificently with two tries to lead his side to a 16-7 win and a second clean sweep in three years. As Wales' jubilant fans celebrated a third Grand Slam of the 1970s, little did they know of the conversation Bennett was having with his half-back partner and arguably the greatest player of them all, Gareth Edwards, in the home changing room after the final whistle. ""I knew it was going to be my last game, but I didn't tell anyone beforehand,"" Bennett recalled years later. ""I didn't want this game to be about me, this was a great Welsh team, we had just achieved the triple Triple Crown and were going for a second Grand Slam in two years. ""So there was no big farewell to the crowd or anything like that. ""Afterwards, I walked into the changing room and I went up to Gareth and said thanks for everything and he replied, 'Bloody hell, you're getting out as well. Me too'."" Phil Bennett and his wife Pat on their wedding day in 1970 That was Phil Bennett. Understated, humble, class to the last. His final game was in 1981 after a Llanelli club career of 413 appearances with 2,535 points, including 131 tries. After retirement, he worked as a pundit for BBC Wales and was a regular spectator at Felinfoel RFC, his home village's amateur club and was president of his beloved Scarlets. Bennett was as unassuming a presence on the touchline at Felinfoel as he was warm and approachable in the media room at the Principality Stadium. He wore his greatness lightly, generous with his time with fans, journalists and just about anyone he ever met. While Bennett himself may never have sung his own praises, the sporting world recognised his special quality. He was inducted to the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2005 and will be forever remembered as one of the best to play the game.

"The race pits man against horse over a 22.5-mile course in Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys The winner of the gruelling Man v Horse race has revealed he had been awake for 29 hours before the event after flying from Tenerife to claim victory. Trail runner Ricky Lightfoot became only the third person to win the race since it started in 1980. He told the BBC he had woken at 06:00 BST on Friday before catching a flight to Manchester at midnight. Landing at 04:00 he travelled to Wales, arriving at Llanwrtyd Wells, Powys, at 09:00 for the race start at 11:00. Crossing the line, the 6ft 4in (1.93m) athlete had no idea whether he had won as the people and animals take slightly different routes. This video can not be played Can a human run faster than a horse? After asking around, he discovered he had come out on top against 1,000 runners and 50 horses with a time of 2:22:23. He took home Â£3,500 after beating the first horse by more than two minutes on the 22.5-mile (36km) course. The 37-year-old Cumbrian said winning was ""pretty good, like"". Almost there... Ricky Lightfoot on the way to victory ""It's great to win the event and beat the horse,"" he said. ""I called my partner and said: 'I beat the horse'. And she said: 'You're joking?'. ""And I said: 'No, I did.' She was like, 'oh my God!'"" The firefighter said he had been quietly confident. ""I thought I could give the horse a good race,"" he explained. Since his win, he has been asked if he will enter the Grand National next. ""It would be great if I could win the Grand National,"" he said. ""I've never rode a horse in my life. I once rode a donkey at Blackpool Pleasure Beach though."" After winning, the father of two then made his way home to Maryport, in Cumbria, as he had to be back in work at 07:30 on Sunday. Race director Mike Thomas said Mr Lightfoot, a member of Cumbria running club Ellenborough AC, beat the horses ""quite comfortably"" on Saturday. The last time a human beat a horse in the race was in 2007, and the first time was in 2004. Ricky Lightfoot, pictured left, with boss and coach Dean Pepper, was back at work as a firefighter on Sunday The race, which returned after two years due to the pandemic, began on tarmac but took in forest tracks and open moorland.

"This video can not be played Root & Pope centuries keep England hopes alive Second LV= Insurance Test, Trent Bridge (day three) New Zealand 553:Mitchell 190, Blundell 106 England 473-5:Root 163*, Pope 145 England trail by 80 runs Scorecard Scintillating centuries from Joe Root and Ollie Pope kept England in the second Test with New Zealand on a riotous third day at Trent Bridge. Root, in form far beyond anyone else in the world, is 163 not out, while Pope vindicated his selection at number three with 145. After Alex Lees fell for 67, Root and Pope flayed the New Zealand bowling in a third-wicket stand of 187. But that was nothing compared with the entertainment provided by England captain Ben Stokes, who crashed 46 from only 33 balls. Calm was only restored late in a day when England added 383 runs, the home side ending 473-5, 80 behind New Zealand's 553. There is still work to do for England, but they should be looking to first get level with New Zealand, then build a handy lead. Their Sunday effort has given them a strong chance of preserving their 1-0 series advantage, and maybe even a shot at victory. Listen: Ask Moeen Ali - TMS podcast special This was the day when the influence of new England Test coach Brendon McCullum has been most obviously on show. At 90-1 overnight, 463 behind, it would have been typical of England to wilt. Instead, they attacked from the outset, with every batter looking to get after the New Zealand bowling. Aided by a true surface and lightning-fast outfield, this was England playing 'Bazball' to devastating effect. The scoreboard rattled along to the delight of the energetic Trent Bridge crowd. New Zealand did not help themselves - they missed catches off Root twice and gave a life to Ben Foakes to go with reprieves handed to Lees and Pope on Saturday, while off-spinner Michael Bracewell was underused. The Black Caps also had to deal with a back injury to fast bowler Kyle Jamieson. But this was an exhilarating assault by England, one that has brought this Test to life and set up the possibility of a thrilling final two days. For England to win they will have to find a way of dismissing New Zealand in their second innings - a big ask given the nature of the pitch. Still, McCullum will ask them to believe that anything is possible. This video can not be played Pope reaches second Test century as England fight back Pope had not batted at number three in first-class cricket before this series, but was recalled because new captain Stokes was adamant he wanted the Surrey man in his team. Pope repaid the faith with his second Test century and, curiously, the first of his 14 in first-class cricket made at a ground north of the River Thames. After being dropped on 37 the previous evening, Pope resumed on 51 and, along with Lees, was determined to pressure the New Zealand bowling on Sunday morning. The intent led to a number of nervy moments for both men and was Lees' undoing when he flashed to first slip after making his maiden Test half-century, but Pope grew in stature, peppering the boundaries square of the wicket on both sides. His hundred, reached by pushing Matt Henry through the covers, came from 160 balls. At one stage, with the same bowler packing the leg side, Pope backed off to play an outrageous cut for four. Pope was eventually undone after a lengthy break to change a damaged pad. He top-edged a pull off Trent Boult to long leg and was given lengthy congratulations from Root as he departed. Root is so prolific that he is exhausting all the superlatives. This was his 10th century since the beginning of last year and second in as many Sundays. It was a carefree hundred - at 116 balls the fastest of his 27 in Tests. As a result, there were loose moments - on 27 he burst the hands of second slip Tim Southee and could have been caught on 52 when a top-edged slog-sweep at Southee landed between the wicketkeeper and long leg. There were also the classic Root characteristics. Rhythmical footwork, urgent running and sweet off drives. When he reached three figures by inside-edging Daryl Mitchell, his first reaction was to laugh. The stand with Pope saw runs flow at nearly 4.5 an over and, after Jonny Bairstow gloved Boult behind, Root's time with Stokes bordered on carnage. The captain ran down the pitch to the pace bowlers and launched Bracewell for a huge six, only to then hole out looking for another maximum. Sixty-one runs had been added in 56 balls. There was still time for Root to share another 68 with Foakes, who overturned being given caught behind on eight and was dropped by Will Young at deep square leg on nine. Root continued to attack right up to the close. His fetch from outside off stump to whip Southee through mid-on was perhaps the most audacious stroke of a remarkable day. This video can not be played 'Phenomenal player' - Root's best shots as he reaches 150 Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""We're witnessing something special. I've known Joe for years and I really do believe he's England's greatest player. ""He's such a joy to watch and he makes batting look so easy. ""It's just that drive and determination. You've got to have an incredible appetite to just keep on scoring centuries."" England all-rounder Moeen Ali:""During Covid when everyone was locked down, Root got all his dismissals and had a look where he can get better. ""He did this thing where he batted 30 overs on the bowling machine. Have a break. Then bat 30 overs on the machine again so it can help his concentration and he can bat the whole day. That really helped his game. ""That is why he's so good and what makes him a great, and probably our best ever player. The way he trains is the most impressive thing."" BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""If you haven't had the chance to watch Joe Root today, then I implore that you do because that was batting poetry.

"Ruth Llewellyn said she would decide on her day off depending on her workload from week to week A firm in Merthyr Tydfil is part of the world's biggest four-day week trial. Housing association Merthyr Valleys is one of 70 UK companies in thesix-month trialwhich will see them work fewer hours for the same pay. Employees say the trial could be ""life-changing"", but the company says tenants must not see a reduced service. The aim is to gather data on how the system works in all sorts of businesses in order to encourage more employers to offer a shorter working week. The workers getting 100% pay for 80% of the hours 'Four-day working week makes us more productive' The whole 225-strong workforce, from carpenters to communications, from the chief executive to the call centre, started working fewer hours earlier this week. Marcus Powell, chair of the democratic body which represents employees and residents of the housing association to the board, said he believed the opportunity was ""life changing"". Although some workers wondered whether it was too good to be true, he said, there was ""lots of excitement through the organisation"". ""I think it's life changing, because on my day off I can spend more time with my family. ""I certainly don't want to be doing any housework, I'll still leave that to the weekend, but for me it's about spending more quality time with my friends and family and being able to relax on those days."" Not everyone has decided to have one less day in the office. Gerald Charles has decided to do a five-day week during term time working 09:00 to 15:00 Monday to Friday Gerald Charles manages the gas contracts for the organisation and has decided to do a five-day week during term time. He will work 09:00 until 15:00 while his daughter is at school, then during the holidays he will work a four-day week. ""It's fantastic for my personal life, it means that I'm able to take on more responsibility at home and my wife, who isn't able to do what I'm able to do, she doesn't have to worry about any more, which is fantastic. I can't fault it,"" he said. Ruth Llewellyn, head of human resources, has been organising the rollout of the project. She said she intends to work flexibly and change her day off depending on how the week pans out. She said she would fill her time with seeing friends and family and hopes to do more of the ""general things that you struggle to fit into your working week, things like hairdressers appointments, sorting out your home insurance"". She said they were able to offer a four-day week by being more productive in the time that they were on site. ""I think the challenge from us to our colleagues, is to ask yourselves 'why?' If you're doing something, why am I doing it? Why am I doing it this way? Is there a better way? Is there a quicker way? ""Just getting us all to focus on the time we have at work."" Dai and Gary will measure their productivity in tonnes collected David McLoughlin and Gary Flye are a two-person team who work for the environmental department and deal with fly-tipping across the borough. They have decided to have a Friday off. Usually they would cover the whole borough, which is 12 miles (19km) across, by going from place to place. They will now spend more time in one place, maybe one part of the borough in the morning and another in the afternoon. They will measure their productivity in tonnes collected. ""We're trying to work a little bit smarter, a little bit harder Monday to Thursday, so we can get the nice Friday benefit,"" said Dai. He is looking forward to taking his kids to school on his day off and having some time to relax and catch up on housework and DIY jobs. For Gary, it is his partner that will feel the benefit. ""With me, I play a lot of sport on the weekend so my partner doesn't see me much on the weekend. She doesn't work on a Friday, so this it'll give me a chance to take her out. ""Whether that's a good thing, I don't know, but it'll keep her happy."" Everyone at the housing association is working a four-day week or the equivalent number of hours ""I've got grand plans - whether they come off is another thing,"" said Allison Soroko, from the communications team. At the moment, she said, her weekends were ""really busy"". ""I work Monday to Friday and I've got two kids, a husband and a dog, so the weekends are spent cooking, cleaning, shipping the kids around, so Saturdays and Sundays are really busy. ""So I'm really looking forward to having some time off just to pick up those tasks and to pinch a little bit of time for me."" It's clear all the employees I spoke to that they want the trial to work, but there is a risk productivity does not improve, according to Gerald Charles. ""From my point of view, it's all down to Key Performance Indicators (KPIs),"" said Mr Charles. ""I monitor what's being done daily and then what the results are at the end of the week, which tells me how things are going, so as long as we can keep up with our KPIs and we can maintain the 100% then yes, of course it will work. ""I want it to work, my wife wants it to work and everyone in the company wants it to work, so it's definitely got the full support, so why not?"" Surveys have been carried out before the trial to measure productivity in all of the company's departments. They'll be monitored throughout the six months and compared at the end to measure the success of the trial. Worried households cut back on energy and food Pay gap between men and women fails to improve Ruth Llewellyn said: ""Our main aim is to demonstrate that there's absolutely no impact on our services. Our main measure is going to be on tenants and colleagues. ""For our colleagues, how are they feeling that it's working for them? How are they using that extra day? Is it bringing the additional wellbeing benefits that we expect it to bring? And for our tenants, are we still delivering the service that they expect? Do we need to do things differently?"" Surveys will be completed by employees and tenants throughout the trial to see what their experiences are. All the workers we spoke to mentioned the impact of the pandemic on the way they thought and felt about their work. Employment lawyer Fflur Jones said that before the pandemic ""we didn't know things could be done slightly differently"" Fflur Jones, is an employment lawyer with Darwin Gray in Cardiff. She said that before the pandemic, ""we didn't know things could be done slightly differently"". ""This is a great time for this to be experimented upon because there is so much dissatisfaction with the status quo."" She said the desire for more work-life balance was a ""phenomenon"" after the pandemic, and it is here to stay. Asda to allow permanent hybrid working for offices Women warned home working may harm their careers ""It's more about the flexibility and the hours of work and the location of work now than it is about salaries, for sure. ""That comes up time and time again when people look to move. It's a proper phenomenon. And I don't think it's going to go away, particularly while there are so many roles out there, so it is the employee's market rather than the employer's being able to pick and choose who to take or to retain."" The pilot is being organised by 4 Day Week Global in partnership with think tank Autonomy, the 4 Day Week UK Campaign, and researchers at Cambridge University, Oxford University and Boston College. Will Stronge said many kinds of work and the working day is ""elastic"" as productivity can wane due to tiredness But can the four-day working week work for all workplaces? It can work for many according to Will Stronge from employment think tank, Autonomy, but not all. ""If you look at things like health care, teaching, social care, these are the kinds of work which actually, if you reduce their working week, they wouldn't necessarily become more productive,"" said Mr Stronge. ""That kind of work is not amenable to simply reducing the working week, you need to increase the staff count or the headcount. ""In many companies though, that's just not the case and in many kinds of work the working day is what we call elastic. So a lot can get done in a short amount of time and then in another period of the day, if staff are burnt out or tired or things just don't go their way. there can be less productive hours of the day. ""It's one of the myths about productivity, that greater productivity is achieved when you work longer hours. On a very macro economic level, that's just not the case."" He added that Greece and Mexico work longer hours but their economy did not perform better, while other countries such as Netherlands, Germany, France and many others worked fewer hours than in the UK but were more productive in general. ""What's really exciting about that is that researchers, such as us at Autonomy and academic researchers at Cambridge and Boston, are going to really get their hands on new data for a whole range of organisations and you can evaluate what works and what doesn't work and hopefully inform policy rollout more broadly following the trial,"" he added.

Join us again tomorrow.  Orla GuerinReporting from Lysychansk Ukraineâs president says Lysychansk is already dead, along with neighboring Severodonetsk - both ghost cities now. Russia is not just destroying apartment buildings, flats and homes, itâs destroying history and the fabric of cities. This is a deliberate tactic - bomb, shell, burn, and leave nothing but scorched earth. Those who remain make brief escapes from their basements to cook outdoors. The city has no power or running water. The city is running out of time. This is now an artillery war and Ukraine doesnât have enough big guns or ammunition. Just a short distance away, neighbouring Severodonetsk is burning and may soon fall. Ukrainian troops there are fighting building to building, street to street but all bridges to the city have now been destroyed. Ukraine is facing an enemy that has learned lessons and is imposing crushing losses in battle. Troops fight on but the handful of advanced weapon systems promised by Britain and the United States may be too little, too late. Here in the Donbas region right now, it looks like a losing battle. Read Orla's report in full:Russia erasing history in Ukraine's 'dead city'. Some lighter news from Ukraine now - Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has injured his leg while playing sport. ""There could be a story about an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group. But in reality, I just injured my leg trying to resume sports for the first time since the beginning of the war,"" Kuleba wrote on Instagram, posting a photo of himself with a bandaged leg. He didn't disclose what sport he was playing. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""Trouble happens, but it doesn't get me off my feet. There is no time to leave the ranks now,"" he wrote. He said that he will continue to work on the issues of heavy weapons, Russian sanctions and EU candidate status for Ukraine. ""Even on crutches and one leg - forward to victory,"" Kuleba added. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov Turning now to Russia and it says the main goal of its military
operation in Ukraine is to protect what it calls the Donetsk and Luhansk
people's republics, a spokesman for the Kremlin says. ""In general, the protection of the republics is the main goal of the special military operation,"" Dmitry Peskov says, according to Russia's RIA state news agency. Russian officials only refer to the invasion as a ""special military operation"" aiming to ""demilitarise"" or ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine, referencing a baseless claim about Nazis in the Ukrainian government, which Moscow uses to justify the invasion. Donetsk and Luhansk are two breakaway Russian-backed
entities in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Russia is currently focusing its war effort on Donbas after its forces were forced to retreat from other parts of the country. More now on a former British soldier who was killed while fighting in Ukraine. The International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine says he was one of its members. Jordan Gatley left the British army in March and travelled to Ukraine,where he died in the battle for control of Severodonetsk. âWe can confirm that Jordan Gatley was a legionnaire and he was in the International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine,"" the Ukrainian legion said in a statement. ""Jordan made the ultimate sacrifice defending Ukraine, her sovereignty and freedom,"" it said. ""Jordan will forever be a hero of Ukraine and the legion. We thank Jordan for his service and selfless sacrifice.â More now from President Zelensky's nightly address to the Ukrainian people. He says he thinks the human cost of the battle for the eastern Donbas region ""will without doubt be remembered in military history as one of the most violent battles in Europe"". Earlier this month, Zelensky said his army was losing ""between 60 and 100 soldiers"" a day in the battle for Donbas. ""We are dealing with absolute evil. And we have no choice but to move forward and free our territory,"" he adds. Read more:Why is Russia trying to capture Donbas? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking about Severodonetsk, the strategically important city in the east that Russian forces are close to fully occupying. ""The human cost of this battle is very high for us. It is simply terrifying,"" Zelensky says on Telegram in his daily address to the Ukrainian people. All three bridges leading to the city have been destroyed, the regional governor reported earlier this evening. Ukrainian troops remaining in the city must ""surrender or die"", a military representative of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic has said. We've been following the battle in the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which appears to be falling increasingly under Russian control amid intense street battles. Across the river lies its twin city, Lysychansk. It's still in Ukrainian hands, but the regional governor says it's under heavy Russian fire. Assuming Russia is aiming to control all of Luhansk, it will be the next target after Severodonetsk. Photographs from the past few days give a sense of life for those remaining in Lysychansk. Maksym Katerin stands in the yard of his damaged house today, after his mother and his step-father were killed in shelling A man tries to put out a fire with a bucket of water after a bombardment destroyed the home next door on Friday A man and two boys cycle in an empty street in the city on Friday. In early June, an estimated 20,000 of the city's roughly 100,000 residents were thought to remain. Residents queue to receive bread given out by police officers in the city on Saturday. Regional police claim seven bodies, several with their hands and legs tied, have been found in a grave near the town of Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, reports AFP. ""Seven civilians were tortured by the Russians then executed in a cowardly manner with a bullet to the head,"" Kyiv regional police chief Andriy Nebytovhas written on Facebook,external. ""This grave was discovered today in an area where Russian troops were stationed near the village of Myrotske"", he writes, adding police are ""working to identify the deceased"". The town of Bucha was occupied by Russian troops during the initial weeks of the invasion. After the town was liberated in early April, at least 500 dead bodies were found, many in makeshift and mass graves. Russia, which withdrew from the town on 30 March, has repeatedly rejected allegations of war crimes in Bucha - insisting they are ""falsifications"" by Ukraine, backed by its allies in the West. Read more about thebodies found in Bucha.  Bodies of Bucha residents were found in makeshift graves by local police following the month-long occupation Firefighters extinguish a fire at the central Maisky market Away from the fighting in Severodonetsk, at least three people, including
a child, have been killed and 18 injured, in a Ukrainian
artillery attack at a market in the Russian-backed separatist
Ukrainian region of Donetsk, officials there said. The Donetsk News Agency has shown pictures of parts of central Maisky market in flames and bodies on the ground. ""We had a hit to the market - there were many people here,""
Yan Gagin, an adviser to the separatists' self-styled
government, tells the Russian RIA news agency. He says a woman and child were among the dead. A soldier comforts a woman at the market Local health officials report 18 people have been injured, including two children. The BBC has been unable to verify these reports. This bridge, pictured in May, was the first of three linking Severodonetsk and Lysychansk to be destroyed For weeks now, Severodonetsk has been the focus of Russian military bombardment in Ukraine. Reports suggest about 70% of the city is currently under Russian control. Severodonetsk, and its twin city, Lysychansk, form an important regional and industrial focal point in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Capturing the two cities would give Russia control of the entire Luhansk region - parts of which are already controlled by Russian-backed separatists.  The twin cities sit astride the strategic Siversky Donets river, while the key, 90km-long (56 miles) central sector of Russiaâs front line lies to the west of the river. The regional governor says the third of three bridges into the city has been destroyed today, a day after the second. With Russian-controlled areas to the north, east and south of Severodonetsk, this greatly reduced access to and from Ukrainian-held areas. Regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said he believes Lysychansk, which is on higher ground, is of more strategic importance, and that the Russians have also been targeting the road from Bakhmut towards the two cities. Only around 15,000 people, from a pre-war population of 100,000, are still believed to be in the city. With heavy shelling and intense street fighting ongoing, evacuation is impossible at present, with the situation described as ""extremely difficult"". Luhansk and the neighbouring region of Donetsk - which run from Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border with Russia - make up the Donbas,whose so-called ""liberation"" is currently Russian President Putin's top priority. Russian military success in the Donbas could lead to annexation by Moscow of the entire region, US officials believe. Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv Columns of smoke rise from Severodonetsk last week The battle for Severodonetsk has been as intense as any fight in the Donbas region, but it seems Russia is now on the cusp of taking the city. The regional Ukrainian governor, Serhiy Haidai, warned of an imminent symbolic and strategic loss, saying Severodonetsk will soon be cut off from the rest of the country if the Russians destroy its last remaining bridge. It was in this fierce frontline fight that British ex-soldier Jordan Gatley was shot dead, his family revealed at the weekend. Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's defence minister, said his country was deeply grateful for ongoing foreign support, but that weapons from the West were not arriving as quickly as they should. He said every Ukrainian city remained at risk of Russian attack, not just those in the east of the country. President Zelensky has called for upgraded aerial defence systems, revealing that more than 2,600 cruise missiles have landed in Ukraine since the start of the war. British soldier Jordan Gatley was killed while fighting Russian forces in Severodonetsk Returning now to news in the last few days that a former UK soldier has been killed in Severodonetsk, the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says he doesn't know how many veterans are fighting in Ukraine. ""The simple reality is we don't know,"" he told MPs, when quizzed by shadow defence secretary John Healey. Wallace said, at the outbreak of the conflict in February, politicians had ""publicly made statements to try and deter"" UK citizens from joining the fight in Ukraine. It follows Friday's news ofthe death of Jordan Gatley, shot dead in Severodonetsk. ""Obviously I, like others, am saddened by the loss of the other former veteran who was reported killed recently,"" said the defence secretary. Two Britons captured and condemned to death for fighting Russian forces""were themselves living in Ukraine or half Ukrainian"", he added. ""But as far as individuals who decided of their own volition to go and fight, separate from the United Kingdom, or indeed separate of any of the United Kingdom's serving personnel, we are unaware of the total number."" He said the question had been raised with his Ukrainian counterpart ""on a number of occasions"". ""It is, of course, for the Ukrainians to answer and find those details, but I do have some sympathy with the Ukrainians - they are fighting a war, and not one or two or three of their citizens are on that front, tens of thousands of those citizens."" Battles are still raging in Severodonetsk Just joining us or need a recap? Here are the latest developments from Ukraine: Severodonetsk Grain  All three bridges to the embattled city of Severodonetsk have been destroyed, says regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Inan update,external, he says although Russian troops have not completely captured the city - which is at the centre of the fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops - all bridges leading to the regional centre have now been destroyed, making the evacuation of residents and the transportation of goods impossible. Residents who remain in the city are surviving under extremely difficult conditions, he adds, with the city under heavy fire. A UN-approved humanitarian zone should be set up around the port of Odesa, a British MP says, to ensure exports of grain can get out of Ukraine, which is one of the world's main food producers. Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, says with Russia consolidating in the Donbas, ""there's every chance they may be turning their sights to Odesa"". ""If this port falls, Ukraine will be landlocked, further impacting on the cost-of-living crisis across Europe, including here, because critical grain exports can't get out,"" he says. He suggests to Defence Secretary Ben Wallace the UK could ""lead a coalition of willing Nato allies to secure a UN General Assembly-approved humanitarian zone around the port and territorial waters, with neighbouring international waters policed by an international maritime force"". ""This would ensure the breadbasket of Europe and beyond is able to function and remain part of Ukraine,"" Ellwood says. Wallace says Ellwood makes a ""very valid"" suggestion about the importance of getting the grain out of Ukraine, but adds: ""I'm afraid it is definitely easier said than done when it comes to securing that Black Sea and a UN mandate to do that."" Anti-tank barriers sit among wheat fields in southern Ukraine UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has spoken to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva about the ""havoc and destruction"" caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine  - and the consequential risks of plunging millions into poverty across the globe. ""Since we last gathered the war in Ukraine continues to destroy the lives of many.... the horrors inflicted on the civilian population will leave their indelible mark, including on generations to come,""  she said, at the gathering on Monday. ""Its social, economic and political ramifications ripple across the region and globally - with no end in sight,"" she continued, adding that the ""global food, fuel and finance crisis now risks plunging millions into food insecurity and poverty"". According to the World Food Programme, the number of people living with severe food insecurity is expected to grow ""from 276 million at the start of 2022, to 323 million in the course of the year"" - with the poorest in society likely to suffer the most, Ms Bachelet concluded. A Ukrainian serviceman stands in a wheat field in the Donetsk region of Ukraine Ukraine's grain harvest is likely to drop to around
48.5 million tonnes this year from 86 million tonnes last year
following Russia's invasion, a senior government official said. First Deputy Agriculture Minister Taras Vysotskyi told Reuters that the
total area sown had fallen by 25% and the exportable
surplus could be 30 million tonnes, meaning a huge loss of
revenue. Ukraine is a major global grain and oil seed grower,
but its exports have been severely hit since Russia's invasion. A Russian blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea
ports means efforts are being made to export by road, river and
rail. Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova was detained after she disrupted Russia's state TV news with an anti-war protest in March UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet has used her speech to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva, to express her concerns around Russia's censorship of free speech and the media. She highlighted new criminal laws which had been introduced effectively banning ""the dissemination of information - based on vague and ambiguous notions including false news"". Bachelet said she regretted ""the increasing censorship and restrictions on independent mediaâ - and described ""the arbitrary arrest of a large number of anti-war protesters"" in Russia as ""worrying"". An adviser to Ukraine's defence minister says more weapons are needed urgently from the West. Speaking on BBC World Service's Newshour, Yuriy Sak says that though Ukraine is grateful for the weapons it has received so far from Western countries, further supplies are not arriving as quickly as they should. ""We are a little concerned, there is not sufficient understanding of the level of the threat we are facing and Europe is facing,"" he says. In Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region - where fighting is at its fiercest - he says the Ukrainian army continues to protect the city ""with what we can,"" but that it would have been ""much more efficient at repelling the enemy and liberating Ukrainian land had we received more heavy weaponry by now."" Russia's advantage is overwhelming, he adds. ""On average, they shoot about 50,000 rounds a day, now this is literally a barrage of mortar shells, air bombardment, missiles strikes. ""There is not even one Ukrainian city at the moment which is not in the risk zone. Just today we have a missile strike in one of the cities in the Chernihiv region, which is not in the east of Ukraine. But nevertheless it was hit."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Bachelet said she regretted ""the increasing censorship and restrictions on independent mediaâ - and described ""the arbitrary arrest of a large number of anti-war protesters"" in Russia as ""worrying"". An adviser to Ukraine's defence minister says more weapons are needed urgently from the West. Speaking on BBC World Service's Newshour, Yuriy Sak says that though Ukraine is grateful for the weapons it has received so far from Western countries, further supplies are not arriving as quickly as they should. ""We are a little concerned, there is not sufficient understanding of the level of the threat we are facing and Europe is facing,"" he says. In Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region - where fighting is at its fiercest - he says the Ukrainian army continues to protect the city ""with what we can,"" but that it would have been ""much more efficient at repelling the enemy and liberating Ukrainian land had we received more heavy weaponry by now."" Russia's advantage is overwhelming, he adds. ""On average, they shoot about 50,000 rounds a day, now this is literally a barrage of mortar shells, air bombardment, missiles strikes. ""There is not even one Ukrainian city at the moment which is not in the risk zone. Just today we have a missile strike in one of the cities in the Chernihiv region, which is not in the east of Ukraine. But nevertheless it was hit."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Women embrace at a memorial to those killed in the Uvalde mass shooting A cross-party group of US senators have agreed a framework for potential legislation on gun safety, following a spate of mass shootings. This would include support for tougher checks for buyers aged under 21 and cracking down on illegal gun purchases. Crucially, the proposals are supported by 10 Republicans, meaning they have the numbers to be voted into law. President Biden said the plans were ""steps in the right direction"" but they fall far short of what he called for. Previous attempts to tighten gun laws failed to get the required support in Congress. Tens of thousands of protestersrallied across the US on Saturdayto call for stricter gun laws in the wake of two mass shootings. ""Today, we are announcing a common sense, bipartisan proposal to protect America's children, keep our schools safe, and reduce the threat of violence across our country,"" the Senate group said in a statement. ""Families are scared, and it is our duty to come together and get something done that will help restore their sense of safety and security in their communities."" The senators also called for increased investment in mental health services and school safety resources, as well as including domestic violence convictions and restraining orders in the national background check database for people buying firearms. Where does US gun control go from here? US gun control claims fact-checked America's gun culture - in seven charts President Biden urged lawmakers to pass the proposals quickly, while making clear that they did not go as far as he wanted. The president has pushed for far bigger reforms - including a ban on assault rifles, which were used in the Texas and Buffalo mass shootings - or at least an increase in the age at which they can be purchased. ""Obviously, it does not do everything that I think is needed, but it reflects important steps in the right direction, and would be the most significant gun safety legislation to pass Congress in decades,"" he said in a statement. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat who said the plans were ""a good first step"", said he wanted to move a bill quickly to a Senate vote once legislative details were worked out. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said the measures showed ""the value of dialogue and cooperation"". He added: ""I continue to hope their discussions yield a bipartisan product that makes significant headway on key issues like mental health and school safety, respects the Second Amendment, earns broad support in the Senate, and makes a difference for our country."" Democratic Senator Chris Murphy said a ""substantial"" part of the deal had been nailed down by negotiators, allowing the drafting of legislation to get under way on Monday, Reuters news agency reported. The news has also been welcomed by some gun control activists. ""This is a first step and it's actually a lot more than I thought it would be. This is progress even if small,"" tweeted David Hogg, a survivor of the 2018 Parkland school shooting and co-founder of March for Our Lives, a student-led movement focused on gun violence prevention.

"Wilson revealed her new relationship on Friday, describing her partner as her ""Disney princess"" An Australian newspaper has denied outing actress Rebel Wilson amid a storm of criticism over its reporting of her new relationship with a woman. On Friday, Wilson said she had found her ""Disney princess"" as she shared a selfie with her partner onInstagram,external. But on Saturday theSydney Morning Herald,externalrevealed it had known about the relationship before it was public and had given Wilson two days to comment. The Herald denied pressuring Wilson, saying it had ""simply asked questions"". But the paper has faced criticism on social media, with LGBTQ+ campaigners saying it was unacceptable to put pressure on people to come out. In response to a Twitter post saying it wasn't Wilson's choice to come out, the 42-year-old Australian actress, who is known for roles in Bridesmaids and Pitch Perfect among others,said,externalit was a ""very hard situation but trying to handle it with grace"". Wilson: I know what it's like to be invisible Rebel Wilson 'deeply sorry' for plus-sized claims Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Wilson's post about her relationship with leisurewear designer Ramona Agruma prompted a wave of congratulations from fans and famous friends - along with more than 1.6 million likes. But a day later Andrew Hornery, a columnist at the Herald, revealed the paper had known about the relationship and contacted Wilson's representatives on Thursday morning - ""with an abundance of caution and respect"" - to request a comment. Writing in the Private Sydney column, Hornery said: ""In a perfect world, 'outing' same-sex celebrity relationships should be a redundant concept in 2022. Love is love, right? ""As Rebel Wilson knows, we do not live in a perfect world. ""So, it was with an abundance of caution and respect that this media outlet emailed Rebel Wilson's representatives on Thursday morning, giving her two days to comment on her new relationship with LA leisure wear designer Ramona Agruma, before publishing a single word."" Hornery went on to criticise Wilson, saying she instead ""opted to gazump the story"", adding that ""her choice to ignore our discreet, genuine and honest queries was, in our view, underwhelming"". BBC reporter Megha Mohan was among those on social media to criticise the paper's journalistic methods and the tone of the piece, saying: ""Still reeling from the fact that a publication gave someone a deadline to out them in 2022. Maybe I'm incredibly naive but this is what I imagined 90s gutter press was like and most journalists had huge standards change since then."" LGBTQ+ campaigners also criticised the paper. A Stonewall spokesperson said: ""Coming out is a deeply personal decision. Whether, when and how to come out should be decided by the individual, entirely on their terms. ""It is simply not OK to 'out' LGBTQ+ people or put pressure on us to come out. Media outlets should take care not to sensationalise LGBTQ+ lives and relationships."" Allow Twitter content?

But the Herald's editor, Bevan Shields,denied the paper had outed Wilson,external, saying it had made no decision about what it would have published. He wrote: ""Like other mastheads do every day, we simply asked questions and as standard practice included a deadline for a response. ""I had made no decision about whether or what to publish, and the Herald's decision about what to do would have been informed by any response Wilson supplied."" Shields added that the Private Sydney was a column ""in which the writer's interaction with his subjects is often part of the story"", adding it was not a ""standard news story"". Last month, Wilson told People magazine she had been set up with a new partner ""through a friend"" but refused to reveal their identity. She said: ""We spoke on the phone for weeks before meeting. And that was a really good way to get to know each other. ""It was a bit old-school in that sense - very romantic."" Wilson was previously in a relationship with businessman Jacob Busch. They made their red carpet debut as a couple in September 2020 at a gala in Monaco but appeared to confirm their split the following February. Earlier this year, Wilson followed in the footsteps of Graham Norton, Dame Joanna Lumley and Stephen Fry by hosting the Bafta film awards at the Royal Albert Hall in London.

"Beijing has reported 1,997 local Covid cases since 22 April A total of 166 Covid infections in China have been linked to a single bar in the capital Beijing, officials say. A government spokesman described the outbreak as ""ferocious"". All residents living in the area where the bar is located will be tested over the next three days. The number of infections in the city is low by international standards but high for China, which is the world's only major economy still maintaining a ""zero Covid"" policy. The outbreak was traced to a venue called the Heaven Supermarket Bar, in the well-known entertainment area of Sanlitun in Chaoyang district. Two buildings housing hundreds of people in Chaoyang were put under strict lockdown on Sunday after a positive case was reported, a residential committee worker told Reuters news agency. Some people in Beijing said they were sent texts telling them to report to authorities if they had recently visited Sanlitun's bars. Chinese officials have reversed the relaxation of some Covid rules in Beijing because of the outbreak. Most children in the capital will not return to school next week as originally planned, officials said. The capital has reported 1,997 local Covid cases since 22 April. Relief and caution as Shanghai returns to life China's overall policy of ""zero Covid"" remains in place and people catching Covid face quarantine or hospital.

"British Muslims hoping to make a pilgrimage to Mecca are at risk of losing thousands of pounds after the Saudi government has enforced online booking. Pilgrims have been told to use a website to register their interest and that a draw will take place to choose who will go on Hajj. Some have already booked with Hajj tour operators and could lose their money. Hajj is a religious requirement for all Muslims who can afford it. It is one of the five pillars of Islam along with five daily prayers, fasting, charity and a belief in God (Allah) and in Muhammad as a prophet. The cost of the once in a lifetime trip varies from about Â£6,000 to more than Â£10,000 and many Muslims spend years saving up for it. Famida, not her real name, is in her 30s and lives in the north west of England. She told the BBC she has been waiting to go to Mecca with members of her extended family for two years. She had registered her interest with a local travel agent and was very excited about fulfilling an important part of her Islamic faith. Famida said she was ""heartbroken"" when she heard that she and her husband would have to book the visit online. ""It was so upsetting it actually made us cry,"" she said. Famida was also unsure about using the new digital booking system. She said she didn't know what sort of service they would receive, if they'd be able to visit all the historical sites, how much the trip would cost, and who to complain to if anything went wrong. Despite her concerns she has submitted her and her husband's name via the digital portal to say she wants to make the pilgrimage in a few weeks' time but is worried about how much time she has to prepare for it. ""If you think about it practically, no. I've got children who're at school, they attend football, madrassah, they go to  madrassah, cricket, football."" The head of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Hajj and Umrah, Yasmin Qureshi, has written to the Minister of Hajj and Umrah, Tawfiq bin Fawzan Al-Rabiah to ask for the new system to be delayed until next year. In the letter seen by the BBC, Ms Qureshi has asked if money paid to Saudi service providers will be refunded. She has also said she is worried that Muslims who had deferred their trip in 2020 risk major financial losses if their pilgrimage is not carried out. Travel agent Mohsin Shah says the changes have had a big financial impact She is also concerned about how and if pilgrims' money will be protected under the new scheme. Ms Qureshi said: ""Certainly for this year, do not organise the portal system because it's not going to work. Who do you complain to if things don't turn out correctly?"" It is also unclear how many Hajj visas will be allocated to the UK. Previously about 25,000 were issued every year. Figures quoted in some Arabic media suggested this number could now be halved. Travel agents in the UK who specialise in arranging Hajj tours are also worried as they will lose out financially. Mohsin Shah, a Manchester based travel agent, and his London-based partner were due to take 48 pilgrims to Mecca later this month. He said all the pilgrims now have to re-book their visit online and he doesn't know how many of them will get a visa to travel. He charged Â£9,500 for a five star package and has paid money to hotels and transport providers in Mecca. ""It's a big (financial) impact (on us) because we're not sure what's going to happen and how we can arrange it because hotels were booked and transport."" There are 3.72 million Muslims in the UK according to figures from Office for National Statistics. All pilgrims from Europe, America and Australia must use the new online portal to book their pilgrimage. The BBC has contacted the Licensed Hajj Organisers UK, an independent industry watchdog, and the Council for British Hajjis UK for a comment. The Saudi government has also been asked to comment.

"The human cost of the battle for the city of Severodonetsk is very high and simply terrifying, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says All three bridges to the embattled eastern Donbas city have been destroyed, says regional governor Serhiy Haidai A pro-Russian separatist leader says Ukrainian troops there must ""surrender or die"" because ""there is no other option"" UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has warned that the war in Ukraine risks plunging millions into food poverty across the globe This comes as a senior Ukrainian official says the country's grain harvest is likely to drop by almost half this year, following the invasion Up to 1,200 bodies found across Ukraine, including some found in mass graves, have not yet been identified, the head of the national police says Edited by Claire Heald A resident walks between apartment blocks in Bakhmut, Ukraine We're pausing our live coverage shortly. Here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today:  Updates were brought to you today by George Wright, Heather Sharp, James Harness, Alexandra FouchÃ©, James Clarke, Victoria Lindrea, Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow.  Orla GuerinReporting from Lysychansk Ukraineâs president says Lysychansk is already dead, along with neighboring Severodonetsk - both ghost cities now. Russia is not just destroying apartment buildings, flats and homes, itâs destroying history and the fabric of cities. This is a deliberate tactic - bomb, shell, burn, and leave nothing but scorched earth. Those who remain make brief escapes from their basements to cook outdoors. The city has no power or running water. The city is running out of time. This is now an artillery war and Ukraine doesnât have enough big guns or ammunition. Just a short distance away, neighbouring Severodonetsk is burning and may soon fall. Ukrainian troops there are fighting building to building, street to street but all bridges to the city have now been destroyed. Ukraine is facing an enemy that has learned lessons and is imposing crushing losses in battle. Troops fight on but the handful of advanced weapon systems promised by Britain and the United States may be too little, too late. Here in the Donbas region right now, it looks like a losing battle. Read Orla's report in full:Russia erasing history in Ukraine's 'dead city'. Some lighter news from Ukraine now - Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has injured his leg while playing sport. ""There could be a story about an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group. But in reality, I just injured my leg trying to resume sports for the first time since the beginning of the war,"" Kuleba wrote on Instagram, posting a photo of himself with a bandaged leg. He didn't disclose what sport he was playing. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""Trouble happens, but it doesn't get me off my feet. There is no time to leave the ranks now,"" he wrote. He said that he will continue to work on the issues of heavy weapons, Russian sanctions and EU candidate status for Ukraine. ""Even on crutches and one leg - forward to victory,"" Kuleba added. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov Turning now to Russia and it says the main goal of its military
operation in Ukraine is to protect what it calls the Donetsk and Luhansk
people's republics, a spokesman for the Kremlin says. ""In general, the protection of the republics is the main goal of the special military operation,"" Dmitry Peskov says, according to Russia's RIA state news agency. Russian officials only refer to the invasion as a ""special military operation"" aiming to ""demilitarise"" or ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine, referencing a baseless claim about Nazis in the Ukrainian government, which Moscow uses to justify the invasion. Donetsk and Luhansk are two breakaway Russian-backed
entities in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Russia is currently focusing its war effort on Donbas after its forces were forced to retreat from other parts of the country. More now on a former British soldier who was killed while fighting in Ukraine. The International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine says he was one of its members. Jordan Gatley left the British army in March and travelled to Ukraine,where he died in the battle for control of Severodonetsk. âWe can confirm that Jordan Gatley was a legionnaire and he was in the International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine,"" the Ukrainian legion said in a statement. ""Jordan made the ultimate sacrifice defending Ukraine, her sovereignty and freedom,"" it said. ""Jordan will forever be a hero of Ukraine and the legion. We thank Jordan for his service and selfless sacrifice.â More now from President Zelensky's nightly address to the Ukrainian people. He says he thinks the human cost of the battle for the eastern Donbas region ""will without doubt be remembered in military history as one of the most violent battles in Europe"". Earlier this month, Zelensky said his army was losing ""between 60 and 100 soldiers"" a day in the battle for Donbas. ""We are dealing with absolute evil. And we have no choice but to move forward and free our territory,"" he adds. Read more:Why is Russia trying to capture Donbas? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking about Severodonetsk, the strategically important city in the east that Russian forces are close to fully occupying. ""The human cost of this battle is very high for us. It is simply terrifying,"" Zelensky says on Telegram in his daily address to the Ukrainian people. All three bridges leading to the city have been destroyed, the regional governor reported earlier this evening. Ukrainian troops remaining in the city must ""surrender or die"", a military representative of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic has said. We've been following the battle in the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which appears to be falling increasingly under Russian control amid intense street battles. Across the river lies its twin city, Lysychansk. It's still in Ukrainian hands, but the regional governor says it's under heavy Russian fire. Assuming Russia is aiming to control all of Luhansk, it will be the next target after Severodonetsk. Photographs from the past few days give a sense of life for those remaining in Lysychansk. Maksym Katerin stands in the yard of his damaged house today, after his mother and his step-father were killed in shelling A man tries to put out a fire with a bucket of water after a bombardment destroyed the home next door on Friday A man and two boys cycle in an empty street in the city on Friday. In early June, an estimated 20,000 of the city's roughly 100,000 residents were thought to remain. Residents queue to receive bread given out by police officers in the city on Saturday. Regional police claim seven bodies, several with their hands and legs tied, have been found in a grave near the town of Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, reports AFP. ""Seven civilians were tortured by the Russians then executed in a cowardly manner with a bullet to the head,"" Kyiv regional police chief Andriy Nebytovhas written on Facebook,external. ""This grave was discovered today in an area where Russian troops were stationed near the village of Myrotske"", he writes, adding police are ""working to identify the deceased"". The town of Bucha was occupied by Russian troops during the initial weeks of the invasion. After the town was liberated in early April, at least 500 dead bodies were found, many in makeshift and mass graves. Russia, which withdrew from the town on 30 March, has repeatedly rejected allegations of war crimes in Bucha - insisting they are ""falsifications"" by Ukraine, backed by its allies in the West. Read more about thebodies found in Bucha.  Bodies of Bucha residents were found in makeshift graves by local police following the month-long occupation Firefighters extinguish a fire at the central Maisky market Away from the fighting in Severodonetsk, at least three people, including
a child, have been killed and 18 injured, in a Ukrainian
artillery attack at a market in the Russian-backed separatist
Ukrainian region of Donetsk, officials there said. The Donetsk News Agency has shown pictures of parts of central Maisky market in flames and bodies on the ground. ""We had a hit to the market - there were many people here,""
Yan Gagin, an adviser to the separatists' self-styled
government, tells the Russian RIA news agency. He says a woman and child were among the dead. A soldier comforts a woman at the market Local health officials report 18 people have been injured, including two children. The BBC has been unable to verify these reports. This bridge, pictured in May, was the first of three linking Severodonetsk and Lysychansk to be destroyed For weeks now, Severodonetsk has been the focus of Russian military bombardment in Ukraine. Reports suggest about 70% of the city is currently under Russian control. Severodonetsk, and its twin city, Lysychansk, form an important regional and industrial focal point in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Capturing the two cities would give Russia control of the entire Luhansk region - parts of which are already controlled by Russian-backed separatists.  The twin cities sit astride the strategic Siversky Donets river, while the key, 90km-long (56 miles) central sector of Russiaâs front line lies to the west of the river. The regional governor says the third of three bridges into the city has been destroyed today, a day after the second. With Russian-controlled areas to the north, east and south of Severodonetsk, this greatly reduced access to and from Ukrainian-held areas. Regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said he believes Lysychansk, which is on higher ground, is of more strategic importance, and that the Russians have also been targeting the road from Bakhmut towards the two cities. Only around 15,000 people, from a pre-war population of 100,000, are still believed to be in the city. With heavy shelling and intense street fighting ongoing, evacuation is impossible at present, with the situation described as ""extremely difficult"". Luhansk and the neighbouring region of Donetsk - which run from Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border with Russia - make up the Donbas,whose so-called ""liberation"" is currently Russian President Putin's top priority. Russian military success in the Donbas could lead to annexation by Moscow of the entire region, US officials believe. Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv Columns of smoke rise from Severodonetsk last week The battle for Severodonetsk has been as intense as any fight in the Donbas region, but it seems Russia is now on the cusp of taking the city. The regional Ukrainian governor, Serhiy Haidai, warned of an imminent symbolic and strategic loss, saying Severodonetsk will soon be cut off from the rest of the country if the Russians destroy its last remaining bridge. It was in this fierce frontline fight that British ex-soldier Jordan Gatley was shot dead, his family revealed at the weekend. Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's defence minister, said his country was deeply grateful for ongoing foreign support, but that weapons from the West were not arriving as quickly as they should. He said every Ukrainian city remained at risk of Russian attack, not just those in the east of the country. President Zelensky has called for upgraded aerial defence systems, revealing that more than 2,600 cruise missiles have landed in Ukraine since the start of the war. British soldier Jordan Gatley was killed while fighting Russian forces in Severodonetsk Returning now to news in the last few days that a former UK soldier has been killed in Severodonetsk, the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says he doesn't know how many veterans are fighting in Ukraine. ""The simple reality is we don't know,"" he told MPs, when quizzed by shadow defence secretary John Healey. Wallace said, at the outbreak of the conflict in February, politicians had ""publicly made statements to try and deter"" UK citizens from joining the fight in Ukraine. It follows Friday's news ofthe death of Jordan Gatley, shot dead in Severodonetsk. ""Obviously I, like others, am saddened by the loss of the other former veteran who was reported killed recently,"" said the defence secretary. Two Britons captured and condemned to death for fighting Russian forces""were themselves living in Ukraine or half Ukrainian"", he added. ""But as far as individuals who decided of their own volition to go and fight, separate from the United Kingdom, or indeed separate of any of the United Kingdom's serving personnel, we are unaware of the total number."" He said the question had been raised with his Ukrainian counterpart ""on a number of occasions"". ""It is, of course, for the Ukrainians to answer and find those details, but I do have some sympathy with the Ukrainians - they are fighting a war, and not one or two or three of their citizens are on that front, tens of thousands of those citizens."" Battles are still raging in Severodonetsk Just joining us or need a recap? Here are the latest developments from Ukraine: Severodonetsk Grain  All three bridges to the embattled city of Severodonetsk have been destroyed, says regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Inan update,external, he says although Russian troops have not completely captured the city - which is at the centre of the fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops - all bridges leading to the regional centre have now been destroyed, making the evacuation of residents and the transportation of goods impossible. Residents who remain in the city are surviving under extremely difficult conditions, he adds, with the city under heavy fire. A UN-approved humanitarian zone should be set up around the port of Odesa, a British MP says, to ensure exports of grain can get out of Ukraine, which is one of the world's main food producers. Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, says with Russia consolidating in the Donbas, ""there's every chance they may be turning their sights to Odesa"". ""If this port falls, Ukraine will be landlocked, further impacting on the cost-of-living crisis across Europe, including here, because critical grain exports can't get out,"" he says. He suggests to Defence Secretary Ben Wallace the UK could ""lead a coalition of willing Nato allies to secure a UN General Assembly-approved humanitarian zone around the port and territorial waters, with neighbouring international waters policed by an international maritime force"". ""This would ensure the breadbasket of Europe and beyond is able to function and remain part of Ukraine,"" Ellwood says. Wallace says Ellwood makes a ""very valid"" suggestion about the importance of getting the grain out of Ukraine, but adds: ""I'm afraid it is definitely easier said than done when it comes to securing that Black Sea and a UN mandate to do that."" Anti-tank barriers sit among wheat fields in southern Ukraine UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has spoken to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva about the ""havoc and destruction"" caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine  - and the consequential risks of plunging millions into poverty across the globe. ""Since we last gathered the war in Ukraine continues to destroy the lives of many.... the horrors inflicted on the civilian population will leave their indelible mark, including on generations to come,""  she said, at the gathering on Monday. ""Its social, economic and political ramifications ripple across the region and globally - with no end in sight,"" she continued, adding that the ""global food, fuel and finance crisis now risks plunging millions into food insecurity and poverty"". According to the World Food Programme, the number of people living with severe food insecurity is expected to grow ""from 276 million at the start of 2022, to 323 million in the course of the year"" - with the poorest in society likely to suffer the most, Ms Bachelet concluded. A Ukrainian serviceman stands in a wheat field in the Donetsk region of Ukraine Ukraine's grain harvest is likely to drop to around
48.5 million tonnes this year from 86 million tonnes last year
following Russia's invasion, a senior government official said. First Deputy Agriculture Minister Taras Vysotskyi told Reuters that the
total area sown had fallen by 25% and the exportable
surplus could be 30 million tonnes, meaning a huge loss of
revenue. Ukraine is a major global grain and oil seed grower,
but its exports have been severely hit since Russia's invasion. A Russian blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea
ports means efforts are being made to export by road, river and
rail. Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova was detained after she disrupted Russia's state TV news with an anti-war protest in March UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet has used her speech to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva, to express her concerns around Russia's censorship of free speech and the media. She highlighted new criminal laws which had been introduced effectively banning ""the dissemination of information - based on vague and ambiguous notions including false news"". Bachelet said she regretted ""the increasing censorship and restrictions on independent mediaâ - and described ""the arbitrary arrest of a large number of anti-war protesters"" in Russia as ""worrying"". An adviser to Ukraine's defence minister says more weapons are needed urgently from the West. Speaking on BBC World Service's Newshour, Yuriy Sak says that though Ukraine is grateful for the weapons it has received so far from Western countries, further supplies are not arriving as quickly as they should. ""We are a little concerned, there is not sufficient understanding of the level of the threat we are facing and Europe is facing,"" he says. In Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region - where fighting is at its fiercest - he says the Ukrainian army continues to protect the city ""with what we can,"" but that it would have been ""much more efficient at repelling the enemy and liberating Ukrainian land had we received more heavy weaponry by now."" Russia's advantage is overwhelming, he adds. ""On average, they shoot about 50,000 rounds a day, now this is literally a barrage of mortar shells, air bombardment, missiles strikes. ""There is not even one Ukrainian city at the moment which is not in the risk zone. Just today we have a missile strike in one of the cities in the Chernihiv region, which is not in the east of Ukraine. But nevertheless it was hit."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"The UK's competition watchdog has been asked to conduct an urgent review into whether a 5p fuel duty cut is being passed on quickly enough to drivers. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has urged the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to examine the fuel market and whether there are local variations in petrol and diesel prices. The cost of filling an average family car has now hit a record Â£100. It comes as the CBI warned households will go into recession later this year. The Petrol Retailers Association, which represents independent fuel retailers, said it ""welcomed transparency regarding fuel pricing"" and would co-operate with the CMA's investigation. Pump prices have been rising since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February led to oil supply fears. Last week, the RAC motoring organisation said the cost of filling a 55-litre tank reached Â£100.27 for petrol and Â£103.43 for diesel. Fuel prices: Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Calls for more help as cost to fill a tank hits Â£100 In a letter to the CMA,external, Mr Kwarteng said that despite introducing a fuel duty cut ""there remains widespread concern about the pace of the increase in prices at the forecourt and, that prices may not fall as much or as fast as they rise"". As well as looking at whether the duty cut is being passed on to consumers, Mr Kwarteng has also asked the CMA to examine ""whether the retail fuel market has adversely affected consumer interests"". This will include investigating whether there are price variations for petrol and diesel at local forecourts. ""Drivers should be getting a fair deal for fuel across the UK,"" said Mr Kwarteng. ""Healthy competition between forecourts is key to achieving this, with competition working to keep pressure on prices."" He has asked for the CMA to report back to him by 7 July. The Petrol Retailers Association says its members passed on the 5p fuel duty cut after it was announced in March, but wholesale fuel prices have continued to rise since then. It has left retailers ""operating on extremely tight margins"", it says. Boss Gordon Balmer said the association had requested several meetings with Mr Kwarteng ""to explain how the fuel market works"" but had not heard back. ""Our members have had to endure several [unfair] headlines in the press,"" he added. ""Therefore, the news that the minister has contacted the CMA to conduct an urgent review of the fuel market is timely."" Jack Cousens, head of roads policy at the AA, said while the group welcomed the review, ""more urgent action is needed"". ""To relieve pressure at the pumps we need an immediate 10p cut to fuel duty. That would help restore some balance ahead of the initial CMA findings due in early July."" Edmund King OBE, president of the AA, maintains that there is space for a further fuel duty cut. ""The government is still making 8.74p more in VAT than they were this time last year,"" he told the BBC's Today programme, ""so there is money there for another possible duty cut."" He added that retailers should publish fuel wholesale prices alongside pump prices. ""That does seem to increase competition locally in places where it's currently done, like Austria and Northern Ireland."" Mr King said price differences of up to 8p a litre were found between local garages and supermarkets. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told the BBC: ""Once we get the review of that then it will be right to look at what more, if we need to, we can do to help people to make sure it's actually getting to where we want to see that support."" Labour said it had been calling for a CMA investigation into pump prices for some time. Setting out measures to tackle the rising cost of living, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told Times Radio: ""We know that the market for petrol and diesel is not working properly, and even when the government reduced duty back in March it was not passed onto consumers."" The Liberal Democrats urged the government to cut fuel duty in rural areas to help families bearing the brunt of record petrol prices. Analysis of official figures by the party suggests households in rural areas pay Â£114 a week on transport costs, almost Â£40 more than those in urban areas. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit a 40-year high of 9% in April, with higher energy bills and fuel prices contributing to the increase. The head of the UK's largest business group warned on Sunday that households will go into recession later this year as people cut spending to combat rising living costs. Tony Danker, director-general of the CBI, forecast that spending on the High Street and on discretionary items will ""go negative"" and that Britons were already ""trading down"". ""It is a well-known behaviour when there's high inflation,"" Mr Danker told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme. ""They're not buying as many discretionary goods or they're buying the cheaper option in the supermarkets."" The CBI has significantly downgraded its growth outlook for the UK this year from 5.1% to 3.7%, blaming inflation as the ""primary source"" of the slowdown. It predicts growth of just 1% in 2023 compared with a previous forecast of 3%. Mr Danker said: ""The only real thing stopping us from having a full-blown recession this year is that at the moment business investment levels are quite high."" A recession is defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive quarters. He said: ""The risk is if business investment starts to fall then the whole country could go into recession sooner than some are predicting, ie next year so I think that's why at the moment there's not a lot you can do about household spending when inflation is this high but you do need to stabilise confidence among firms so they don't stop spending too.""

Analysis of official figures by the party suggests households in rural areas pay Â£114 a week on transport costs, almost Â£40 more than those in urban areas. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - hit a 40-year high of 9% in April, with higher energy bills and fuel prices contributing to the increase. The head of the UK's largest business group warned on Sunday that households will go into recession later this year as people cut spending to combat rising living costs. Tony Danker, director-general of the CBI, forecast that spending on the High Street and on discretionary items will ""go negative"" and that Britons were already ""trading down"". ""It is a well-known behaviour when there's high inflation,"" Mr Danker told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme. ""They're not buying as many discretionary goods or they're buying the cheaper option in the supermarkets."" The CBI has significantly downgraded its growth outlook for the UK this year from 5.1% to 3.7%, blaming inflation as the ""primary source"" of the slowdown. It predicts growth of just 1% in 2023 compared with a previous forecast of 3%. Mr Danker said: ""The only real thing stopping us from having a full-blown recession this year is that at the moment business investment levels are quite high."" A recession is defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive quarters. He said: ""The risk is if business investment starts to fall then the whole country could go into recession sooner than some are predicting, ie next year so I think that's why at the moment there's not a lot you can do about household spending when inflation is this high but you do need to stabilise confidence among firms so they don't stop spending too.""

"The 340-year-old Gloucester warship was discovered after a cannon was spotted on the seabed by divers Sections of a royal shipwreck found off the Norfolk coast may be recoverable from the seabed, a former head of the British Army has said. Lord Dannatt, the deputy lieutenant of Norfolk, is due to chair a charity caring for items from The Gloucester. He hopes a permanent local museum can be created to house its artefacts. The discovery of the wreck, which nearly drowned a future king in 1682, was revealed on Friday after being kept secret for years for security reasons. The warship ran aground off the coast of Great Yarmouth, nearly killing the Duke of York, who went on to become King James II of England. Diarist and naval administrator Samuel Pepys witnessed the Gloucester's sinking The wreck was found by two divers in 2007 andits discovery has only just been made publicafter its many artefacts were carefully salvaged from the sea. Maritime expert Prof Claire Jowitt, from the University of East Anglia (UEA), said it was ""the single most significant historic maritime discovery since theraising of the Mary Rose in 1982,external"". This video can not be played Two divers say it was an ""absolute privilege"" to discover the warship Lord Dannatt, the former British Army Chief of the General Staff, suggested it might be possible to raise some of the wreck.

"British Muslims hoping to make a pilgrimage to Mecca are at risk of losing thousands of pounds after the Saudi government has enforced online booking. Pilgrims have been told to use a website to register their interest and that a draw will take place to choose who will go on Hajj. Some have already booked with Hajj tour operators and could lose their money. Hajj is a religious requirement for all Muslims who can afford it. It is one of the five pillars of Islam along with five daily prayers, fasting, charity and a belief in God (Allah) and in Muhammad as a prophet. The cost of the once in a lifetime trip varies from about Â£6,000 to more than Â£10,000 and many Muslims spend years saving up for it. Famida, not her real name, is in her 30s and lives in the north west of England. She told the BBC she has been waiting to go to Mecca with members of her extended family for two years. She had registered her interest with a local travel agent and was very excited about fulfilling an important part of her Islamic faith. Famida said she was ""heartbroken"" when she heard that she and her husband would have to book the visit online. ""It was so upsetting it actually made us cry,"" she said. Famida was also unsure about using the new digital booking system. She said she didn't know what sort of service they would receive, if they'd be able to visit all the historical sites, how much the trip would cost, and who to complain to if anything went wrong. Despite her concerns she has submitted her and her husband's name via the digital portal to say she wants to make the pilgrimage in a few weeks' time but is worried about how much time she has to prepare for it. ""If you think about it practically, no. I've got children who're at school, they attend football, madrassah, they go to  madrassah, cricket, football."" The head of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Hajj and Umrah, Yasmin Qureshi, has written to the Minister of Hajj and Umrah, Tawfiq bin Fawzan Al-Rabiah to ask for the new system to be delayed until next year. In the letter seen by the BBC, Ms Qureshi has asked if money paid to Saudi service providers will be refunded. She has also said she is worried that Muslims who had deferred their trip in 2020 risk major financial losses if their pilgrimage is not carried out. Travel agent Mohsin Shah says the changes have had a big financial impact She is also concerned about how and if pilgrims' money will be protected under the new scheme. Ms Qureshi said: ""Certainly for this year, do not organise the portal system because it's not going to work. Who do you complain to if things don't turn out correctly?"" It is also unclear how many Hajj visas will be allocated to the UK. Previously about 25,000 were issued every year. Figures quoted in some Arabic media suggested this number could now be halved. Travel agents in the UK who specialise in arranging Hajj tours are also worried as they will lose out financially. Mohsin Shah, a Manchester based travel agent, and his London-based partner were due to take 48 pilgrims to Mecca later this month. He said all the pilgrims now have to re-book their visit online and he doesn't know how many of them will get a visa to travel. He charged Â£9,500 for a five star package and has paid money to hotels and transport providers in Mecca. ""It's a big (financial) impact (on us) because we're not sure what's going to happen and how we can arrange it because hotels were booked and transport."" There are 3.72 million Muslims in the UK according to figures from Office for National Statistics. All pilgrims from Europe, America and Australia must use the new online portal to book their pilgrimage. The BBC has contacted the Licensed Hajj Organisers UK, an independent industry watchdog, and the Council for British Hajjis UK for a comment. The Saudi government has also been asked to comment.

"The Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he was confident new legislation would not break international law New legislation to change post-Brexit trade arrangements will not break international law, the Northern Ireland secretary has said. Brandon Lewis said he was confident the changes would be lawful. The UK government is due to publish legislation on Monday that wouldallow ministers to override parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocolkeeps Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. It prevents a hard border with the Republic of Ireland but means checks on some goods arriving from other parts of the UK. Critics of the move, including the Irish government, have said any unilateral action could breach international law. However Mr Lewis said that when people see the legislation ""they'll see it's focused on fixing the problems with the implementation of the protocol"". ""Doing so is not only within international law but works for people across the United Kingdom and respects the EU single market,"" he told BBC News NI's Sunday Politics programme. Earlier, Mr Lewis told the Sunday Morning programme the UK government would also set out its legal position when introducing the legislation. He said the legal position would ""make sure people see it is within international law"". On Saturday, BBC News NI economic editor John Campbell wrote that representatives from the food industry in Northern Ireland warned thatscrapping the protocol could damage businesses. The Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association (NIFDA) told BBC News NI the protocol was working for the majority of its members. But Mr Lewis said businesses did not want to see ""uncertainty and instability"" and some industries, including hospitality, had been ""consistently clear that parts of the protocol are causing issues"". He added: ""When people see what we're proposing tomorrow, it is sensible solutions to the very issues that have been detrimental to businesses."" The trade deal governs how goods enter Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK and was agreed by the UK government and the European Union following the Brexit vote in 2019. It was designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland when the UK left the European Union. The protocol led to the creation of new goods checks at Northern Ireland sea ports on some products from Great Britain, effectively creating a new trade border in the Irish Sea. Unionist parties, including the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), argue that this has led to extra costs and unnecessary delays, as well as undermining the union between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Read more:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem On Sunday, Irish newspaper theBusiness Post,externalreported that officials from the UK's Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) have written to agri-food businesses setting out what the changes will mean. The letter reportedly said ministers would remove all customs processes for goods moving within the United Kingdom and enable the frictionless movement of agri-food goods staying within the UK. It also indicated that businesses in Northern Ireland could have the ability to choose whether to follow UK or EU regulations, depending on who they are trading with. When asked on the Sunday Politics programme about the possibility of moving to a dual-regulatory system, Mr Lewis said the UK government wants a system ""where products that are moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland to be consumed or used within the UK can do so freely and flexibly"". The new law may allow for firms to choose whether goods follow UK or EU regulations, depending on who they are trading with ""That means giving businesses in Northern Ireland options and the ability to trade both ways as part of the United Kingdom, but have that free ability to trade with the (EU) single market. ""We think we've got a proposal that's very sensible and does that and can give confidence to the EU that there is no risk to the single market."" Any legislation would have to be approved by Parliament, a process which could take months. The legislation could also face challenges by both rebel MPs from within the Conservative Party - after therecent revolt against Prime Minister Boris Johnson's leadership- and in the House of Lords. The EU has previously acknowledged issues with the protocols and, last October, put forward its own proposals which it said would cut paperwork and checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. However, the UK rejected these plans saying they would make things worse. A row over the impact of the protocol has created ablock on forming a devolved government in Northern Ireland, with the DUP stopping the assembly from sitting or a new executive being formed since Sinn FÃ©in emerged as the largest party inMay's election. The DUP, which has the second highest number of Stormont seats,has refused to support the election of a new speaker or first and deputy first ministeruntil there is ""action"" on the protocol. Asked whether Monday's legislation could tempt the party to return to power-sharing, Mr Lewis said he hoped the DUP would see it ""resolves the issues they've been concerned about"". ""If the DUP are true to what they have said and the reason they withdrew around wanting to see positive progress on fixing the problems of the protocol, this legislation will do that,"" he added. But DUP MP Sammy Wilson said it was too early to make a final judgement on the legislation. ""It was supposed to be published on Thursday, it wasn't because there were still arguments within the cabinet and the Conservative Party on what should be contained in the legislation,"" he said. ""We have seen and have been told bits and pieces of what is there but since it has been a changing feast all week, until we see the final draft, then it's impossible for me to judge on."" During the past week, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson defended his party's saying that ""there is not cross-community support for the protocol"". Sinn FÃ©in has said any move by the UK government to change the protocol would be ""unacceptable to the wider public and majority of MLAs (Northern Ireland Assembly members) who support the protocol"". Speaking to Sky News on Sunday, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary-Lou McDonald said that the UK legislation would break international law and cause ""huge, huge damage"" to the Northern Irish and Irish economies. On Wednesday, the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) saidunilateral action on the protocol would mark a ""historic low"". Speaking at the European Parliament, MichÃ©al Martin said it was ""perfectly reasonable"" to want to make improvements to the protocol but warned that any attempt to do so outside the agreed joint mechanisms would damage the rule of law.

"Schwartzel won by one shot from fellow South African Hennie du Plessis A dramatic week for professional golf concluded with former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel pocketing $4.75m (Â£3.86m) with a one-stroke victory at the inaugural LIV Golf Invitational event in Hertfordshire. In three days at the Centurion Club, the 37-year-old from Johannesburg, who won at Augusta in 2011, picked up a sum equal to the amount it has taken him the last four years to earn on the PGA Tour. But the golf was a relative sideshow compared with the seismic impact this start up series has had on the game this week. ""All I can say is that the evolution of golf has arrived,"" LIV Golf chief executive Greg Norman stated at the presentation ceremony. ""For 27 years there have been a lot of obstacles put in our path, a lot of dreams have tried to be squashed but they couldn't squash us,"" added the former world number one, who first tried to set up a world tour in the mid 1990s. PGA bans overshadow LIV Golf's big day All you need to know about Saudi-funded series The event that threatens to blow apart elite men's golf McIlroy shares Canadian Open lead into final round After accepting the trophy, Schwartzel who picked $4m for winning the individual competition and an additional $750,000 for being part of the winning team, said: ""Never in my wildest dreams did I ever think we could play for that much money in golf. ""As you could see I was taking a bit of heat down the stretch and there was a lot of money involved."" The 2018 Masters champion Patrick Reed has joined the LIV series LIV Golf chose the final day to announce that two more Americans have joined their cast list. As Schwartzel was grinding his way to the $4m individual jackpot, LIV revealed 2018 Masters champion Patrick Reed and 46-year-old world number 168 Pat Perez as its latest recruits. Reed is a nine-times winner on the PGA Tour and currently ranked 36 in the world after only one top 10 finish this year. He will make his LIV debut at Pumpkin Ridge next month. ""I'm super excited,"" Reed told the streamed coverage of the final day. ""Being part of the evolution and change in golf is unbelievable."" The 31-year-old Texan added: ""Portland can't get here soon enough.  I can't wait, it is going to be a blast."" Men's professional golf has never endured a more controversial week. On Thursday, 17 players were suspended indefinitely by the PGA Tour for taking part. Reed, Perez and Friday's recruit Bryson DeChambeau face a similar fate. But following an uncomfortable start for several players, when the issue of Saudi Arabian sportswashing dominated the agenda, the upstart project has gathered momentum. The staging of the event was first class with an impressive spectator village and no expense was spared in streamed coverage that benefited from an absence of ad breaks. As the tournament reached its climax with Schwartzel bogeying the last for a closing 72 that left him seven-under-par and one clear of South African compatriot Hennie Du Plessis there were around 100,000 viewers on YouTube. The promotional nature of the commentary may have irritated golf's die-hard viewers but was understandable given the way that LIV want to shake up the professional game. And there is no doubt that is exactly what they have done.  The PGA Tour responded in draconian fashion by issuing bans; how the DP World Tour react is the next big question. Leading officials from the Wentworth-based circuit were spotted at the venue and this at a time when they are coming under increasing pressure from their membership. Many players are dissatisfied with dwindling playing opportunities, which they perceive to be a consequence of the tour's strategic alliance struck with the PGA Tour 18 months ago. Norman's operation is disruptive to golf's eco-system and potentially capable of testing the resilience of that transatlantic relationship. These remain early days in the LIV story and the Saudi Arabian source of their huge financial clout remains controversial. And if they want to change the perception of golf and truly fashion a format that equates to T20 cricket then they must find a way to ditch playing in three balls. With a relatively weak field, including only four of the world's top 50 players, the golf was largely turgid and proved LIV is not immune from the curse of slow play. The final round took two minutes shy of five hours. But the inaugural event still made a significant impact. Leading golf agents and managers were conspicuous throughout the three-day tournament. ""I wasn't sure we'd ever see a shot hit,"" admitted one insider. ""But I think it now has legs and will absolutely be a big part of the landscape of professional golf.  Lots of players who were on the fence would love to be involved now."" This video can not be played Ros Atkins onâ¦ Saudi Arabiaâs $2 billion golf series More players are expected to be unveiled by LIV's second tournament at Portland in Oregon starting on 30 June. The series then visits New Jersey, Boston and Chicago. These are traditional heartlands of American golf and how the US market, brought up on a weekly fare of PGA Tour action, responds will be significant. A warm welcome is not guaranteed among the wider US population. LIV players from the United States have been heavily criticised by a 9/11 survivors group who point out that Osama bin Laden and 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the terrorist attack on 11 September, 2001 were from Saudi Arabia. Terry Strada, the chair of 911familiesunited.org, sent a letter to representatives of Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson, DeChambeau, Reed and Kevin Na criticising their participation. ""Given Saudi Arabia's role in the death of our loved ones and those injured on 9/11 - your fellow Americans - we are angered that you are so willing to help the Saudis cover up this history in their request for 'respectability,'"" Strada wrote. ""When you partner with the Saudis, you become complicit with their whitewash, and help give them the reputational cover they so desperately crave.""

"The government is preparing plans to repeal a legal ban on agency staff filling in for striking workers. Transport SecretaryGrant Shapps told the Sunday Telegraph,externala potential change in legislation could allow companies to hire temporary workers to cover some roles and prevent disruption. Any intervention would not affect therail strikes across Britain this month. But Mr Shapps said changes could be brought in quickly to minimise future action in rail or other sectors. Labour shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told BBC One's Sunday Morning programme the proposals would make it ""less safe to travel"" and accused ministers of ""sowing chaos and sowing division"". ""The government is acting like arsonists rather than firefighters,"" she said. When is the rail strike and which lines will be affected? Are UK travellers heading for a summer of misery? A war of words between rail unions and ministers has been escalating since the RMT union announced three days of strikes, after talks about pay, terms and conditions, and redundancies fell through. Mr Shapps said should the action continue then ""further measures certainly would come in during this particular dispute, if it can't be resolved"". ""We will be looking at the full suite of modernisation that's required,"" he told the Telegraph.  ""The country must not continue to be held to ransom."" The transport secretary said any change could involve secondary legislation, which can be signed off by ministers ""very fast"". Meanwhile,writing in the Sun on Sunday,external, Mr Shapps warned rail workers who plan to strike this month that they will not be able to work overtime on subsequent days to top-up pay they will lose as a result of taking part in the action.  It is is understood this is because rail companies may decide to run restricted timetables after the strike days. Describing the strikes as a ""disruptive and unnecessary stoppage"", he wrote: ""Rail managers and ministers are determined to ensure strikers cannot milk the system to maintain their income while inflicting misery on the public."" Days are passing quickly until this first wave of crippling train strikes start, with no current sign of a resolution. The suggested legislative changes won't happen for the first wave of strikes in just over a week, but if there are more, Grant Shapps hopes agency workers can fill gaps. But 40,000 workers are walking out, and 10,000 more on London Underground. There are a few problems. Firstly, the UK economy has a huge recruitment problem at the moment. There are record numbers of vacancies, and not enough workers to fill them. So finding 50,000 agency workers for the railways when we can't fully resource UK airports could be a challenge. Secondly, both sides of this fractious industrial dispute have said that safety problems with agency workers make this plan impossible. Unions and the rail industry say safety-critical roles like signallers, guards, drivers can't easily be covered. They say these workers don't work for agencies, they already work in the railway. Mr Shapps' comments come less than a month afterrail unions reacted with fury to a government threatto make strike action illegal unless a minimum number of train staff remained working during a walkout. In response, RMT general secretary Mick Lynch said: ""We already have the most restrictive anti-democratic trade union laws in Western Europe and if the government attempts to reduce our rights further, the RMT along with the rest of the trade union movement will mount the fiercest resistance possible."" More than 40,000 RMT members working for Network Rail and 13 train operating companies across Britain will strike on 21, 23 and 25 June. The RMT says train company workers had been subject to ""pay freezes, threats to jobs and attacks on their terms and conditions"". Network Rail plans to cut 2,500 maintenance jobs in a bid to make Â£2bn of savings, but the RMT argues such a move would make accidents more likely. The union's members voted by 87% to 11% in favour of industrial action. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the country ""must not continue to be held to ransom"" Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis criticised the strike action and told the Sunday Morning programme that staff in the rail industry were already ""very well rewarded"". ""The median salary in the rail industry is about Â£46,000â¦ against an average wage in this country of closer to Â£26,000,"" he said. Asked about the proposals to replace striking workers with agency staff, he said the government was ""not taking anything off the table""  but would make sure the railways were ""running properly and safely"". In a separate dispute over pensions and job losses, the RMT's London Underground members will also strike on 21 June. The RMT is calling it the biggest dispute for over three decades and put the industrial action down to the ""inability of the rail employers to come to a negotiated settlement"". Train and tram drivers,part of the Aslef union, are also set to strike in three locations this month. Aslef's general secretary Mick Whelan called Mr Shapps' idea ""impractical"" and asked where the agency workers would come from. ""You can't just ship in a load of signallers and train drivers,"" he said adding: ""If they are not working for the railway now they are either not medically fit, have been dismissed or don't want to do it anymore.""

"The human cost of the battle for the city of Severodonetsk is very high and simply terrifying, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says All three bridges to the embattled eastern Donbas city have been destroyed, says regional governor Serhiy Haidai A pro-Russian separatist leader says Ukrainian troops there must ""surrender or die"" because ""there is no other option"" UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has warned that the war in Ukraine risks plunging millions into food poverty across the globe This comes as a senior Ukrainian official says the country's grain harvest is likely to drop by almost half this year, following the invasion Up to 1,200 bodies found across Ukraine, including some found in mass graves, have not yet been identified, the head of the national police says Edited by Claire Heald A resident walks between apartment blocks in Bakhmut, Ukraine We're pausing our live coverage shortly. Here's a look at the main developments in Ukraine today:  Updates were brought to you today by George Wright, Heather Sharp, James Harness, Alexandra FouchÃ©, James Clarke, Victoria Lindrea, Nathan Williams, Jeremy Gahagan and Claire Heald. Join us again tomorrow.  Orla GuerinReporting from Lysychansk Ukraineâs president says Lysychansk is already dead, along with neighboring Severodonetsk - both ghost cities now. Russia is not just destroying apartment buildings, flats and homes, itâs destroying history and the fabric of cities. This is a deliberate tactic - bomb, shell, burn, and leave nothing but scorched earth. Those who remain make brief escapes from their basements to cook outdoors. The city has no power or running water. The city is running out of time. This is now an artillery war and Ukraine doesnât have enough big guns or ammunition. Just a short distance away, neighbouring Severodonetsk is burning and may soon fall. Ukrainian troops there are fighting building to building, street to street but all bridges to the city have now been destroyed. Ukraine is facing an enemy that has learned lessons and is imposing crushing losses in battle. Troops fight on but the handful of advanced weapon systems promised by Britain and the United States may be too little, too late. Here in the Donbas region right now, it looks like a losing battle. Read Orla's report in full:Russia erasing history in Ukraine's 'dead city'. Some lighter news from Ukraine now - Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has injured his leg while playing sport. ""There could be a story about an enemy sabotage and reconnaissance group. But in reality, I just injured my leg trying to resume sports for the first time since the beginning of the war,"" Kuleba wrote on Instagram, posting a photo of himself with a bandaged leg. He didn't disclose what sport he was playing. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""Trouble happens, but it doesn't get me off my feet. There is no time to leave the ranks now,"" he wrote. He said that he will continue to work on the issues of heavy weapons, Russian sanctions and EU candidate status for Ukraine. ""Even on crutches and one leg - forward to victory,"" Kuleba added. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov Turning now to Russia and it says the main goal of its military
operation in Ukraine is to protect what it calls the Donetsk and Luhansk
people's republics, a spokesman for the Kremlin says. ""In general, the protection of the republics is the main goal of the special military operation,"" Dmitry Peskov says, according to Russia's RIA state news agency. Russian officials only refer to the invasion as a ""special military operation"" aiming to ""demilitarise"" or ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine, referencing a baseless claim about Nazis in the Ukrainian government, which Moscow uses to justify the invasion. Donetsk and Luhansk are two breakaway Russian-backed
entities in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Russia is currently focusing its war effort on Donbas after its forces were forced to retreat from other parts of the country. More now on a former British soldier who was killed while fighting in Ukraine. The International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine says he was one of its members. Jordan Gatley left the British army in March and travelled to Ukraine,where he died in the battle for control of Severodonetsk. âWe can confirm that Jordan Gatley was a legionnaire and he was in the International Legion for the Defence of Ukraine,"" the Ukrainian legion said in a statement. ""Jordan made the ultimate sacrifice defending Ukraine, her sovereignty and freedom,"" it said. ""Jordan will forever be a hero of Ukraine and the legion. We thank Jordan for his service and selfless sacrifice.â More now from President Zelensky's nightly address to the Ukrainian people. He says he thinks the human cost of the battle for the eastern Donbas region ""will without doubt be remembered in military history as one of the most violent battles in Europe"". Earlier this month, Zelensky said his army was losing ""between 60 and 100 soldiers"" a day in the battle for Donbas. ""We are dealing with absolute evil. And we have no choice but to move forward and free our territory,"" he adds. Read more:Why is Russia trying to capture Donbas? Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been speaking about Severodonetsk, the strategically important city in the east that Russian forces are close to fully occupying. ""The human cost of this battle is very high for us. It is simply terrifying,"" Zelensky says on Telegram in his daily address to the Ukrainian people. All three bridges leading to the city have been destroyed, the regional governor reported earlier this evening. Ukrainian troops remaining in the city must ""surrender or die"", a military representative of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic has said. We've been following the battle in the eastern city of Severodonetsk, which appears to be falling increasingly under Russian control amid intense street battles. Across the river lies its twin city, Lysychansk. It's still in Ukrainian hands, but the regional governor says it's under heavy Russian fire. Assuming Russia is aiming to control all of Luhansk, it will be the next target after Severodonetsk. Photographs from the past few days give a sense of life for those remaining in Lysychansk. Maksym Katerin stands in the yard of his damaged house today, after his mother and his step-father were killed in shelling A man tries to put out a fire with a bucket of water after a bombardment destroyed the home next door on Friday A man and two boys cycle in an empty street in the city on Friday. In early June, an estimated 20,000 of the city's roughly 100,000 residents were thought to remain. Residents queue to receive bread given out by police officers in the city on Saturday. Regional police claim seven bodies, several with their hands and legs tied, have been found in a grave near the town of Bucha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, reports AFP. ""Seven civilians were tortured by the Russians then executed in a cowardly manner with a bullet to the head,"" Kyiv regional police chief Andriy Nebytovhas written on Facebook,external. ""This grave was discovered today in an area where Russian troops were stationed near the village of Myrotske"", he writes, adding police are ""working to identify the deceased"". The town of Bucha was occupied by Russian troops during the initial weeks of the invasion. After the town was liberated in early April, at least 500 dead bodies were found, many in makeshift and mass graves. Russia, which withdrew from the town on 30 March, has repeatedly rejected allegations of war crimes in Bucha - insisting they are ""falsifications"" by Ukraine, backed by its allies in the West. Read more about thebodies found in Bucha.  Bodies of Bucha residents were found in makeshift graves by local police following the month-long occupation Firefighters extinguish a fire at the central Maisky market Away from the fighting in Severodonetsk, at least three people, including
a child, have been killed and 18 injured, in a Ukrainian
artillery attack at a market in the Russian-backed separatist
Ukrainian region of Donetsk, officials there said. The Donetsk News Agency has shown pictures of parts of central Maisky market in flames and bodies on the ground. ""We had a hit to the market - there were many people here,""
Yan Gagin, an adviser to the separatists' self-styled
government, tells the Russian RIA news agency. He says a woman and child were among the dead. A soldier comforts a woman at the market Local health officials report 18 people have been injured, including two children. The BBC has been unable to verify these reports. This bridge, pictured in May, was the first of three linking Severodonetsk and Lysychansk to be destroyed For weeks now, Severodonetsk has been the focus of Russian military bombardment in Ukraine. Reports suggest about 70% of the city is currently under Russian control. Severodonetsk, and its twin city, Lysychansk, form an important regional and industrial focal point in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine. Capturing the two cities would give Russia control of the entire Luhansk region - parts of which are already controlled by Russian-backed separatists.  The twin cities sit astride the strategic Siversky Donets river, while the key, 90km-long (56 miles) central sector of Russiaâs front line lies to the west of the river. The regional governor says the third of three bridges into the city has been destroyed today, a day after the second. With Russian-controlled areas to the north, east and south of Severodonetsk, this greatly reduced access to and from Ukrainian-held areas. Regional governor Serhiy Haidai has said he believes Lysychansk, which is on higher ground, is of more strategic importance, and that the Russians have also been targeting the road from Bakhmut towards the two cities. Only around 15,000 people, from a pre-war population of 100,000, are still believed to be in the city. With heavy shelling and intense street fighting ongoing, evacuation is impossible at present, with the situation described as ""extremely difficult"". Luhansk and the neighbouring region of Donetsk - which run from Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border with Russia - make up the Donbas,whose so-called ""liberation"" is currently Russian President Putin's top priority. Russian military success in the Donbas could lead to annexation by Moscow of the entire region, US officials believe. Nick BeakeReporting from Kyiv Columns of smoke rise from Severodonetsk last week The battle for Severodonetsk has been as intense as any fight in the Donbas region, but it seems Russia is now on the cusp of taking the city. The regional Ukrainian governor, Serhiy Haidai, warned of an imminent symbolic and strategic loss, saying Severodonetsk will soon be cut off from the rest of the country if the Russians destroy its last remaining bridge. It was in this fierce frontline fight that British ex-soldier Jordan Gatley was shot dead, his family revealed at the weekend. Yuriy Sak, an adviser to Ukraine's defence minister, said his country was deeply grateful for ongoing foreign support, but that weapons from the West were not arriving as quickly as they should. He said every Ukrainian city remained at risk of Russian attack, not just those in the east of the country. President Zelensky has called for upgraded aerial defence systems, revealing that more than 2,600 cruise missiles have landed in Ukraine since the start of the war. British soldier Jordan Gatley was killed while fighting Russian forces in Severodonetsk Returning now to news in the last few days that a former UK soldier has been killed in Severodonetsk, the UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says he doesn't know how many veterans are fighting in Ukraine. ""The simple reality is we don't know,"" he told MPs, when quizzed by shadow defence secretary John Healey. Wallace said, at the outbreak of the conflict in February, politicians had ""publicly made statements to try and deter"" UK citizens from joining the fight in Ukraine. It follows Friday's news ofthe death of Jordan Gatley, shot dead in Severodonetsk. ""Obviously I, like others, am saddened by the loss of the other former veteran who was reported killed recently,"" said the defence secretary. Two Britons captured and condemned to death for fighting Russian forces""were themselves living in Ukraine or half Ukrainian"", he added. ""But as far as individuals who decided of their own volition to go and fight, separate from the United Kingdom, or indeed separate of any of the United Kingdom's serving personnel, we are unaware of the total number."" He said the question had been raised with his Ukrainian counterpart ""on a number of occasions"". ""It is, of course, for the Ukrainians to answer and find those details, but I do have some sympathy with the Ukrainians - they are fighting a war, and not one or two or three of their citizens are on that front, tens of thousands of those citizens."" Battles are still raging in Severodonetsk Just joining us or need a recap? Here are the latest developments from Ukraine: Severodonetsk Grain  All three bridges to the embattled city of Severodonetsk have been destroyed, says regional governor Serhiy Haidai. Inan update,external, he says although Russian troops have not completely captured the city - which is at the centre of the fighting between Russian and Ukrainian troops - all bridges leading to the regional centre have now been destroyed, making the evacuation of residents and the transportation of goods impossible. Residents who remain in the city are surviving under extremely difficult conditions, he adds, with the city under heavy fire. A UN-approved humanitarian zone should be set up around the port of Odesa, a British MP says, to ensure exports of grain can get out of Ukraine, which is one of the world's main food producers. Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, says with Russia consolidating in the Donbas, ""there's every chance they may be turning their sights to Odesa"". ""If this port falls, Ukraine will be landlocked, further impacting on the cost-of-living crisis across Europe, including here, because critical grain exports can't get out,"" he says. He suggests to Defence Secretary Ben Wallace the UK could ""lead a coalition of willing Nato allies to secure a UN General Assembly-approved humanitarian zone around the port and territorial waters, with neighbouring international waters policed by an international maritime force"". ""This would ensure the breadbasket of Europe and beyond is able to function and remain part of Ukraine,"" Ellwood says. Wallace says Ellwood makes a ""very valid"" suggestion about the importance of getting the grain out of Ukraine, but adds: ""I'm afraid it is definitely easier said than done when it comes to securing that Black Sea and a UN mandate to do that."" Anti-tank barriers sit among wheat fields in southern Ukraine UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has spoken to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva about the ""havoc and destruction"" caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine  - and the consequential risks of plunging millions into poverty across the globe. ""Since we last gathered the war in Ukraine continues to destroy the lives of many.... the horrors inflicted on the civilian population will leave their indelible mark, including on generations to come,""  she said, at the gathering on Monday. ""Its social, economic and political ramifications ripple across the region and globally - with no end in sight,"" she continued, adding that the ""global food, fuel and finance crisis now risks plunging millions into food insecurity and poverty"". According to the World Food Programme, the number of people living with severe food insecurity is expected to grow ""from 276 million at the start of 2022, to 323 million in the course of the year"" - with the poorest in society likely to suffer the most, Ms Bachelet concluded. A Ukrainian serviceman stands in a wheat field in the Donetsk region of Ukraine Ukraine's grain harvest is likely to drop to around
48.5 million tonnes this year from 86 million tonnes last year
following Russia's invasion, a senior government official said. First Deputy Agriculture Minister Taras Vysotskyi told Reuters that the
total area sown had fallen by 25% and the exportable
surplus could be 30 million tonnes, meaning a huge loss of
revenue. Ukraine is a major global grain and oil seed grower,
but its exports have been severely hit since Russia's invasion. A Russian blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea
ports means efforts are being made to export by road, river and
rail. Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova was detained after she disrupted Russia's state TV news with an anti-war protest in March UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet has used her speech to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva, to express her concerns around Russia's censorship of free speech and the media. She highlighted new criminal laws which had been introduced effectively banning ""the dissemination of information - based on vague and ambiguous notions including false news"". Bachelet said she regretted ""the increasing censorship and restrictions on independent mediaâ - and described ""the arbitrary arrest of a large number of anti-war protesters"" in Russia as ""worrying"". An adviser to Ukraine's defence minister says more weapons are needed urgently from the West. Speaking on BBC World Service's Newshour, Yuriy Sak says that though Ukraine is grateful for the weapons it has received so far from Western countries, further supplies are not arriving as quickly as they should. ""We are a little concerned, there is not sufficient understanding of the level of the threat we are facing and Europe is facing,"" he says. In Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region - where fighting is at its fiercest - he says the Ukrainian army continues to protect the city ""with what we can,"" but that it would have been ""much more efficient at repelling the enemy and liberating Ukrainian land had we received more heavy weaponry by now."" Russia's advantage is overwhelming, he adds. ""On average, they shoot about 50,000 rounds a day, now this is literally a barrage of mortar shells, air bombardment, missiles strikes. ""There is not even one Ukrainian city at the moment which is not in the risk zone. Just today we have a missile strike in one of the cities in the Chernihiv region, which is not in the east of Ukraine. But nevertheless it was hit."" Â© 2025 BBC.

""Its social, economic and political ramifications ripple across the region and globally - with no end in sight,"" she continued, adding that the ""global food, fuel and finance crisis now risks plunging millions into food insecurity and poverty"". According to the World Food Programme, the number of people living with severe food insecurity is expected to grow ""from 276 million at the start of 2022, to 323 million in the course of the year"" - with the poorest in society likely to suffer the most, Ms Bachelet concluded. A Ukrainian serviceman stands in a wheat field in the Donetsk region of Ukraine Ukraine's grain harvest is likely to drop to around
48.5 million tonnes this year from 86 million tonnes last year
following Russia's invasion, a senior government official said. First Deputy Agriculture Minister Taras Vysotskyi told Reuters that the
total area sown had fallen by 25% and the exportable
surplus could be 30 million tonnes, meaning a huge loss of
revenue. Ukraine is a major global grain and oil seed grower,
but its exports have been severely hit since Russia's invasion. A Russian blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea
ports means efforts are being made to export by road, river and
rail. Russian journalist Marina Ovsyannikova was detained after she disrupted Russia's state TV news with an anti-war protest in March UN Human Rights chief Michelle Bachelet has used her speech to the UNâs human rights council in Geneva, to express her concerns around Russia's censorship of free speech and the media. She highlighted new criminal laws which had been introduced effectively banning ""the dissemination of information - based on vague and ambiguous notions including false news"". Bachelet said she regretted ""the increasing censorship and restrictions on independent mediaâ - and described ""the arbitrary arrest of a large number of anti-war protesters"" in Russia as ""worrying"". An adviser to Ukraine's defence minister says more weapons are needed urgently from the West. Speaking on BBC World Service's Newshour, Yuriy Sak says that though Ukraine is grateful for the weapons it has received so far from Western countries, further supplies are not arriving as quickly as they should. ""We are a little concerned, there is not sufficient understanding of the level of the threat we are facing and Europe is facing,"" he says. In Severodonetsk in the eastern Donbas region - where fighting is at its fiercest - he says the Ukrainian army continues to protect the city ""with what we can,"" but that it would have been ""much more efficient at repelling the enemy and liberating Ukrainian land had we received more heavy weaponry by now."" Russia's advantage is overwhelming, he adds. ""On average, they shoot about 50,000 rounds a day, now this is literally a barrage of mortar shells, air bombardment, missiles strikes. ""There is not even one Ukrainian city at the moment which is not in the risk zone. Just today we have a missile strike in one of the cities in the Chernihiv region, which is not in the east of Ukraine. But nevertheless it was hit."" Â© 2025 BBC.
