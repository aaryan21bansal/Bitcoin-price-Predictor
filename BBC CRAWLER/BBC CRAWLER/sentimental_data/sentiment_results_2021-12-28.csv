"The British holidaymakers were left stranded as they arrived at Innsbruck airport Innsbruck airport refused to allow 110 British tourists entry into Austria because they had not followed updated Covid restrictions, it has emerged. Police said many were probably caught out on Sunday by a new rule requiring a negative PCR test within 48 hours. Austrian opposition politicians blamed the health minister for failing to update restrictions on the internet. Most of the tourists were flown home immediately but 40 were put up overnight in a hotel. Of those 40, 12 were allowed to take new PCR tests and continue with their holidays, the local authority in Innsbruck said. British travellers arriving in Innsbruck for skiing holidays in the western Tyrol region on Sunday were met by what some of them described as chaos, as the airport implemented new rules that came into effect on Christmas Day for arrivals from the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark and Norway because of the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus.

While 70 of those arriving in Innsbruck were able to fly home on the day, the other 40 were not and were quarantined in an Innsbruck hotel for the night. The 12 people eventually allowed in were reportedly all families with children. The restrictions,currently displayed on the Austrian UK embassy website,external, require anyone over the age of 12 to have a third Covid vaccination and a negative PCR test taken within 48 hours of arrival. Under the previous rules a negative PCR test had to be taken within 72 hours of arrival. While many reportedly had older PCR tests, some also had not received booster doses. One tourist, Victoria Winstanley, said on social media that the team checking Covid certificates for an Easyjet flight either did not have up-to-date information or were not checking them properly. The BBC has approached Easyjet for a comment. Local opposition People's Party tourism spokesman Franz HÃ¶rl said he had no problem with tighter restrictions on countries such as the UK labelled ""virus variant areas"". His issue was with a ""botched"" operation that he called neither professional nor humane, to bring in tourists over the Christmas period, take them to a hotel under police protection and then send them home at their own expense, he told the APA news agency. French ski season in disarray as UK tourists banned Tighter Covid restrictions imposed across Europe He said Health Minister Wolfgang MÃ¼ckstein was to blame because the old restrictions were still showing on the relevant government websites. Austria's Tyrol is especially sensitive to further outbreaks of Covid-19 in its famous ski resorts. The resort of Ischgl was linked to cases in 45 countries at the start of the pandemic when skiers returned home with the virus in February and March 2020. Earlier this month, France banned British holidaymakers from its ski resorts, barring all non-essential travel from the UK.

"We are too used to giving away information freely on social media, says one psychologist What is your rock star name? Can you remember your first pet? What's the first gig you went to? If questions like this pop up when you're scrolling through social media online, you should think twice before answering, a consumer group has warned. TheUK's fraud reporting service,externalsaid Â£2.5bn has been stolen in more than 480,000 cyber crimes in the past year. And Which? estimates online crime in the UK increased 33% since the start of the Covid pandemic. Adam French, senior consumer editor at Which?, warned cyber crime would only increase over Christmas and the new year period as more people shop and socialising online. Police pressure as Covid 'changes crime landscape' Fraud warning for young: 'I had Â£700 stolen' Student hacker jailed for selling exam answers Of Action Fraud's almost half a million reported crimes, more than 90,000 were online shopping or auction scams, and in Wales,fraud reports rose by a quarterduring the first year of the pandemic. Senior consumer rights editor Mr French said although people have some idea how they can be scammed online, there were many new ways in which they may be caught out. ""Unfortunately, online scams can happen, a number of different ways, but at the heart of it is usually fake content, whether that's search engine adverts which crops up, when you're looking for the next best investment opportunity, an ad targeting you on social media or sites selling you really lovely clothes at a bargain price. ""There are so many different ways that scammers can come at you, one of the worst is where you think you're talking to a real person."" He said criminals were building much more realistic sites to scam people, particularly after ""a real explosion of online shopping"" in the last couple of years. Asking for personal information to scam people online is called phishing. Mr French said the types of questions may seem irrelevant at first, but could help someone trying to guess your security questions. Adam French, senior consumer editor at Which?, says there are so many different ways people can be caught out online ""Those kind of quizzes and those personality type tests may seem a little bit of fun, but actually the information out there in the public domain can ultimately be used against you and it's something we do recommend people avoid participating in, even if it does seem like just a bit of fun,"" he said. He explained what made the problem worse was so many cyber crimes went unreported due to many not knowing how to report it, or feeling embarrassed they fell for a scam. ""You wouldn't be embarrassed if you've been the victim of doorstep crime or you had been robbed,"" he said. ""People report it straight to the police to get it dealt with and that's exactly the same mentality we need, ""They are very intelligent criminals and they are good at what they do."" Mr French said big tech companies, such as Facebook and Google, ""have a responsibility to ensure that the advertising they're being paid to promote to you isn't fraudulent"". ""I don't think that's a big ask and that will go big long way to protecting us from fraudulent messaging reaching our eyes in the first place."" According to a psychologist Martin Graff, it is all down to our relationship with being online. ""The very innocuous questions are the kind of quizzes we would see on Facebook anyway, so people just dive into these things without giving them a lot of thought,"" said Mr Graff, of the University of South Wales. ""It is what we might call low level disclosure and is almost sort of chit-chat stuff. ""You would happily tell someone you just met in a pub what your favourite ice cream is and it's no big deal really is just to say those kind of things."" Psychologist Martin Graff said people know they should not give out their information online but are used to it with social media He explained there was a ""privacy paradox"", with people who give away information like this, in that people know they should not give away information online but ""there is a bit of a mismatch between what we actually believe and what we do"". Often people forget there is a ""real person on the other side of the computer"" and the willingness to give away information like this online is mirrored in our approach to social media. ""You wouldn't go outside and shout the same information you write on Facebook down the road with a megaphone which is essentially what you're doing when making an announcement on social media isn't it.""

"People should enjoy themselves but be cautious when celebrating new year, UK care minister Gillian Keegan has said. Revellers should take a lateral flow test before going out and celebrate in well-ventilated areas, she advised. The government is not imposing further Covid restrictions in England, but there are limits on socialising in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. England has reported a record high of 117,093 cases, whilefigures from Walesindicate a steep rise before Christmas. Provisional data in Scotland suggestsanother 9,360 people have tested positive, down on its record of 11,030 on 26 December. No cases data is available in Northern Ireland due to Christmas holidays. Meanwhile, England saw another 1,374 Covid hospital admissions on 26 December - the highest number since February. A total of 9,546 people are in hospital with Covid in England, official figures show. This is the highest since March but well below the peak of 34,000 in January. Not all the patients in hospital will have been admitted for Covid - latest data suggests about three in 10 have the virus but were admitted to hospital for something else. Ms Keegan said that while people should try to enjoy themselves on new year, Omicron was ""highly infectious"" and they needed to exercise caution. The hospitality sector said the decision not to add further measures was a ""lifeline"" for pubs, bars and clubs. This video can not be played Care Minister Gillian Keegan says people should enjoy new year cautiously Ms Keegan also said 214,000 people had received their booster jab over the Christmas weekend and a total of 32.4 million had now received a third dose. Earlier, environment Secretary George Eustice saidthe evidence on Covid cases and admissions did not support more interventions at the momentbut the government would keep its decision not to impose further curbs in England under review. Record levels of demand for Covid PCR tests have leftsome people waiting for up to five days to receive their resultsover Christmas - meaning they have had to self-isolate until they receive their negative result. The UKHSA apologised and said action had been taken to add extra capacity to its laboratory network. A further 16,133 Omicron cases have been confirmed in England, taking the total to 159,204. Some 49 people with a confirmed case of Omicron have now died, according to UKHSA data. On Monday, the health secretary said 90% of cases in England were now the Omicron variant, which was first identified in South Africa just one month ago. The new places where you'll be asked to wear a mask Record demand leads to Covid test result delays What are the new Covid rules for the UK? How can I get my booster jab? Pubs, bars and restaurants have been hard hit in the run-up to Christmas, due to mass cancellations over Omicron fears. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said the decision not to go beyond Plan B measures in England would give ""a real lifeline"" to many businesses. But there are also calls for more support - Adnams brewery boss Andy Wood, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more than half of Christmas business had been lost. Ms Keegan said the governmenthad introduced a Â£1bn packageto support businesses before Christmas. Concerns have also been raised about the impact on hospitals and schools of staff having to self-isolate. Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, told BBC Breakfast that in time, people with Covid should be allowed to ""go about their normal lives"" as they would with a common cold. ""If the self-isolation rules are what's making the pain associated with Covid, then we need to do that perhaps sooner rather than later,"" he said. He suggested this might be able to happen ""once we're past Easter"", depending on the effects of the disease at that time. Prof Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, told the Today programme the decision not to introduce new curbs before the new year was ""probably fine"", with data showing ""very low"" numbers of vaccinated people in intensive care. He said the Omicron variant was ""not the same disease"" we saw last year, adding he thought ""the horrific scenes that we saw a year ago"" were ""now history"". Staff quarantining was putting additional stress on the health service, Sir John said, and lateral flow tests were ""quite a good way"" of showing who was infectious - rather than cutting isolation periodsas has been done in the US. Restrictions do not stop Covid, they just buy time by delaying its spread. Last winter, that time was used to roll out the vaccine programme, which meant when cases started to rise as restrictions were lifted the population was better protected. Given the extent of the booster rollout - nine in 10 of the most vulnerable have had one - we are about as well protected as we can be. So the argument for restrictions is more about spreading out the pressure on the NHS and wider economy given that high rates of infection lead to lots of people isolating. But that then needs balancing against the costs and harms of restrictions. There are finely balanced trade-offs that need to be made. Ministers in England have clearly decided on a different course to their peers elsewhere in the UK in the belief the levels of serious illness caused in this wave will be manageable. But even then there is no guarantee the approaches in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will have much of an impact anyway. Many scientists believe it will take pretty severe restrictions, perhaps a complete ban on indoor mixing, to dent Omicron's spread. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said some trust executives felt staff absences due to self-isolation were going to be a ""bigger problem and challenge"" than the number of people being treated for Covid. He told BBC Breakfast that while there may come a point where Covid was treated like a common cold, that should not be the case for people who work in the NHS, as they dealt with potentially ""very, very vulnerable"" people. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the big issue would be whether there would be enough staff to sustain in-person education when term began in January due to self-isolation. Not all experts have agreed with the government's decision not to impose further measures, with Prof Andrew Hayward - epidemiologist and a member of the advisory group Sage - saying ministers seemed to be acting ""on the optimistic end of the spectrum"". Public health professor Andrew Watterson, of the University of Stirling, accused England of being ""really out of step"" by not introducing further restrictions, saying there was a ""real mismatch"" between some of the data and policy. This variant is very contagious and spreads faster than others Vaccines and boosters are still essential and do a great job at protecting against severe disease It is milder - if you catch it, the risk of needing hospital treatment is up to 70% lower than with previous variants - but that is largely because many of us have built up immunity from vaccines and past infections rather than changes to the virus Read more here. After a two-day halt in publishing data, it was revealed that more than 300,000 new Covid cases had been recorded on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. What are your plans for new year?

"Pharmacists are warning of patchy supplies of rapid Covid tests following changes to self-isolation rules. They said demand for lateral flow tests increased after changes allowed people with Covid in England to end isolation after seven days if they test negative. The Association Of Independent Multiple Pharmacies said staff and customers were stressed over the lack of supply. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said test availability is refreshed throughout the day. ""During periods of exceptional demand there may be temporary pauses in ordering or receiving tests, to ensure we manage distribution across the system"", it added. Labour said the situation was a ""total shambles"" and the government should help people ""trying to do the right thing"" by ordering tests. What are the rules for new year? How many cases are in my area Live updates: No plans to cut self-isolation further Omicron cases now constitute more than 90% of all community Covid cases in England, the UKHSA said on Wednesday. A total of 10,462 people were in hospital with Covid in England as of Wednesday morning, according to figures from NHS England. This is up 48% from a week ago and is the highest number of admissions since 1 March. Not all the patients in hospital will have been admitted for Covid - latest data suggests about three in 10 have the virus but were admitted to hospital for something else. The number of people with Covid in hospital has risen above 10,000 in England for the first time in nearly 10 months. There are currently 10, 462 patients with the virus in hospital. That is the highest level since the start of March - and means the numbers have risen by 2,000 in just two days. Admissions for Covid are rising, the weekly average is more than 50% higher than it was a week ago. But other factors are likely to have contributed to the increase, including a drop in the numbers being discharged. Last Christmas the numbers leaving hospital more than halved as it is more difficult to discharge patients over the festive period. It means there are likely to be hundreds of patients in hospital who have recovered from Covid but just have not left yet. The proportion of hospitalisations for what is known as an incidental admission is also growing and contributing to the increase. These are people being treated for something else, but happen to have Covid. Last week, these cases accounted for around three in 10 patients in hospital, but the expectation is this will have increased by now. But the numbers who are acutely unwell with Covid are still going up and it could be the end of January before they peak. Hospital cases are though rising more slowly than cases, once again showing the Omicron variant is leading to milder illness. The latest daily Covid case number stands at a record 117,093. Partial data from the UK nations means a full national picture will only be available again in the first week of January. The warnings about the supply of rapid lateral flow Covid tests come after several changes to self-isolation rules. Those who test positive for Covid can now leave home after seven days - as long as they test negative via lateral flow devices on day six and seven - in England. And fully-vaccinated close contacts of positive cases, including those in the same household, can go about their daily lives as normal with a daily negative lateral flow test in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Leyla Hannbeck, chief executive of the Association Of Independent Multiple Pharmacies, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there had been a very high demand for lateral flow tests since the changes. ""Every five minutes, approximately, somebody comes into the pharmacy and asks for tests,"" she said. ""But unfortunately because of the issues around supply being patchy and inconsistent it means that those who come forward for the test don't always get it, which is very stressful not just for the pharmacy but also for the patients."" Thorrun Govind, chair of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society in England, said having an online collection code for lateral flow tests does not guarantee they will be in stock at a chemists. She also urged the public not to become angry with pharmacy staff and pleaded for patience amid the increased demand. This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson call for people to ""enjoy New Year in a cautious way... but above all get a booster"" The UKHSA said that the delivery capacity for lateral flow testing kits has doubled to 900,000 a day since 18 December, due to unprecedented demand. Lateral flow tests are alsoavailable to order online,externalfor delivery through Royal Mail - but many people have reported problems placing orders, with the website often saying ""sorry, there are no home delivery slots left for rapid lateral flow tests right now"". The UKHSA said ""exceptionally high demand"" for Covid PCR appointments - tests used to confirm a positive lateral flow result - could lead to temporary reduced availability in some areas but currently there are tests available to book online. ""We have made 100,000 more PCR booking slots available per day since mid-December and we are continuing to rapidly expand capacity, with over half a million tests carried out on 23 December alone."" The agency also said Christmas post schedules could be impact deliveries - but work and pensions minister Chloe Smith said people should ""persevere"" in their efforts to secure Covid tests. Separately, record demand for Covid PCR testshas left some people waiting up to five daysfor results in Scotland. In other developments: Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people who have not been fully vaccinated were ""eight times more likely"" to get seriously ill with Covid Matthew Taylor, head of the NHS Confederation, said staff absence ""is a huge issue for the NHS right now"" Health Secretary Sajid Javidcriticised restrictions in Wales after group run organisers Parkruncancelled meets following the introduction of fresh Covid curbs there People in Scotland have been urged not to travel to England for new year celebrationsas doing so would go against the ""spirit"" of restrictions, the Scottish government says. Free-to-order rapid tests are seen as a crucial way to keep safe as Covid cases surge. Countries like the US have scrambled to follow the UK's lead in providing mass lateral flow tests free of charge. They are useful in showing whether a person is infectious - providing trustworthy results in just 30 minutes. They are used: To allow people with Covid to leave isolation after seven days - by testing negative on day six and seven - in England By those in close contact with Covid cases to avoid isolation through daily rapid testing in England, Wales and Northern Ireland To reassure people without symptoms they are not infectious before seeing vulnerable relatives or attending new year gatherings In secondary schools, which require regular rapid testing, as well as some workplaces There have been calls by some scientists and business leaders for the government to follow theexample of US health officialsand reduce the isolation period in England for people with asymptomatic Covid, to five days. But a government spokesperson said the current isolation period - which was recently lowered from 10 to seven days - remained ""critical for limiting the spread of the virus"". They said: ""There are no further changes to the isolation period planned at this time, but we keep all rules under review based on the latest health data"". Unlike Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the government has decided against introducing new Covid measures in England ahead of the new year.

"Teenagers whose parents smoke are four times more likely to take it up themselves, experts have warned. As part of a new government campaign, parents and caregivers are urged to make giving up smoking for good a new year's resolution. TheBetter Health Smoke Free campaign,externalhighlights research that shows the impact adult smokers have on the young people in their lives. It says that 4.9% of teenagers whose parents smoke have taken it up too. By contrast, only 1.2% of teenagers whose parents do not smoke begin to do so. A new film issued by the NHS health sees experts discuss the link. GP Dr Nighat Arif and child psychologist Dr Bettina Hohnen called on parents to make a change to bring a benefit they say will last for decades. Health minister Maggie Throup said she hoped the research would give parents extra motivation to quit. ""We know many people make a quit attempt in January, and while there are so many good reasons to stop smoking for yourself, we hope that this new campaign - by highlighting the inter-generational smoking link with parents influencing their children - will be the added motivation many need to ditch the cigarettes for good this year,"" she said. There is help and support available for parents, carers and anyone looking to quit smoking, she added. This includes the NHS Quit Smoking app, support on Facebook, daily emails and texts, and an online Personal Quit Plan.

"Elon Musk is facing a social media backlash after China complained that its space station was forced to avoid collisions with satellites launched by his Starlink Internet Services project. The country's space station had two ""close encounters"" with Starlink satellites this year, Beijing claimed. The incidents behind the complaints, lodged with the UN's space agency, have not yet been independently verified. Starlink is a satellite internet network operated by Mr Musk's SpaceX. Mr Musk is well known in China even as his electric carmaker Tesla comes under growing scrutiny from regulators. The incidents occurred on 1 July and 21 October, according toa document submitted by China this month,externalto the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs. ""For safety reasons, the China Space Station implemented preventive collision avoidance control,"" Beijing said in the document published on the agency's website. SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. After the complaint was made public, Mr Musk, Starlink and the US were heavily criticised on China's Twitter-like Weibo microblogging platform. One user described Starlink's satellites as ""just a pile of space junk"". The satellites are ""American space warfare weapons"" and ""Musk is a new 'weapon' created by the US government and military"", others said. Another posted: ""The risks of Starlink are being gradually exposed, the whole human race will pay for their business activities."" China also accused the US of putting astronauts in danger by ignoring obligations under outer space treaties. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China was urging the US to act responsibly. Scientists have voiced concerns about the risks of collisions in space and called on world governments to share information about the estimated 30,000 satellites and other space debris that are orbiting Earth. SpaceX has already launched almost 1,900 satellites as part of the Starlink network, and plans to deploy thousands more. Last month, the US space agency Nasa abruptly postponed a spacewalk from the International Space Station over concerns about space debris.

"The government will keep its decision not to impose further Covid curbs in England under very close review, a cabinet minister has said. Environment Secretary George Eustice said the evidence did not support more interventions at the moment. The hospitality sector described the decision not to add further measures as a ""lifeline"" for pubs, bars and clubs. But there is concern about the impact on hospitals and schools of staff having to self-isolate. Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, told BBC Breakfast that in time people with Covid should be allowed to ""go about their normal lives"" as they would with a common cold. ""If the self-isolation rules are what's making the pain associated with Covid, then we need to do that perhaps sooner rather than later,"" he said. He suggested this might be able to happen ""once we're past Easter"", depending on the effects of the disease at that time. Some scientists advising ministers are concerned the government may be taking an overly optimistic approach when it comes to restrictions. England has not gone as far as the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - which have all introduced further restrictions this week. On Monday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said people should remain cautious and celebrate outside on New Year's Eve if possible. He said the government would reassess whether more measures were needed in the new year. Mr Eustice said ""if we do see a big increase in hospital admissions"" then ministers would have to act. The new places where you'll be asked to wear a mask What are the new Covid rules for the UK? How can I get my booster jab? Pubs, bars and restaurants have been hard hit in the run-up to Christmas, due to mass cancellations over Omicron variant fears. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said the decision to not go beyond Plan B measures in England would give ""a real lifeline"" to many. But there are also calls for more support - Adnams brewery boss Andy Wood, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more than half of Christmas business had been lost. Some scientists think the decision not to introduce new curbs before the new year is ""probably fine"", with data showing ""very low"" numbers of vaccinated people in intensive care. Prof Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University told the Today programme: ""The horrific scenes that we saw a year ago - intensive care units being full, lots of people dying prematurely - that is now history in my view and I think we should reassured that that's likely to continue."" He said while there had been an increase in the number of people admitted to hospital with Covid in London - 364 were admitted on Christmas Day - it had remained below 400 per day, a marker Sir John said had been watched for. Staff quarantining was putting additional stress on the health service, he said, and lateral flow tests were ""quite a good way"" of showing who was infectious - rather than cutting isolation periodsas has been done in the US. Restrictions do not stop Covid, they just buy time by delaying its spread. Last winter that time was used to rollout the vaccine programme, which meant when cases started to rise as restrictions were lifted the population was better protected. Given the extent of the booster rollout - nine in 10 of the most vulnerable have had one - we are about as well protected as we can be. So the argument for restrictions is more about spreading out the pressure on the NHS and wider economy given high rates of infection leads to lots of people isolating. But that then needs balancing against the costs and harms of restrictions. There are finely balanced trade-offs that need to be made. Ministers in England have clearly decided on a different course to their peers elsewhere in the UK in the belief the levels of serious illness caused in this wave will be manageable. But even then there is no guarantee the approaches in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will have much of an impact anyway. Many scientists believe it will take pretty severe restrictions, perhaps a complete ban on indoor mixing, to dent Omicron's spread. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said some trust executives felt staff absences due to self-isolation were going to be a ""bigger problem and challenge"" than the number of people being treated for Covid. He told BBC Breakfast that while there may come a point where Covid was treated like a common cold, that should not be the case for people who work in the NHS, as they worked with potentially ""very, very vulnerable"" people. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the big issue would be whether there would be enough staff to sustain in-person education when term began in January due to self-isolation.

Prof Andrew Hayward - epidemiologist and a member of the advisory group Sage - said ministers seemed to be acting ""on the optimistic end of the spectrum"". And Prof Danny Altmann suggested that there was now a great divergence between scientific advice and legislation. Public health professor Andrew Watterson, of the University of Stirling, accused England of being ""really out of step"" by not introducing further restrictions, saying there was a ""real mismatch"" between some of the data and policy. This variant is very contagious and spreads faster than others Vaccines and boosters are still essential and do a great job at protecting against severe disease It is milder - if you catch it, the risk of needing hospital treatment is up to 70% lower than with previous variants - but that is largely because many of us have built up immunity from vaccines and past infections rather than changes to the virus Read more here. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting urged the government to publish all relevant advice and data, so the public could be reassured that Mr Johnson was not ""capitulating"" to members of his own party. After a two-day halt in publishing data, it was revealed that more than 300,000 new Covid cases had been recorded on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.

I'd like us to put our best foot forward, come out and compete. It's going to be hard work, we know that. Australia have showed their class in all three games."" #bbccricket Robin Bernstein:Losing like this is shameful. Previous Australian teams, which were much better, had to work harder than this team have had to. Meek and weak in every department from the management all way through to the players. BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra England coach Chris Silverwood, speaking to TMS after the defeat:""We have to find a way of moving forward and getting runs against high-quality attacks. ""Without no games to back them up, the best we can do is get players in the nets. It is a difficult thing to do. That's the way it is in this day and age. ""I have to give credit to the bowlers. To do what they did and perform at the level they did yesterday was excellent."" Many of you are placing blame on the ECB's new 100-ball competition which took place in the summer.

I'll say 'watch' instead of 'enjoy'... #bbccricket Ian Clark:I feel sorry for Joe Root and the bowlers in the England team. We just canât bat against a decent bowling line up abroad. We canât just say we win at home everythingâs fine. The way things are at the moment, Test cricket for England is dead. Martin:For those saying itâs the end of Root as captain, who the hell would you make captain out of the rest of them? Not a single decent choice amongst them all. More from Joe Root, speaking to TMS earlier:""My main focus and the groups focus is on the next ball, which is the first ball of the next Test. ""You can't start looking at things too far in the future. More than anything, we've got to make sure we end up coming away from this tour with something.

England captain Joe Root, speaking to TMS after the defeat:""I look at this squad of players as being the best 18 red-ball players that are in our county system. ""If we want to talk about the set up and the structure below then that is
a longer conversation for another time. ""The fact is we have 18 players here playing for England and theyâve got
a responsibility. Weâve all got a responsibility to be better than what we have
been so far and weâve got two games to show just that and put some pride back in
to the badge and give something for the fans back home to cheer about and show
how much we care about playing for our country."" Just scrolling through some of your comments social media. it's not even daylight but you lot are not holding back on. I expected no less, to be honest. Let's hear what Joe Root had to say on Test Match Special earlier... #bbccricket Ditchy:Now England know why they call it Ashes...they are burnt out. And here's the winning moment. England were finally put out of their misery as Cameron Green dismissed James Anderson... The final five wickets fell in the space of 30 balls.

Environment Secretary George Eustice said the evidence did not support more interventions at the moment. The hospitality sector described the decision not to add further measures as a ""lifeline"" for pubs, bars and clubs. But there is concern about the impact on hospitals and schools of staff having to self-isolate. Prof Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, told BBC Breakfast that in time people with Covid should be allowed to ""go about their normal lives"" as they would with a common cold. ""If the self-isolation rules are what's making the pain associated with Covid, then we need to do that perhaps sooner rather than later,"" he said. He suggested this might be able to happen ""once we're past Easter"", depending on the effects of the disease at that time. Some scientists advising ministers are concerned the government may be taking an overly optimistic approach when it comes to restrictions. England has not gone as far as the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - which have all introduced further restrictions this week. On Monday, Health Secretary Sajid Javid said people should remain cautious and celebrate outside on New Year's Eve if possible. He said the government would reassess whether more measures were needed in the new year. Mr Eustice said ""if we do see a big increase in hospital admissions"" then ministers would have to act. The new places where you'll be asked to wear a mask What are the new Covid rules for the UK? How can I get my booster jab? Pubs, bars and restaurants have been hard hit in the run-up to Christmas, due to mass cancellations over Omicron variant fears. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said the decision to not go beyond Plan B measures in England would give ""a real lifeline"" to many. But there are also calls for more support - Adnams brewery boss Andy Wood, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more than half of Christmas business had been lost. Some scientists think the decision not to introduce new curbs before the new year is ""probably fine"", with data showing ""very low"" numbers of vaccinated people in intensive care. Prof Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University told the Today programme: ""The horrific scenes that we saw a year ago - intensive care units being full, lots of people dying prematurely - that is now history in my view and I think we should reassured that that's likely to continue."" He said while there had been an increase in the number of people admitted to hospital with Covid in London - 364 were admitted on Christmas Day - it had remained below 400 per day, a marker Sir John said had been watched for. Staff quarantining was putting additional stress on the health service, he said, and lateral flow tests were ""quite a good way"" of showing who was infectious - rather than cutting isolation periodsas has been done in the US. Restrictions do not stop Covid, they just buy time by delaying its spread. Last winter that time was used to rollout the vaccine programme, which meant when cases started to rise as restrictions were lifted the population was better protected. Given the extent of the booster rollout - nine in 10 of the most vulnerable have had one - we are about as well protected as we can be. So the argument for restrictions is more about spreading out the pressure on the NHS and wider economy given high rates of infection leads to lots of people isolating. But that then needs balancing against the costs and harms of restrictions. There are finely balanced trade-offs that need to be made. Ministers in England have clearly decided on a different course to their peers elsewhere in the UK in the belief the levels of serious illness caused in this wave will be manageable. But even then there is no guarantee the approaches in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will have much of an impact anyway. Many scientists believe it will take pretty severe restrictions, perhaps a complete ban on indoor mixing, to dent Omicron's spread. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said some trust executives felt staff absences due to self-isolation were going to be a ""bigger problem and challenge"" than the number of people being treated for Covid. He told BBC Breakfast that while there may come a point where Covid was treated like a common cold, that should not be the case for people who work in the NHS, as they worked with potentially ""very, very vulnerable"" people. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said the big issue would be whether there would be enough staff to sustain in-person education when term began in January due to self-isolation. This video can not be played Watch: Sajid Javid explains why England is choosing a different path from the other nations Conservative MPs - who recently inflicted the largest rebellion of Boris Johnson's premiership over the introduction of Covid passes - were among those who welcomed Monday's announcement of no new restrictions. However, some experts who advise the government were less enthusiastic. Prof Andrew Hayward - epidemiologist and a member of the advisory group Sage - said ministers seemed to be acting ""on the optimistic end of the spectrum"". And Prof Danny Altmann suggested that there was now a great divergence between scientific advice and legislation. Public health professor Andrew Watterson, of the University of Stirling, accused England of being ""really out of step"" by not introducing further restrictions, saying there was a ""real mismatch"" between some of the data and policy. This variant is very contagious and spreads faster than others Vaccines and boosters are still essential and do a great job at protecting against severe disease It is milder - if you catch it, the risk of needing hospital treatment is up to 70% lower than with previous variants - but that is largely because many of us have built up immunity from vaccines and past infections rather than changes to the virus Read more here. Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting urged the government to publish all relevant advice and data, so the public could be reassured that Mr Johnson was not ""capitulating"" to members of his own party. After a two-day halt in publishing data, it was revealed that more than 300,000 new Covid cases had been recorded on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. UK-wide hospital data has not been updated since before Christmas but NHS England revealed there were 1,281 Covid-19 hospital admissions in the country on Christmas Day - the highest number for any day since 16 February.

Australia have showed their class in all three games."" #bbccricket Robin Bernstein:Losing like this is shameful. Previous Australian teams, which were much better, had to work harder than this team have had to. Meek and weak in every department from the management all way through to the players.

""Without no games to back them up, the best we can do is get players in the nets. It is a difficult thing to do. That's the way it is in this day and age. ""I have to give credit to the bowlers.

Here are the highlights from day three of the third Ashes Test for you to... I'll say 'watch' instead of 'enjoy'... #bbccricket Ian Clark:I feel sorry for Joe Root and the bowlers in the England team. We just canât bat against a decent bowling line up abroad. We canât just say we win at home everythingâs fine. The way things are at the moment, Test cricket for England is dead. Martin:For those saying itâs the end of Root as captain, who the hell would you make captain out of the rest of them? Not a single decent choice amongst them all. More from Joe Root, speaking to TMS earlier:""My main focus and the groups focus is on the next ball, which is the first ball of the next Test. ""You can't start looking at things too far in the future. More than anything, we've got to make sure we end up coming away from this tour with something. ""We do not want to be stood there 5-0 at the end of the series. We've got two Test matches, a lot of World Test Championship points to play for, and we have to put some pride back into the badge and give the fans that are so loyal to us back home something to shout about and enjoy."" #bbccricket Danny Bushell:Surely that's it for Silverwood and Root? Utter shambles. GP:Englandâs worst performance in decades. Canât get worse. No fight. England captain Joe Root, speaking to TMS after the defeat:""I look at this squad of players as being the best 18 red-ball players that are in our county system. ""If we want to talk about the set up and the structure below then that is
a longer conversation for another time. ""The fact is we have 18 players here playing for England and theyâve got
a responsibility. Weâve all got a responsibility to be better than what we have
been so far and weâve got two games to show just that and put some pride back in
to the badge and give something for the fans back home to cheer about and show
how much we care about playing for our country."" Just scrolling through some of your comments social media. it's not even daylight but you lot are not holding back on. I expected no less, to be honest. Let's hear what Joe Root had to say on Test Match Special earlier... #bbccricket Ditchy:Now England know why they call it Ashes...they are burnt out. And here's the winning moment. England were finally put out of their misery as Cameron Green dismissed James Anderson... The final five wickets fell in the space of 30 balls. England's 68 all out is their lowest total in Australia since March 1904 and their ninth lowest score against them in Tests. Sigh. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Teenagers whose parents smoke are four times more likely to take it up themselves, experts have warned. As part of a new government campaign, parents and caregivers are urged to make giving up smoking for good a new year's resolution. TheBetter Health Smoke Free campaign,externalhighlights research that shows the impact adult smokers have on the young people in their lives. It says that 4.9% of teenagers whose parents smoke have taken it up too. By contrast, only 1.2% of teenagers whose parents do not smoke begin to do so. A new film issued by the NHS health sees experts discuss the link. GP Dr Nighat Arif and child psychologist Dr Bettina Hohnen called on parents to make a change to bring a benefit they say will last for decades. Health minister Maggie Throup said she hoped the research would give parents extra motivation to quit. ""We know many people make a quit attempt in January, and while there are so many good reasons to stop smoking for yourself, we hope that this new campaign - by highlighting the inter-generational smoking link with parents influencing their children - will be the added motivation many need to ditch the cigarettes for good this year,"" she said. There is help and support available for parents, carers and anyone looking to quit smoking, she added. This includes the NHS Quit Smoking app, support on Facebook, daily emails and texts, and an online Personal Quit Plan.

"Bar owners are having difficulty enforcing the new rules, with one saying footfall has dropped by at least 50% New rules for hospitality in Wales have left some customers confused while others stayed away, said bar owners. Since 26 December, two-metre social distancing returned in Wales, along with mask wearing, table service and contact tracing. Groups have also been limited to a maximum of six people, to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. One bar owner said it's been a ""nightmare"" trying to enforce the new rules as many people just aren't aware. New Covid restrictions come into force in Wales Tighter restrictions see pub group limits in Wales PM gets Covid briefing as UK nations tighten rules ""A lot people have just given up watching TV at this rate, and they just don't realise [the new rules] have come in,"" said Joann Cooney, owner of The Irish bar in Llandudno, Conwy. ""It's just been a bit of a nightmare that way, and just controlling people it was just really hard, and it definitely wasn't a busy as it usually would be."" Joann Cooney says many customers don't realise masks are now mandatory in pubs, so she had to turn them away ""Boxing Day is always a great day, everyone walking around having a bit of banter at the bar, and we couldn't have that, it was just really difficult. ""We were definitely at least over 50% down, because it's usually normally busy with live music and everything, it's normally a great atmosphere."" Ms Cooney thinks in addition to the new restrictions, people are staying home because they are ""frightened"" of the new variant. Mr Beynon says he conforms to every rule - yet there are always new ones to adhere to ""What you've got to realise is that to put table service on, that's extra work, but you're not getting extra money for it,"" said Dai Beynon, owner of Pontarddulais Workingmens Club. He thinks clubs like his need to have more staff on shift to collect track and trace information, as well as providing table service. Mr Beynon added: ""In hospitality everyone's doing their best to keep order, two metres apart, etc, and yet we're persecuted time after time."" When he announced the new restrictions last week, First Minister Mark Drakeford warned of ""a wave of infections caused by the new, fast-moving and very-infectious Omicron"". On Christmas Eve, the last day data was published,6,755 new Covid cases were reportedby Public Health Wales, the highest figure since the start of the pandemic. Phil Ash represents west Conwy Pubwatch, which has around 120 pubs as members Phil Ash, a bar owner who also represents west Conwy Pubwatch, has said the amount of restrictions in place in Wales is ""unfair"". ""I do get it, to a point, its just we've had the hardest restrictions out of the four nations, once again,"" he said. ""Us in wales have had to have more restrictions put on us than the other three nations, which is a bit unfair."" Mr Ash also thinks its getting increasingly hard to implement the restrictions with customers. ""Yesterday people were turning up and they didn't know that there were new rules in place, which made it ten times harder for us to police. He said more people now claim they are exempt from wearing face coverings, and enforcing rules is tricky ""especially when people have had alcohol, then they're not as willing to abide by them"". The Welsh government said a total of Â£120m will be made available for nightclubs, retail, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses. However, Mr Ash said the money may be too late, as businesses need the support now. ""It will help when we get it, [but] we won't get the money until the end of January, which doesn't help with the loss of trade in December,"" he said. ""Also, we don't know what it's going to be like between now and when we get that money at the end of January.""

To do what they did and perform at the level they did yesterday was excellent."" Many of you are placing blame on the ECB's new 100-ball competition which took place in the summer.

""You can't start looking at things too far in the future. More than anything, we've got to make sure we end up coming away from this tour with something.

Utter shambles. GP:Englandâs worst performance in decades. Canât get worse. No fight. England captain Joe Root, speaking to TMS after the defeat:""I look at this squad of players as being the best 18 red-ball players that are in our county system. ""If we want to talk about the set up and the structure below then that is
a longer conversation for another time. ""The fact is we have 18 players here playing for England and theyâve got
a responsibility. Weâve all got a responsibility to be better than what we have
been so far and weâve got two games to show just that and put some pride back in
to the badge and give something for the fans back home to cheer about and show
how much we care about playing for our country."" Just scrolling through some of your comments social media. it's not even daylight but you lot are not holding back on. I expected no less, to be honest. Let's hear what Joe Root had to say on Test Match Special earlier... #bbccricket Ditchy:Now England know why they call it Ashes...they are burnt out. And here's the winning moment. England were finally put out of their misery as Cameron Green dismissed James Anderson... The final five wickets fell in the space of 30 balls.
