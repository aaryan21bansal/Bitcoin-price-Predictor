"Roger Federer claimed his 18th Grand Slam with his victory over Rafael Nadal Of course it was going to go to five sets. Of course it was going to make you feel sick for four hours. Of course it was going to go places that no other final and no other players could possibly go. Before this Australian Open final between Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal even began, it felt like the Beatles reforming in 1979 for a one-off gig. When Federer's forehand finished it, deep into the Melbourne night, it was as if they had released a new Revolver too. Federer, supposed to be not only past his prime but past the period when he was past his prime, took on logic, his nemesis and the unarguable passing of time. In coming past all three he may have pulled off not only the best of his 18 Grand Slam singles titles but possibly the greatest Slam victory of all. Federer beats Nadal to win 18th Grand Slam Serena beats Venus to set Grand Slam record Is Serena the greatest? Out injured for the past six months. Adrift in the rankings; superseded by the younger, fitter, faster. Thirty-five years old, a father of four - in recent seasons worshipped as a relic rather than real-time contender. And then a break down in the deciding set, off court for a lengthy medical time-out, receiving further treatment between games as Nadal's forehand pulled the legs off him like a cruel kid playing with a crane fly, only to reach back into the years for one final dazzling burst. Most meetings between the world number 17 and the world number nine are not like this. But then no-one has ever been like Federer and Nadal, the two finest players in history, the rivalry between them approached only by McEnroe and Borg. It is 31 months since Nadal last got past a quarter-final at a major, seven years since Federer last won the title here, and this was the past come back gloriously to the present: a beautiful final for troubled times, sport playing to perfection its role as the sweetest of distractions. Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer (pictured at Wimbledon in 2006) have met in nine Grand Slam finals A fortnight ago, the odds on a Federer-Nadal andVenus-Serena pair of finalswas 5000-1. It should have been impossible, and that has made it all the more impossible to resist. When Nadal opened his tennis academy in Majorca four months ago,Federer turned upto wish him well. Both were injured, reduced to hitting sponge balls against kids, old warriors turned battle-damaged friends. They wore suits, and looked ready for slippers. All those Slam campaigns, all those slugfests on hard courts and knee-jarring slides on clay and chasing on slick grass, seemed to have taken their toll. Federer's back had gone, and then his knee. Nadal's knees for once seemed OK, but his wrist had failed instead. At Wimbledon, where the 2008 final between the two took its sport to new heights, Nadal's last four appearances have ended in defeat to the world number 100, 135, 144 and 102. This video can not be played Australian Open: Roger Federer beats Rafael Nadal to win 18th Grand Slam title For the two to be reunited like this, on such a stage, felt like one last glorious treat from a pair who had already given so much. With the happiness came melancholia too, for nothing marks your own ageing process like the fading of the sporting stars who have defined your fondest years. They looked different, marching out into the Rod Laver Arena on Sunday, following the same path as most men in maturity: thinner hair, longer sleeves. The crowd in Melbourne, and the millions postponing critical Sunday chores around the world, reacted differently too. You were always either Roger or Rafa. There was no in between, not when their styles and characters were so distinct. For this 35th meeting, there was instead confusion. There are some sporting contests when you want both sides to lose. England football supporters may recall West Germany v Argentina in the World Cup final of 1990. This was one when you wanted both to win. Roger Federer has won 12 of his 35 matches against Rafael Nadal since 2004 A home-made banner in the stands read, 'Let's Go Fedal!' For the first four sets the players themselves appeared to be similarly compromised. Federer dominated the first, going at 63% on his first serve, winning 93% of points on it. He hit 13 winners, shortening points as much as he could, coming in to the net and winning five of seven points there. Nadal found himself outpaced and sometimes wrong-footed. The second saw Rafa reborn in a storm of thrashed forehands and screamed vamooses, Federer not only crumpled by that left-handed howitzer but pummelled by a percussive body serve. The third - Federer three break points down in his opening service game only to save them all with aces out wide, and then breaking with aggression and sweaty toil. The fourth - Nadal's energy and endurance opening a lead, the set garlanded by the exchange of the night for 4-1, the Spaniard flicking an outrageous squash-style forehand cross-court for a winner when Federer's own backhand crashed cross-court seemed to have won the point. Federer applauded that one, and grinned across the net. But this was a contest about the dramatic tension as much as its early quality, and it was a match that will be remembered for its final titanic set rather than the preceding four. Federer, broken in his first service game with a weary forehand wide. Nadal, saving three break-back points in his first, saving two more in his next. Federer, setting up break points yet unable to take them, finally levelling it up at 3-3. And then the eighth game, Federer 4-3 up. Three break points, Nadal double-faulting, the plot's course surely set. Nadal responding with two winners; Federer, at 30-40 and on a feeble second serve, chunking a backhand into the tramlines. Another break point, a Nadal ace. A 26-shot rally on the next. Roger Federer leads the list of all-time men's major winners with 18 Grand Slam titles It was almost too much - less a final hurrah than a crescendo that no-one could have seen coming and few could handle. Even when Federer finally broke, even when he was serving for the championship, Nadal clawed his way to two break points. On the first championship point there was a successful challenge. On the second, the challenge fell short. The game, at last, was up. ""Tennis is a tough sport,"" said an exhausted Federer afterwards, tears in his eyes and aches in his bones. ""There are no draws. If there were, I would have been happy to accept one tonight and share it with Rafa."" As a champion who was supposed to be spent, it brought to mind Jack Nicklaus winning his 18th major at Augusta in 1986. As a smooth warrior expected to be felled by the muscular jabs and hooks of the younger man, it was reminiscent of Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa. And it brought back the words of BBC commentator Harry Carpenter as George Foreman finally fell under Ali's assault, amended to fit a player who has spent a career making precedent redundant.

"I recall David Irving as an intimidating presence In late March 2000, only a few days before the verdict in the high profile libel case he had brought against Deborah Lipstadt, I went to interview David Irving. It may be hard to imagine now, but before the trial verdict he still retained some of his reputation as a historian. It was not impossible - though pretty unlikely - that he would win the case. Mr Irving had claimed Prof Lipstadt's book, Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory, had destroyed his livelihood and generated ""waves of hatred"" against him. In her defence, Prof Lipstadt had to show that what she had written was true and that Mr Irving deliberately distorted history. This video can not be played Timothy Spall on playing Holocaust denier David Irving In the film Denial, released this weekend, Timothy Spall captures Irving's bluster, but for me the film as a whole does not quite convey the threat of Mr Irving at the time. The story is told from Prof Lipstadt's point of view. At times Mr Irving seems a somewhat ridiculous figure, easily flattered into accepting a judge-only trial, rather than a jury, which would probably have worked better for him. I recall him as a more intimidating presence, especially when I encountered him for the first time, marching down the dark corridor of his Mayfair flat. His Danish partner Bente Hogh had opened the front door and, as she was making a cup of tea, we chatted in her - and my mother's - language. Mr Irving overheard and came to see what was happening. I explained I was half-Danish and he paused to look me up and down, taking in my dark hair and eyes. ""Well!"" he said, ""you'd never know it to look at you!"" And then, perfectly polite, he invited me to his study where we could talk. In the film, the lawyers and Prof Lipstadt see the glass-fronted cases full of shoes at Auschwitz In Denial, the lawyers and Prof Lipstadt travel to Auschwitz for research. They see the glass-fronted cases full of suitcases and shoes in Auschwitz I, property of murdered Jews from across Western Europe. Outside in the the freezing Polish winter, they walk round the huge second site at Birkenau, down the steps into the remains of a demolished gas chamber. Later, Richard Rampton QC is shown angry that there has not been a full detailed scientific study of the whole site, to remove all possibility of doubt. ""Where's the proof?"" he shouts. David Irving put Auschwitz at the centre of his case but had never visited the site I knew Auschwitz unusually well as I'd joined theToday programmeafter three years as the BBC Warsaw correspondent. At that time, the late 1990s, Auschwitz was often in the news because there was international concern about the site and its upkeep. The post-Communist government wanted to build better relations with Jewish communities worldwide, so the president took personal responsibility for Auschwitz improvement. One way and another, often with survivors, I had visited the site many times. Although Mr Irving put Auschwitz at the centre of his case, he had never been there himself. In the quiet of his study, as soon as I brought out the microphone, Mr Irving spoke energetically and confidently. ""If I carry the day on Auschwitz,"" he told me, ""if I'm right on crematorium number two at Auschwitz then as far as I'm concerned I'm right on my position on the Holocaust: that it has been grossly inflated and there's been a hell of a lot of lying by the eyewitnesses and I don't need to prove them right on the other camps as well."" Chimneys are all that remain of detention blocks destroyed by the SS at the end of World War Two at the Auschwitz II Birkenau extermination camp In the film, Prof Lipstadt is angry that eyewitnesses, Auschwitz survivors, are not called to give evidence. Written testimony was employed by the defence instead. Mr Irving had been confident he had demolished these accounts. He told me: ""They produced only five eyewitnesses and it's always the same five eyewitnesses,"" I pointed out that there were scores of living eyewitnesses and that I had met them myself. ""Not so,"" he retorted, with a half cough, half laugh, effectively calling me a liar. I said that just by researching the subject he would have come across many survivors. He denied it. I explained that I had lived in Poland for years, told him that I knew Auschwitz well, had visited often. ""And what did they show you?"" he asked, leaning forward, suddenly more interested. ""What they show everyone,"" I replied. ""Did they show you the gas chamber?"" he asked. I replied: ""You know very well the Germans blew them up as they left."" And then, once again, he simply cast doubt. ""Well somebody blew them up. I don't think it was necessarily the Germans, it was either the Russians or the Germans, we don't know which. I mean this is the kind of extraordinary grey area which just hasn't been properly researched."" Prof Lipstadt, Penguin and their lawyers won the case in April 2000 Mr Irving's posture through the 32 days of court was that of the sceptical historian - always looking for the documentary proof. It was only by establishing that his political views had directly affected his work, that Prof Lipstadt, Penguin and their lawyers could win the case. And as Denial shows, that was neither simple, nor straightforward: it required tremendous effort, months of work from many researchers and a brilliant legal mind in Mr Rampton to marshal the argument. In April 2000, Mr Justice Gray delivered his damning verdict. He found the charges against Mr Irving ""substantially true"". He said: ""Irving was motivated by a desire to present events in a manner consistent with his own ideological beliefs, even if that involved distortion and manipulation of historical evidence."" In the film, that is where it ends - but today Holocaust denial is alive and well on the internet. Last December it emerged that asking Google ""Did the Holocaust happen?"" threw up as the first answer a right-wing, Holocaust-denying site. There was an outcry, Google has now acted and now the search returns are very different. Timothy Spall on playing Holocaust denier.

"This video can not be played Protesters gather at Dulles airport: ""Welcome to the USA!"" Said Hajouli, a second-year medical resident, had waited over a year to see his bride. They met in Turkey, after ""Leen"" - Said did not want to use her real name - fled her university in Syria when the war broke out. They were engaged for a year, married in 2015, then spent only one week together as husband and wife before Said had to return to Virginia on his J-1 visa, a non-immigrant visa commonly given to scholars and doctors. In the meantime, the couple applied and were approved for a J-2 visa for Leen, which is a permit reserved for spouses and dependents of J-1 holders. Finally, on Saturday 28 January, Leen boarded a flight in Istanbul bound for Dulles International Airport in Virginia, about 45 minutes outside of Washington DC. It was supposed to be a happy day. ""It was supposed to be, but I don't know what's going to happen,"" 29-year-old Said said, not long after arriving at Dulles. Almost exactly 24 hours earlier,President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled, ""Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States"". It shut down the US refugee programme for 120 days, indefinitely suspended the resettlement of Syrian refugees, and halted all immigration to the US from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days. The order led to chaos at airports all over the world. Travellers were prevented from boarding planes abroad and, in some cases, were pulled off flights. They were detained at US airports. And there seemed to have been little instructions given to US Customs and Border Patrol on how to handle refugee and immigrant arrivals under the new rules. Lawyers gathered to represent those facing travel bans Earlier that morning, Said's friend's wife also attempted to enter the country with a J-2 visa, but he says she was immediately stopped and sent back. So, instead of flowers, Said brought Rob Robertson to the airport, a tall, burly immigration lawyer. Said had found him just hours earlier after putting out a desperate plea for help on social media. ""They've done everything they need to do. It's already clear she's not a threat,"" said Mr Robertson. ""It worries me that they're just going to turn around and send them back, pursuant to an executive order that is not law, that does not override the Immigration and Nationality Act,"" he said, referring to the 1965 law that bans discrimination against immigrants based on ""nationality, place of birth, or place of residence"". This video can not be played Protesters against the ban also gathered at New York's JFK Airport Mr Robertson was one of roughly 30 volunteer lawyers who showed up to Dulles on Saturday afternoon. They deployed en masse following news that two Iraqi men with valid visas were detained at John F Kennedy Airport, in New York, and faced deportation. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued on their behalf and they were later released. Rumours spread that more were trapped in legal limbo at other airports around the country - including Dulles. ""This is not the country I was born in. This is not the country that I loved,"" said lawyer Lena Albibi, who was moved to tears. ""It's very painful seeing this happenâ¦ They're breaking families apart."" Reaching prospective clients was a tricky errand for the lawyers, since anyone who needed legal help - travellers being detained in the ""secondary inspection"" area of US Customs and Border Patrol at Dulles - had no way to communicate with lawyers waiting outside. Lawyer Lena Albibi said this did not feel like the US she knew ""We cannot get the information that we need so we can figure out how we can assist them,"" said immigration lawyer Sari Long. ""We're trying to do our best to canvas family members."" Dispersed in the waiting area near baggage claim number 15 were people like Elmira Tayary, who had no idea she would need a lawyer to collect her 63-year-old mother, a green-card holder. Just hours earlier, Department of Homeland Security officials had revealed that the executive order would extend to permanent residents of the US coming from the seven banned countries. Tayary said her mother splits her time between the US and Iran, and has for years. ""I'm very, very sad, but I'm hopeful she may show up any minute,"" said Elmira. ""This is very disappointing."" Relatives and supporters waited to greet arrivals who had been detained As hours ticked by, and more and more protesters arrived carrying signs that read ""Refugees Are Welcome"" and ""Love Your Neighbour"", it became clear that something like 50 to 60 people, including green-card holders, were being held at customs. Lawyers were still not permitted to speak to them. However, there were small acts of rebellion. Employees of the airport itself managed to ferry information to family members who were waiting, including Elmira, to tell them that green card holders would soon be on their way. Immediately soothed, Elmira bought her mother a red-white-and-blue balloon. One by one, the permanent residents were released, walking down a corridor now teeming with demonstrators shouting ""Welcome home!"" and singing ""This Land is My Land"". Ali and his wife Hajer wore weary smiles as they pushed their luggage through the gauntlet of well-wishers, their 11- and 7-year-old boys in tow. Someone handed Hajer flowers. Ali worked for three years as an interpreter for the US Army and gained admittance to the US through a Special Immigrant Visa, reserved for Iraqi and Afghan nationals who face threats of violence for working for Americans during the conflicts there. He now has a green card, and returned to Iraq for his father's funeral, only to be delayed for hours for questioning at Dulles. ""We are not terrorists. We are not bad people,"" said Ali. ""It's so hard. I hope they will change their minds on this position."" US citizen Alaa was finally able to connect with his wife Jinan, a green card holder, only after she answered a series of questions about her family and her husband's business. ""That's way over the limit. She's got a green card,"" Alaa said. ""Are we going to blow up our system because we are afraid? Then, you know, whoever we are afraid from are winning."" Just then, a thin man carrying a sign that read ""This Veteran Stands With You"" stopped Alaa, told him he is an Iraq veteran, and with little explanation fastened a Purple Heart medal to Alaa's jacket. ""That's a great thing, that's a great thing!"" Alaa cried, elated. ""This is what America is all about!"" Ali, Hajer and their sons, legal residents in the US, finally make it through to the arrivals hall As the green-card holders began to depart, more good news arrived - first a judge in Brooklyn declared that deporting refugees and valid visa holders who'd already arrived in US airports would cause ""irreparable harm"", thereby blocking the deportations. Next, a judge in Virginia issued a temporary restraining order to stop the expulsion of green card holders. Each time the news arrived, the lawyers huddled together and then broke out into rowdy cheers. ""We are optimistic that pretty soon all those people back there will be allowed to come through,"" said lawyer Dan Press. By the time some detainees made it through, they were so exhausted that several fell weeping into the arms of loved ones - to the frenzied glee of the now-enormous protest group. It wasn't all good news. Rumours that deportations took place continued to swirl, though it is unclear how many. The Virginia court decision lasts only a week and Trump's executive order still holds for anyone who did not make it to US shores in time for this brief, legal reprieve. By 11 pm, Said still had no definitive answer about his wife, Leen. She called to say she was being sent back to Turkey, but then later was shuffled off to another room in customs. ""She may come walking out of there for all I know,"" said Said's lawyer. So Said leaned against a wall, eyes fixed on the path out of customs, and waited, as patiently as the previous year.

"This video can not be played Trump's 'yuge' first week as president recapped Donald Trump promised that he would deliver big things for the American people from the moment he came into office. To call his first week ""yuge"", as he might say, would be an understatement. Mr Trump's first seven days in office have seen a flurry of executive orders, a war declared by his team on the mainstream media, some of the largest protests ever held in the United States, and the coining of a term - ""alternative facts"" - that could come to define the White House under his tenure. The BBC website has publishedmore than 200 stories and videosabout or relating to President Trump since inauguration day. It's been a busy week. In retrospect, this was the calmest day of them all. With his hand resting on two Bibles - one his own, the other used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861 - Donald John Trump was sworn in as US President, the first man to hold the office without either political or military experience. Earlier in the day, Barack Obama was captured through a window leaving a letter for his successor in the top drawer of the Oval Office desk. What did it say? We don't know and President Trump won't say. Addressing the nation at the ceremony, President Trumpspokein fairly bleak terms of rusted-out factories, poverty-stricken families and crime-blighted cities, vowing to end ""this American carnage"" This video can not be played Trump's inauguration: Story of the day ""This was not a message to the American people as a whole - many of whom likely feel the past resident of the White House, Barack Obama, reflected their beliefs and their diversity,""our correspondent Anthony Zurcher wrote. ""This was a speech for the angry, the frustrated, the American voters who turned out in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Ohio to shake their fist at the status quo and take a chance on a man who was unlike any presidential politician who came before him."" As the Obamas left for a holiday in Palm Springs, a new era in politics began. Take a deep breath now... Whilemany protestswere held on inauguration day around the world, including one in Washington thatspiralled into violence, Saturday 21 January saw a remarkable global expression of opposition to the Trump administration and its perceived world view. Millions of people turned out to demonstrate at ""Women's Marches"" in cities around the world to make their voice heard on women's reproductive rights, gender, sexual and racial equality. This video can not be played Five countries where anti-Donald Trump protests took place But as protests continued, President Trump gave an extraordinary press conference at the CIA headquarters, telling staff that the media had fabricated a ""feud"" between him and the intelligence agencies, despitepreviously tweeting,externalthey were acting as if the US was Nazi Germany. Standing in front of the CIA's hallowed memorial wall, which honours agency employees who died in service, he also complained about reporting of the crowd size at his inauguration, and unflattering comparisons to the turn-out at Barack Obama's own ceremony in 2009. What followed saw ""post-truth"" politics kick into high gear. Trump dispatched hiscombative new press secretary Sean Spicerto lambast the media in a televised briefing. He said no-one had any crowd estimates from the inauguration before then giving his own crowd numbers - saying that the space holding 720,000 people was full when the oath was taken. This, he claimed, ""was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe"". Officials in Washington say up to half a million demonstrators joined the Women's March there He also falsely said the number of people taking Washington's subway system on the day had been higher than during Barack Obama's second inauguration in 2013. In a television interview on Sunday, Trump counsellor Kellyanne Conway defended Spicer's inaccurate claims, thereby introducing the world to the term ""alternative facts"", which is how she described what he said. ""Alternative facts are not facts. They are falsehoods,"" NBC presenter Chuck Todd replied. The internet, of course, delivered an outpouring of #Spicerfacts. Meanwhile, the president himself was praising Barack Obama at a ceremony to swear in senior members of his team. This video can not be played President Trump reveals that Barack Obama left him a ""beautiful"" letter at the Oval Office While there, he said he would soon begin negotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with his Canadian and Mexican counterparts. ""Mexico has been terrific. The president has been really very amazing,"" he said. More on Mexico was to come later in the week from the president. (Hint: They stopped being so amazing.) Trump also finally responded to Saturday's mass protests against him. The first working day of the Trump administration kicked off with meeting between the president and business leaders, during which Trump announced his aim to cut regulations for US-based businesses by 75%. A clutch of executive actions followed. He pulled the US out of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, a key part of Obama's efforts to engage and divert attention to the Asia-Pacific. Australia swiftly said it wanted to try to keep the deal alive with a so-called 'TPP 12 minus one'. This video can not be played Donald Trump had a busy first working day as president Trump alsobanned federal moneygoing to international groups which perform or provide information on abortions. The US president's order shows he ""wants to stand up for all Americans, including the unborn,"" his press secretary Sean Spicer said. This picture went viral. Spot the women ""As long as you live you'll never see a photograph of 7 women signing legislation about what men can do with their reproductive organs,"" Guardian social editor Martin Belam said on Twitter. More than 260,000 people re-tweeted his thoughts. If the day wasn't busy enough in Trump news, a group of US ethics lawyers hadfiled a lawsuit against the president, alleging he is violating a constitutional ban on accepting payments from foreign governments through his hotels. Mr Trump described the lawsuit as ""totally without merit"". Oh, and he implementeda hiring freezeon some federal government workers. The barrage of executive actions continued on Tuesday, with two orders signed to back controversial oil pipelines - Keystone XL and the Dakota Access project - if American steel is used. The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, whose land abuts the proposed route of the Dakota Access pipeline, called Mr Trump's decision a violation of ""law and tribal treaties"".

This video can not be played Sean Spicer: ""The president has believed this for a long time"" It was also announced the FBI Director James Comey would stay in his position under the Trump administration. Mr Comey, of course, is blamed by many Democrats for Hillary Clinton's election loss.

A visit to the Department of Homeland Security saw two more executive orders signed. One calls for ""a large physical barrier"" - the infamous wall - to be built on the US's southern border. The other toughened policy on illegal immigrants -""aliens"" -  including by withholding funding from so-called ""sanctuary cities"" that protect undocumented immigrants within their boundaries. In an interview with ABC News that aired on Wednesday evening, Trump said he believed waterboarding works, stating ""we have to fight fire with fire"". But Mr Trump also said he would consult Defence Secretary James Mattis and CIA director Mike Pompeo - both of whom have indicated they oppose the method - and ""if they don't want to do it that's fine"". This video can not be played Donald Trump tells ABC News that ""torture works"" A draft executive order - that the Trump team disavows as a White House document - also surfaces. It calls for a review into whether the ""black sites"" programme should be reintroduced and would scrap Mr Obama's move to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Another draft executive order emerges suggesting Trump would suspend the Syrian refugee programme and stop issuing visas from several Muslim-majority countries deemed to pose a threat to the security of the US. White House officials declined to comment on the document. This video can not be played Which countries might be subject to Trump ban? But hey, it's almost the weekend.

"This video can not be played Highlights: Liverpool 1-2 Wolves Liverpool's nightmare January reached rock bottom as they weredumped out of the FA Cup in the fourth roundby Wolverhampton Wanderers at Anfield. Jurgen Klopp's side have won only one game out of eight since the turn of the year - an unconvincing third-round replay win at League Two Plymouth - and the loss at home to a team lying 18th in the Championship leaves Liverpool's season at a tipping point. Wolves' victory also left Liverpool contemplating the damaging statistic of three successive Anfield losses for the first time since October 2012, the league defeat by Swansea followed by their EFL Cup semi-final exit at the hands of Southampton. Klopp's Liverpool were riding a wave of Anfield optimism backed up by thrilling attacking football in the early months of the season - so what has gone so badly wrong? BBC One is showing two live FA Cup ties on Sunday. Millwall host Watford at 12:00 GMT, followed at 16:00 GMT by holders Manchester United against Wigan. Liverpool saw in the new year celebrating a victory over Manchester City at Anfield that left them in second place in the Premier League just hours before 2016 became 2017. Klopp and his players celebrated extravagantly in front of the Kop after beating a City side regarded as title rivals. There has been nothing to celebrate since. The last time Liverpool lost three games at home in succession it was to Arsenal and Manchester United in the Premier League and Udinese in the Europa League at the start of Brendan Rodgers' reign - and the last time Klopp suffered a similarly miserable fate was in April 2007 when he was in charge of German side Mainz. Liverpool's struggles started when they were held 2-2 at Sunderland on 2 January and momentum has been totally lost since. Klopp's side were deservedly beaten by Southampton over two legs and he cannot make any serious complaints about fixture overload because the lengthy trip to Plymouth for that third-round replay was  a product of selecting a scratch side for the first game at Anfield. Liverpool performed creditably in a 1-1 draw at Manchester United but the past seven days have been easily the worst since Klopp took over from Rodgers in October 2015. They close January 2017 facing Premier League leaders Chelsea at Anfield on Tuesday. It is Liverpool and Klopp's last chance to salvage comfort and hope from a dreadful month. Liverpool, so full of threat and intensity until the turn of the year, have looked laboured and lacking in threat and confidence in January. The most obvious mitigating circumstance has been the loss of leading scorer Sadio Mane to the Africa Cup of Nations with Senegal. The Â£34m summer signing's stock has risen higher than Anfield's new main stand in his absence. Liverpool won 15 out of 21 games with Mane but only three out of 10 without him. They lost five out of 10 without him and only one out of 21 when he was in the side. The statistics speak for themselves. Ave goals for Win % With Mane 2.6 71.4 Without Mane 1 30 Mane offered width, menace and the sort of pressing on opposing defenders that Klopp sets such store in. And most of all he offered goals, nine of them in the Premier League before he left for the Africa Cup of Nations. This cannot be offered as the sole excuse for Liverpool's collapse, with Klopp still able to call on Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi, as well as being able to use Roberto Firmino, with eight league goals, as the point of Liverpool's attack. There is no question, however, that Origi's confidence has fallen through the floor and Sturridge's more languid style simply does not fit the Klopp template. Mane could not have gone on international duty at a worse time. Liverpool's all-action style was one of the trademarks of Klopp's credo as a manager. He wants a fiercely physical ""gegenpressing"" approach, pressuring the opposition into submission. It is a style that makes strong demands upon his players and they have been carrying out his orders to the letter - but is it starting to catch up with Liverpool? In the Premier League this season, Liverpool have covered 2,579.5km, more than any other team. That's more than 200km further than one of their direct rivals, Manchester United. Klopp dismisses suggestions he has run his players into the ground and left them exhausted so early in the season - and he would appear to be right. Even through a hectic January, Liverpool remain the team to cover the most distance in the league. So if they are still outrunning all of their top-four rivals, there are other factors he may point to for this loss of form. Philippe Coutinho, Liverpool's most creative attacking force in the early phase of the season, is still working his way back after a seven-week absence with an ankle injury, while there is the curious case of defender Joel Matip. Matip was sidelined with an ankle injury after an impressive start to his Liverpool career following his summer arrival from Schalke - but his return was then delayed after confusion about his eligibility following his decision not to play for Cameroon in the Africa Cup of Nations. He was back for the midweek loss to Southampton but Liverpool have not lost a game he has started in the Premier League, testimony to his importance. Matip has figured in 13 Premier League matches in all and Liverpool have lost two out of nine without him. Ave goals conceded Points per game Win % With Matip 1.1 2.2 61.5 Without Matip 1.4 1.9 55.6 Premier League only All can be offered up as reasons for the sudden downturn in Liverpool's fortunes - but the bottom line is both Klopp and his players have lost the assured touch that accompanied them until the new year. Sturridge's contribution to Liverpool's latest Anfield misery was a 25-minute appearance as a substitute for Firmino - but there is no doubt the England striker is increasingly under the microscope. The 27-year-old was expected to assume a greater share of responsibility in Mane's absence but, like so much of his career under Klopp, it has simply not happened for him. The big chance, or chances, came and went for Sturridge in the second leg of the EFL Cup semi-final when two opportunities he would surely have converted with ease in full confidence were badly missed. And as Klopp has suggested, it is Liverpool's wastefulness in front of goal that is costing them dear. They are still creating chances, but Sturridge and his team-mates are not taking them. Sturridge's style, relying on instinct and a glorious natural talent, also seems to be an uneasy fit with what Klopp requires. Despite words of support from his manager, he now seems incapable of operating at the level of full-throttle intensity demanded by the German. The statistics again back up the theory. He recovers possession less often than any other Liverpool player and wins fewer duels against opponents than any other outfield player at Anfield. These are two key components of the classic Klopp tactical plan. Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher delivered a forensic critique of Sturridge's current status in his role as a Sky Sports pundit after the loss to Southampton. ""Sturridge is not the player to run in behind,"" said Carragher, ""so you can forget about him replacing Mane. All he does is come to feet now. ""More often than not you cannot question his finishing but he doesn't do anything else in a game now, whereas he did when he first arrived. ""That's the case with that type of striker now. If they're not a target man or don't run in behind, everything has got to be put on a plate. ""So when he doesn't score you're basically down to 10 men because they're not offering anything else whatsoever."" Klopp has been supportive of Sturridge but the recent Liverpool troubles have underscored the impression that he is starting to look like a square peg in a round hole at Anfield. Liverpool's manager said it himself after suffering Anfield's displeasure in the wake of the humiliating home defeat by Wolves,accepting he was ""100% responsible."" Former Liverpool defender Mark Lawrenson, who was an Anfield, told BBC Radio 5 live moments after Wolves' win: ""At 1.20pm today, Klopp found himself at his lowest point since he became Liverpool manager."" Klopp's popularity has soared from the moment he arrived at Anfield in October 2015 after his sabbatical following his departure from Borussia Dortmund. It was enhanced by taking Liverpool to cup finals in his first campaign, even though they lost on penalties to Manchester City in the League Cup final and were well beaten by Sevilla in the Europa League final. There is no doubt, though, that he has not covered himself in glory in this unexpected fall from grace. Klopp has endured scrutiny with some of his selections, including his ploy of leaving the influential Georginio Wijnaldum out of the EFL semi-final second leg loss to Saints. Instead he employed the midfield duo of out-of-form Emre Can and captain Jordan Henderson to little or no effect. This video can not be played I am responsible, I'm sorry - Klopp Liverpool's manager has been playing with fire in the FA Cup this season and got his fingers badly burned against Wolves. Klopp fielded a second-string side in the third-round tie at home to Plymouth and had to settle for a draw, adding an extra game Liverpool would not have relished. And at Anfield on Saturday, even after the EFL Cup exit to Southampton left the FA Cup as Liverpool's main hope of a trophy, Klopp made nine changes. He tempted FA Cup fate and fate could not resist. Surely after the disappointment of going out to Southampton one step from Wembley, this was an occasion to ditch that policy in favour of trying to keep Liverpool on track for a trophy? Klopp could not even offer up the demands of European football as a reason for resting many of his stars, with Liverpool free from that obligation this season. Yes, Chelsea come to Anfield in the Premier League on Tuesday but the FA Cup fourth-round tie had suddenly assumed a significance Klopp did not appear to fully grasp. BBC Sport's Match of the Day presenter Gary Linekermade his feelings clear,externalwhen he said: ""Don't get Klopp playing the reserves with no European football. Shows a lack of knowledge of the depth in English football and respect."" This week's events should not disguise the fact that the huge majority of Liverpool supporters are happy the club is in safe hands with Klopp. He retains the affection of the club's fanbase. Liverpool's owners, Fenway Sports Group, share that view after awarding him a six-year extension to his contract in July last year. What is in no doubt is that this has been a dreadful week for him and Liverpool - and some of the wounds have been self-inflicted. Liverpool's goal at the start of the season would have been a top-four place. This was a feat many thought would prove beyond them. Klopp perhaps raised expectations almost too high with Liverpool's results and thrilling performances earlier this season. This has made the fall from a height even more painful and surprising. He still has that top-four objective well within reach but he will want marksman Mane back as soon as possible and he will need to work on regaining the confidence and impetus that has been lost. Liverpool can still achieve big things - but trophy hopes look to be over for another season.

"This video can not be played Protesters gather at Dulles airport: ""Welcome to the USA!"" Said Hajouli, a second-year medical resident, had waited over a year to see his bride. They met in Turkey, after ""Leen"" - Said did not want to use her real name - fled her university in Syria when the war broke out. They were engaged for a year, married in 2015, then spent only one week together as husband and wife before Said had to return to Virginia on his J-1 visa, a non-immigrant visa commonly given to scholars and doctors. In the meantime, the couple applied and were approved for a J-2 visa for Leen, which is a permit reserved for spouses and dependents of J-1 holders. Finally, on Saturday 28 January, Leen boarded a flight in Istanbul bound for Dulles International Airport in Virginia, about 45 minutes outside of Washington DC. It was supposed to be a happy day. ""It was supposed to be, but I don't know what's going to happen,"" 29-year-old Said said, not long after arriving at Dulles. Almost exactly 24 hours earlier,President Donald Trump signed an executive order titled, ""Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States"". It shut down the US refugee programme for 120 days, indefinitely suspended the resettlement of Syrian refugees, and halted all immigration to the US from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Sudan and Yemen for 90 days. The order led to chaos at airports all over the world. Travellers were prevented from boarding planes abroad and, in some cases, were pulled off flights. They were detained at US airports. And there seemed to have been little instructions given to US Customs and Border Patrol on how to handle refugee and immigrant arrivals under the new rules. Lawyers gathered to represent those facing travel bans Earlier that morning, Said's friend's wife also attempted to enter the country with a J-2 visa, but he says she was immediately stopped and sent back. So, instead of flowers, Said brought Rob Robertson to the airport, a tall, burly immigration lawyer. Said had found him just hours earlier after putting out a desperate plea for help on social media. ""They've done everything they need to do. It's already clear she's not a threat,"" said Mr Robertson. ""It worries me that they're just going to turn around and send them back, pursuant to an executive order that is not law, that does not override the Immigration and Nationality Act,"" he said, referring to the 1965 law that bans discrimination against immigrants based on ""nationality, place of birth, or place of residence"". This video can not be played Protesters against the ban also gathered at New York's JFK Airport Mr Robertson was one of roughly 30 volunteer lawyers who showed up to Dulles on Saturday afternoon. They deployed en masse following news that two Iraqi men with valid visas were detained at John F Kennedy Airport, in New York, and faced deportation. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued on their behalf and they were later released. Rumours spread that more were trapped in legal limbo at other airports around the country - including Dulles. ""This is not the country I was born in. This is not the country that I loved,"" said lawyer Lena Albibi, who was moved to tears. ""It's very painful seeing this happenâ¦ They're breaking families apart."" Reaching prospective clients was a tricky errand for the lawyers, since anyone who needed legal help - travellers being detained in the ""secondary inspection"" area of US Customs and Border Patrol at Dulles - had no way to communicate with lawyers waiting outside. Lawyer Lena Albibi said this did not feel like the US she knew ""We cannot get the information that we need so we can figure out how we can assist them,"" said immigration lawyer Sari Long. ""We're trying to do our best to canvas family members."" Dispersed in the waiting area near baggage claim number 15 were people like Elmira Tayary, who had no idea she would need a lawyer to collect her 63-year-old mother, a green-card holder. Just hours earlier, Department of Homeland Security officials had revealed that the executive order would extend to permanent residents of the US coming from the seven banned countries. Tayary said her mother splits her time between the US and Iran, and has for years. ""I'm very, very sad, but I'm hopeful she may show up any minute,"" said Elmira. ""This is very disappointing."" Relatives and supporters waited to greet arrivals who had been detained As hours ticked by, and more and more protesters arrived carrying signs that read ""Refugees Are Welcome"" and ""Love Your Neighbour"", it became clear that something like 50 to 60 people, including green-card holders, were being held at customs. Lawyers were still not permitted to speak to them. However, there were small acts of rebellion. Employees of the airport itself managed to ferry information to family members who were waiting, including Elmira, to tell them that green card holders would soon be on their way. Immediately soothed, Elmira bought her mother a red-white-and-blue balloon. One by one, the permanent residents were released, walking down a corridor now teeming with demonstrators shouting ""Welcome home!"" and singing ""This Land is My Land"". Ali and his wife Hajer wore weary smiles as they pushed their luggage through the gauntlet of well-wishers, their 11- and 7-year-old boys in tow. Someone handed Hajer flowers. Ali worked for three years as an interpreter for the US Army and gained admittance to the US through a Special Immigrant Visa, reserved for Iraqi and Afghan nationals who face threats of violence for working for Americans during the conflicts there. He now has a green card, and returned to Iraq for his father's funeral, only to be delayed for hours for questioning at Dulles. ""We are not terrorists. We are not bad people,"" said Ali. ""It's so hard. I hope they will change their minds on this position."" US citizen Alaa was finally able to connect with his wife Jinan, a green card holder, only after she answered a series of questions about her family and her husband's business. ""That's way over the limit. She's got a green card,"" Alaa said. ""Are we going to blow up our system because we are afraid? Then, you know, whoever we are afraid from are winning."" Just then, a thin man carrying a sign that read ""This Veteran Stands With You"" stopped Alaa, told him he is an Iraq veteran, and with little explanation fastened a Purple Heart medal to Alaa's jacket. ""That's a great thing, that's a great thing!"" Alaa cried, elated. ""This is what America is all about!"" Ali, Hajer and their sons, legal residents in the US, finally make it through to the arrivals hall As the green-card holders began to depart, more good news arrived - first a judge in Brooklyn declared that deporting refugees and valid visa holders who'd already arrived in US airports would cause ""irreparable harm"", thereby blocking the deportations. Next, a judge in Virginia issued a temporary restraining order to stop the expulsion of green card holders. Each time the news arrived, the lawyers huddled together and then broke out into rowdy cheers. ""We are optimistic that pretty soon all those people back there will be allowed to come through,"" said lawyer Dan Press. By the time some detainees made it through, they were so exhausted that several fell weeping into the arms of loved ones - to the frenzied glee of the now-enormous protest group. It wasn't all good news. Rumours that deportations took place continued to swirl, though it is unclear how many. The Virginia court decision lasts only a week and Trump's executive order still holds for anyone who did not make it to US shores in time for this brief, legal reprieve. By 11 pm, Said still had no definitive answer about his wife, Leen. She called to say she was being sent back to Turkey, but then later was shuffled off to another room in customs. ""She may come walking out of there for all I know,"" said Said's lawyer. So Said leaned against a wall, eyes fixed on the path out of customs, and waited, as patiently as the previous year.

"The US Marines have a particular mystique - often first into a hotspot, and last out - and the training recruits undergo is particularly challenging. This applies to female marines - now for the first time being used in combat roles - as well as their male counterparts. Hannah King, of the British Forces Broadcasting Service, witnessed some of them undergoing an intense, 54-hour trial known as the Crucible. ""Hit 'er, Davey, harderâ¦Hit her harder."" The khaki camo-paint caking the drill instructor's face hides her crimson rage as she screeches in at a small recruit, who obediently hammers away at her opponent's head with her fists. This is one of the final events of the Crucible - a gruelling 54-hour endurance test that will ultimately determine which of these young women will become US Marines. Parris Island, hidden from the Atlantic by a tangle of sparkling rivers, looks like the perfect holiday spot. But this is where all female marines come to be trained. Or ""reprogrammed"", as some prefer to say. And it's far from serene. For three months now they've been screamed at by merciless Alsatian-like instructors and exercised to exhaustion. They've been stripped of their purses, their phones, their feelings, their personalities. From the moment they arrive on Parris Island they can no longer say ""I"". From now on, it's ""this recruit"". ""This recruit requests..."" ""This recruit believesâ¦"" They will say everything in unison, and move everywhere in perfect formation. The sticky South Carolina air is filled with their ditties as they chant the instructions for every single task - from loading their guns to filing in to take a shower. The US Marine Corps has accepted women into its ranks since 1918, although then only for clerical duties. Over the next century, however, their contribution would increase significantly. By 1985 they had their first female brigadier-general and just a few weeks ago the first three female marines took up roles in a ground combat unit, ready to fight on the front line - something which is yet to happen on our side of the pond. ""I don't mean to sound contentious,"" I begin apologetically, suddenly acutely aware of my classic Britishness, ""but what do you think of your female counterparts? Do they make good marines?"" The young male drill instructor starting before me barely hesitates: ""What it comes down to, ma'am, is this. Mission accomplishment. If there's a mortarman three clicks away who's gonna give you support - you're not gonna care. If you get shot and blown up and a helicopter comes in to pull you out - you're not gonna care about the race, creed, colour or sex of that marine."" He has a point. In a gigantic swimming pool on the other side of camp, some fresh new recruits are doing their swim assessment. One test requires them to remove all clothes, guns and ammunition underwater, in less than 10 seconds. It sounds like a tall order. But as I look around the pool, some of them are only just learning to swim. ""Why would you want to become a marine,"" I wonder, ""if you can't even swimâ¦"" It dawns on me that recruits here perhaps join for different reasons to those back in the UK. Firstly, serving four years here means all your future tuition fees and some living costs are paid. It's almost a free ticket to university. Secondly, many of these wannabe marines really do believe that serving your country is just something everyone should do. Once you've served - then you can go on to become the lawyer, the teacher, or the hairdresser that you've always dreamed of being. But first - you serve your country. And the Marines are the best of the best. It's where everyone wants to be. The gift shop on Parris Island offers tourist tat to rival any popular attraction. T-shirts and tracksuits, car stickers, key fobs and coffee cups - declaring proudly ""Marine Wife,"" ""Proud Marine Dad,"" and even ""My granddaughter's a Marine"".

The cars packed with loud relatives queueing at the gates are bedecked with banners and paint declaring ""Parris Island bound, to collect our new marine,"" or ""Honk for Marine Katy"". ""I used to wear my faded jeans, now I'm rockin' cammie greens."" A faint chorus echoes across the island, calling out to camp - the newest marines are nearing the end of the torturous Crucible. Sleep-deprived, hungry, battered and blistered, they still find the breath to sing as they trudge through the gates, beneath a large sign that hollers ""We make marines"". Fellow servicemen line the road, whooping them in with genuine applause, pride and delight. On the parade square, they gather. Their ordeal - over. Normally I might scour a line-up of troops - searching somewhere for a hint of emotion. But there's no problem here. Tears drizzle down the face of each and every warrior - no matter their gender. They're the first marines to be sworn in under a brand new commander-in-chief - Donald Trump. Some of them will probably go on to be amongst the first women to serve on the front line.

"This video can not be played Ciera Taylor lived most of her life as a boy, until she transitioned last March Ciera Taylor was 14 when she told her parents she was born in the wrong body and wanted to live as a girl. Now aged 16, she tells BBC News how her family and schoolfriends have coped with her momentous decision. Less than two years ago, Ciera sat down with her mother and father in Leicestershire and told them one of the most difficult things a child can tell their parents. Ciera was called Kieran and living as a boy. But she had increasingly come to feel she was meant to be a girl. ""I said I do want to change this body and I need to be able to look in the mirror and see me,"" she says. ""It was a big shock for them and they didn't know how to handle it. I didn't expect them to."" Ciera, from Leicestershire, thought she might be gay when she was younger Ciera says she had felt different from her peers for a long time before that day in March 2015. She had always been ""very small and quite feminine looking"" as a young child. ""I thought I might be gay,"" she says. ""I didn't know what it was that was going through my head as a young boy; for a while I pushed those feelings aside. ""When I look back at old pictures of me I kind of see someone that's not happy; probably smiling in the photo but not happy because that person doesn't feel fulfilled in who they are."" Ciera says she was ""very small and quite feminine looking"" as a young child She says her parents' shock initially deterred her from living as a girl. ""It put me off and I said I wouldn't transition any more for the benefit of people around me who couldn't cope with the loss of Kieran,"" she says. But a year later, one weekend in March 2016, she began to live as a girl. Her dad, Andy Taylor, said he cried all day long. ""I think I bottled up quite a lot of emotion and it only came sort of bursting out when she transitioned,"" he says. Ciera says she sees ""someone that's not happy"" when she looks at old photos Her mum, Rachel Taylor, felt just as emotional. ""I'd lost my little boy and I was grieving for my little boy,"" she says. ""As a mum you know that your child's going to take a certain path and you've got their future mapped in your mind. ""Now all of a sudden it was taking a completely different direction and I knew it was going to be a really, really hard journey."" But seeing Ciera as a girl was also a relief. ""I just looked at her and I thought, 'You should have been born a girl, you are a girl', and actually from that day forwards a huge weight lifted off my shoulders, because my little girl was coming to me now,"" she says. Ciera's parents, Andy and Rachel Taylor, are proud of their daughter ""All the things she's done since she transitioned, which was only March, it's almost overwhelming,"" says her dad. Her mum adds: ""We are so lucky because now we've got our daughter, and she is beautiful and she will be happy."" On the weekend she transitioned, Ciera posted a selfie on Facebook revealing her new appearance. Her friends were quick to compliment Ciera on her ""gorgeous"" and ""stunning"" new look. But as supportive as they were, Ciera knew she still had to face going to school as a girl for the first time on Monday morning. Stonewall, the LGBT rights charity, said it was common for young transgender people to be bullied, and some even report being bullied by their teachers. Ciera says she felt nervous, but fortunately had a ""warm reception"" from her school and peers. Ciera's school held an assembly to help pupils understand transgender issues A representative of the Young Transgender Centre of Excellence in Leicester - which supports 33 young people, including Ciera - was even invited into the school to speak at assembly. ""I'm very lucky,"" says Ciera. ""I've heard of other people having horrid experiences at schools. My school said 'Give us more information'."" Jenny McDonald-Brown, a student support teacher at Ciera's school in Leicestershire, said the assembly helped the pupils understand transgender issues. ""I know a lot of them have said to me 'We don't know what to say to Ciera, because we might upset her, or we might say the wrong thing, or it's awkward or we feel silly', but now that they know the facts and it is an emotional thing that she needs to go through, then they can help with that and support her."" Transgender or trans people are those who have transitioned or want to transition to live as the gender they identify with, which differs from the gender assigned to them when they were born It can include both social and/or medical transition Medical transition can include hormone replacement therapy such as hormone blockers and cross-sex hormones (including testosterone or oestrogen) as well as different surgeries Transitioning socially is about how someone expresses their gender. This includes but is not limited to a change in name and pronoun use, wearing clothes typically associated with a specific gender and a change in hairstyle Transitioning socially is a big part of a young person's life as they are not eligible for permanent medical intervention such as cross-sex hormones and surgeries until they reach adulthood and adult NHS gender identity services Lisa Vine, Project Lead, Young Transgender Centre of Excellence,external The reaction from parents has been positive too - even after Ciera was given the choice of using either the boys' or girls' toilets and changing rooms. ""We thought we may get issues from parents, they might say 'We're not happy', but everybody has been fabulous,"" says Ms McDonald-Brown. ""Not one person has come forward and said they've got an issue with it, which is really good for the school and it's really good for Ciera."" Ciera, shown here on a shopping trip with her sister, says she has had to figure out what clothes suit her and what she feels comfortable in Ciera says girls usually have years to find their style, but she has had to pack it into a few months Despite assurances that she is beautiful, Ciera still feels insecure about her appearance and says ""looking in the mirror is a challenge"". She hopes to start taking hormone blockers in the next few months, and these will suppress the effects of puberty. ""I still see a lot of Kieran in my face only because of the effects that puberty has had on this face, that's made a face that I can't really relate with any more,"" she says. ""I do wear make-up and I have to almost transition each morning to try and create a face that is presentable enough for me to the outer world."" Ciera says looking in the mirror is still a challenge ""For me, I do want medical intervention to change my hormones so it's in line with how I feel inside; taking oestrogen when I'm older so my body would develop like a girl's would. ""I will need surgeries for when I'm older, it's just what I need to do, I know I will feel complete. ""For me, as a trans person, this is not the body I want. It's not mine and I'm making this life-changing decision so I can live my life."" Transgender campaigner Paris Lees said her own teenage years were ""tough"" Ciera met up withtransgender campaigner Paris Leeswhile she was making the film about her experiences. Paris said her own teenage years, in the neighbouring county of Nottinghamshire, were ""tough"". ""I often felt unsafe just to come out of the house,"" says Paris. ""People would call me a 'poofter' and just shout abuse at me in the streets. ""Kids who are not supported are much more likely to come into difficulties whether that's homelessness, mental health issues, suicide. ""As a society we should be shamed when we know that 48% of young trans people have attempted suicide."" Ciera says she was ""really, really excited"" to meet Paris, because she has been a role model for her for a long time. Ciera says Paris Lees has been her role model for a long time And in the same way, Ciera herself is keen to help other young transgender people. ""I wish that I had been born a girl. I wish I hadn't been born transgender but I'm happy and proud to be trans to raise awareness."" You can see Ciera's film in full on BBC Inside Out East Midlands at 19:30 GMT on BBC One on Monday 30 January or via iPlayer afterwards. What would you ask a transgender woman?

"Donald Trump has sparked a sales bonanza for publishers of dystopian fiction - as well as his own books on business success. Here are the titles currently enjoying a boost on the back of his arrival in the White House. Sales:As of Friday, the eighth best-selling book on Amazon. It was out of print in the UK but publishers Penguin launched a new edition following the inauguration - promoting it as the book that predicted Trump - and has so far ordered three print runs, totalling 11,000 copies, a spokeswoman said. Plot:A charismatic demagogue, Berzelius ""Buzz"" Windrip, runs for president on a promise to restore American greatness, dragging the country into fascism. The Trump factor:Sales of this relatively obscure 1935 satirical novel took off when critics began claiming it was essentially the Donald Trump story.  Sally Parry, of the Sinclair Lewis Society, claims there are parallels with Trump in the way that Windrip targets his message at disaffected white working class males - The League of Forgotten Men in the book - sweeping to victory on a wave of anti-immigrant, nationalistic sentiment. But she adds: ""Some of his satire is not necessarily towards Buzz Windrip, the fascist character, but towards the lazy intellectuals, the lazy liberals who say 'well, things will go along' and the constant refrain of 'it can't happen here', this is America, we are exceptional."" Parry herself admits she initially fell into this category: ""I thought how can so many people fall for this guy?"" But the comparisons only stretch so far, says Parry. Lewis was writing at a time of far greater economic turmoil than today and against the backdrop of the rise of fascism in Europe.  He was also a member of the America First committee, which opposed America's entry into World War Two. Key quote:""My one ambition is to get all Americans to realise that they are, and must continue to be, the greatest Race on the face of this old Earth, and second, to realise that whatever apparent Differences there may be among us, in wealth, knowledge, skill, ancestry or strength - though, of course, all this does not apply to people who are racially different from us - we are all brothers, bound together in the great and wonderful bond of National Unity, for which we should all be very glad."" Sales:As of Friday, the best-selling book on Amazon. Since Donald Trump's inauguration, sales have increased by 9,500%, according to American publishers Signet Classics, which this week ordered an additional 100,000 copies of Orwell titles, including 1984 and Animal Farm.  In the first three weeks of January sales increased by 20% in the UK. The book has never been out of print since it was published in 1948, selling close to 30 million copies to date. The last sales spike occurred in 2013 during Edward Snowden's spying revelations. Plot:A man crushed by a totalitarian, surveillance state - presided over by the all-seeing and possibly non-existent Big Brother - attempts to rebel. The Trump factor:Orwell's classic dystopian narrative shot to the top of the Amazon sales charts after Donald Trump's senior adviser Kellyanne Conway said the White House was issuing ""alternative facts"" in a row over the size of the crowd at his inauguration. A key part of Orwell's book is the way that the Party uses simplistic slogans to warp reality, so Black is White, 2+2=5, War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength. But it was written, in part, as a warning against Soviet communism and America is not a one-party state with no personal freedom. Andrew Simmons, a writer and English teacher from California, who uses 1984 in the classroom, thinks people are reaching for Orwell's book and other nightmarish visions of the future as a ""safety valve,"" enabling them to ""freak out and think about the worst possible destination for American democracy"". ""The cultural mood in America is dystopian, particularly among people who read a lot of classic fiction,"" he adds. But he also argues that for some readers 1984 contains echoes of Trump in its attitude to ""scientific progress"" (in 1984, science doesn't exist) and the way he has played on Americans' fears about foreigners. ""The president's promise that he was the only person who could protect them does potentially echo for people the Party's pattern of whipping up fear among the populace and then presenting them with a narrative trumpeting victory over the source of said fears."" Key quote:""And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed - if all records told the same tale - then the lie passed into history and became truth. 'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.' And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory. 'Reality control,' they called it: in Newspeak, 'doublethink.'"" Sales:Another dystopian novel that was not in Amazon's top 100 sales chart two years ago but which is currently in the top 10. Plot:Set in 2540, it depicts a world where the population are willing slaves to totalitarianism, kept docile and compliant by drugs, constant entertainment, technology and a surfeit of material goods. The Trump factor:For some cultural critics Huxley's 1935 novel provides a far more accurate representation of our cosseted, anaesthetised times, than the world portrayed in 1984 or Animal Farm. ""Orwell feared we would become a captive culture,"" writes the late Neil Postman in his 1995 book Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. ""Huxley feared we would become a trivial culture, preoccupied with some equivalent of the feelies, the orgy porgy, and the centrifugal bumblepuppy."" Key quote:""A really efficient totalitarian state would be one in which the all-powerful executive of political bosses and their army of managers control a population of slaves who do not have to be coerced, because they love their servitude."" Sales:Currently tussling with Donald Trump's book (see below) for the 15th slot in the Amazon chart. Plot:A 24th Century fireman Guy Montag, whose job is to burn illegally-owned books and their readers' homes, starts to question the value of his profession and his life. The Trump factor:Another warning about the dangers of censorship, propaganda and the stifling of free thought. Bradbury's 1953 book predicts the death of the written word and its replacement by screens. TV is the bogeyman, however, not social media. Key quote:""With school turning out more runners, jumpers, racers, tinkerers, grabbers, snatchers, fliers, and swimmers instead of examiners, critics, knowers, and imaginative creators, the word 'intellectual,' of course, became the swear word it deserved to be."" Sales:As of Friday, this was the 15th best-selling book on Amazon. First published in 1987, it spent 51 weeks in the New York Times best-seller list. He went on to publish several other books, some of which have also seen an increase in sales in recent weeks. Plot:A work of non-fiction, the Art of the Deal is Trump's personal manifesto, offering readers 11 steps to business success. The Trump factor:As a primer in the way Donald Trump thinks and operates, the Art of the Deal is seen by many readers - and the man himself - as hard to beat. ""The voice that sprang from the pages was entirely original, seemingly candid, relentlessly boastful and refreshingly unafraid to take swipes, settle scores, and opine with an I-am-what-I-am gusto,"" wrote Timothy L O'Brien in a biography of Trump. That voice was crafted by Tony Schwarz, who unusually for a ghost writer received half of the royalties and got a credit on the cover.

"Trump executive orders include building a wall with Mexico Barack Obama used them sparingly; Donald Trump issued at least four in his first week in office: executive orders are a key tool for any US president wanting to make their mark on government policy. Republicans accused Mr Obama of overreach when he signed orders on healthcare and gay rights, but they have praised Mr Trump for using the same tactic to roll back Obamacare. Trump orders to watch for Trump orders building of wall Trump rolls back Obamacare It is a written order issued by the president to the federal government which does not require congressional approval. Orders range from dramatic reverses of policy, like MrTrump's approval for the construction of two bitterly contested oil pipelines, to ordinary business, such as Mr Obama's instructions onhalf-day closing for government departments,externalon Christmas Eve 2015. Authority for issuing the orders is rooted inArticle II of the US constitution,external, which states: ""The executive power shall be vested in a president of the United States of America."" Roosevelt issued several thousand orders Sometimes the orders are made during wartime or to avert a domestic crisis. In February 1942, President Franklin D Roosevelt signed an executive order that led to the creation of detention centres for about 120,000 Japanese Americans. In 1952 President Harry S Truman issued an order that put the steel industry under the control of the government in an attempt to avoid a strike. Mr Obama issued his most controversial executive orders in an attempt to work around gridlock in Congress caused by intransigent Republican opposition. ""If they're not going to do anything, we'll do what we can on our own,"" he told a crowd in Kansas City in July 2014. ""That's when we act - when your Congress won't."" An executive order has to work within the confines of the law, with, in theory, each one ""reviewed by the Office of Legal Counsel for form and legality"". This does not always happen. If an order is deemed to stray outside the boundaries of what is acceptable, it can be subject to a legal review. Congress can also pass a law to override the executive order, but a president still has a veto over that law, theConstitution Center explained,external. Republicans in the House, led by Speaker John Boehner, at microphone, blocked virtually all of Obama's legislative agenda, leading him to take executive action on his own Executive orders are controversial because they bypass approval from Congress, allowing the president to act on his own. Republicans successfully sued Mr Obama over part of his 2010 healthcare changes, arguing that he had exceeded his constitutional authority when he unilaterally delayed an insurance coverage deadline. A president may also issue an order when members of Congress act too slowly or when the president feels he needs to flesh out details of a new law. Grover Cleveland issued 28 executive orders per year during his first term Roosevelt issued 3,721 orders during his 12 years in office, whileMr Obama signed just 279,external. George W Bush issued 291 over his eight years in power. Mr Obama's was a modest total by modern standards. His average of 35 orders per year is the lowest tally since Grover Cleveland, who was president from 1885-89, and then 1893-97 - and averaged 32 orders a year.

"The existence of Rene Magritte's The Enchanted Pose (La Pose EnchantÃ©e) was only known about because of a single black and white photo A section of a lost painting by surrealist master Rene Magritte discovered beneath another of his works will not be physically uncovered, a museum has said. Part of The Enchanted Pose was found last year under Magritte's work The Human Condition at Norwich Castle. The museum curator said it was ""impossible"" to uncover the image without destroying the later painting. ""Non-invasive"" imaging methods will be used to recreate the hidden section. The Enchanted Pose, which showed two almost identical female nudes side by side in a neoclassical style, was exhibited in 1927 but disappeared. The only evidence of the painting's existence is a single black and white photo. It is believed the Belgian artist cut the painting into four to reuse the smaller canvases for an exhibition in 1936. One section is still missing. The first quarter - a head and torso section - was hidden under The Portrait, hanging in New York's Museum of Modern Art, while the second was discovered beneath The Red Model at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm. Both were found in 2013. Rene Magritte painted The Human Condition (La Condition Humaine) over the top of The Enchanted Pose after it was returned to him from an exhibition The third quarter was found under The Human Condition by conservator Alice Tavares da Silva, who works for the Hamilton Kerr Institute at the University of Cambridge. She was studying the picture in Norwich before it was loaned to the Pompidou Centre in Paris in September for a major retrospective of 100 Magritte pieces. The museum's historic art curator Dr Giorgia Bottinelli said they would ""never attempt"" to physically uncover the original. ""If it was technically possible it would certainly be unethical, as it was Magritte himself that decided to cut up one of his paintings and then create new compositions over the fragments,"" she said. ""The preservation of the artist's intention is in my opinion our main priority. ""Non-invasive and non-destructive imaging techniques will enable us to make a reconstructed image of the hidden painting."" The Human Condition is now being transported to the Schirn in Frankfurt, where it will go on show until it returns to Norwich in June. The hope is that publicity generated by the exhibitions will prompt the discovery of the final quarter.

"Anyone looking to eat their breakfast on a Trump-free Sunday will be disappointed. The face of the US president is seldom absent. The Sunday Telegraph alone carries five photographs and a cartoon of the newest occupant of the Oval Office. The Sun on Sunday also has five photos, although Trump is eclipsed by six pictures of David Beckham on a single page, ahead of hisappearance on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. Some coverage of Trump's first week in the White House is scathing.The Observer,externalconcludes that the president ""cannot be trusted"" on issues that affect Britain, describing him as ""ignorant, prejudiced and vicious in ways that no American leader has been"". Itreports the case,externalof a Yazidi woman who fled an ""Isis massacre in Iraq"", but was not allowed to board a flight to the US to be reunited with her husband. Sunday Mirror columnistSaira Khan,externaldescribes Trump's policies as ""damaging, isolationist, racist, sexist, Islamophobic, backward"", and likely to trigger an ""economic arms race"" of tit-for-tat tariffs. But in The Sunday Times, historian Niall Ferguson writes that while Trump is a ""self-publicist of prodigious talent"", it is important to distinguish his messages to his supporters from the actual process of governing. No-one, writes Ferguson, is yet in a position to know how a Trump presidency will turn out. The spectacle of President Trump holding hands with the prime minister in the White House continues to fascinate. The Sunday Telegraph has acartoon,externalof a serene-looking Mr Trump locking hands with a rather less relaxed Theresa May on one side, and a bare-chested Vladimir Putin on the other, as they gambol through a meadow. There's a possible explanation inThe Sunday Express,externalas to why the president took Mrs May's hand - and the answer may not be chivalry, as Downing Street has suggested. The paper says it has learned that Mr Trump has a fear of slopes and stairs, known as ""bathophobia"", and he merely needed a steadying arm. TheMail on Sunday,externaltakes aim at what it calls a ""ludicrous, politically correct directive to placate the transgender lobby"". It says the British Medical Association has told NHS doctors not to call pregnant women ""expectant mothers"", in case the term offends transgender people. A spokesperson from a transgender support group tells the Mail that the advice to doctors is a ""massive step forwards"" in preventing discrimination.  But the paper's leader column says transgender campaigners are not entitled to force their opinions about changing language on to others. The Sun on Sunday has a warning about a new obesity epidemic - but there's not a hamburger or sugar-packed smoothie in sight. The paper reports a survey which suggests cars are getting heavier. Bigger engines, tyres, extra equipment and safety devices such as air bags mean some cars have doubled in weight since they were launched, decades ago.  The new Mini, for example, is now more of a maxi, being more than eighty per cent heavier than the lightweight original.
