"Will Beckett said Hawksmoor needed to ""turbo-charge"" its recruitment drive Restaurant group Hawksmoor is offering bonuses of up to Â£2,000 to workers who recommend friends for jobs in a bid to fill staffing shortages. Another chain has emailed customers with a promise of gift vouchers if they introduce candidates who go on to be hired by the firm. It comes as the hospitality sector faces a jobs crisis that threatens to hold back its recovery. Hawksmoor co-founder Will Beckett told the BBC there ""aren't enough people"". The firm's problems underline the wider staffing crunch facing hospitality with indoor dining in Britain having resumed last week. Pub chains Marston's and Mitchells and Butlers both warned last week that they were finding it hard to recruit workers, blaming overseas staff returning home and the stop-start nature of lockdown forcing people to give up on the sector. Job vacancies highest for a year as lockdown eases 'We offered people a $300 bonus to work for us' Mr Beckett said: ""Hospitality is struggling with recruitment at the moment. It's a little hard to tell whether this is because there aren't enough people due to them leaving the country or leaving the sector, or because everyone is recruiting at the same time."" Whatever the reason, he said, Hawksmoor needed to ""turbo-charge"" its recruitment efforts. For each person recommended and who is hired after passing a one-month trial they will get a bonus - Â£200 for a first friend, Â£300 for the next one, and up to Â£2,000 for five friends. Mr Beckett said he wanted to re-direct the recruitment budget ""at our own staff, who've had financial problems while on furlough. So instead of a huge amount spent on recruitment websites or agencies, we did this policy."" Another restaurant chain, Caravan, said it was offering Â£100 gift vouchers to customers if they successfully recommend someone for a job. ""We have emailed our lovely customers to help us find superstars to work with us,"" the firm said in an email to the BBC. The Sunday Times,which reported the quirky practices some firms were using,external, quoted the chairman of recruitment giant Reed as saying the jobs pendulum had swung back in favour of workers. But James Reed said there were job shortages across the board, not just in hospitality, with 18,000 vacancies added online in just one day last week - ""the highest number I can recall in years"". Government action needed Latest figures from global recruitment firm Broadbean Technology found that in April, vacancies in UK hospitality soared 77% from the previous month. However, compared with April 2020, the number of applications slumped 82%. ""The decline in application numbers is a concern and could hinder the growth of the hospitality sector in the immediate future,"" said Broadbean's managing director Alex Fourlis. He said that, as work dried up during the pandemic many people chose to leave the sector and firms now face a challenge enticing them back. But he added: ""Perhaps more concerningly, though, this drop in applications follows the UK's exit from the EU and potentially suggests that Brexit has had a long-lasting impact on hospitality."" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of industry body UK Hospitality, told the Sunday Times it was time for the government to review its ""shortage occupations"" list. ""We've also suggested an Australian-style coronavirus recovery visa for lower-skilled workers who don't meet the point-based system [but] who are crucial to the recovery,"" she said. UK Hospitality has estimated that more than 52,000 venues employing about 900,000 people were planning to reopen last week in England, Scotland and Wales. That's on top of about 26,000 venues that opened in April for outside trading.

"Phil Mickelson and his brother Tim as caddie won together at a major for the first time US PGA Championship final leaderboard -6P Mickelson (US);-4B Koepka (US), L Oosthuizen (SA);-2P Harrington (Ire), S Lowry (Ire), P Casey (Eng) H Higgs (US) Selected others: -1J Rose (Eng), C Morikawa (US);+1M Fitzpatrick (Eng), M Laird (Sco), I Poulter (Eng), H Matsuyama (Jpn);+2J Spieth (US);+5R McIlroy (NI) Phil Mickelson became the oldest man to win a major title as he claimed the US PGA Championship at Kiawah Island amid extraordinary scenes as thousands of fans swarmed on to the final fairway to witness the winning moment. It was a throwback victory for 50-year-old Mickelson and a reminder of what sport has been missing in the absence of crowds during the Covid-19 pandemic. Spectators swamped the American as he marched up to the 18th green on his way to clinching a sixth major title, eight years after his last. ""It was quite unnerving, but exceptionally awesome. I don't think I've ever experienced anything like that before,"" said Mickelson, who won on six under par at the Ocean Course after a closing one-over 73. He finished two clear of fellow American Brooks Koepka, who closed with a 74, and South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen, who signed for a 73. Mickelson takes the record of oldest major winner from Julius Boros, who won this title in 1968 at the age of 48, and also joins England's Sir Nick Faldo and American Lee Trevino as a six-time major winner. Only 11 male players have won more. ""This is just an incredible feeling. I just believed that it was possible yet everything was saying it wasn't and I hope that others find that inspiration,"" added Mickelson. ""It may take a little extra work and harder effort to maintain the physicality, or maintain the skills, but gosh is it worth it in the end. ""I just love this game and I love what I do and I love the challenge of competing against such great players."" He will now be among the favourites at next month's US Open, the only major he needs to become the sixth man to complete the career Grand Slam. It is being held near his home in San Diego at Torrey Pines, a course on which he has won three titles. Ireland's Padraig Harrington and Shane Lowry finished in a tie for fourth at two under after closing rounds of 69. They were level with American Harry Higgs and England's Paul Casey, who scored consistently throughout the week and posted his third 71 on Sunday. It's a family affair - how crucial caddie intervention inspired Mickelson victory It was a final pairing packed with potential storylines: Mickelson aiming to become the oldest major championship winner, Koepka looking for victory just two months after serious knee surgery. In the end, it was Mickelson who controlled the narrative and held his nerve during a tense final round. Koepka was eight months old when Mickelson claimed the first of his 45 PGA Tour titles as an amateur at the Northern Telecom Open in 1991 and 13 years later the American became a major champion with the first of his three Masters crowns. He added to those at the 2005 PGA Championship and 2013 Open, but victory at Kiawah Island must rank as the most remarkable after dropping out of the top 100 earlier this year for the first time since 1993. Mickelson says he has being trying to improve his concentration and stay more ""present"" by practising meditation and other drills to increase his focus and he needed all of that composure on a rollercoaster front nine. He led by one overnight on seven under, but began with a bogey and when Koepka rolled in a birdie from 12 feet a two-shot swing handed the 31-year-old the lead. But a double bogey followed for Koepka as he duffed a chip from a bank behind the second green and then watched as Mickelson clipped on before sinking a birdie putt to reclaim top spot and take a two-stroke advantage on the field. Phil Mickelson claimed his sixth major eight years after his fifth title Mickelson held on to the sole lead despite a bogey at three after two loose chips around the green, but only because Koepka missed a three-footer for birdie. Then came a moment of magic from the champion, chipping in from the sand to birdie the par-three fifth and send the Kiawah Island crowd almost delirious. Mickelson followed up with a bogey and Koepka took advantage by pulling back level, only to send a disastrous approach at seven on to the cart path on his way to another dropped shot as Mickelson got up and down for a birdie that sent him clear once more. The veteran hit the turn with his two-stroke lead intact and increased it to four at 10 with a well-made birdie as Koepka found the sand and failed to recover. The left-hander had a five-stroke lead at the same stage on Saturday, only to watch it evaporate over the next three holes, but not even a fan picking up his ball after a wayward drive at 11 could faze him this time as Mickelson saved par and Koepka bogeyed to drop five back, meaning Oosthuizen was once again his closest challenger. Having avoided the water off the tee at 13, Mickelson then found it with his approach to the green and made back-to-back bogeys, though Oosthuizen dropped two shots on the same hole after also finding the water. That meant Mickelson led by three shots with four to play. Oosthuizen, whose sole major win came at the 2010 Open, birdied the 16th to keep the fight alive but moments later Mickelson, who turns 51 next month, hit the longest drive of any player this week on the hole - 366 yards - on his way to a birdie of his own. Mickelson said he was having fun this week, though there was nothing enjoyable about the daunting par-three 17th, but he could afford to drop a shot and head to the 18th with a two-stroke advantage. Up to 10,000 fans were allowed on site each day at Kiawah Island He pushed his drive left and as he assessed his options from in front of a hospitality stand, fans started to swarm onto the fairway. After some deliberation, he hit a nine-iron into the heart of the green, and the boisterous crowd immediately surrounded Mickelson who, with the help of officials, had to push his way through to reach the putting surface to put the finishing touches on his historic win. Koepka was disappointed with his putting on Saturday and also missed several close-range attempts on Sunday. He still had an outside chance of taking the tournament to a play-off on the last but had to finish amid the madness surrounding Mickelson. ""It would have been cool if I didn't have a knee injury and got dinged a few times in the knee in that crowd,"" said the four-time major champion who took a couple of extra minutes to make his way through to the green. ""It's cool for Phil. But getting dinged a few times isn't exactly my idea of fun."" Harrington and Lowry both posted rounds of 69 on the final day An eagle at the par-five second and chip-in birdie on the 14th were the highlights of European Ryder Cup captain Harrington's round as he rolled back the years to card a three-under 69 on Sunday and finish at two under par for a share of fourth place. That is the three-time major champion's best finish at a major since winning this event in 2008. The 49-year-old had a terrific time playing with fellow Irishman Lowry and the Open champion also posted a 69 to finish at two under. ""I don't think I have enjoyed a round of golf as much as I have playing with Shane,"" said Harrington. ""It was amazing how relaxed I was from tee to green. When you have your head in the right place it is much easier to play good golf. It was a very nice pairing."" Casey also shared fourth and briefly threatened to put an early run together with back-to-back birdies on two and three, but five birdies overall were offset by four bogeys as he finished four off the lead. Justin Rose failed to break par in the opening three days but posted one of the rounds of the day with a five-under 67 that included eight birdies, a bogey and a double to leave the Englishman one under for the tournament. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy was unable to tame the Ocean Course as he did during his 2012 victory, with the pre-tournament favourite finishing on five over par. Jordan Spieth's wait to complete the career Grand Slam continues after he finished at two over par, one behind Japan's Masters champion Hideki Matsuyama, while US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau faded to three over par with a final-day 77. The US PGA Championship's Covid-19protocols,externalfor fans included ""no handshakes, fist bumps, autographs, photographs or selfies""; for people attending to ""respect their [players'] space and watch your distance"" and ""avoid unnecessary touchpoints and large crowds"". Fans who had not been vaccinated were advised to wear masks when they could not be socially distant. But Mickelson needed a security and police escort to make his way through the jam-packed crowd of spectators to complete his historic moment. ""I've never had that experience and to see that, to feel that kind of excitement and enthusiasm, and be at the forefront of that, was pretty special. That's a moment I'll always, always cherish."" Considering where we are in the world right now, it was sort of weird,"" Mickelson's caddie and brother Tim said about the swarming crowds. ""But it was also pretty darned cool to see."" Thousands of fans swarmed across the 18th fairway as Mickelson marched towards a sixth victory in his 112th major It took a bit of pushing and shoving but Mickelson finally got through with his putter to finish his round Mickelson credited his brother and caddie Tim as one of several people who helped him win on the big stage again The vast majority of the spectators at Kiawah Island were rooting for Mickelson to win on Sunday Jon Rahm was one of several players to congratulate Mickelson after he walked off the 18th green Allow Twitter content?

"Business and government should put the bitter divisions of Brexit behind them and focus on building a fairer, greener economy, according to the Confederation of British Industry. That could drive an extra Â£700bn of economic growth by 2030, the CBI says. The employers' organisation is launching what it says is a ""landmark"" economic plan for the next decade. And its proposals would lead to ""prizes for everyone"", not just for some firms, the CBI's director general believes. ""For the last five years business and government have been at odds. Brexit was very divisive,"" Tony Danker told the BBC. ""But after the events of the last five years, we find ourselves in total alignment about what needs to be done. We need to level up, we need a greener economy and, my God, we should not waste this opportunity."" What is levelling up and how is it going? The CBI's new report, entitled ""Seize the Moment"", focuses on the government's policy agenda of addressing geographic inequalities, decarbonisation and innovation and says 2021 must be a turning point for the UK if it is to address those long term challenges. Among them, levelling up is the one that the government has trumpeted most in recent election campaigns. And those promises to alter the economic map of the UK have resulted in changes to the country's political map. But fulfilling those promises won't come from the wave of some magic wand. Tony Danker says that while big ticket, regional infrastructure investments are a welcome start, they alone are not enough. ""Transport is great, we need it. Broadband is great, we need it. But we need to turn all of that into real jobs and real growth, in skills and wages, if levelling up is going to mean anything to the people of this country,"" he says. The CBI believes it and its members have an important role to play. ""Governments don't create jobs. Governments don't prepare people in the workplace for the skills of the future. Governments don't suddenly invent new decarbonisation technologies. That's what businesses do."" In Hull's Alexandra Dock, a factory run by Siemens Gamesa produces 1,000 offshore wind turbine blades a year. At nearly 100 metres of moulded fibreglass they are high-tech pieces of equipment, and a decarbonising world will need a lot of them in the years to come. The plant has grown rapidly since it opened five years ago, in part thanks to government seed funding, and price guarantees. Manufacturing wind turbines offers hi-tech, green jobs in Humber ""The government is doing a lot right,"" says Carl Ennis, managing director of Siemens UK. ""But it could have gone even better. The blades for some of our wind turbines are made in the UK, but the research and development and the cell (the motor the blades are attached to) are made in Denmark and Germany. ""What has been missing is speed of action and scale of ambition,"" says Mr Ennis. He says Germany is investing 50 times the amount the UK is in new hydrogen technology for example. And if investments like Siemens' are going to benefit Hull, in the form of higher paid jobs for local people, more needs to be done. Hannah Clague, an aerospace engineering graduate employed at the plant, says applications for jobs like hers have doubled since she joined, because ""it's such a sustainable career to go into and a lifelong career"". But Hannah isn't from Hull herself. She's from Reading, a graduate from Sheffield University. And at the moment few locals are in a position to join her, says JJ Tatten, from the Warren Youth Project. Hannah Clague joined Siemens after graduating, but many Hull locals don't have the skills they need for the jobs on offer ""The reality is that the young people we work with are not ready to go into jobs in local tech and green industries,"" he says. ""There's no lack of will, no lack of intelligence, no lack of energy. They just need that first rung of the ladder and that access to skills. ""There is a real danger for the young people we work with here in Hull, that if they can't get the opportunity to develop some of those skills, they won't get the opportunity to take a job in that field or that industry, and the people to fill those vacancies will have to be sourced from outside'. The government's levelling up playbook looks something like this: pick an industry that the UK does - or should - have a natural advantage in, put in some funding, incentives and price guarantees to encourage businesses to invest, get local universities and colleges involved, use regulation to accelerate progress and government procurement to help at the customer end. But on top of that the CBI believes it could be playing a much bigger role in coordinating investment in regional businesses, building regional economic clusters, and determining the direction of skills training. Specific recommendations for government policy in its report include an overhaul of the much criticised Apprenticeship Levy and a requirement that economic regulators prioritise investment and innovation. The CBI said it was ready to play a more proactive role in transforming the economy than previously. It sees this year as a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity to unite and agree to transform the UK economy"". Failure to make bold changes now would result in a return to business as usual, it said, including ""the persistently low productivity and heightened social division that followed the 2008 financial crisis"".

"In Khan Younis, Gaza, people have emerged to take stock of the destruction After the ceasefire, Palestinians in Gaza, who had stayed inside as much as they could while there was a chance of getting killed outside, walked round their neighbourhoods to get a better idea of what Israel had done. People stopped to inspect huge piles of concrete rubble from the tower blocks that Israel had toppled. In some places the streets were blocked by rubble. Bulldozer operators were working overtime. Nothing they found was surprising. What has happened has been covered exhaustively on TV. But human beings like to see for themselves. In Khan Younis, one of Gaza's towns, I went to the funeral of nine fighters who were killed in part of the tunnel network that Israel has targeted. Israeli politicians and commanders have claimed that they have done serious damage to what they describe as an infrastructure of terror, run by Hamas and the smaller factions in Gaza. The damage to buildings is obvious. I have not been able to see underground military installations, but the talk here is that Hamas was shocked that Israel was able to kill its men when they believed they were safe underground. Morale among supporters of the armed groups in Gaza is another matter. It seems intact, even enhanced by the 11-day war. Khan Younis stopped for the funerals. Several thousand men prayed on a sports field and followed the stretchers carrying bodies wrapped in Palestinian flags, chanting their support on the way to the cemetery. Thousands attend a funeral in Khan Younis Israel and Hamas both claimed victory. Israeli leaders listed buildings destroyed, Hamas commanders and fighters targeted and killed, and the remarkable success of the Iron Dome anti-missile system. Hamas defines victory first of all as survival. Its leader in Gaza, Yahya Sinwar, emerged triumphantly from hiding the day after the ceasefire. But Hamas will also look at the political scorecard with some satisfaction. Hamas slogans have been chanted after prayers 60 miles (96km) inland from Gaza, at the Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem. Hamas has driven home a message to Palestinians that it is prepared to fight and accept sacrifices for their rights in Jerusalem. Israel insists that all of Jerusalem is its eternal and indivisible capital. Palestinians have other ideas. The Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is recognised internationally as the representative voice of his people through his leadership of the PLO and the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the occupied territories and was intended in the now moribund Oslo agreements of the 1990s to develop into the government of an independent state. But Palestinians are deeply dissatisfied with the president's performance. He cancelled elections due for May that he looked likely to lose. Palestinians have not been able to vote for a president or a legislature since 2006. In contrast, a simple message from Hamas that it would fight to the death for Jerusalem resonated with Palestinians who despair at the inability of President Abbas to slow down, let alone stop, the steady increase of Jewish settlement, illegal under international law, on occupied land they want for a state. Palestinian supporters of Hamas celebrate after the ceasefire In Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will now return to the battle for political survival he was fighting before the 11 days of conflict with Hamas. Mr Netanyahu is on trial on charges so serious that he could end up in jail for corruption, like his predecessor Ehud Olmert. On 10 May, the day Hamas dramatically escalated the conflict by firing missiles at Jerusalem, the prime minister was close to losing his job. He has been a caretaker since the fourth inconclusive election in two years. In a month of trying, Mr Netanyahu failed to form a coalition that commanded the necessary 61 votes in parliament for a majority. His main opponent, Yair Lapid, was taking his turn and looked to be days, even hours, away from announcing he had the votes to form a government. Mr Lapid's plans fell apart during the fighting. He still has time to rebuild them, though a fifth election might be a more likely outcome. In pictures: The destruction in Gaza and Israel Life in the Gaza Strip WATCH: The children of the Israel-Gaza conflict Israel also has to deal with the collapse of co-existence between its Jewish majority and Palestinian Arab minority, which makes up around 20 per cent of the population. Mr Netanyahu's polarising rhetoric and embrace of extreme Jewish nationalists have made a bad situation worse. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now resumes his fight for political survival Like the previous rounds of fighting between Israel and Hamas, the ceasefire is just a pause. The conflict is not just unresolved. It is not even frozen. The ceasefire will hold until it is tested by a crisis. That could be a rocket fired out of Gaza, or more Israeli police violence towards Palestinians in Jerusalem. Or it could be the lawsuit brought by Jewish settler groups to evict Palestinians from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah, a leafy district on the occupied eastern side of Jerusalem. The prospect of evicted Palestinian families being replaced by more Jewish settlers was a major reason why tension in Jerusalem turned violent. The judgement in the case was postponed in a belated attempt to calm matters. But the case was not dropped, and the judgement will eventually be issued. Israel's legal timetable could deliver the ceasefire's first big challenge.

"This video can not be played DR Congo's Goma volcano: Drone images show devastation Ernestine Kabuo returned home after fleeing the lava flow in Goma, Democratic Republic of Congo, to find that her husband had not survived. The 68 year old was unable to carry her sick husband out of their house and she found him burnt to death, she told Reuters news agency. At least 22 deaths have been confirmed following Saturday's eruption of a nearby volcano, Mount Nyiragongo. But the lava stopped short of the city's built-up area. This avoided the level of death and destruction witnessed in 2002. It did, however, hit the Buhene district, where Ms Kabuo's home was. Africa Live: Latest updates from the continent In pictures: Mount Nyiragongo erupts Watch: 'I monitor Congo's deadliest volcano' ""I said to myself: I can't go alone, we've been married for the best and for the worst,"" she told Reuters reflecting on what happened on Saturday. Ernestine Kabuo was unable to save her husband ""I went back to at least try to get him out but couldn't. I ran away and he got burned inside. I don't know what to do. I curse this day."" Five people died of asphyxiation while trying to cross the lava when it was cooling in a place just north of Goma. A sixth person is in hospital with breathing difficulties, civil society leader Mambo Kawaya told the AFP news agency. Since then, the authorities have tried to prevent people from visiting places where the lava is cooling, Goma journalist Esdras Tsongo told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme. Other Goma residents, a city of 670,000 according to UN estimates, are searching for missing loved ones as the city, and the region, continues to experience earthquakes. More than 170 children are feared to be missing and 150 others had been separated from their families, the UN's children's agency, Unicef, said, adding that centres would be set up to help unaccompanied minors. Please refresh your browser Nine of the deaths so far recorded by the authorities occurred in a traffic accident as people fled. Four others died as they tried to escape a prison while two were burned to death, government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said on Sunday. But there are fears that more deaths may be confirmed as people return to the remains of their houses. The lava stopped in the Buhene district, on the outskirts of Goma, burying hundreds of houses and even large buildings. Reconstruction efforts are likely to take months. ""All the houses in Buhene neighbourhood were burned,"" Innocent Bahala Shamavu told the Associated Press news agency. Local people have been sifting through the remains of flattened houses Elsewhere, lava crossed the N2 road connecting Goma to the city of Beni, severing a key aid and supply route. However, the city's airport was untouched, despite earlier reports that it had been affected. The volcano, located 10km (six miles) from Goma, last erupted in 2002, killing 250 people and making 120,000 homeless. Residents started leaving their houses even before the government announced an evacuation plan. At night, crowds were seen fleeing on foot with mattresses and other belongings. Rwandan authorities said more than 3,000 people had officially crossed from Goma. Some started to return on Sunday. Others went to higher ground to the west of the city. One Goma resident, Richard Bahati, said he was in his house when he heard screaming and became extremely worried as he saw the sky reddening outside. ""I lived through the problem with this volcano in 2002. The volcano devastated all our homes and possessions,"" he said. A local trader, Kambere Ombeni, was among those who returned to the scene as the rubble still smouldered. ""We watched the whole neighbourhood in the Nyiragongo territory go up in smoke. The fire came right down to here. Even now we can still see lava,"" he said. Another resident, Irene Bauma, said people would need help from the government to rebuild their lives. ""There's land, people, a population that has lost everything, maybe there are also deaths, who knows? We are asking the government to come and help the survivors of this eruption."" Tom Peyre-Costa, from the Norwegian Refugee Council in Goma, told the BBC what had happened. ""The lava was pretty slow, like, 1km/h, but it didn't stop.... It started burning the houses,"" he said, adding that humanitarian organisations were already trying to address people's needs. This image captured on Saturday shows how the lava was destroying everything in its path Mount Nyiragongo is one of the world's more active volcanoes but there were concerns that its activity had not been properly observed by the Goma Volcano Observatory, since the World Bank cut funding amid allegations of corruption. Professor Mike Burton, a volcanologist at the University of Manchester in England, told the BBC that the lava in Mount Nyiragongo is particularly fluid and has the potential to move fast. In a report on 10 May, the observatory warned that seismic activity at Nyiragongo had increased. Last year, the observatory's director,Katcho Karume, told the BBC World Service's Science in Action that the volcano's lava lake had been filling up quickly,increasing the chances of an eruption in the next few years. But he also warned that an earthquake could trigger a disaster earlier. The volcano's deadliest eruption happened in 1977, when more than 600 people died.

"This video can not be played Glasgow Covid level may drop if ICU numbers do not rise Covid restrictions in Glasgow could be eased if the number of people in intensive care does not go up, Scotland's health secretary has said. Glasgow is the only part of Scotland still in level three, and some businesses have criticised the decision to keep it under stricter measures. Humza Yousaf said ministers wanted to ease restrictions as soon as possible. He said he hoped after this week it would become clear whether case numbers had led to a rise in ICU patients. Glasgow becomes the only Scottish area in level 3 Speaking toBBC Scotland's Sunday Show, Mr Yousaf said it was a difficult balance to strike and he could understand why people in Glasgow were ""feeling somewhat despondent"" about the situation. On Friday, business bosses said they were stuck in an ""excruciating"" position. Andrew McRae, of the Federation of Small Business Scotland, said there was ""intense"" frustration, and called for the Scottish government to investigate whether a new approach was required for Glasgow. He said: ""If the virus has not been brought under control while Glasgow businesses have facedalmost nine months of restrictions, then surely the problem lies elsewhere."" And Glasgow Chamber of Commerce chief executive Stuart Patrick said businesses had been hit with ""hefty financial losses in staff and perishable food costs"" afterlevel three restrictions were extended. Glasgow will stay in level three for at least until Friday Mr Yousaf insisted ministers felt it was ""absolutely necessary"" to control the so-called Indian variant, which public health experts believe is driving increasing infection rates in the city. ""If we control it now then hopefully we will avoid future lockdowns in the months to come,"" he said. He added that another reason why ministers had decided to keep Glasgow in level three for a further week was because they were trying to understand more about the variant. ""The really critical question is... does the new variant lead to more hospitalisations and more severe disease which then requires admissions into ICU?"" he said. ""If the answer to that which I hope is no, then we can look at what we can do in terms of easing restrictions into the future."" He continued: ""We have seen an increase in the number of hospital admissions. ""What this week will hopefully allow us to do is to see whether we continue to see a rise in hospital cases but also whether that translates into more severe disease which would need admission to ICU."" Glasgow is the only area in Scotland to remain in level three of Scotland's coronavirus restrictions, with the highest coronavirus rates in the country at 126.7 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 19 May. Public health expert, Prof Linda Bauld, said she was starting to see signs in the data that cases were declining in the city. If this trajectory continued, she had optimism the city would in the future go to level two. People aged 18 to 39 who live in postcodes G41, G42, G5, G51 or G52 in the southside of Glasgow are also being offered jabs early to tackle surging cases. Mobile testing units have been set up in some parts of Glasgow Mr Yousaf said there was the possibility to increase the number of injections given daily - particularly administering second doses amongst those priority groups. He said: ""Although we are doing extremely well with the vaccine rollout I think there is room to increase the number of vaccines that we are administering per day and per week."" He added that rolling out the vaccine to more people in Covid hotspots should not mean people in other parts of the country having to wait longer. Breakdowns of vaccinations by area showed ""no slowing down"", and a recent call on social media for those in Glasgow to come forward for vaccination due to additional supplies had been successful, and said he thought being more ""pro-active"" was a good idea. Mr Yousaf also pointed to the news that the Pfizer and AstraZeneca coronavirusvaccines were highly effective against the variant identified in Indiaafter two doses. Opposition politicians have previously criticised the Scottish government for its handling of the pandemic. On Friday Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross said a ""more targeted approach"" was needed, and that resources should be diverted to areas where the virus was spreading. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for ""a mass rollout of PCR testing and rapidly accessible vaccinations so that we can bring the case load down and have a consistency across the country."" East Renfrewshire is in level two this week, allowing hospitality venues to serve alcohol inside until 22:30 Mr Yousaf also spoke about East Renfrewshire, which has the second highest rate in the country. With 108.9 cases per 100,000 in the week to 19 May, it is well in excess of the target of 50 cases for level two set by the Scottish government. However, the health secretary said there was not significant community transmission of the new variant as seen in the outbreak on Glasgow's southside. ""That is really key, as the public health officials tell us they can contain those relatively small number of cases within those domestic settings,"" he said. He said another factor was that the number of cases was also relatively small, and could be contained with appropriate health measures - including enhanced testing, contact tracing and maximising the vaccine rollout. Figures published on Sunday showed that Scotland had recorded 378 new cases of coronavirus  - 212 in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area - but no further deaths in the previous 24 hours. It means the death toll under this daily measure - of people who first tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days - remains at 7,664. However, registration offices are generally closed at weekends. Figures published by the Scottish government on Sunday showed the daily test positivity rate was 2%, up from 1.8% the previous day. So far, 3,108,819 people have received a first dose of the Covid vaccination and 1,828,930 have received their second dose. Under level three restrictions, groups of six people from two households can meet in cafÃ©s, pubs and restaurants. However, alcohol can only be served outdoors. And six people from six households can meet outside. But, you cannot visit people in their homes. Under level two restrictions, which East Renfrewshire is currently in, pubs and restaurants are allowed to serve alcohol inside until 22:30, and limited numbers of people can socialise indoors. Social distancing during meetings indoors or in private gardens is no longer required in levels one and two. Cinemas, theatres, concert halls, music venues, comedy clubs and bingo halls can reopen with restrictions. RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Farmer Garry Williams says he would be willing to wear a bodycam to fight rural crime Farmers across Wales are turning to technology to fight rural crime - including wearing bodycams. A recent survey by NFU Cymru found that 31% of farmers had invested at least Â£1,000 in crime prevention measures in the last five years. In north Wales, police are working with the farming community to launch Future Farms Cymru, a scheme using technology to tackle thefts on farms. Farmers will use social media, CCTV and bodycams to protect their property. Tractors and animals taken as rural crime cost up Crime makes farmers 'feel like sitting ducks' Don't forget rural communities, farmer pleads Organised gangs cause spike in cost of rural crime In Carmarthenshire, farmer Garry Williams uses a WhatsApp group to keep local farmers informed of any suspicious activity in the area. ""On this farm we've had ladders, tools, strimmers etc stolen and as a result we've put up CCTV cameras and have a lock-up to keep our tools safe,"" he said. ""At the moment, I think the two biggest issues in this area are quad theft and sheep theft."" After getting fed up with being targets for criminals, including thieves and scammers, Mr Williams and his fellow farmers are prepared to embrace modern methods to protect their traditional way of life. This video can not be played 'They've stolen a land rover, diesel, roof slates' ""Rural crime is a worry for all farmers but I'm especially concerned about elderly farmers in our community who are more vulnerable to these crimes and being conned by fraudsters,"" said Mr Williams. ""My advice to all farmers is to remain vigilant and to take any measures possible to improve on-farm security to deter these criminals. ""I'd need to know more about them but I can imagine if you were to notice something suspicious at night, having a body camera may give an added layer of security."" NFU Cymru president John Davies said rural crime continued to wreak havoc on farms across Wales, ""causing not only financial but emotional pressures on farming families"". Tech could soon be mixed with tractors on Welsh farms ""Farmers are using preventative measures to deter criminals and secure their machinery, tools and stock,"" he said. ""These measures include upgrading building security and routinely removing equipment from vehicles overnight with some even installing CCTV on farms and blocking field entrances. ""Farmers are trying various tactics to prevent crime on their farm and so some may well be interested in these new technologies being trialled in north Wales, if effective and cost-efficient.""

Today's writers were Victoria Lindrea, Jen Meierhans, and Lauren Turner, and the editor was Owen Amos. People waiting for their vaccine in Blackburn, Lancashire Thanks for joining us this Sunday, wherever you are in the world, as we've brought you the latest news on coronavirus. Here are some of the main headlines from today:  This new graphic, updated with today's 4pm data, gives an overview of the virus situation in the UK. About 72% of adults in the UK have now had a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, new figures show - and 43% have had both doses. The government said data showed the vaccines had saved more than 13,000 lives in England by 9 May and prevented 39,100 people having to go to hospital. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the vaccination programme is ""another great British success story and a testament to what can be achieved when all four corners of the country comes together to defeat this virus"". He urged people who have not yet taken up their offer of a jab to do so, adding: ""It could save your life and protect your loved ones."" The NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens called the vaccination programme ""undoubtedly one of the
greatest achievements in health service history"". The gap between first and second doses has been reduced from 12 weeks to 8 weeks for those in the top nine priority groups following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, in order to help tackle the new variants of concern. Some 762,361 vaccines were delivered in the UK yesterday - 556,951 were second doses, and 205,410 were first doses. According to thegovernment's virus dashboard,external, that isn't quite a record breaking day - that was Saturday 20 March, when 844,285 were delivered. No other days have topped 700,000. Saturday 24 April was next closest, with 696,403 jabs delivered. The programme is ""getting us back to the things we love"", the PM writes on Twitter... Allow Twitter content?

It wasn't just the team's bus that Liverpool fans were looking out for at Anfield today - but a mobile vaccination bus too, which parked in a stadium car park. The bus has been touring the city, providing first vaccine doses for those eligible, with no appointment needed. It is part of a plan to help improve vaccine access in areas of the city where take-up has been lower. Liverpool are playing Crystal Palace this afternoon in their final match of the season. The figures just released in the UK also show that in the past seven days, a total of 17,719 people have tested positive for coronavirus. That's up by 1,801 - or 11.3% - from the previous week. Since testing began, there have now been 4,462,538 cases of the virus. There have also been 42 deaths in the past seven days - that's down by 32, or 43%, on the previous seven-day period. The total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test stands at 127,721, with the latest figures showing that 151,904 people who died have had coronavirus mentioned on their death certificate.   There have been five more deaths reported in the UK of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within the previous 28 days. The government figures also showed there had been 2,235 more positive cases. We were expecting the UK-wide vaccine data at 4pm - but Health Secretary Matt Hancock has just broken the news on Twitter. More than 762,000 jabs were delivered yesterday - a mixture of first and second doses. That means more than 60m jabs have been delivered across the UK in total. Allow Twitter content?

Nearly 700,000 vaccines, both first and second doses, were administered in England on Saturday, according to public health data. NHS England said 178,251 first jabs were given on Saturday as well as 508,013 second doses. Second jabs for the over-50s, and clinically vulnerable, are now being delivered within eight weeks of the first, amid concerns over the Indian variant. From Saturday, people in England aged 32 and 33 are now being invited to book their first dose. The other UK nations are already offering jabs to younger age groups - people aged 30 and over are eligible in Scotland, as are over-18s in Wales and over-25s in Northern Ireland. Government data covering vaccines, case numbers and deaths across the UK over the past 24 hours will be published shortly.  Dr Fauci (centre) turned up to wish runners well in Washington DC In the UK, keen runners have towait a bit longer for the resumption of Parkrun- the weekly, free 5km event. But in the US, there has been a partial resumption, with the first runs taking place this weekend. At Fletcher's Cove Parkrun in Washington DC, the occasion was marked with a visit from Prof Anthony Fauci - the top Covid adviser in the US. Event director Dan Owen had invited him after bumping into him on a walk the week before. Runners were spread out for the start of the run About 90 runners attended the run on Saturday. New protocols in place included people being asked to wear masks before and after the run, as well as runners being spread out along the path rather than all starting from the same place in a cluster. Mr Owen said Prof Fauci did not take part - but wished the runners well and was ""fully supportive"" of the resumption with the safety measures in place. Former prime minister Gordon Brown has urged current PM Boris Johnson to use next month's G7 summit in Cornwall to step up funding of the global Covid vaccine rollout. In an interview for BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Mr Brown said rich countries' pledges so far would not meet the needs of this year and next year. So what is the UK doing to help vaccinate the world?  Covid restrictions inGlasgow could be easedif the number of people in intensive care does not go up, Scotland's health secretary has said. Glasgow is currently the only part of Scotland still under level three restrictions - the strictest measures in the country at present.

Under level three restrictions, businesses can only serve alcohol outdoors and people can't meet others in their homes. With level two, limited numbers can socialise indoors and pubs, bars and restaurants can serve drinks inside until 22:30.  This video can not be played Germany's new, tighter rules on UK arrivals came into force today - after the UK was designated as avirus variant area of concern. The German public health institute says the decision is related to the Indian Covid-19 variant, which is responsible for the majority of new cases in parts of England and is believed to spread more quickly. The UK government still strongly advises against non-essential travel to most other EU countries, including Germany and Spain, which are on the amber list. Germany's new restrictions,externalmean that you may only enter the country from the UK if you are a German citizen, a resident or their spouse/partner/child under 18 - or if you can invoke an urgent humanitarian reason such as an immediate family bereavement. Travel from the UK is subject to pre-departure digital registration and 14-day quarantine with no exemptions and no possibility for early test and release.

Germany's Health Minister Jens Spahn has said he expects spectators to be able to return to football matches in Germany when the top division resumes in August. Coronavirus cases have been falling steadily over the last month, with Mr Spahn saying on Friday that Germany's third wave was in retreat. On Sunday, he toldBild am Sonntag that,externalopen air concerts looked likely to return over the summer ""with tests and social distancing"". And, on Bundesliga football matches, he added: ""If the incidence continues to fall, I am sure that fans will be allowed back into the stadium in August."" He also said he expected there would be European approval for the Pfizer vaccine to be given to 12-16 year-olds - with rollout forecast for the end of August. But he cautioned: ""For a carefree summer, we need to reduce the incidence further."" France is not ruling out ""slightly tougher"" health measures for travellers from Britain, the French foreign affairs minister says, citing the spread in the UK of the coronavirus variant first found in India. ""We worry about the Indian variant and we remain on high alert regarding that matter, in cooperation with British authorities,"" Jean-Yves Le Drian told RTL radio. Most travellers from the UK are now banned from entering Germany, because of fears of the Indian variant. There are exceptions for German citizens and residents - but even they require two weeks' quarantine. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News Herd immunity is a term used to mean
that most people are immune to a particular disease. This means the
disease is much less likely to spread from person to person, so those who are
not immune are at reduced risk of illness. The more infectious a disease is, the
greater the number of people that need to be immune in order to reach the
threshold where the unprotected are safe. There are two ways of achieving herd
immunity: the first is through the natural progression of the disease, which will
cause illness and death as people become infected. The second is through
vaccination. The head of the UK Health Security Agency and test and Trace boss, Dr Jenny Harries, said
this morning that around 70% of the population were now immune - mostly as a
result of the vaccination programme but also as a result of infection. But early on in the pandemic, the
governmentâs chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, created alarm when
he talked about herd immunity building up through the natural progression of
the disease. ""Our aim,"" he said, ""is to try
and reduce the peak - not suppress it completely, also because most people get
a mild illness, to build up some degree of herd immunity whilst protecting the
most vulnerable."" Some interpreted his words as suggesting that
it was government policy to create herd immunity by allowing the disease to
spread - which is why it had not ordered a lockdown, despite
increasing calls from many experts. He later clarified his comments, saying that
herd immunity was a natural consequence of the disease spreading - and that it was not
the policy to allow Covid-19 to spread. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,7.1291547e-06

East Renfrewshire is in level two this week, allowing hospitality venues to serve alcohol inside until 22:30 Mr Yousaf also spoke about East Renfrewshire, which has the second highest rate in the country. With 108.9 cases per 100,000 in the week to 19 May, it is well in excess of the target of 50 cases for level two set by the Scottish government. However, the health secretary said there was not significant community transmission of the new variant as seen in the outbreak on Glasgow's southside. ""That is really key, as the public health officials tell us they can contain those relatively small number of cases within those domestic settings,"" he said. He said another factor was that the number of cases was also relatively small, and could be contained with appropriate health measures - including enhanced testing, contact tracing and maximising the vaccine rollout. Figures published on Sunday showed that Scotland had recorded 378 new cases of coronavirus  - 212 in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area - but no further deaths in the previous 24 hours. It means the death toll under this daily measure - of people who first tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days - remains at 7,664. However, registration offices are generally closed at weekends. Figures published by the Scottish government on Sunday showed the daily test positivity rate was 2%, up from 1.8% the previous day. So far, 3,108,819 people have received a first dose of the Covid vaccination and 1,828,930 have received their second dose. Under level three restrictions, groups of six people from two households can meet in cafÃ©s, pubs and restaurants. However, alcohol can only be served outdoors. And six people from six households can meet outside. But, you cannot visit people in their homes. Under level two restrictions, which East Renfrewshire is currently in, pubs and restaurants are allowed to serve alcohol inside until 22:30, and limited numbers of people can socialise indoors. Social distancing during meetings indoors or in private gardens is no longer required in levels one and two.

"This video can not be played Glasgow Covid level may drop if ICU numbers do not rise Covid restrictions in Glasgow could be eased if the number of people in intensive care does not go up, Scotland's health secretary has said. Glasgow is the only part of Scotland still in level three, and some businesses have criticised the decision to keep it under stricter measures. Humza Yousaf said ministers wanted to ease restrictions as soon as possible. He said he hoped after this week it would become clear whether case numbers had led to a rise in ICU patients. Glasgow becomes the only Scottish area in level 3 Speaking toBBC Scotland's Sunday Show, Mr Yousaf said it was a difficult balance to strike and he could understand why people in Glasgow were ""feeling somewhat despondent"" about the situation. On Friday, business bosses said they were stuck in an ""excruciating"" position. Andrew McRae, of the Federation of Small Business Scotland, said there was ""intense"" frustration, and called for the Scottish government to investigate whether a new approach was required for Glasgow. He said: ""If the virus has not been brought under control while Glasgow businesses have facedalmost nine months of restrictions, then surely the problem lies elsewhere."" And Glasgow Chamber of Commerce chief executive Stuart Patrick said businesses had been hit with ""hefty financial losses in staff and perishable food costs"" afterlevel three restrictions were extended. Glasgow will stay in level three for at least until Friday Mr Yousaf insisted ministers felt it was ""absolutely necessary"" to control the so-called Indian variant, which public health experts believe is driving increasing infection rates in the city. ""If we control it now then hopefully we will avoid future lockdowns in the months to come,"" he said. He added that another reason why ministers had decided to keep Glasgow in level three for a further week was because they were trying to understand more about the variant. ""The really critical question is... does the new variant lead to more hospitalisations and more severe disease which then requires admissions into ICU?"" he said. ""If the answer to that which I hope is no, then we can look at what we can do in terms of easing restrictions into the future."" He continued: ""We have seen an increase in the number of hospital admissions. ""What this week will hopefully allow us to do is to see whether we continue to see a rise in hospital cases but also whether that translates into more severe disease which would need admission to ICU."" Glasgow is the only area in Scotland to remain in level three of Scotland's coronavirus restrictions, with the highest coronavirus rates in the country at 126.7 per 100,000 people in the seven days to 19 May. Public health expert, Prof Linda Bauld, said she was starting to see signs in the data that cases were declining in the city. If this trajectory continued, she had optimism the city would in the future go to level two. People aged 18 to 39 who live in postcodes G41, G42, G5, G51 or G52 in the southside of Glasgow are also being offered jabs early to tackle surging cases. Mobile testing units have been set up in some parts of Glasgow Mr Yousaf said there was the possibility to increase the number of injections given daily - particularly administering second doses amongst those priority groups. He said: ""Although we are doing extremely well with the vaccine rollout I think there is room to increase the number of vaccines that we are administering per day and per week."" He added that rolling out the vaccine to more people in Covid hotspots should not mean people in other parts of the country having to wait longer. Breakdowns of vaccinations by area showed ""no slowing down"", and a recent call on social media for those in Glasgow to come forward for vaccination due to additional supplies had been successful, and said he thought being more ""pro-active"" was a good idea. Mr Yousaf also pointed to the news that the Pfizer and AstraZeneca coronavirusvaccines were highly effective against the variant identified in Indiaafter two doses.

"Farmer Garry Williams says he would be willing to wear a bodycam to fight rural crime Farmers across Wales are turning to technology to fight rural crime - including wearing bodycams. A recent survey by NFU Cymru found that 31% of farmers had invested at least Â£1,000 in crime prevention measures in the last five years. In north Wales, police are working with the farming community to launch Future Farms Cymru, a scheme using technology to tackle thefts on farms. Farmers will use social media, CCTV and bodycams to protect their property. Tractors and animals taken as rural crime cost up Crime makes farmers 'feel like sitting ducks' Don't forget rural communities, farmer pleads Organised gangs cause spike in cost of rural crime In Carmarthenshire, farmer Garry Williams uses a WhatsApp group to keep local farmers informed of any suspicious activity in the area. ""On this farm we've had ladders, tools, strimmers etc stolen and as a result we've put up CCTV cameras and have a lock-up to keep our tools safe,"" he said. ""At the moment, I think the two biggest issues in this area are quad theft and sheep theft."" After getting fed up with being targets for criminals, including thieves and scammers, Mr Williams and his fellow farmers are prepared to embrace modern methods to protect their traditional way of life. This video can not be played 'They've stolen a land rover, diesel, roof slates' ""Rural crime is a worry for all farmers but I'm especially concerned about elderly farmers in our community who are more vulnerable to these crimes and being conned by fraudsters,"" said Mr Williams. ""My advice to all farmers is to remain vigilant and to take any measures possible to improve on-farm security to deter these criminals. ""I'd need to know more about them but I can imagine if you were to notice something suspicious at night, having a body camera may give an added layer of security."" NFU Cymru president John Davies said rural crime continued to wreak havoc on farms across Wales, ""causing not only financial but emotional pressures on farming families"". Tech could soon be mixed with tractors on Welsh farms ""Farmers are using preventative measures to deter criminals and secure their machinery, tools and stock,"" he said. ""These measures include upgrading building security and routinely removing equipment from vehicles overnight with some even installing CCTV on farms and blocking field entrances. ""Farmers are trying various tactics to prevent crime on their farm and so some may well be interested in these new technologies being trialled in north Wales, if effective and cost-efficient.""

"The UK has now delivered more than 60m vaccines, with 762,000 jabs given on Saturday It's the second-highest total of jabs given in one day in the UK The UK has also reported five more Covid deaths, and 2,235 more cases Dr Jenny Harries tells the BBC the ""straightforward message"" is ""get a second dose"" She was speaking after data showed two doses of Pfizer and AZ vaccines are effective against the Indian variant But both vaccines are only 33% effective against the Indian variant three weeks after the first dose Health Secretary Matt Hancock says he's ""increasingly confident"" restrictions in England can end on 21 June But Home Secretary Priti Patel warns it is not ""green light all the way"" Former adviser Dominic Cummings repeats claim that government's original plan was ""herd immunity"" But that is denied by Priti Patel - who says it was ""absolutely not"" the policy France is considering tougher measures for UK travellers, due to the Indian variant Edited by Owen Amos That's the end of our rolling coverage today - we'll be back on Monday morning in the UK. Today's writers were Victoria Lindrea, Jen Meierhans, and Lauren Turner, and the editor was Owen Amos. People waiting for their vaccine in Blackburn, Lancashire Thanks for joining us this Sunday, wherever you are in the world, as we've brought you the latest news on coronavirus. Here are some of the main headlines from today:  This new graphic, updated with today's 4pm data, gives an overview of the virus situation in the UK. About 72% of adults in the UK have now had a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, new figures show - and 43% have had both doses. The government said data showed the vaccines had saved more than 13,000 lives in England by 9 May and prevented 39,100 people having to go to hospital. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the vaccination programme is ""another great British success story and a testament to what can be achieved when all four corners of the country comes together to defeat this virus"". He urged people who have not yet taken up their offer of a jab to do so, adding: ""It could save your life and protect your loved ones."" The NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens called the vaccination programme ""undoubtedly one of the
greatest achievements in health service history"". The gap between first and second doses has been reduced from 12 weeks to 8 weeks for those in the top nine priority groups following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, in order to help tackle the new variants of concern. Some 762,361 vaccines were delivered in the UK yesterday - 556,951 were second doses, and 205,410 were first doses. According to thegovernment's virus dashboard,external, that isn't quite a record breaking day - that was Saturday 20 March, when 844,285 were delivered. No other days have topped 700,000. Saturday 24 April was next closest, with 696,403 jabs delivered. The programme is ""getting us back to the things we love"", the PM writes on Twitter... Allow Twitter content?

It wasn't just the team's bus that Liverpool fans were looking out for at Anfield today - but a mobile vaccination bus too, which parked in a stadium car park. The bus has been touring the city, providing first vaccine doses for those eligible, with no appointment needed. It is part of a plan to help improve vaccine access in areas of the city where take-up has been lower. Liverpool are playing Crystal Palace this afternoon in their final match of the season. The figures just released in the UK also show that in the past seven days, a total of 17,719 people have tested positive for coronavirus. That's up by 1,801 - or 11.3% - from the previous week. Since testing began, there have now been 4,462,538 cases of the virus. There have also been 42 deaths in the past seven days - that's down by 32, or 43%, on the previous seven-day period. The total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test stands at 127,721, with the latest figures showing that 151,904 people who died have had coronavirus mentioned on their death certificate.   There have been five more deaths reported in the UK of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within the previous 28 days. The government figures also showed there had been 2,235 more positive cases. We were expecting the UK-wide vaccine data at 4pm - but Health Secretary Matt Hancock has just broken the news on Twitter. More than 762,000 jabs were delivered yesterday - a mixture of first and second doses. That means more than 60m jabs have been delivered across the UK in total. Allow Twitter content?

The PM has thanked all those involved in a study that showed the Pfizer and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines to be ""highly effective"" against the variant identified in India after two doses. The research, by Public Health England, also showed both vaccines were only 33% effective against the Indian variant three weeks after the first dose - prompting the PM to urge people to take both doses.

Nearly 700,000 vaccines, both first and second doses, were administered in England on Saturday, according to public health data. NHS England said 178,251 first jabs were given on Saturday as well as 508,013 second doses. Second jabs for the over-50s, and clinically vulnerable, are now being delivered within eight weeks of the first, amid concerns over the Indian variant. From Saturday, people in England aged 32 and 33 are now being invited to book their first dose. The other UK nations are already offering jabs to younger age groups - people aged 30 and over are eligible in Scotland, as are over-18s in Wales and over-25s in Northern Ireland. Government data covering vaccines, case numbers and deaths across the UK over the past 24 hours will be published shortly.  Dr Fauci (centre) turned up to wish runners well in Washington DC In the UK, keen runners have towait a bit longer for the resumption of Parkrun- the weekly, free 5km event. But in the US, there has been a partial resumption, with the first runs taking place this weekend. At Fletcher's Cove Parkrun in Washington DC, the occasion was marked with a visit from Prof Anthony Fauci - the top Covid adviser in the US. Event director Dan Owen had invited him after bumping into him on a walk the week before. Runners were spread out for the start of the run About 90 runners attended the run on Saturday. New protocols in place included people being asked to wear masks before and after the run, as well as runners being spread out along the path rather than all starting from the same place in a cluster. Mr Owen said Prof Fauci did not take part - but wished the runners well and was ""fully supportive"" of the resumption with the safety measures in place. Former prime minister Gordon Brown has urged current PM Boris Johnson to use next month's G7 summit in Cornwall to step up funding of the global Covid vaccine rollout. In an interview for BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Mr Brown said rich countries' pledges so far would not meet the needs of this year and next year. So what is the UK doing to help vaccinate the world?  Covid restrictions inGlasgow could be easedif the number of people in intensive care does not go up, Scotland's health secretary has said. Glasgow is currently the only part of Scotland still under level three restrictions - the strictest measures in the country at present. Some businesses have criticised the decision to keep it in level three. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said ministers wanted to ease restrictions as soon as possible. He told BBC Scotland's Sunday Show there was a difficult balance to strike and he could understand why those in Glasgow were ""feeling somewhat despondent"". He said he hoped after this week it would become clear whether case numbers had led to a rise in ICU patients. Glasgow Chamber of Commerce chief executive Stuart Patrick said businesses had been hit with ""hefty financial losses in staff and perishable food costs"" afterlevel three restrictions were extendedin the city. Under level three restrictions, businesses can only serve alcohol outdoors and people can't meet others in their homes.

Germany's Health Minister Jens Spahn has said he expects spectators to be able to return to football matches in Germany when the top division resumes in August. Coronavirus cases have been falling steadily over the last month, with Mr Spahn saying on Friday that Germany's third wave was in retreat. On Sunday, he toldBild am Sonntag that,externalopen air concerts looked likely to return over the summer ""with tests and social distancing"". And, on Bundesliga football matches, he added: ""If the incidence continues to fall, I am sure that fans will be allowed back into the stadium in August."" He also said he expected there would be European approval for the Pfizer vaccine to be given to 12-16 year-olds - with rollout forecast for the end of August. But he cautioned: ""For a carefree summer, we need to reduce the incidence further."" France is not ruling out ""slightly tougher"" health measures for travellers from Britain, the French foreign affairs minister says, citing the spread in the UK of the coronavirus variant first found in India. ""We worry about the Indian variant and we remain on high alert regarding that matter, in cooperation with British authorities,"" Jean-Yves Le Drian told RTL radio. Most travellers from the UK are now banned from entering Germany, because of fears of the Indian variant. There are exceptions for German citizens and residents - but even they require two weeks' quarantine. Pallab GhoshScience correspondent, BBC News Herd immunity is a term used to mean
that most people are immune to a particular disease. This means the
disease is much less likely to spread from person to person, so those who are
not immune are at reduced risk of illness. The more infectious a disease is, the
greater the number of people that need to be immune in order to reach the
threshold where the unprotected are safe. There are two ways of achieving herd
immunity: the first is through the natural progression of the disease, which will
cause illness and death as people become infected. The second is through
vaccination. The head of the UK Health Security Agency and test and Trace boss, Dr Jenny Harries, said
this morning that around 70% of the population were now immune - mostly as a
result of the vaccination programme but also as a result of infection. But early on in the pandemic, the
governmentâs chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, created alarm when
he talked about herd immunity building up through the natural progression of
the disease. ""Our aim,"" he said, ""is to try
and reduce the peak - not suppress it completely, also because most people get
a mild illness, to build up some degree of herd immunity whilst protecting the
most vulnerable."" Some interpreted his words as suggesting that
it was government policy to create herd immunity by allowing the disease to
spread - which is why it had not ordered a lockdown, despite
increasing calls from many experts. He later clarified his comments, saying that
herd immunity was a natural consequence of the disease spreading - and that it was not
the policy to allow Covid-19 to spread. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.2849929e-05

The government said data showed the vaccines had saved more than 13,000 lives in England by 9 May and prevented 39,100 people having to go to hospital. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the vaccination programme is ""another great British success story and a testament to what can be achieved when all four corners of the country comes together to defeat this virus"". He urged people who have not yet taken up their offer of a jab to do so, adding: ""It could save your life and protect your loved ones."" The NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens called the vaccination programme ""undoubtedly one of the
greatest achievements in health service history"". The gap between first and second doses has been reduced from 12 weeks to 8 weeks for those in the top nine priority groups following advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, in order to help tackle the new variants of concern. Some 762,361 vaccines were delivered in the UK yesterday - 556,951 were second doses, and 205,410 were first doses.

It wasn't just the team's bus that Liverpool fans were looking out for at Anfield today - but a mobile vaccination bus too, which parked in a stadium car park. The bus has been touring the city, providing first vaccine doses for those eligible, with no appointment needed. It is part of a plan to help improve vaccine access in areas of the city where take-up has been lower. Liverpool are playing Crystal Palace this afternoon in their final match of the season. The figures just released in the UK also show that in the past seven days, a total of 17,719 people have tested positive for coronavirus. That's up by 1,801 - or 11.3% - from the previous week. Since testing began, there have now been 4,462,538 cases of the virus. There have also been 42 deaths in the past seven days - that's down by 32, or 43%, on the previous seven-day period. The total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive test stands at 127,721, with the latest figures showing that 151,904 people who died have had coronavirus mentioned on their death certificate.   There have been five more deaths reported in the UK of people who had tested positive for coronavirus within the previous 28 days. The government figures also showed there had been 2,235 more positive cases. We were expecting the UK-wide vaccine data at 4pm - but Health Secretary Matt Hancock has just broken the news on Twitter. More than 762,000 jabs were delivered yesterday - a mixture of first and second doses. That means more than 60m jabs have been delivered across the UK in total. Allow Twitter content?

The PM has thanked all those involved in a study that showed the Pfizer and AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccines to be ""highly effective"" against the variant identified in India after two doses. The research, by Public Health England, also showed both vaccines were only 33% effective against the Indian variant three weeks after the first dose - prompting the PM to urge people to take both doses.

Nearly 700,000 vaccines, both first and second doses, were administered in England on Saturday, according to public health data. NHS England said 178,251 first jabs were given on Saturday as well as 508,013 second doses. Second jabs for the over-50s, and clinically vulnerable, are now being delivered within eight weeks of the first, amid concerns over the Indian variant.

The other UK nations are already offering jabs to younger age groups - people aged 30 and over are eligible in Scotland, as are over-18s in Wales and over-25s in Northern Ireland. Government data covering vaccines, case numbers and deaths across the UK over the past 24 hours will be published shortly.  Dr Fauci (centre) turned up to wish runners well in Washington DC In the UK, keen runners have towait a bit longer for the resumption of Parkrun- the weekly, free 5km event. But in the US, there has been a partial resumption, with the first runs taking place this weekend. At Fletcher's Cove Parkrun in Washington DC, the occasion was marked with a visit from Prof Anthony Fauci - the top Covid adviser in the US. Event director Dan Owen had invited him after bumping into him on a walk the week before. Runners were spread out for the start of the run About 90 runners attended the run on Saturday. New protocols in place included people being asked to wear masks before and after the run, as well as runners being spread out along the path rather than all starting from the same place in a cluster. Mr Owen said Prof Fauci did not take part - but wished the runners well and was ""fully supportive"" of the resumption with the safety measures in place. Former prime minister Gordon Brown has urged current PM Boris Johnson to use next month's G7 summit in Cornwall to step up funding of the global Covid vaccine rollout. In an interview for BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Mr Brown said rich countries' pledges so far would not meet the needs of this year and next year. So what is the UK doing to help vaccinate the world?  Covid restrictions inGlasgow could be easedif the number of people in intensive care does not go up, Scotland's health secretary has said. Glasgow is currently the only part of Scotland still under level three restrictions - the strictest measures in the country at present. Some businesses have criticised the decision to keep it in level three. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said ministers wanted to ease restrictions as soon as possible. He told BBC Scotland's Sunday Show there was a difficult balance to strike and he could understand why those in Glasgow were ""feeling somewhat despondent"". He said he hoped after this week it would become clear whether case numbers had led to a rise in ICU patients. Glasgow Chamber of Commerce chief executive Stuart Patrick said businesses had been hit with ""hefty financial losses in staff and perishable food costs"" afterlevel three restrictions were extendedin the city. Under level three restrictions, businesses can only serve alcohol outdoors and people can't meet others in their homes. With level two, limited numbers can socialise indoors and pubs, bars and restaurants can serve drinks inside until 22:30.
