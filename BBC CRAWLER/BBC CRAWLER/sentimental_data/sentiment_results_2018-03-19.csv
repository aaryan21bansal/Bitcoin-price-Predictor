"This video can not be played David Davis: Transition is about beginning life outside EU The UK and EU have agreed on a ""large part"" of the agreement that will lead to the ""orderly withdrawal"" of the UK. Negotiators Michel Barnier and David Davis saidthe deal on what the UK calls the implementation period,externalwas a ""decisive step"" in the Brexit process. But issues still to be resolved include the Northern Ireland border. And Scotland's fishing industry has reacted angrily to the deal, which will see the UK ""consulted"" on quotas and access to its waters until 2021. Brexit Secretary Mr Davis said Monday's transition agreement, which is conditional on both sides agreeing a final withdrawal treaty, would smooth the path to a future permanent relationship. Laura Kuenssberg: Done deal but work ahead EU fishing deal 'far from acceptable' Brexit: All you need to know Mr Barnier said the legal text marked a ""decisive step"" but added that it was ""not the end of the road"". The key aspects of the agreement announced in Brussels are: The transitional period will last from Brexit day on 29 March 2019 to 31 December 2020 EU citizens arriving in the UK between these two dates will enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive before Brexit. The same will apply to UK expats on the continent The UK will be able to negotiate, sign and ratify its own trade deals during the transition period The UK will still be party to existing EU trade deals with other countries The UK's share of fishing catch will be guaranteed during transition but UK will effectively remain part of the Common Fisheries Policy, yet without a direct say in its rules, until the end of 2020 Northern Ireland will effectively stay in parts of the single market and the customs union in the absence of other solutions to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland The EU says this so-called ""backstop option"" for Northern Ireland was a key part of December's phase one agreement with the UK and must continue to apply ""unless and until another solution is found"". Theresa May has suggested this outcome - which is favoured by Dublin - would be unacceptable as it would effectively shift the existing land border to the Irish Sea and compromise UK sovereignty. In a letter to the European Council President Donald Tusk, the prime minister said ""more work"" was needed on certain commitments included in December's agreement and she continued to believe safeguards for Ireland could be agreed as part of the overall future economic and security partnership. Conservative MPs have expressed disappointment at the outline fishing deal Should this not prove possible, she said she was committed to discussing ""additional specific solutions"" in parallel with the existing legal process for the UK's withdrawal. Both the UK and the EU hope the terms of an agreement on the transitional period can be signed off by Mrs May's fellow 27 leaders at the EU summit this week. The UK has said it had secured a number of improvements to the text, including an explicit reference to Gibraltar being covered by the agreement and the creation of a joint committee to oversee the process. ""We must seize the moment and carry on the momentum of the last few weeks,"" Mr Davis said. ""The deal today should give us confidence that a good deal for the UK and EU is closer than ever before."" No Brexit agreement on Irish border 'Extend transition' call divides MPs What is the Brexit 'transition' phase? Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said the agreement was ""a step in the right direction"" but Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the agreement for fishing during the implementation period was ""shaping up to be a massive sell-out of the Scottish fishing industry by the Tories"". She added: ""The promises that were made to them during #EUref and since are already being broken - as many of us warned they would be."" Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said the agreement fell ""far short of an acceptable deal"" giving the UK full control of its waters from the moment it leaves. ""We will leave the EU and leave the Common Fisheries Policy, but hand back sovereignty over our seas a few seconds later,"" he said. ""Our fishing communities' fortunes will still be subject to the whim and largesse of the EU for another two years."" Downing Street said that because fishing quotas are worked out on an annual basis, for the period from 2020 onwards, the UK would be ""negotiating fishing opportunities as an independent coastal state deciding who can access our waters and on what terms"".

Monday's document clearly states the European Court of Justice will have ""jurisdiction"" over matters relating to EU law and EU citizens during the transition - once regarded as a ""red line"" by many Brexit-supporting MPs. As well as questions about Northern Ireland, there are unresolved issues about what role, if any, the ECJ will have after the transition and other governance issues. The UK and EU hope that if a transition deal is agreed, then negotiations can focus on what sort of permanent future relationship the two sides will have - with the aim of a deal being agreed in the autumn to allow time for EU member states and the UK Parliament to ratify it before Brexit next March.

"This video can not be played Alexander Nix, CEO of Cambridge Analytica was filmed by undercover reporters for Channel 4 News The UK's Information Commissioner is to apply to court for a warrant to search the offices of London-based political consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica. The company is accused of using the personal data of 50 million Facebook members to influence the US presidential election in 2016. Its executives have also been filmed by Channel 4 News suggesting it could use honey traps and potentially bribery to discredit politicians. The company denies any wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has been summoned to give evidence about the company's links to Cambridge Analytica to a UK parliamentary committee. Damian Collins MP, who is leading the committee's inquiry into fake news, accused Facebook of giving answers ""misleading to the committee"" at a previous hearing which asked whether information had been taken without users' consent. On Monday,Channel 4 News,externalbroadcast hidden camera footage in which Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix appears to suggest tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online. In the footage, asked what ""deep digging"" could be done, Mr Nix told an undercover reporter: ""Oh, we do a lot more than that."" He suggested one way to target an individual was to ""offer them a deal that's too good to be true and make sure that's video recorded"". He also said he could ""send some girls around to the candidate's house..."" adding that Ukrainian girls ""are very beautiful, I find that works very well"". Mr Nix continued: ""I'm just giving you examples of what can be done and what has been done."" Cambridge Analytica: The story so far Facebook data sharing - time to act? Channel 4 News said its reporter had posed as a fixer for a wealthy client hoping to get a political candidate elected in Sri Lanka. This video can not be played Former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie says the firm planted fake news However, Cambridge Analytica said the report had ""grossly misrepresented"" the conversations caught on camera. ""In playing along with this line of conversation, and partly to spare our 'client' from embarrassment, we entertained a series of ludicrous hypothetical scenarios,"" the company said in a statement. ""Cambridge Analytica does not condone or engage in entrapment, bribes or so-called 'honeytraps',"" it said. Mr Nix told the BBC's Newsnight programme that he regarded the report as a ""misrepresentation of the facts"" and said he felt the firm had been ""deliberately entrapped"". On its website, Cambridge Analytica says it can provide data and insights to ""drive your voters to the polls and win your campaign"" and says it has played a ""pivotal role"" in winning US presidential races. This video can not be played Mr Nix spoke to BBC Newsnight before the Channel 4 report was aired on Monday night. He declined to be interviewed after the undercover footage was broadcast UK Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham is investigating the company over claims it used personal data to influence the US election. Christopher Wylie, who worked with the company, claimed it amassed the data of millions of people through a personality quiz on Facebook called This is Your Digital Life that was created by an academic. Ms Denham demanded access to the firm's databases and servers after it missed her Monday deadline. She said her office has been investigating political campaigning and the use of political data for many months - the allegations against Facebook and Cambridge Analytica were one strand of that work. She said she was looking at whether personal data was acquired in ""an unauthorised way"", whether there was sufficient consent to share the data, what was done to safeguard it and whether Facebook acted robustly when they found out about the loss of the data. She admitted she told Facebook to withdraw from its own search of Cambridge Analytica's offices, saying there were concerns it might damage the integrity of her investigation. ""Our advice to Facebook was to back away - and they agreed,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. This video can not be played Information Commissioner: We need to get in to Cambridge Analytica offices Labour's shadow digital economy minister Liam Byrne said Ms Denham's powers did not allow her to apply for a digital search warrant ""quickly and quietly"". Instead, she has ""told the world she's going to court"", giving Cambridge Analytica and others time to hide any evidence, he told the Today programme. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve said her legal powers were inadequate and this matter had highlighted a need for ""greater powers and greater sanctions"". Ms Denham said she was using all the powers she had under the law but would not know whether evidence had been tampered with until her team of forensic experts gained access to the offices. Cambridge Analytica insists it followed the correct procedures in obtaining and using data,but it was suspended from Facebook last week. Facebook, meanwhile, will hold an open meeting with its employees later to discuss the matter,tech news website The Verge is reporting.,external Facebook said it has hired its own digital forensic team to audit Cambridge Analytica to find out whether the Facebook data in question still exists. Facebook's value falls $37bn amid backlash Zuckerberg pressed to face breach concerns ""If this data still exists, it would be a grave violation of Facebook's policies and an unacceptable violation of trust and the commitments these groups made."" Facebook said Aleksandr Kogan, who created the personality app from which the data had been harvested, has agreed to be audited, but Mr Wylie - who made the claims about the way the data was gathered and used - has declined. There are a few things to be aware of if you want to restrict who has access to your data. Keep an eye on apps, especially those which require you to log in using your Facebook account - they often have a very wide range of permissions and many are specifically designed to pick up your data Use an ad blocker to limit advertising Look at your Facebook security settings and make sure you are aware of what is enabled. Check the individual app settings to see whether you have given them permission to view your friends as well as yourself. You can download a copy of the data Facebook holds on you, although it is not comprehensive. There is a download button at the bottom of the General Account Settings tab. However bear in mind that your data may be less secure sitting on your laptop than it is on Facebook's servers, if your device is hacked. You can of course, simply leave Facebook, but the campaign group Privacy International warns that privacy concerns extend beyond the social network. ""The current focus is on protecting your data being exploited by third parties, but your data is being exploited all the time,"" said a spokeswoman.

"The deal is done, the pound has been climbing; forget the snow, only sunshine and clear skies ahead for Brexit. The two hardy political mountaineers have scaled the heights. David Davis and Michel Barnier, representing the UK and the EU, have agreed in principle to the transition deal, or implementation period (whatever you want to call it) - a period of 21 months where the two sides can work out the finer details of the relationship that will evolve over many, many years. UK and EU agree Brexit transition terms Brexit: All you need to know The sighs of relief from No 10 will be so loud they'll be heard in Brussels. The government has something they can say is an agreement, which means progress, and they hope it's an insurance policy against business pulling up stumps and abandoning the UK as the uncertainty around Brexit threatens their ability to make plans. ""Hang on,"" I rightly hear you say. It is not, that simple. Yes, the EU and the UK havehammered out a political agreement,externalon what happens as soon as we leave the European Union next year. The short answer is, as the prime minister conceded back in Florence in September, not very much. And during that period the UK will pay significant amounts of cash for the status quo. But there are three big questions about what has been agreed. First:As ministers have been perfectly well aware for a long time, there have had to be compromises to get this far. The EU has bent in some areas true, but the UK has done more of the budging. As we reported a few weeks ago for example,  the UK's original hope to make big changes to EU immigration during the transition period, has gone.  The UK has agreed the EU's preferred date of finishing the implementation period at the end of 2020, rather than spring 2021. And in the next few hours the text of today's Brussels statements will be scoured to see where else the big concessions have come. Second:What is left to resolve? The answer is, a lot. The original plan for the first phase of the talks was to resolve citizens' rights, Ireland and the divorce bill. Well, the cash and citizens' rights are done. That is of course, an achievement of its own. But there is no sign of agreement on the Irish issue, and the UK has had to agree that the controversial backstop remains to solve the problem if everything goes wrong.  And this stage is, remember, only about how we leave - the divorce proceedings not the final agreement that will determine how the UK does business with the EU in the decades to come. This is an important step that is highly likely to be rubber stamped later this week, but it ain't over. Lastly:How politically acceptable are the fudges agreed so far at home? David Davis has got his ""joint committee"" that will police the implementation agreement. No 10 hopes this will ease concerns that the UK will essentially have to abide by the EU rules without much of a say - to use the terrible jargon, to be a ""rule-taker not a rule-maker"". But it is not certain that guarantee will be enough on the Tory backbenches to end claims that the transition will leave us a ""vassal state"".  And on fishing for example, there is disappointment already that the government has agreed to concede some sovereignty on UK waters during the implementation period that might give rise to demands for a tougher approach in the next part of the negotiations. Don't be surprised for one moment if there are plenty of Brexiteer mutterings that ""nothing is agreed, until everything is agreed"". Today though the government will trumpet the fact they have come this far. Expect ministers to hail the agreement on transition as evidence that Brexit is on track, and to big-up what they see as achievements in the talks - the UK will be able to sign and ratify trade agreements in the transition period for example, to be ready to come into force at midnight on 31 December 2020. But the agreement has been possible because some of the hard bits have been parked. This a long, a very very long, game.

"Data about Facebook users is gathered and shared all the time say industry experts The gathering storm over how millions of Facebook profiles were apparently exploited for political purposes raises all sorts of questions about how our data is used. But already some in the data and marketing industries are pouring cold water on the story which theGuardian's Carole Cadwalladr,externalhas pursued with such admirable vigour. ""Nothing very new here,"" they say with a world-weary sigh. ""This sort of thing has been going on for years."" But that surely is the point - we are finally waking up to a murky world where there is little regulation, and companies can trade our personal information without a care. Some in the data industry agree. ""It's a bit like the MPs expenses scandal,"" says Nick Halstead, an entrepreneur who has started several data analytics businesses. He believes, that just as MPs had a rude awakening when they were caught out doing what was accepted practice for years, so data firms and the social media giants will have to change their ways. He says the method used by an academic who ran a personality quiz to gather Facebook data and then allegedly passed it to Cambridge Analytica is a familiar one: ""I can name you 10 companies that have hundreds of millions of Facebook profiles using similar methods."" He says these firms are not doing anything illegal, and although they should not be passing on the data to others, they often do. Mr Halstead thinks a recent change in Facebook's rules for external developers which made it harder for them to simply scrape data from users' public profiles, may be a sign that the company knows there is a problem. It might have another as the public row over the data has hit Facebook shares which were down about 5% as politicians, pundits and regulators queued to demand more information. For Stephanie Hare, a tech expert who has worked in the data field, the Cambridge Analytica story raises big questions over a lack of accountability: ""What is really striking here is the absence of any oversight."" Nobody, she points out - not the social network, nor the data company or the academic researcher - seems to have thought that it was their job to ask if data had been improperly shared, and if so to ensure it was deleted. Questions are being asked about how profile data was gathered She thinks there is going to need to be some kind of regulatory oversight to make sure the rules are followed. Much has been made of the fact that users who sign up to the kind of personality quiz used in this case have to explicitly give permission for their data to be accessed. But Stephanie Hare says it is unfair to put the burden on people with busy lives to read through the fine print. And she feels that Facebook's settings should be set to maximise privacy by default. ""It's our jobs as technologists to design systems that are safe,"" she says. ""I don't get on an aeroplane as a passenger and make my own safety checks."" I spent this morning giving a talk at a school in South Wales about the power of social media platforms to spread fake news. I took some time to explain just how much power Facebook puts in the hands of advertisers - and political parties - to target their messages very precisely at, say, 15-25 year olds in Pontypridd who like motor racing. My audience, all keen users of social media, seemed surprised to learn that Facebook owned Instagram and WhatsApp, and Google owned YouTube, meaning that just two giant companies could exert huge influence over the information they received and how they thought. I also warned them against signing up to quizzes on Facebook and elsewhere. But we are now asking a lot of this generation, demanding that they examine every news story to be certain of its sources, and making them read through arcane privacy statements everywhere they go online. Perhaps it is time for the grownups to give them an online world which is safer by default.

"Fishing opportunities will continue to be negotiated by the EU during a two-year transition period underthe latest draft agreement on Brexit. The industry had expected the UK to withdraw from the Common Fisheries Policy on the day of leaving the EU. But the UK government has now agreed to be ""consulted"" on arrangements with the EU continuing to set quotas. The Scottish Fishermen's Federation said it falls ""far short of an acceptable deal"". The UK government has denied betraying its promise to ""take back control"" of the UK's fishing waters after Brexit. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""We have secured specific safeguards on behalf of British fishermen."" He said the deal specified that in 2019 ""there is a commitment that the UK's share of the total catch cannot be changed"". The spokesman added that, from 2020, ""we'll be negotiating as an independent coastal state and we'll decide who can access our waters and on what terms"".

Both the UK and the EU hope the terms of an agreement on the transitional period can be signed off by Prime Minister Theresa May's fellow leaders at the EU summit this week.

""To our politicians we say this: Some have tried to secure a better deal but our governments have let us down. ""As a consequence, we expect a written, cast-iron guarantee that after the implementation period, sovereignty will mean sovereignty and we will not enter into any deal which gives any other nation or the EU continued rights of access or quota other than those negotiated as part of the annual Coastal States negotiations."" The UK's Brexit negotiator David Davis said he hoped negotiations on the UK's future relationship with the EU - including a free trade agreement - could now start ""as soon as is possible"". He said: ""We need to get on with this now. We need to come to agreement on this as fast as we can. ""That is in the interests of businesses within the European Union and businesses within the United Kingdom."" Last week,Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson and UK environment secretary Michael Goveissued a joint statement saying: ""The Prime Minister has been clear: Britain will leave the CFP as of March 2019. We both support her wholeheartedly."" They said it was ""vital"" that the country regained control over its own fisheries management. Following the latest announcement by David Davis and his EU counterpart Michel Barnier, Ms Davidson said she ""would not support a deal as we leave the EU which, over the long-term, fails to deliver full control over fish stocks and vessel access"". She added: ""During these negotiations, we wanted to gain control over our waters from as early as the end of next year. ""The EU was not willing to move on this. That we now have to wait until 2020 to assume full control is an undoubted disappointment. ""Having spoken to fishing leaders today, I know they are deeply frustrated with this outcome. There is no ignoring the fact that this falls short of what they had hoped for in the short-term. ""I've made clear to them that I will continue to do everything in my power to ensure their interests are protected during the implementation period and beyond."" Allow Twitter content?

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: ""The promises that were made to them (Scottish fishermen) during #EUref and since are already being broke - as many of us warned they would be."" Rural economy secretary Fergus Ewing said: ""Ruth Davidson should be shame-faced for her fastest broken Brexit promise yet. ""Just last week she said Britain will leave the CFP as of March 2019. ""Now we know not only will the UK have to abide by CFP rules during the transition period, it will lose the voting rights it has now. The Tories have delivered the worst possible outcome for Scotland's fishing industry. ""It is outrageous that Ruth Davidson and Michael Gove could have issued such a misleading statement last weekend when they must have known what was about to happen - and they must both now apologise for their broken promise. Mr Ewing added: ""The Tories have demonstrated once again that for them Scottish interests are expendable."" Environmental coalition, Greener UK, said continuing to co-operate with the EU during the implementation period ""does not have to be seen as a capitulation"". Dr Lyndsey Dodds, of WWF and Greener UK, added: ""Having longer to negotiate the sharing of over 100 stocks can reduce the risk of rash quota setting, and heightens our chances of achieving thriving coastal communities and sustainable fisheries in the longer run.""

"Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is facing intensified calls to appear in person at investigations into the social network's conduct. His company has been accused of failing to properly inform users that their profile information may have been obtained and kept by Cambridge Analytica, a data firm widely-credited with helping Donald Trump win the 2016 US presidential election. Facebook said on Friday it had blocked Cambridge Analytica from Facebook while it investigated claims the London-based firm did not, as promised, delete data that was allegedly obtained using methods that were in violation of Facebook's policies. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny any wrongdoing. Despite pledging that in 2018 he would ""fix"" his company, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has managed to avoid engaging with the site's growing number of critics - instead sending lawyers or policy bosses to various committee hearings. The 33-year-old's recent remarks on some of Facebook's controversies have been communicated in the relatively safe space of a blog post or video message published on his Facebook page. Facebook and Trump data firm 'misled' MPs US to investigate Trump campaign data firm Tech Tent: Facebook and Google take action With the building row over how Facebookdata may have been used to fuel highly-targeted political propaganda, several influential figures on both side of the Atlantic this weekend said it was time for Mr Zuckerberg to step up to publicly defend - or at least justify - his creation. Some called for investigations into whether Mr Zuckerberg's company may have violated laws governing disclosure of a data breach - and also rules on properly obtaining a user's consent to collect personal information. ""This is a major breach that must be investigated,"" demanded Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. ""Itâs clear these platforms canât police themselves. I've called for more transparency and accountability for online political ads. They say 'trust us'."" She added: ""Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary."" That sentiment was backed by Adam Schiff, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is already investigating social media manipulation in the run up to the 2016 presidential election. ""I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees,"" he told the Washington Post. ""And not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space."" On Sunday morning TV, Florida senator and former presidential hopeful Marco Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press he felt technology companies acted as if they are ""above"" regulations. Eight reasons Facebook has peaked Social networks 'too slow' on changes Facebook broke German privacy laws ""Their growth has been a lot faster than perhaps their ability to mature institutionally from within on some of these challenges that they're facing,"" he said. ""I think another part about it is sometimes these companies grow so fast and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think that perhaps they're above sort of the rules that apply to everybody else."" The man in charge of Britain's investigation into Russian meddling in the democratic process said he too wanted to press Mr Zuckerberg on the issue. ""I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,"" said Damian Collins MP. ""It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers."" This video can not be played In the age of big data, is our democracy open to manipulation? Mr Collins also said he would be recalling Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix to parliament to answer more questions. ""It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and parliament,"" Mr. Collins said. Cambridge Analytica and Mr Nix have denied any wrongdoing. In an attempt to get out ahead of a story in the New York Times and Observer newspapers,Facebook made an announcement late Friday night, California time, that it was blocking Cambridge Analytica from using Facebookwhile it investigated claims the inappropriately-obtained data had not been deleted as promised. This was followed by remarks from Alex Stamos, the firm's chief security officer, who wrote and then deleted a series of tweets. He objected to the word ""breach"" being used to describe how data from as many as 50 million peoples' user profiles may have been obtained without explicit user consent. ""I have deleted my tweets on Cambridge Analytica,"" he later wrote. ""Not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in."" Christopher Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica, revealed how it and its partners harvested data belonging to mostly US voters. Over the weekend, he announced he had been suspended from Facebook. On top of its initial statement, Facebook on Sunday said it was conducting a ""comprehensive internal and external review"" into whether the data, gathered via an app created by Global Science Research (GSR), still existed. GSR was set up by University of Cambridge associate professor Aleksandr Kogan and his colleague Joseph Chancellor. According to the Guardian, Mr Chancellor was given a job at Facebook as a researcher just months after GSR carried out the data-gathering exercise that Facebook now says violated its policies. Facebook has not commented on the calls for Mr Zuckerberg to appear in front of the several committees expressing a desire to hear from him. But one analyst warned that this controversy is a direct threat to Facebook's business model, and therefore Mr Zuckerberg will be expected to put investors at ease, sooner rather than later. ""This has potential to grow into something a lot more onerous,"" said Daniel Ives from GBH Insight. ""So he has to get ahead of this storm before it turns into a hurricane.""

"Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix has spoken of the firm's intricate data Facebook and a US data firm, Cambridge Analytica, have been accused of ""misleading"" Parliament. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee said both firms must answer more questions over claims that details from 50 million profiles were gathered without consent. Facebook suspended the US company, saying it breached its policies. Cambridge Analytica said it does not hold or use any Facebook data. Both companies deny any wrongdoing. The data firm is primarily known for its role in US President Trump's election campaign, where it provided details on American voters. Damian Collins, chairman of the Digital Culture Committee, said comments by Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix at a Commons hearing last month must be explained. Did Cambridge Analytica play a role in the EU referendum? Mr Collins said reports by the Guardian and the Observer made it ""clear that he [Mr Nix] has deliberately misled the committee and Parliament by giving false statements"". Cambridge Analytica has denied allegations that Mr Nix misled that committee. Facebook claims Cambridge Analytica, among others, did not destroy all the data it obtained, which breached its policies. The claims against the company rose to prominence after a former employee told the Guardian about his time at Cambridge Analytica. Mr Collins also criticised Facebook, saying his committee had ""repeatedly"" asked the firm about how companies accessed user data from the website and if information had been taken without users' consent. He claims that the firm ""deliberately avoided answering straight questions"" from the committee by sending witnesses who claimed not to know the answers. ""This also creates a false reassurance that Facebook's stated policies are always robust and effectively policed."" He also claimed Facebook had failed to supply evidence of the relationship between the social media platform and Cambridge Analytica. ""The reputation of this company is being damaged by stealth, because of their constant failure to respond with clarity and authority to the questions of genuine public interest that are being directed to them. ""Someone has to take responsibility for this."" A spokesperson for Facebook said that the data collection was not a hack or a breach. ""People knowingly provided their information, no systems were infiltrated, and no passwords or sensitive pieces of information were stolen or hacked,"" the company said.

"Uber said it is suspending self-driving car tests in all North American cities after a fatal accident. A 49-year-old woman was hit by a car and killed as she crossed the street in Tempe, Arizona. While self-driving cars have been involved in multiple accidents, it is thought to be the first time an autonomous car has been involved in a fatal collision. Uber said that its ""hearts go out to the victim's family"". ""We're fully cooperating with @TempePolice and local authorities as they investigate this incident"", the company said in a statement on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

Police said the accident happened Sunday night while the car was in autonomous mode. A human monitor was also behind the wheel. Police said the woman, Elaine Herzberg, had not been using a pedestrian crossing. Herzberg was taken to a local hospital where she died. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board said they were sending teams to Tempe. Companies including Ford, General Motors, Tesla and Waymo are investing heavily in research to develop self-driving cars, which are often characterised as the future of the industry and hailed as a way to reduce traffic accidents. Driverless cars on UK roads by 2021 - really? UK plans 200-mile 'country roads' driverless trial Many states across America have welcomed the tests in the hope of keeping themselves at the forefront of new technology. However, there have been warnings that the technology is being deployed before it is ready. Anthony Foxx, who served as US Secretary of Transportation under former President Barack Obama,called the accident,externala ""wake up call to the entire [autonomous vehicle] industry and government to put a high priority on safety."" More than a dozen states in the US allow autonomous vehicles on the roads to some degree. Officials typically require a person to be on hand either in the car or remotely in case something goes wrong, according to the Center for Automotive Research. The US is working on national safety guidelines for such vehicles. A self-driving car at the Google headquarters in 2015 Consumer Watchdog, a lobby group that has warned of the risks of autonomous cars, on Monday called for a moratorium of such vehicles on public roads, describing the accident as a ""tragedy we have been fighting years to prevent"". ""We hope our calls for real regulation of driverless cars will be taken seriously going forward by Silicon Valley and the Trump Administration,"" the groupwrote on Twitter,external. Uber started testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh in 2016. The ride-hailing firm has also been testing driverless cars in San Francisco, Pittsburgh, Toronto and the Phoenix area, which includes Tempe. The death comes a year afterUber took its self-driving cars off the roadfollowing an accident that left a Volvo SUV on its side in Arizona. The programme was later reinstated. Self-driving shuttle bus in crash on first day Are driverless pods the future for world cities? Carla Bailo, president and chief executive of the Center for Automotive Research, said more information about how the crash occurred is necessary before officials can say what went wrong and how the self-driving system should be improved. She also said the fatality should be considered in the context of all accidents. More than 37,000 people, including almost 6,000 pedestrians, died,externalin traffic accidents in the US in 2016, according to the US Department of Transportation. ""We need to be fair and look at all the data,"" she said. ""But I don't think anybody is taking this lightly. By far safety is the first concern. Tempe Mayor Mark Mitchell said he supports autonomous car tests because of the technology's potential. He also praised Uber's decision to suspend the programme as ""responsible"". ""Our city leadership and Tempe Police will pursue any and all answers to what happened in order to ensure safety moving forward,""he said,external.

"A disgruntled gamer is thought to be behind a hoax email sent to about 400 schools in England threatening to bomb school grounds if money was not paid. A number of schools were evacuated but police said there was no evidence the threats were terror-related. Schools in London, Manchester and North Yorkshire were among those affected. The email appeared to come from gaming server VeltPvP, but the company said the account had been ""spoofed"" and the message had not come from them. The US firm's 17-year-old CEO told the BBC he suspected the hoax emails had been sent by a disgruntled Minecraft player in a bid to damage VeltPvP's reputation. The email address requested payment to an email address that used the domain veltpvp.com but the website posted messages on Twitter denying any involvement. It said: ""We have nothing to do with the bomb threats that were sent out to the 400+ UK schools. ""We're extremely sorry for anyone who had to deal with this, but just know it's fake."" VeltPvP is mainly used by gamers aged eight to 18 VeltPvP.com is a US-based online ""player-versus-player"" server that allows gamers to compete against other users in the world-building game Minecraft. Carson Kallen, the 17-year-old CEO of the firm, told the BBC he had a team of 50 people  managing 10,000 users a day. He says: ""Everyone who plays it is between the ages of eight and 18 years old - it's all kids playing."" Mr Kallen told the BBC: ""Every now and then we have a little rebel who will try to do something bad like this. We've had stuff like this happen before but nothing this extreme."" He said it was likely that a disgruntled user orchestrated the attack: ""He was probably a player who got banned from our server and got mad. This is his way of trying to make us look bad."" Sarah Stephenson was at her son's school, Oathall Community College in West Sussex, waiting for a meeting when it was evacuated. ""I noticed a little bit of activity going on. I went through to student support and all of a sudden a notification went out that the school was being evacuated. ""My son George was in class at the time. The students were evacuated out of the school building and told to ring their parents. An email was sent out to all the parents."" Another affected school, Dowdales secondary in Cumbria, tweeted: ""As you may know the school office received a threatening email this morning. ""The decision was taken to evacuate the school as a precaution. Students and staff are safe and have returned to normal lessons.""

"The Parsons Green Tube bomber was a ""lovely lad"" and ""a bright and intelligent child"", his foster mother has said. Speaking in an ITV interview, Penny Jones said she felt ""very betrayed"" by Ahmed Hassan,external, who was convicted of attempted murder last week after trying to bomb a District Line train. She added: ""There is a small part of me that cares about him because I know he has mental health issues"". Hassan will be sentenced this week. Mrs Jones and her husband Ron, who have fostered hundreds of children over five decades, gave Hassan a home afterhe arrived in the UK as an asylum seeker from Iraq. They said they had no idea about the teenager's plan. While the couple were away, Hassan made 400g of explosives and packed the device with nearly 2.2kg of screwdrivers, knives, nuts and bolts. Mrs Jones added: ""I am cross with him for what he's done, and that he's done this in my house makes me feel very, very betrayed, I can't help that. ""Because he's such a bright and intelligent child, he'd got a good future ahead of him. I find this hard."" Ahmed Hassan, 18, was found guilty on ""overwhelming evidence"" In court, the jury heard that he wanted to avenge the death of his father in Iraq and was ""disappointed"" when the bomb only partly detonated. Mr Jones said he still struggled to accept what his foster son did.  ""He was so convincing and I didn't have no cause to be suspicious of anything he had done,"" he said.

"Doctors have taken a major step towards curing the most common form of blindness in the UK - age-related macular degeneration. Douglas Waters, 86, could not see out of his right eye, but ""I can now read the newspaper"" with it, he says. He was one of two patients given pioneering stem cell therapy atMoorfields Eye Hospital in London,external. Cells from a human embryo were grown into a patch that was delicately inserted into the back of the eye. Douglas, who is from London, developed severe age-related macular degeneration in his right eye three years ago. The macula is the part of the eye that allows you to see straight ahead - whether to recognise faces, watch TV or read a book. He says: ""In the months before the operation my sight was really poor and I couldn't see anything out of my right eye. ""It's brilliant what the team have done and I feel so lucky to have been given my sight back."" The macula is made up of rods and cones that sense light and behind those are a layer of nourishing cells called the retinal pigment epithelium. When this support layer fails, it causes macular degeneration and blindness. Doctors have devised a way of building a new retinal pigment epithelium and surgically implanting it into the eye. The technique,published in Nature Biotechnology,external, starts with embryonic stem cells. These are a special type of cell that can become any other in the human body. They are converted into the type of cell that makes up the retinal pigment epithelium and embedded into a scaffold to hold them in place. The living patch is only one layer of cells thick - about 40 microns - and 6mm long and 4mm wide. It is then placed underneath the rods and cones in the back of the eye. The operation takes up to two hours. Prof Lyndon da Cruz, consultant retinal surgeon at Moorfields, told the BBC: ""We've restored vision where there was none. ""It's incredibly exciting. As you get older, parts of you stop working and for the first time we've been able to take a cell and make it into a specific part of the eye that's failing and put it back in the eye and get vision back."" However, he does not call this a ""cure"" as completely normal vision is not restored. Only one diseased eye was operated on in each patient. So far the patients, the other is a woman in her early sixties, have maintained improved vision in the treated eye for a year. They went from not being able to read with their affected eye at all, to reading 60 to 80 words per minute. Eight more patients will take part in this clinical trial. Doctors need to be sure it is safe. One concern is the transplanted cells could become cancerous, although there have been no such signs so far. Mums' Down's syndrome video goes viral Essential oils 'make male breasts develop' UK teacher wins global best teacher prize Prof Pete Coffey, from the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, said: ""This study represents real progress in regenerative medicine. ""We hope this will lead to an affordable 'off-the-shelf' therapy that could be made available to NHS patients within the next five years."" More than 600,000 people have age-related macular degeneration in the UK. It's the leading cause of blindness and the third globally. Both patients in the trial had ""wet"" age-related macular degeneration. This form of the disease is caused by abnormal blood vessels growing through the retinal pigment epithelium and damaging the macula. Dry age-related macular degeneration is more common and caused by the retinal pigment epithelium breaking down. It is hoped the patch will be able to treat both forms of the disease. Dr Carmel Toomes, from Leeds Institutes of Molecular Medicine, said: ""What's exciting about this study is that the patients recorded an increase in vision. ""To see an improvement is a good sign that this therapy may help patients in the future, although further studies are needed before real conclusions can be drawn.""

"Alex Mahon became boss of Channel 4 last year Channel 4 has revealed it pays its female staff almost a quarter less than its male staff on average. Its 24.2% median gender pay gap is above the 18.4% UK average, and comes despite the broadcaster's workforce being nearly 60% female. Channel 4 also said it had a bonus gap of 47.6%. It comes a week after ITN, which makes programmes for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, revealed a pay gap of 18.2%. Channel 4 boss Alex Mahon said the news made for ""uncomfortable reading"". In a report,external, the broadcaster blamed the pay discrepancy on there being a large number of women in the lower two quartiles at the organisation, while most jobs in the highest-paid quartile were filled by men. Ms Mahon, who joined Channel 4 last year, said she was ""determined to take action"". ""There is no quick fix, but identifying the complex and multiple reasons behind our gap is the first step towards tackling the fundamental issues at play,"" she said. She added that while the broadcaster employs ""significantly more women than men there is an imbalance in the ratios at the higher and lower-earning parts of the business"". Ms Mahon said the broadcaster would focus on ""increasing the proportion of women in higher-paid roles"". It aims to have a ""50:50 gender balance"" among its top 100 earners by 2023. Other media organisations have reported their median gender pay gaps recently, including the BBC at 9.3% and the Guardian newspaper at 12.1%. Broadcasters ITV and Channel 5 have yet to publish their figures. Broadcaster pay has been in the spotlight since the BBC published the salaries of top talent last year. Radio 2's Chris Evans topped the list on more than Â£2m, while the highest paid woman was Claudia Winkleman on between Â£450,000 and Â£499,999. A review of presenter pay for the BBC, carried out by PwC, said there was a ""lack of clarity and openness about the basis for pay decisions"". But it found ""no evidence of gender bias in pay decision-making"". BBC Women, a group that includes presenters such as Mishal Husain and Victoria Derbyshire, have rejected the report's findings. The BBC's former China editor Carrie Gracie also resigned from her role in protest at inequalities.

"Police have sealed the area around the scene of the blast Police in Austin, Texas, have said four explosions that have rocked the city, killing two people, are believed to be the work of a serial bomber. The latest explosion on Sunday night, which injured two white men, aged 22 and 23, may have been activated by a tripwire, police say. Three parcel bombs left on doorsteps have killed two people and injured two others since early March. Investigators say they have seen similarities in all four cases. ""We are clearly dealing with what we expect to be a serial bomber at this point,"" Austin police chief Brian Manley said at a news conference on Monday. ""We have seen similarities in the devices that exploded here last night and the other three devices."" Sunday night's victims suffered non-life threatening injuries and were taken to hospital after encountering a suspicious device on the side of a road in a residential area, police said. The latest blast came hours after officials announced a new $100,000 (Â£71,000) reward for information. The cash reward is on top of an existing $15,000 being offered by the state's governor. The two men killed earlier this month were African Americans and police have not ruled out racism as a possible motive. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Cynthia Nixon is a lifelong New Yorker Sex and the City star Cynthia Nixon has announced she is launching a bid for New York governor. Ms Nixon, who played Miranda Hobbs on the HBO series, plans to challenge incumbent Governor Andrew Cuomo for the Democratic party nomination. The actress announced her plans to challenge the incumbent governor on Twitter on Monday. The 51-year-old liberal activist, who had long been tipped to run, has never held elected office. Sex and the City stars 'never friends' Kim Cattrall suggests SATC replacements Governor Cuomo participates in 'die-in"" Ms Nixon played a career-oriented lawyer from 1998-2004 on television show Sex and the City. She won an Emmy for her work in 2004. It was presented to her by another television celebrity - Donald Trump, whose presidency she has recently railed against. Ms Nixon married her wife Christine Marinoni in 2012. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Marinoni, an LGBTQ advocate, worked for Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio until she resigned a month ago. The couple both contributed financially to his mayoral race. In Monday's campaign launch video, the actress said: ""I love New York. I've never wanted to live anywhere else, but something has to change."" The actress listed several campaign priorities in the clip. Ms Nixon married her wife Christine Marinoni in 2012 ""We want our government to work again, on healthcare, ending mass incarceration, fixing our broken subway,"" she said. ""We are sick of politicians who care more about headlines and power than they do about us. It can't just be business as usual anymore."" Ms Nixon has long championed access to quality education in New York. ""I'm a proud public school graduate,"" she said, ""and a prouder public school parent. I was given chances I just don't see most of New York's kids today. Our leaders are letting us down. ""We are the most unequal state in the entire country, with both incredible wealth and extreme poverty."" Actress Cynthia Nixon accepts her Emmy from Donald Trump in 2004 In a January op-ed for CNN, Ms Nixon wrote: ""If we've learned anything during this first year of the Trump presidency, it's that the cavalry isn't coming to save us. ""We ourselves are the cavalry. In 2018, each one of us has to do whatever we can to take the government back. If we want change, we have to go out ourselves and seize it."" If elected, Nixon would become the first female and first openly gay governor of New York state. Her fledgling campaign brands her as a progressive alternative to the centrist Mr Cuomo. The 60-year-old incumbent governor, who is chasing his third term, is often touted as a possible presidential hopeful in 2020. He has dismissed concerns about potential challengers in the Democratic primary on 13 September. Governor Cuomo has dismissed concerns about potential challengers ""I'm not nervous about whoever runs,"" the governor said last week. ""There'll be people who run. That's called elections, and that's fine."" But he could be vulnerable on his political left flank. The Nixon campaign team will take heart from the unexpectedly stiff challenge Mr Cuomo faced in his 2014 re-election from a little-known college lecturer who also positioned herself as a liberal Democrat. Zephyr Teachout won roughly 34% of the vote to Mr Cuomo's 62%. A recent opinion poll by New York's Siena College before Ms Nixon's public announcement had Mr Cuomo leading Democrats by 66% to Ms Nixon's 19%. The same survey indicated the governor enjoyed an advantage over both Republicans who plan to challenge him, state senator John DeFrancisco and Marc Molinaro. Allegations of corruption in the state capitol at Albany are likely to be dredged up ahead of election day in November. Mr Cuomo's close friend and former aide Joseph Percoco was convicted last week on corruption charges. Though the governor was not himself accused in the case, his name repeatedly cropped up during the trial. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Police and military officers in protective suits in Durrington The EU has offered the UK ""unqualified solidarity"" in its investigation into the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury. A statement urged Russia to address the UK's questions and called for a full disclosure of its development of Novichok, the nerve agent used. Russian President Vladimir Putin said state involvement was ""unimaginable"". Meanwhile, the Army is recovering a car used to collect Yulia Skripal from the airport, the BBC understands. It is believed the vehicle, in Durrington, Wiltshire, was used by a friend of Mr Skripal to pick up Yulia on 3 March, the day before the pair became unwell. Both Mr Skripal, 66, and Yulia Skripal, 33, remain critically ill in hospital. They were found slumped and unconscious on a bench near a shopping centre in the centre of Salisbury on March 4, having visited a pub and a restaurant. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Russian denials of involvement were ""increasingly absurd"" and welcomed the EU support. Responding to President Putin's dismissal of Russian involvement, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""I'm clear that what we have seen shows that there is no other conclusion but that the Russian state is culpable for what happened on the streets of Salisbury."" The EU statement comes as international experts arrive in the UK to assess the type of nerve agent used in the attack. Meanwhile, police investigating the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov,who was found dead in his London home on 12 March, have found no evidence of forced entry into his house. Mr Glushkov's death came in the same week Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced that a string of deaths on UK soil were to be reinvestigated by the police and MI5 after claims of Russian involvement. Police have stressed there is no evidence to link Mr Glushkov's death with the attempted murder of Mr Skripal. What are Novichok nerve agents? Russian spy: What we know so far Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? Russia spy poisoning: What happens when you expel a diplomat? Nikolai Glushkov: Police say no forced entry at Russian's home In a statement, the EU's foreign affairs council said it condemned the ""reckless and illegal act"" and said  it took the UK government's view ""extremely seriously"" that it was likely that Russia was responsible. ""The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us all,"" it said. ""The European Union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UK's efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice."" It urged Russia to provide ""immediate, full and complete"" disclosure of its Novichok programme to international body the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).

Mr Johnson, who is in Brussels seeking further support for Britain's stance, said he was ""very heartened"" by the strength of support the UK was getting over the case.

Arriving at the EU meeting in Brussels, Swedish foreign minister Margot Wallstrom told the BBC it was important that the nations were united and demonstrated solidarity with the UK Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis said it was time for an ""extended examination of all the elements involved"" and offered support to the UK. But,speaking after winning a fourth term as leader, President Putin insisted Russia had destroyed all of its chemical weapons, adding it was ""nonsense"" to implicate his  government in the attack. The Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, said Russia destroyed all of its chemical weapons in 2017. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russia's Tass news agency that the UK will have to provide evidence of its claims or apologise. ""Sooner or later they will have to be responsible for these allegations,"" he said. Mr Johnson had earlier accused Moscow of stockpiling the agent used in the attack. A team from the Netherlands-based OPCW, which polices the prohibition of chemical weapons, was invited by the UK to the military research base at Porton Down in Wiltshire to independently verify the nerve agent used. It will take at least two weeks to produce results. Experts at Porton Down say the agent is of a type first developed by the Russians. Police say their investigation will take ""weeks, if not months"" The Metropolitan Police are treating the attack in Salisbury as attempted murder. They have renewed their appealfor sightings of Mr Skripal's burgundy BMW 320D saloon car, registration HD09 WAO, on the morning of 4 March. According to sources cited in a report on ABC News in the US, Mr Skripal and his daughter may have been exposed to the nerve agent through the vehicle's ventilation system. Police say they have recovered 762 exhibits and are trawling through about 4,000 hours of CCTV footage. Officers said they were ""making good progress in what is a painstaking investigation that is likely to be ongoing for weeks, if not months"". Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs last week that the substance used in the attack had been identified as belonging to a group of military-grade nerve agents known as Novichok, developed by the Soviet Union. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Boris Johnson said: ""We actually have evidence within the last 10 years that Russia has not only been investigating the delivery of nerve agents for the purposes of assassination, but has also been creating and stockpiling Novichok.""

It also said it would close the British Council in Russia, which promotes cultural ties between the nations, and the British Consulate in St Petersburg. The prime minister has said the UK government would consider its next steps ""in the coming days, alongside our allies and partners"". Meanwhile, the shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti reiterated Labour's position that the incident was either a ""loss of control"" by the Russian state or a ""malevolent directed attack"". John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Labour had given a ""constructive critique"" in response to the incident which others ""had misread"". He told ITV's Peston on Sunday: ""We support exactly what the prime minister said and we condemn Russia for this, condemn them.""

"Alex Mahon became boss of Channel 4 last year Channel 4 has revealed it pays its female staff almost a quarter less than its male staff on average. Its 24.2% median gender pay gap is above the 18.4% UK average, and comes despite the broadcaster's workforce being nearly 60% female. Channel 4 also said it had a bonus gap of 47.6%. It comes a week after ITN, which makes programmes for ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, revealed a pay gap of 18.2%. Channel 4 boss Alex Mahon said the news made for ""uncomfortable reading"". In a report,external, the broadcaster blamed the pay discrepancy on there being a large number of women in the lower two quartiles at the organisation, while most jobs in the highest-paid quartile were filled by men. Ms Mahon, who joined Channel 4 last year, said she was ""determined to take action"". ""There is no quick fix, but identifying the complex and multiple reasons behind our gap is the first step towards tackling the fundamental issues at play,"" she said. She added that while the broadcaster employs ""significantly more women than men there is an imbalance in the ratios at the higher and lower-earning parts of the business"". Ms Mahon said the broadcaster would focus on ""increasing the proportion of women in higher-paid roles"". It aims to have a ""50:50 gender balance"" among its top 100 earners by 2023. Other media organisations have reported their median gender pay gaps recently, including the BBC at 9.3% and the Guardian newspaper at 12.1%. Broadcasters ITV and Channel 5 have yet to publish their figures. Broadcaster pay has been in the spotlight since the BBC published the salaries of top talent last year. Radio 2's Chris Evans topped the list on more than Â£2m, while the highest paid woman was Claudia Winkleman on between Â£450,000 and Â£499,999. A review of presenter pay for the BBC, carried out by PwC, said there was a ""lack of clarity and openness about the basis for pay decisions"". But it found ""no evidence of gender bias in pay decision-making"". BBC Women, a group that includes presenters such as Mishal Husain and Victoria Derbyshire, have rejected the report's findings. The BBC's former China editor Carrie Gracie also resigned from her role in protest at inequalities.

"Shares in Carpetright and Mothercare have plunged amid fears about the retailers' futures. Carpetright slumped 14% after a report suggested it would cut jobs and close stores as part of a rescue plan to stop it going into administration. Mothercare, which is in the midst of a store closure programme, fell almost 12%. It comes amid a wider High Street slowdown that has seen a host of big businesses shut stores or go bust. At the weekend, the Sunday Times reported that Carpetright could go down the route of a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), which would allow to it to shut loss-making stores and secure deep discounts on rental costs. That would follow similar recent arrangements atfashion retailer New Look, restaurant chains Jamie's Italian and Prezzo, and burger chain Byron. Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Carluccio's latest restaurant chain to feel the heat Carpetright, which has 409 UK shops, has been struggling with underperforming outlets which have made its rental costs harder to shoulder. Earlier this month the firm said it would swing to a full-year loss and had started talks with lenders to ensure it does not breach the terms of its bank loans. In a statement on Monday, the retailer said it was exploring ""a range of options"" to bolster the business and a final decision about its future had not been made. Mothercare is in the midst of a store closure programme Earlier this month Mothercare said it was in talks with its banks after poor trading put it at risk of breaching the terms of its loans. It plans tocut its store numbersfrom 140 to 80. A spokesman for Mothercare declined to comment on Monday's share price fall. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""There's no public information specifically released about Mothercare today, but if you look across the market quite a lot of retailers are in the red. ""Mothercare is one of the weaker players in a sector that is struggling across the board, which might explain why its shares have fallen more than other firms' today."" High Street retailers have been buffeted by higher overheads, falling consumer demand and the rise of online spending. Many retailers also embarked on debt-fuelled expansion during the good years, leaving them dangerously exposed in the current climate. Last week,Toys R Us said it would close all of its UK storesafter the chain collapsed into administration in February, and electronics retailerMaplin also went bust. On Monday, the owner of the Bargain Booze and Wine Rack chains,Conviviality, said its chief executive was stepping downafter the firm revealed last week it had failed to set aside Â£30m to pay a tax bill. The company, which is also a major drinks wholesaler, said Diana Hunter would step down from the board with immediate effect, with chairman David Adams stepping into the breach until further notice.

"The recruits had been posted to the Army Foundation College in Harrogate (stock image) One of the biggest investigations into the alleged abuse of teenage Army recruits in Britain has collapsed. Sixteen instructors at the Army Foundation College, Harrogate, North Yorkshire, were accused of slapping and punching 28 recruits. A judge branded the three-year Royal Military Police (RMP) probe ""seriously flawed"" as he halted the first of three courts martial. There are now calls for senior RMP officers to be investigated. More on this story and others from around Yorkshire The investigation had considered complaints from a total of 40 recruits about 30 instructors - which led to the prosecution of 16 of them, all sergeants and corporals. The allegations centred on how recruits, aged 16 and 17, were treated at training camp in Scotland in the summer of 2014. Recruits claimed they were slapped or punched in the face, spat at, grabbed by the throat, had their faces submerged in mud or were ordered to eat animal manure. However, it took two years to interview the soldiers involved under caution and another year before they were told they were being charged. In addition, handwritten accounts made by some recruits shortly after the alleged abuse have never been found and the military court heard some recruits claim they were threatened into giving statements and to appear as witnesses. The courts martial at Bulford, Wiltshire, collapsed after eight days when the prosecution offered no evidence in 24 of the 31 charges faced by the first 10 defendants. Five were cleared and Assistant Judge Advocate General Alan Large halted proceedings against the remaining five, ruling they could not get a fair trial. The prosecution indicated it would offer no evidence against a further six instructors due to go on trial next month. It emerged the RMP officer leading the investigation, Capt Teresa Spanton, did not question eyewitnesses because she thought they would lie. ""The decision not to interview, at any stage during a very long inquiry, such highly relevant eyewitnesses is a very serious breach of the duty upon police officers to investigate a case fairly and objectively,"" the judge said. He said her assumptions were ""frankly startling"". ""It reflects a totally blinkered approach to the police's duty of establishing, fairly and objectively, what happened,"" he added. On the face of it these were very serious allegations of widespread physical abuse of teenage recruits - children in the eyes of the law - but the court martial quickly unravelled. The Judge Advocate was scathing about the way the RMP handled the investigation; there were long delays in taking statements and evidence was lost or ignored. Some of the teenage recruits had ""no, or at very best vague, recollections"" of the events and key witnesses, including Army instructors, weren't even spoken to. Judge Alan Large concluded the RMP had carried out the case ""in direct breach of their duty to investigate fairly and objectively"". This isn't the first time the RMP has been accused of bungling an investigation. The human rights group Liberty said it should be a ""wake-up call"" for the Ministry of Defence and should force a rethink about the armed forces' system of justice. Lewis Cherry, a solicitor who specialises in defending soldiers at courts martial, said he was ""appalled"" by what had emerged during the trial. ""When I heard what Capt Spanton had to say even I didn't believe it could be that bad. ""When they are saying they are making a policy decision to deliberately breach the codes of practice and breach the Attorney General's guidelines, even I couldn't believe it could be that bad."" Mr Cherry said the investigation had been ""deliberately improper"". ""Here they are deliberately getting it wrong, they are looking the opposite way. They are only looking for their guilt, not their innocence."" He said those managing the RMP must be investigated. An Army spokeswoman said: ""Despite the outcome, we will consider carefully whether any internal disciplinary action is necessary. ""Given this ruling, the Service Prosecuting Authority and the Royal Military Police will be conducting a review to ensure that lessons are learned."" Human rights campaign group Liberty has said the collapse of the trial should be a ""wake-up"" call to the British Army. Emma Norton, from the group, said those serving their country deserve better that a ""shoddy second-rate"" justice system. ""When someone commits a crime on British soil - whether soldier or civilian - that crime should be investigated by civilian police,"" she said. ""As this scathing ruling shows, military police do not have the resources, expertise or impartiality to conduct proper, fair investigations - and, when they fail, soldiers and their families have no independent oversight body to turn to for help.""

"The court heard Sophie Lionnet's body showed signs of ""significant violence"" A French nanny whose charred remains were found in a garden was held captive and badly beaten before her death, a court has heard. The body of Sophie Lionnet, 21, was discovered at a house in Southfields, south London, on 20 September. Her former employers Sabrina Kouider, 34, and her partner Ouissem Medouni, 40, are on trial for Ms Lionnet's murder at the Old Bailey. The couple have admitted they tried to dispose of her body, but deny murder. Prosecutor Richard Horwell QC said: ""Sophie was trapped in a domestic nightmare."" He told jurors Ms Lionnet's body showed signs of ""significant violence"" including ""fractures to her sternum, to four of her ribs and to her jawbone"". Ouissem Medouni and Sabrina Kouider deny murder The court heard Ms Lionnet lived a ""bizarre and oppressive"" life under French nationals Ms Kouider and Mr Medoun. Mr Horwell said Ms Kouider accused the nanny of being ""in league"" with her former partner Mark Walton, who is an original Boyzone band member. Ms Kouider had ""a fixation"" with Mr Walton and said he controlled her through ""black magic"", the jury were told. The court heard Ms Lionnet had gone to live with the couple shortly after her 20th birthday. ""Sophie was not only young, but also, we suggest, naive and particularly vulnerable and this made her an easy target for abuse and exploitation,"" Mr Horwell said. The court heard Ms Kouider made a series of accusations against Ms Lionnet including that she'd conspired to ""sexually abuse the entire family"". Mr Horwell said Ms Lionnet ""complained that she was being beaten and that she was not allowed to return to her home in France"". Sophie Lionnet's body was found after neighbours raised concerns about a fire in a back garden Ms Lionnet's body was found after neighbours raised concerns about a fire in the couple's back garden. Mr Horwell said: ""The defendants burned her body in the garden of their home in the hope that no-one would ever discover her remains. ""Their plan was to dispose of Sophie's body and to explain her disappearance by inventing a story that she had left their employment under something of a cloud and returned to France."" Following her death, more than eight hours of ""harrowing"" recordings were recovered from the defendants' mobile phones of Ms Lionnet being interrogated, the court heard. Mr Horwell said they depicted ""a young emaciated, frightened and helpless woman"". The trial continues.

Driverless cars on UK roads by 2021 - really? UK plans 200-mile 'country roads' driverless trial Many states across America have welcomed the tests in the hope of keeping themselves at the forefront of new technology. However, there have been warnings that the technology is being deployed before it is ready. Anthony Foxx, who served as US Secretary of Transportation under former President Barack Obama,called the accident,externala ""wake up call to the entire [autonomous vehicle] industry and government to put a high priority on safety."" More than a dozen states in the US allow autonomous vehicles on the roads to some degree. Officials typically require a person to be on hand either in the car or remotely in case something goes wrong, according to the Center for Automotive Research. The US is working on national safety guidelines for such vehicles. A self-driving car at the Google headquarters in 2015 Consumer Watchdog, a lobby group that has warned of the risks of autonomous cars, on Monday called for a moratorium of such vehicles on public roads, describing the accident as a ""tragedy we have been fighting years to prevent"".

"In the summer of 1937 a nine-month-old girl was hidden, with her hands tied, in a blackberry bush in southern England. She was found by sheer chance by a family of holidaymakers. Now 80, Anthea Ring has spent most of her life wondering why she was left to die and who her parents were. Thanks to a leap forward in genetic genealogy she finally has some answers. Jane Dodd was tired. The 11-year-old was walking over the South Downs with her family on a bright August day. Ahead were her parents Arthur and Margaret and her older sister Elizabeth. Every year they travelled from south London for a fortnight's holiday in Worthing. Her father would insist on an invigorating walk in the afternoons. It was still hot, even at 6pm. There was no shade up here, just grassland, gorse and blackberry bushes. Suddenly her mother stopped. ""There's a baby up here,"" she said. Her father turned around. ""Of course there isn't, there's no-one up here,"" he said. ""I haven't had five children and not know what a baby sounds like,"" her mother replied. The family started searching through the scrubland. Minutes later they found a blonde child hidden deep in a blackberry bush. She was wearing a pink dress and looked about one year old. She had scratches and insect bites. Her hands were tied tightly in front of her. The Dodd family on a trip to Worthing, around the time they found the baby girl Nine years later, Anthea Ring was playing with her friend, Peter, on the road outside her Surrey home.  But an argument began and she threatened to go and complain to her mother. ""She's not your mother, you're adopted,"" he replied. Shocked, Anthea ran home and that evening her parents sat her down for a talk. ""They told me I was left on the doorstep of Worthing Hospital when I was a newborn baby,"" Anthea says. ""They had lost a daughter, Veronica, three years before, and decided to adopt me."" Anthea was very excited by the news. Adopted children were usually the heroines in books she devoured about Swiss chalet schools. ""I remember thinking I could tell my friends at school the next day,"" she says. ""It didn't cross my mind to think about who my birth parents were. I was obviously so secure."" She was doted on by her parents, sleeping in a warm back bedroom in winter and a cool front bedroom in summer. Her adoptive father, Douglas Shannan, worked for the Ministry of Food and Anthea remembers going on trips with him to inspect egg-grading stations. ""He was a very kind man, I loved going out with him,"" she says. Anthea found out she was adopted from a friend on her street She describes her mother Margaret as warm and friendly but quite nervous due to the loss of her first daughter. Margaret was intelligent but hadn't been able to follow her sister to Girton College, Cambridge, as the family couldn't afford it. Margaret wanted Anthea to train as a teacher but she wanted to get a job at the first opportunity. At 15 she went to work for the Bourne and Hollingsworth department store in Oxford Street. A few years later she trained to be a nurse in Bath, where she met her future husband Francis. Two children, Jonathan and Christine, followed. One day in 1961, Anthea took baby pictures of Christine over to her parents' house. They said she was the spitting image of Anthea as a baby. ""Then my father said to my mother, 'You'll have to show her now Peggy,' and she went upstairs,"" Anthea recalls. Margaret returned with a newspaper clipping, with a picture of a baby. Anthea asked who it was. ""It's you,"" her mother replied. The police logbook shows Mac (Adamson) assigned to Anthea's case Anthea learned she had been discovered by Arthur Dodd on a hillside near Worthing on 26 August 1937. Scotland Yard had launched an attempted murder investigation and made a nationwide appeal for information, but never discovered how she came to be there or who her parents were. Margaret wrote to the hospital offering her a home, after reading about her case in the newspaper. Several other people offered to take Anthea, including a Belgian diplomat, but the Shannans were chosen because they had experience raising a child - Veronica, who had been knocked over by a car when she was seven. ""My mother said that when they walked in to the ward I came to the end of the cot and put my arms out,"" Anthea says. ""They paid the juvenile court 11 shillings and sixpence and took me home to Surrey."" After receiving this shocking news, Anthea went home and cried. She told her husband but they decided not to tell their children and she put it to the back of her mind. Anthea with her two eldest children, Jonathan and Christine Decades passed, and Anthea's children had children of their own. Her grandson, Aaron, was also a spitting image of Anthea as a baby and it made her wonder once again who she was. In 1994 she joined a group called Norcap, which helped adopted adults find out more about their past. A member of the group suggested she write to the police in Worthing to see if they had any records. And even though 57 years had passed, the Police Superintendent for West Sussex was able to put her in touch with a retired policeman who had worked the case. He was known as Mac. ""He told me he'd been on crowd control in Worthing that day as they'd had a famous film star at the cinema. He got called back after I was found and was put on door-to-door enquiries,"" Anthea says. ""He said he'd carried my photo in his wallet for years and would produce it if he thought someone might know me, but no-one ever did."" Mac was convinced Anthea was not a local child, as it would have been impossible to keep such a secret in a small community. He thought she could have been brought on the train from London. Their meeting was reported in the local paper, after Mac told the local retired policeman's association about it. The wider press got wind of the story and Anthea was once again the focus of national news. Weeks later she received a letter simply addressed to Anthea, with the name of a local TV show she had featured on. It was from Elizabeth Dodd - the eldest daughter of the family who had found her on the Downs. Jane and Elizabeth around the time they found baby Anthea ""She said I'd ruined her holiday all those years ago because she had wanted her parents to adopt me and they wouldn't,"" Anthea says. Elizabeth told her the family had been returning from a walk when her mother had heard her cries. They had taken her to the nearest house but it didn't have a phone so they carried her on to the big farmhouse in the village of Sompting. ""They were having a tennis party and passed me around the dining room,"" Anthea says. ""One of the farmer's daughters called the police and I was taken to hospital."" Elizabeth has since died, but her younger sister Jane, now 92, still remembers that day. She says the family was walking along the side of Cissbury Ring when her mother heard Anthea's cries. ""My mother and sister did everything while I held my father's hand,"" she says. ""That night I was very frightened as I thought we'd taken someone's baby and they would be cross with us."" Jane, 92, with Anthea, 80. They first met on the South Downs when Jane was 11 and Anthea was a baby She remembers that her parents called the hospital the next day and were told the baby had been called Ann. Anthea also received a letter from Betty, a nurse who had looked after her at Worthing Hospital. ""Apparently I was put in a cot in the sister's office. Betty realised I needed a name when she handed over at the end of her shift. She called me Ann, as it was her favourite name,"" Anthea says. Anthea stayed at Worthing Hospital for six months while the police investigated. Her only injuries were to the skin of her wrists, where she had been bound. ""Apparently the ward sister used to take me out in a pram and walk up and down the front. I've always loved the sound of seagulls,"" Anthea says. Anthea with two doctors from Worthing Hospital Although Anthea now knew far more about how she was found and cared for, she was no closer to finding her parents. Her only clue was Mac's hunch that she had come from London. There were no further breakthroughs until 2012, when Anthea, then 75, decided to take a DNA test. This revealed her ethnicity was 92% Irish and matched her with some distant cousins in America and Ireland. One cousin called Joan, living in North Carolina, asked relatives in her extended family tree to take tests. This revealed Joan was linked to Anthea through her father's maternal side. They came from County Mayo in Ireland. ""I met Joan in 2013. She was the first blood relative I had ever met so it was quite something,"" Anthea says. Two years later she matched with a woman who worked at Dublin University, called Ann. Ann didn't match with Joan, which suggested she was from the other side of Anthea's family. Ann's family came from County Galway. By this time Anthea had joined online communities for adoptees and foundlings and in April 2016 she was contacted by genetic genealogist Julia Bell, who offered to help. Julia and Anthea sift through the records Bell had managed to track down her own American GI grandfather using DNA and genealogical research. She had then started helping other people look for their relatives in her spare time. ""Knowing who her family was changed my mother's life,"" Bell says. ""I believe everyone deserves to know who they really are."" Anthea and Bell met at Paddington Station, where Anthea told her everything she had found out up to that point. Bell encouraged Anthea to take some further DNA tests with different companies, knowing that millions more people had joined DNA databases since Anthea tested in 2012. This provided further distant cousin matches. ""We then used genealogy to build trees to find possible common ancestors and then brought the lines down,"" Bell says. ""It was a lot of work because families could have 12 children and there was a lot of intermarriage. This could make people seem like closer matches than they actually were."" After months of work with the help of genealogist Angie Bush, Bell had narrowed down the search. She was confident one parent was a Coyne from County Galway and the other was an O'Donnell from County Mayo. She was considering the seven daughters of a John O'Donnell when things began to fall into place. ""I was looking at the youngest daughter, Ellen O'Donnell, who was born in 1911,"" she says. Irish amateur historian Catherine Corless had told Bell that Ellen's official name would be a Saint's name - and baptismal records revealed this was Helena. Then came the eureka moment. ""Earlier on I had ordered records of illegitimate births in England and Ireland in 1936. I had come across an unmarried mother called Lena O'Donnell but dismissed it. ""Suddenly I thought: 'Of course, Lena could be Helena!'"" Corless found out Lena O'Donnell had got married in Ireland in 1945, seven years after Anthea had been found, and had given birth to four more children. She tracked down one of the sons who agreed to have a DNA test. In April 2017 the test confirmed Bell's hunch. He was Anthea's half-brother. ""I was sitting in the garden in the sun when Julia rang,"" Anthea says. ""She told me my birth mother was Lena O'Donnell. I was delighted."" Anthea's birth certificate revealed she was born on 20 November 1936, just five days after the date her parents picked for her birthday. Her birth name was Mary Veronica. Lena had been moving between digs in Cricklewood when Anthea was born at St Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington. She gave her occupation as a machine operator at a telephone factory. She was taken in by a charity for unmarried mothers called the Home for Guardian Angels after leaving hospital on 7 December. However, she didn't stay long. A baptismal record from 18 December reveals Lena moved with her baby to another home called Devon Nook in Chiswick. This Roman Catholic home was unusual for the time as it encouraged the mothers to look after their babies and to keep them if they could. It's the last known record of Lena O'Donnell until she appears on an electoral roll in 1939 back in Cricklewood. Mary Veronica O'Donnell disappears altogether. ""What happened after Lena left Devon Nook?"" Bell asks, rhetorically. ""I don't think she was the one who abandoned Anthea. I think she did a brave thing and decided to try and keep the baby."" Lena O'Donnell was staying at Devon Nook when Anthea was baptised at four weeks old Had Lena wanted to abandon her baby there were easier ways to do it in a big city. An article in the Daily Herald from 28 August 1937 reported 12 abandoned babies were lying in London hospitals. ""They have all been found in the last 10 weeks in railway carriages, churches, station waiting rooms, public parks and on the doorsteps of private houses."" A search for the mothers of 15 recently abandoned children had only succeeded in two cases, it added. So how did Anthea end up on the South Downs? One theory is that Lena left Anthea with a foster mother while she went out to work. Newspaper reports from the time reveal some foster mothers offered to get children in their care adopted for a fee. They would then sell the child to a couple or another broker. An article from 1932 in the Gloucester Citizen, said the traffic in babies was ""becoming one of the greater evils of London"". A director of the National Children Adoption Association is quoted as saying: ""Americans are often willing to pay a high price for fair-headed babies, especially with curls. They call them the pure Anglo-Saxon typeâ¦ At present they are bought and sold more easily than motor cars."" It's possible an exchange of the fair-haired Anthea had been planned near Worthing, and that it somehow went wrong on the day. ""I may never know what happened to me but I've come to terms with it,"" Anthea says. A bridleway leading down from Cissbury Ring, near where Anthea was left At that point her father had still not been identified, but Bell had narrowed down the search to six brothers. Four of them - Michael, Martin, Patrick and Phillip Coyne - had been working as labourers in London in 1936. Martin's daughter agreed to be tested and the results revealed she was a first cousin. This confirmed one of the other three would be Anthea's father. Michael's granddaughter Anne Marie was tested and the result also ruled Michael out. This left just Patrick and Phillip, but as neither had direct descendants the only thing that could prove paternity would be a sample of their DNA - hard to find years after their death. However, Anthea was also in touch with a first cousin called Dot, who was the daughter of one of Patrick and Phillip's sisters. ""I was telling Dot about the problem when she said: 'Well I've still got letters that Patrick sent me,'"" Anthea says. The letters, still in their original stamped envelopes, had been sent from England to the US about 30 years earlier. Bell approached David Nicholson of Living DNA. He said his company could use a recently developed forensic test to capture Patrick's DNA from the saliva left when he licked the stamps and envelope. Last year they took a sample of Anthea's saliva and compared it to small sections cut from the letters. David Nicholson reveals the results of the DNA test to Anthea and Julia Bell The DNA in the first three samples was too degraded to use. However on the fourth, Nicholson said ""we hit on more than enough DNA"". The test, which Nicholson says has ""a degree of accuracy acceptable in UK courts"", proved Patrick Coyne was Anthea's biological father. ""I was so happy as I'd been looking for my father for 29 years,"" Anthea says. Anthea isn't currently in contact with her mother's relatives, although she says her half-brother who took the DNA test ""wishes me well"". However, she has enjoyed getting to know her father's side of the family. ""They told me Patrick was a very lively man, the life and soul of the party,"" Anthea says. ""We don't know if Patrick ever knew about me. He never married and once told Dot it was because he liked his independence and didn't want to be tied down."" Now 80 and living near Bath, Anthea says she is grateful to both Lena and Patrick for the DNA she inherited from them, as she is pretty healthy for someone of her age. But her long journey to learn about her origins hasn't changed how she remembers her adoptive parents. Last summer she had a family party with her children, grandchildren and cousins.

"This video can not be played 'I lost Â£15,000 in a day gambling on FOBTs' The maximum stake for fixed odds betting terminals (FOBT) should be cut to Â£30 or less, the UK's Gambling Commission has recommended. Currently people can bet up to Â£100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games, such as roulette and blackjack. It comes after a consultation on FOBTs for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The commission says the maximum stake on ""slots games"", like traditional fruit machine games, should be Â£2. The advice has been given,externalto support the government with its review of gambling machines, with a decision expected in coming weeks. FOTBs have come under criticism for encouraging high-stakes gambling and exposing people to the risk of gambling harm.   The machines have been called the ""crack cocaine"" of gambling by campaigners who say they let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social problems. And Tim Miller, executive director of the Gambling Commission, told the BBC that its remit when considering stake recommendations had been ""to protect vulnerable people from harm"". Why the gambling industry faces an uncertain future Fixed-odds terminals were introduced in casinos and betting shops in 1999, and offer computerised games at the touch of a button. The Gambling Commission's report said the Â£30 limit for casino-type games had been recommended, because a higher limit means players could potentially ""lose large amounts of money in a short space of time"". The government now has to decide whether to accept the commission's advice on the stake limit,  or decide to impose a lower figure. The government began to look at FOBT machines in October 2016, when it made a ""call for evidence"" on the number and location of terminals and the measures in place to protect players. Now Gambling Commission chief executive Neil McArthur has said: ""We've put consumers at the heart of our advice - advice which is based on the best available evidence and is focused on reducing the risk of gambling-related harm. ""In our judgment, a stake cut for Fixed Odds Betting Terminals alone doesn't go far enough to protect vulnerable people. ""That is why we have recommended a stake cut plus a comprehensive package of other measures to protect consumers. We have proposed actions that will tackle both the risk of harm and provide solutions that are sustainable in the longer term."" These include working with the gambling industry and others on steps to make limit-setting more effective - this could include ending sessions when consumers reach time and money limits. Another recommendation is a proposed ban on machines being able to allow different - high and low stake - categories of games to be played in a single session. FOBT machines generated more than Â£1.8bn in tax revenue last year. However, Mr Miller of the Gambling Commission told the BBC that although the gambling industry had argued that any cuts in stakes would harm the sector, those arguments played no part in its recommendations to government. Earlier government estimates had suggested that a Â£2 cap could lead to a Â£5.5bn loss in tax revenues over the next 10 years. But MPs on the FOBTs All Party Parliamentary Group have said large gambling sector losses have been exaggerated. Rather, quoting the Centre for Economic and Business Research think tank, they say the cost of problem gambling in the UK is Â£1.5bn a year, ""when its impact on wider social welfare is taken into account - including areas such as employment, mental health and financial stability"". Investors appeared to welcome the recommendations, as shares in gambling firms climbed strongly after the commission's announcement, with Ladbrokes Coral closing 2.8% higher and William Hill shares ending 4% up. ""This should be a relief for the sector as the worst-case scenario looks to have been avoided. Ministers will now have to justify a cut below Â£30 on grounds of significant risk of harm,"" said analyst Neil Wilson at ETX Capital. The Association of British Bookmakers has claimed that a Â£30 maximum stake would see 2,100 betting shops closed and 10,000 jobs lost. ""We fully understand that there is public concern and that there will be a stake cut to reduce the levels of losses on machines in betting shops,"" it said after the Gambling Commission's announcement. ""In the interim, we remain committed to introducing further measures to address problem gambling and will continue to work with all interested parties."" But Grant Humphrey, Betting and Gaming lead at professional services firm EY warned: ""A Â£30 maximum stake may lead to shop closures and job losses and could lead to a wave of industry consolidation."" Tom Watson MP, Labour's Shadow Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, said: ""This is a deeply disappointing report from the Gambling Commission who appear to have caved in to industry pressure. ""These machines are at the heart of the UK's hidden epidemic of problem gambling. The Government must cut the stake to Â£2 on all FOBT machines including the highly addictive roulette style games, as well as increase the delay between each play."" Carolyn Harris, chair of the FOBTs All Party Parliamentary Group, said: ""The problem is that these machines are addictive. ""It has got to be Â£2 [maximum stake], nothing else is acceptable.  It is now for the Secretary of State to make a decision."" The Gambling Commission recommendations have been sent to Matt Hancock, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.  Ministers now have to decide whether to implement any of the commission's recommendations. Charity GambleAware said it welcomed the commission's ""contributions to the ongoing discussion"". ""In the meantime, we are waiting to hear what the ministers conclude in their review, and hope to hear the results soon.""

"A disgruntled gamer is thought to be behind a hoax email sent to about 400 schools in England threatening to bomb school grounds if money was not paid. A number of schools were evacuated but police said there was no evidence the threats were terror-related. Schools in London, Manchester and North Yorkshire were among those affected. The email appeared to come from gaming server VeltPvP, but the company said the account had been ""spoofed"" and the message had not come from them. The US firm's 17-year-old CEO told the BBC he suspected the hoax emails had been sent by a disgruntled Minecraft player in a bid to damage VeltPvP's reputation. The email address requested payment to an email address that used the domain veltpvp.com but the website posted messages on Twitter denying any involvement. It said: ""We have nothing to do with the bomb threats that were sent out to the 400+ UK schools. ""We're extremely sorry for anyone who had to deal with this, but just know it's fake."" VeltPvP is mainly used by gamers aged eight to 18 VeltPvP.com is a US-based online ""player-versus-player"" server that allows gamers to compete against other users in the world-building game Minecraft. Carson Kallen, the 17-year-old CEO of the firm, told the BBC he had a team of 50 people  managing 10,000 users a day. He says: ""Everyone who plays it is between the ages of eight and 18 years old - it's all kids playing."" Mr Kallen told the BBC: ""Every now and then we have a little rebel who will try to do something bad like this. We've had stuff like this happen before but nothing this extreme."" He said it was likely that a disgruntled user orchestrated the attack: ""He was probably a player who got banned from our server and got mad. This is his way of trying to make us look bad."" Sarah Stephenson was at her son's school, Oathall Community College in West Sussex, waiting for a meeting when it was evacuated. ""I noticed a little bit of activity going on. I went through to student support and all of a sudden a notification went out that the school was being evacuated. ""My son George was in class at the time. The students were evacuated out of the school building and told to ring their parents. An email was sent out to all the parents."" Another affected school, Dowdales secondary in Cumbria, tweeted: ""As you may know the school office received a threatening email this morning. ""The decision was taken to evacuate the school as a precaution. Students and staff are safe and have returned to normal lessons.""

Both the Home Office and the Department for Education advised any school that received the email to contact their local police force - even though a version of the email that has been posted on Twitter warns the schools not to.

But Ella Pamfilova, head of the Central Electoral Commission, said there were only half as many reported violations compared to 2012, and that none had been serious. Sunday's vote was also the first in Crimea since Russia seized the region from Ukraine. Mr Putin's victory rally coincided with the anniversary of the annexation. The annexation was bitterly contested by Kiev and ratcheted up tensions between Russia and the West. Russians living in Ukraine were unable to take part in Sunday's vote because access to Russian diplomatic missions was blocked by the Kiev government. The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says a sudden thaw with the West seems unlikely, given Mr Putin's first comments after his victory. Western governments are expecting more cyber-attacks and attempts to disrupt elections, previous cases of which have been blamed on Russia. But some analysts believe that squaring up to the West has only limited appeal, and sooner or later the Russian president will have to address domestic concerns like education, housing and health care.

"Capt Voloshyn pictured at Mykolaiv airbase in 2016 A Ukrainian military pilot blamed by Russia over the 2014 downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 has killed himself, Ukrainian media report, quoting police. Capt Vladyslav Voloshyn had called the Russian allegation a lie. Dutch investigators concluded that a Russian Buk missile had destroyed the Boeing 777 jet, killing 298 people. Reports say Voloshyn shot himself at home in Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea. Ukraine described him as a war hero. He had flown 33 combat missions in a low-flying Su-25 ground attack jet against Russian-backed separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, and had been granted a medal for bravery. Recently the 29-year-old had been in charge of the Mykolaiv airport, after resigning from the air force. The southern city near Odessa is called Nikolayev by Russian speakers. A statement from Mykolaiv police on Facebook (in Ukrainian),externaldescribed Voloshyn's death as ""suicide"", but it is being investigated under the ""premeditated murder"" section of Ukraine's penal code. A military service pistol was found at the scene and is now being examined by experts. Debris from MH17 at the crash site on 17 July 2014 The airliner, with 298 passengers and crew, was shot down on 17 July 2014 over war-torn eastern Ukraine. More than two-thirds of the passengers were Dutch, flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. After pro-Russian rebels launched their insurgency in April 2014 several Ukrainian jets were shot down by them, yet many international airlines continued flying over the conflict zone. MH17's high-altitude flight path was thought to be safe, despite warnings about the rebels' missile capability. Russian officials not only alleged that Voloshyn's plane had shot down MH17. According to another Russian theory, it was a Ukrainian military Buk missile - no longer in service in Russia - that downed the airliner. Independent experts - besides the Dutch-led team - rejected the Russian claims, saying the evidence pointed to a Buk fired by pro-Russian rebels or a Russian military unit.The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) wants to put the suspects on trial in the Netherlands,external, but that is fraught with legal difficulties. Ukrainian and US intelligence sources said the Buk system had been sent into rebel territory by Russia, then moved out again. Conspiracy Files: Who shot down MH17? MH17 dead remembered amid tears and sunflowers Flight MH17: Russia and its changing story Ukraine names Russia as 'aggressor' state Family members quoted by Ukrainian media said Voloshyn had been feeling depressed. They were in the flat when he shot himself on Sunday and his wife heard the shot. An ambulance was called but he died in hospital. A Ukrainian journalist who knew Voloshyn well,Yuriy Butusov, praised him on Facebook (in Russian) as an exemplary pilot who had fought bravely,externalagainst the Russian-backed rebels in the Donbass region. Butusov expressed bewilderment over Voloshyn's death. ""Dear Vlad, how can this be?! Why?!"" he wrote. ""He didn't let himself break down, he wasn't depressed at all - he always acted as an exemplary officer."" According to Butusov, Voloshyn had bombed Russian paratroops during the battle of Ilovaisk in August 2014, one of the bloodiest in the Donbass conflict. More than 300 Ukrainian soldiers died in the fighting there. Voloshyn was shot down but ejected from his Su-25, and reached Ukrainian lines despite severe injuries, Butusov said. ""I didn't hear him speak of any enemies or unresolved problems,"" he wrote, adding that Voloshyn was happily married and adored his wife, his little boy and two-year-old girl.

"Doctors have taken a major step towards curing the most common form of blindness in the UK - age-related macular degeneration. Douglas Waters, 86, could not see out of his right eye, but ""I can now read the newspaper"" with it, he says. He was one of two patients given pioneering stem cell therapy atMoorfields Eye Hospital in London,external. Cells from a human embryo were grown into a patch that was delicately inserted into the back of the eye. Douglas, who is from London, developed severe age-related macular degeneration in his right eye three years ago. The macula is the part of the eye that allows you to see straight ahead - whether to recognise faces, watch TV or read a book. He says: ""In the months before the operation my sight was really poor and I couldn't see anything out of my right eye. ""It's brilliant what the team have done and I feel so lucky to have been given my sight back."" The macula is made up of rods and cones that sense light and behind those are a layer of nourishing cells called the retinal pigment epithelium. When this support layer fails, it causes macular degeneration and blindness. Doctors have devised a way of building a new retinal pigment epithelium and surgically implanting it into the eye. The technique,published in Nature Biotechnology,external, starts with embryonic stem cells. These are a special type of cell that can become any other in the human body. They are converted into the type of cell that makes up the retinal pigment epithelium and embedded into a scaffold to hold them in place. The living patch is only one layer of cells thick - about 40 microns - and 6mm long and 4mm wide. It is then placed underneath the rods and cones in the back of the eye. The operation takes up to two hours. Prof Lyndon da Cruz, consultant retinal surgeon at Moorfields, told the BBC: ""We've restored vision where there was none. ""It's incredibly exciting. As you get older, parts of you stop working and for the first time we've been able to take a cell and make it into a specific part of the eye that's failing and put it back in the eye and get vision back."" However, he does not call this a ""cure"" as completely normal vision is not restored. Only one diseased eye was operated on in each patient. So far the patients, the other is a woman in her early sixties, have maintained improved vision in the treated eye for a year. They went from not being able to read with their affected eye at all, to reading 60 to 80 words per minute. Eight more patients will take part in this clinical trial. Doctors need to be sure it is safe. One concern is the transplanted cells could become cancerous, although there have been no such signs so far. Mums' Down's syndrome video goes viral Essential oils 'make male breasts develop' UK teacher wins global best teacher prize Prof Pete Coffey, from the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, said: ""This study represents real progress in regenerative medicine. ""We hope this will lead to an affordable 'off-the-shelf' therapy that could be made available to NHS patients within the next five years."" More than 600,000 people have age-related macular degeneration in the UK. It's the leading cause of blindness and the third globally. Both patients in the trial had ""wet"" age-related macular degeneration. This form of the disease is caused by abnormal blood vessels growing through the retinal pigment epithelium and damaging the macula. Dry age-related macular degeneration is more common and caused by the retinal pigment epithelium breaking down. It is hoped the patch will be able to treat both forms of the disease. Dr Carmel Toomes, from Leeds Institutes of Molecular Medicine, said: ""What's exciting about this study is that the patients recorded an increase in vision. ""To see an improvement is a good sign that this therapy may help patients in the future, although further studies are needed before real conclusions can be drawn.""

"A British woman volunteer with the all-female Kurdish armed unit the YPJ has been killed in Syria, her father has told the BBC. It is understood Anna Campbell, 26, from Lewes in East Sussex, died on 15 March in Afrin, which has been under bombardment by Turkish forces. Dirk Campbell said his daughter was ""very idealistic"" and ""determined"". Turkey has been fighting Kurdish groups on Syrian territory close to its border since January. Why Turkey is targeting Kurdish enclave in Syria Kurds ousted from heart of Syrian city Ms Campbell, who was a qualified plumber in the UK, travelled to Syria in May 2017 to help the Kurds, who were battling the Islamic State group. Her father said: ""She wanted to create a better world and she would do everything in her power to do that."" He added: ""I told her of course that she was putting her life in danger, which she knew full well she was doing. ""I feel I should have done more to persuade her to come back, but she was completely adamant."" British police have repeatedly warned against travelling to Syria, and have advised that becoming involved with any armed group could lead to arrest and prosecution. Two Britons accused of fighting against Islamic State have been charged with terrorism offences and others have been arrested. The BBC understands Ms Campbell had originally been involved in the fighting with the YPJ in Deir ez-Zor, where IS have continued to hold the last of their territory. But in January, Turkish forces began a major offensive against the Kurds along the northern Syrian border. Many Kurdish fighters left the fight against IS to defend Afrin and some British volunteers are known to have joined them. Mr Campbell told the BBC he understands his daughter's Kurdish comrades tried to stop her. Ms Campbell dyed her hair black before moving on to Afrin ""With fair hair and blue eyes they knew she would stand out, but she dyed her hair black and persuaded them to let her go,"" he said. He added: ""I contacted my MP Maria Caulfield as soon as I knew she was in danger from the Turkish bombardment. ""I emailed my MP and said my daughter is in danger, you have to get on to the Foreign Office and get them to put pressure on Turkey to stop."" Turkey sees the YPJ and associated YPG as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a link that the Kurds deny. Ahmet Berat Conkar - an MP from Turkey's ruling AK Party and head of the Turkish delegation to Nato - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the YPG and PKK are ""the same organisation"" with ""the same organisational structure"" and ""the same leadership"". He described the PKK as a ""very dangerous terrorist organisation"" with ""an evil ideology"" which pushed ""young people into the frontlines"". He also accused the organisation of recruiting child soldiers. Turkish forces stepped up their offensive in Afrin in January YPJ commander in Syria, Nesrin Abdullah, said Ms Campbell had ""insisted"" on leaving for Afrin, adding: ""Although we tried to keep her far from the frontlines, the attacks from the Turkish state were very heavy."" Friends of Ms Campbell in Syria told the BBC she was killed by Turkish airstrikes, describing her as a feminist with ""sincerity and courage"" who wanted to fight for women's liberation in the Middle East. She is the first British woman to have died in Syria with the YPG or YPJ, but the eighth citizen to have been killed while assisting the groups. Mr Campbell said he was ""in pieces"", having only heard about the death on Sunday. He said his daughter had been involved in human rights activism in the UK and it was the Kurdish aim of creating a democratic society in the wake of IS that inspired her to join them. ""When she heard about the political experiment in Rojava [the Kurdish area of northern Syria] this seemed to her to be the way the world should be"" ""The social organisation at all levels, the equality. She wanted to help protect that.""

"Collisions started to cause delays on the A30 on Sunday afternoon A new severe weather warning of ice has been issued as wintry weather continues around much of the UK. All of Wales and most of Englandis covered by the yellow Met Office warning,,externalwhich is in place from Monday evening until Tuesday at 9:00 GMT. Hundreds of schools closed in south-west England and Wales because of heavy snow. Temperatures are expected to rise this week but the weather could turn colder again by the weekend, forecasters said. Over 20cm (8ins) of snow has been recorded in central and southern England as temperatures fell widely below 0C overnight with lows of -5C in Scotland. In Wales, a total of 207 schools were closed on Monday, with GCSE pupils at Brynmawr School in Blaenau Gwentbeing taught in a cinema instead.

Other stranded drivers camped in their vehicles at a service station on the A30 in Okehampton, which was blocked by heavy snow until it fully reopened in the morning. A 64-mile stretch of the A30 in Devon was closed but reopened on Monday morning Richard White, volunteer rest centre manager at Okehampton College - where 82 people, including children, spent the night - said: ""It's the last thing you expect to get stuck in the snow. ""One lady said she felt like a refugee. ""It was -3C and it didn't stop snowing until 06:00. It's been a really horrid night."" Newly-married couple John and Sara Lund, who were travelling to their honeymoon in Cornwall, were forced to spend their wedding night at the rest centre. The couple became stranded on the way to their honeymoon The groom, Mr Lund, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he and his new bride spent their first night sleeping on a mat on ""rock-hard floors"" in a classroom with around 20 other stranded people. ""It's probably a story which has helped keep morale high in the camp,"" Mr Lund said. A 64-mile stretch of the A30 from the M5 at Exeter to near Bodmin in Cornwall was closed by Devon and Cornwall Police to allow its officers and Highways England to clear the route. The force warned drivers to only travel if necessary and ""slow down"". The runway at Exeter Airport was closed but reopened just after 11:00 GMT, although some flights were delayed or cancelled. Temperatures dropped across many parts of the UK overnight causing partly melted snow to refreeze. In parts of England, temperatures fell to -2C and -3C and -5C in central Scotland.

Temperatures are expected to rise into double figures this week but could become colder by the weekend bringing some frost, BBC Weather said. Met Office forecaster Craig Snell added: ""Generally we are out of the woods but anyone hoping for a spring heatwave will have to wait."" Mr Snell said the UK should now see the start of a ""gradual thaw"" - but added there is still a risk of frost and ice, including on Tuesday morning. He said the weather will become ""briefly milder then turning colder come the weekend, but not as cold and not as snowy as the weekend just gone"".

"UK Brexit Minister David Davis (L) and EU chief negotiator Michelle Barnier met in Brussels on Monday The EU and UK have not reached agreement on the Irish border despite ""decisive"" progress on other Brexit issues. The EU's negotiator Michel Barnier said the two sides had agreed on a transition period. It will begin from Brexit day - 29 March 2019 - and is designed to smooth the path to the future permanent relationship. The so-called backstop option for the Irish border remains a sticking point. UK and EU agree terms for Brexit transition What is the Brexit transition phase? Brexit: All you need to know That option would mean Northern Ireland essentially remaining in the single market and customs union if no other border solution can be found. The Democratic Unionist Party said it was not concerned by Monday's announcement. ""The border issue has not been resolved at this stage and we didn't expect it to be,"" said a party statement. Sinn FÃ©in MEP Martina Anderson said the announcement meant ""the British government is accepting the agreements made, including the backstop option, which would see the north remaining in the customs union and significant elements of the single market"". The Conservative MP and former Northern Ireland secretary, Theresa Villiers, said the EU's last resort proposal - of a hard border - remained unacceptable to the UK. ""The government has very clearly ruled that out,"" she said. ""And the presence of that option three in the document is, you know, only a backstop. ""It's only there if the other proposed solutions aren't agreed. ""And the government published a perfectly credible set of propositions for how we could maintain a border on the island of Ireland which is more or less as free-flowing and open as it is today."" Theresa May previously said she would never put her name to any Brexit treaty that divided Britain and Northern Ireland Prime Minister Theresa May has previously warned the EU that she would ""never"" put her name to any Brexit treaty that divided Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK has agreed that a back stop is required but there is no agreement on how that would work in practice. A round of talks focusing solely on Irish issues is due to begin next week. Some Irish issues have been fully agreed, notably the Common Travel Area. However, in a draft agreement published on Monday, most Irish issues were either not agreed or required clarification or drafting changes.

"Cardinal Keith O'Brien resigned as archbishop in February 2013 Cardinal Keith O'Brien, formerly the Catholic Church's most senior cleric in Britain, has died at the age of 80. The cardinal, whoresigned as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh in 2013after apologising for sexual misconduct, was hurt in a recent fall. He was being cared for in Newcastle and was transferred to hospital there after suffering a head injury. His successor administered the last rites on Friday, on the eve of the cardinal's 80th birthday. Cardinal Keith O'Brien - a man of conviction and controversy Commenting upon the news of his death,Archbishop Leo Cushley of St Andrews and Edinburghsaid: ""In life, Cardinal O'Brien may have divided opinion. ""In death, however, I think all can be united in praying for the repose of his soul, for comfort for his grieving family and that support and solace be given to those whom he offended, hurt and let down. May he rest in peace."" Cardinal Keith O'Brien at the Gillis Centre in Edinburgh in 2012 Cardinal O'Brien resigned in February 2013 after three priests and a former priest alleged improper conduct back in the 1980s. He initially contested the allegations but later apologised, saying his sexual conduct had ""fallen beneath the standards"" expected of him. The collapse of Cardinal Keith O'Brien's formidable reputation, though late in his career, was sudden and steep.  Up until his 75th birthday, in 2013, he was one of the most senior figures in Scottish Catholicism and a highly decorated cleric. He received several honorary doctorates, both from Scottish and overseas universities, and held the position of Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion among the Knights of Malta, one of the ancient chivalric orders. The Observer first reported the allegations of four individuals who accused Cardinal O'Brien of inappropriate sexual behaviour, within the Diocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh.  He initially contested the allegations but took the unprecedented decision not to take part in the Papal conclave, which elected Pope Francis. The Herald, in 2015, suggested that Cardinal O'Brienhad used confession by young clerics as a device for sexual grooming,external. The charge of hypocrisy was further compounded byhis outspoken opposition to same sex marriageand apparent defence of traditional morality while allegedly engaged in predatory behaviour. Cardinal O'Brien's health had deteriorated since the fall last month in which he broke his collarbone and suffered a head injury. The Little Sisters of the Poor, who run a nursing home in Newcastle upon Tyne, were caring for him. Archbishop Cushley visited him in hospital to administer the sacrament. Cardinal O'Brien apologised to the church and to the people of Scotland Keith O'Brien was born in Ballycastle, County Antrim, in 1938. He was educated in Scotland, attending St Patrick's High School in Dumbarton and Holy Cross Academy in Edinburgh. After graduating from the University of Edinburgh, he attended St Andrew's College in Drygrange, being ordained as priest in April 1965. His first post as an assistant priest was at Holy Cross in Edinburgh. He was ordained as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh in 1985, and became cardinal in 2003. Cardinal O'Brien at a service at St Mary's in Edinburgh Retiring from public life, he said: ""I wish to take this opportunity to admit that there have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal. To those I have offended, I apologise and ask forgiveness. ""To the Catholic Church and people of Scotland, I also apologise. I will now spend the rest of my life in retirement. I will play no further part in the public life of the Catholic Church in Scotland."" Pope Francis accepted his resignation and stated Cardinal O'Brien would not take part in future papal elections, act as papal adviser, or take part in Vatican congregations and councils and would lose other roles as a cardinal. Alan Draper from In Care Abuse Survivors (INCAS), was also a former advisor to the Catholic Church. He said: ""The church continually showed a lack of compassion towards survivors, or any understanding of what they've suffered emotionally, physically and spiritually. And that is a key issue - the spiritual damage caused to abuse survivors. ""They were shocked and were concerned with a man with immense power who abused that power. ""There was this man living a double life effectively, saying homosexuality was bad and yet was leading a homosexual life himself. What we are seeing is double standards and it is not acceptable."" Catherine Deveney is the Observer journalist who broke the Cardinal O'Brien scandal. She says the issues around what happened were bigger than one man: ""He was a symptom of an organisation that had lost its way. ""Keith O'Brien was not a monster, he wasn't an ogre - he was just a weak man. ""And I hope in the last years of his life when he took off the mitre, took off the cardinal's robes, he found something more real. ""I hope he found peace at the end of his life and I think his victims would wish that for him too."" The president and vice-president of the Bishops' Conference of Scotland have also offered their condolences. Archbishop Philip Tartaglia said: ""On behalf of the Bishops' Conference of Scotland I wish to express my sincere sympathy on the death of the late Cardinal to his family and close friends. I ask for prayers for the repose of his soul. May he rest in peace."" Bishop Joseph Toal added: ""I will pray for the eternal repose of the soul of Cardinal Keith Patrick O'Brien. I extend my sympathy and prayerful support to his family, friends and all who mourn his passing. With constant hope in the Lord's goodness and mercy.""

"Capt Voloshyn pictured at Mykolaiv airbase in 2016 A Ukrainian military pilot blamed by Russia over the 2014 downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 has killed himself, Ukrainian media report, quoting police. Capt Vladyslav Voloshyn had called the Russian allegation a lie. Dutch investigators concluded that a Russian Buk missile had destroyed the Boeing 777 jet, killing 298 people. Reports say Voloshyn shot himself at home in Mykolaiv, near the Black Sea. Ukraine described him as a war hero. He had flown 33 combat missions in a low-flying Su-25 ground attack jet against Russian-backed separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine, and had been granted a medal for bravery. Recently the 29-year-old had been in charge of the Mykolaiv airport, after resigning from the air force. The southern city near Odessa is called Nikolayev by Russian speakers. A statement from Mykolaiv police on Facebook (in Ukrainian),externaldescribed Voloshyn's death as ""suicide"", but it is being investigated under the ""premeditated murder"" section of Ukraine's penal code. A military service pistol was found at the scene and is now being examined by experts. Debris from MH17 at the crash site on 17 July 2014 The airliner, with 298 passengers and crew, was shot down on 17 July 2014 over war-torn eastern Ukraine. More than two-thirds of the passengers were Dutch, flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. After pro-Russian rebels launched their insurgency in April 2014 several Ukrainian jets were shot down by them, yet many international airlines continued flying over the conflict zone. MH17's high-altitude flight path was thought to be safe, despite warnings about the rebels' missile capability. Russian officials not only alleged that Voloshyn's plane had shot down MH17. According to another Russian theory, it was a Ukrainian military Buk missile - no longer in service in Russia - that downed the airliner. Independent experts - besides the Dutch-led team - rejected the Russian claims, saying the evidence pointed to a Buk fired by pro-Russian rebels or a Russian military unit.The Joint Investigation Team (JIT) wants to put the suspects on trial in the Netherlands,external, but that is fraught with legal difficulties. Ukrainian and US intelligence sources said the Buk system had been sent into rebel territory by Russia, then moved out again. Conspiracy Files: Who shot down MH17? MH17 dead remembered amid tears and sunflowers Flight MH17: Russia and its changing story Ukraine names Russia as 'aggressor' state Family members quoted by Ukrainian media said Voloshyn had been feeling depressed. They were in the flat when he shot himself on Sunday and his wife heard the shot. An ambulance was called but he died in hospital. A Ukrainian journalist who knew Voloshyn well,Yuriy Butusov, praised him on Facebook (in Russian) as an exemplary pilot who had fought bravely,externalagainst the Russian-backed rebels in the Donbass region. Butusov expressed bewilderment over Voloshyn's death. ""Dear Vlad, how can this be?! Why?!"" he wrote. ""He didn't let himself break down, he wasn't depressed at all - he always acted as an exemplary officer."" According to Butusov, Voloshyn had bombed Russian paratroops during the battle of Ilovaisk in August 2014, one of the bloodiest in the Donbass conflict. More than 300 Ukrainian soldiers died in the fighting there. Voloshyn was shot down but ejected from his Su-25, and reached Ukrainian lines despite severe injuries, Butusov said. ""I didn't hear him speak of any enemies or unresolved problems,"" he wrote, adding that Voloshyn was happily married and adored his wife, his little boy and two-year-old girl.

"A disgruntled gamer is thought to be behind a hoax email sent to about 400 schools in England threatening to bomb school grounds if money was not paid. A number of schools were evacuated but police said there was no evidence the threats were terror-related. Schools in London, Manchester and North Yorkshire were among those affected. The email appeared to come from gaming server VeltPvP, but the company said the account had been ""spoofed"" and the message had not come from them. The US firm's 17-year-old CEO told the BBC he suspected the hoax emails had been sent by a disgruntled Minecraft player in a bid to damage VeltPvP's reputation. The email address requested payment to an email address that used the domain veltpvp.com but the website posted messages on Twitter denying any involvement. It said: ""We have nothing to do with the bomb threats that were sent out to the 400+ UK schools. ""We're extremely sorry for anyone who had to deal with this, but just know it's fake."" VeltPvP is mainly used by gamers aged eight to 18 VeltPvP.com is a US-based online ""player-versus-player"" server that allows gamers to compete against other users in the world-building game Minecraft. Carson Kallen, the 17-year-old CEO of the firm, told the BBC he had a team of 50 people  managing 10,000 users a day. He says: ""Everyone who plays it is between the ages of eight and 18 years old - it's all kids playing."" Mr Kallen told the BBC: ""Every now and then we have a little rebel who will try to do something bad like this. We've had stuff like this happen before but nothing this extreme."" He said it was likely that a disgruntled user orchestrated the attack: ""He was probably a player who got banned from our server and got mad. This is his way of trying to make us look bad."" Sarah Stephenson was at her son's school, Oathall Community College in West Sussex, waiting for a meeting when it was evacuated. ""I noticed a little bit of activity going on. I went through to student support and all of a sudden a notification went out that the school was being evacuated. ""My son George was in class at the time. The students were evacuated out of the school building and told to ring their parents. An email was sent out to all the parents."" Another affected school, Dowdales secondary in Cumbria, tweeted: ""As you may know the school office received a threatening email this morning. ""The decision was taken to evacuate the school as a precaution. Students and staff are safe and have returned to normal lessons."" Schools and colleges in Cumbria, Cambridgeshire, East Yorkshire, Hertfordshire, Lincolnshire, West Midlands, Derbyshire, Avon and Somerset and Northumbria were also targeted. Allow Twitter content?

Both the Home Office and the Department for Education advised any school that received the email to contact their local police force - even though a version of the email that has been posted on Twitter warns the schools not to. Humberside Police said 19 schools in its area received the threat. Det Supt Tony Cockerill, from the force, said: ""We have spoken to all schools who have contacted us, reassured them that there is no need to evacuate and offered them security advice."" Greater Manchester Police's Assistant Chief Constable Vanessa Jardine said she understood parents and the general public would be very concerned, adding: ""I want to assure you that we are working closely with all of the schools to ensure the safety of pupils and staff. ""We are carrying out extensive enquiries to understand the full circumstances and although there is not currently believed to be any direct threat, as with any report of this nature, they are all being thoroughly investigated.""

"Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is facing intensified calls to appear in person at investigations into the social network's conduct. His company has been accused of failing to properly inform users that their profile information may have been obtained and kept by Cambridge Analytica, a data firm widely-credited with helping Donald Trump win the 2016 US presidential election. Facebook said on Friday it had blocked Cambridge Analytica from Facebook while it investigated claims the London-based firm did not, as promised, delete data that was allegedly obtained using methods that were in violation of Facebook's policies. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny any wrongdoing. Despite pledging that in 2018 he would ""fix"" his company, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has managed to avoid engaging with the site's growing number of critics - instead sending lawyers or policy bosses to various committee hearings. The 33-year-old's recent remarks on some of Facebook's controversies have been communicated in the relatively safe space of a blog post or video message published on his Facebook page. Facebook and Trump data firm 'misled' MPs US to investigate Trump campaign data firm Tech Tent: Facebook and Google take action With the building row over how Facebookdata may have been used to fuel highly-targeted political propaganda, several influential figures on both side of the Atlantic this weekend said it was time for Mr Zuckerberg to step up to publicly defend - or at least justify - his creation. Some called for investigations into whether Mr Zuckerberg's company may have violated laws governing disclosure of a data breach - and also rules on properly obtaining a user's consent to collect personal information. ""This is a major breach that must be investigated,"" demanded Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. ""Itâs clear these platforms canât police themselves. I've called for more transparency and accountability for online political ads. They say 'trust us'."" She added: ""Mark Zuckerberg needs to testify before Senate Judiciary."" That sentiment was backed by Adam Schiff, the highest-ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is already investigating social media manipulation in the run up to the 2016 presidential election. ""I think it would be beneficial to have him come testify before the appropriate oversight committees,"" he told the Washington Post. ""And not just Mark but the other CEOs of the other major companies that operate in this space."" On Sunday morning TV, Florida senator and former presidential hopeful Marco Rubio told NBC's Meet the Press he felt technology companies acted as if they are ""above"" regulations. Eight reasons Facebook has peaked Social networks 'too slow' on changes Facebook broke German privacy laws ""Their growth has been a lot faster than perhaps their ability to mature institutionally from within on some of these challenges that they're facing,"" he said. ""I think another part about it is sometimes these companies grow so fast and get so much good press, they get up high on themselves that they start to think that perhaps they're above sort of the rules that apply to everybody else."" The man in charge of Britain's investigation into Russian meddling in the democratic process said he too wanted to press Mr Zuckerberg on the issue. ""I will be writing to Mark Zuckerberg asking that either he or another senior executive from the company appear to give evidence in front of the committee as part our inquiry,"" said Damian Collins MP. ""It is not acceptable that they have previously sent witnesses who seek to avoid asking difficult questions by claiming not to know the answers."" This video can not be played In the age of big data, is our democracy open to manipulation? Mr Collins also said he would be recalling Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix to parliament to answer more questions. ""It seems clear that he has deliberately misled the committee and parliament,"" Mr. Collins said. Cambridge Analytica and Mr Nix have denied any wrongdoing. In an attempt to get out ahead of a story in the New York Times and Observer newspapers,Facebook made an announcement late Friday night, California time, that it was blocking Cambridge Analytica from using Facebookwhile it investigated claims the inappropriately-obtained data had not been deleted as promised. This was followed by remarks from Alex Stamos, the firm's chief security officer, who wrote and then deleted a series of tweets. He objected to the word ""breach"" being used to describe how data from as many as 50 million peoples' user profiles may have been obtained without explicit user consent. ""I have deleted my tweets on Cambridge Analytica,"" he later wrote. ""Not because they were factually incorrect but because I should have done a better job weighing in."" Christopher Wylie, a Canadian data analytics expert who worked with Cambridge Analytica, revealed how it and its partners harvested data belonging to mostly US voters. Over the weekend, he announced he had been suspended from Facebook. On top of its initial statement, Facebook on Sunday said it was conducting a ""comprehensive internal and external review"" into whether the data, gathered via an app created by Global Science Research (GSR), still existed. GSR was set up by University of Cambridge associate professor Aleksandr Kogan and his colleague Joseph Chancellor. According to the Guardian, Mr Chancellor was given a job at Facebook as a researcher just months after GSR carried out the data-gathering exercise that Facebook now says violated its policies. Facebook has not commented on the calls for Mr Zuckerberg to appear in front of the several committees expressing a desire to hear from him. But one analyst warned that this controversy is a direct threat to Facebook's business model, and therefore Mr Zuckerberg will be expected to put investors at ease, sooner rather than later. ""This has potential to grow into something a lot more onerous,"" said Daniel Ives from GBH Insight. ""So he has to get ahead of this storm before it turns into a hurricane.""

"Michael Gove and Ruth Davidson were on opposite sides of the debate before the Brexit referendum Ruth Davidson and Michael Gove have teamed up to call for the UK to leave the common fisheries policy (CFP) when Britain leaves the European Union. The Scottish Conservative leader and UK environment secretary say it is ""vital"" that the country regains control over its own fisheries management. It came as Scottish fishermen demanded the UK operated as a ""fully-functioning coastal state"" after leaving the EU. The SNP warned the future of Scotland's fishing communities was ""at risk"". Ministers in London could ""trade away our valuable fishing rights"" in Brexit negotiations to protect other sectors, Scotland's fisheries secretary Fergus Ewing added. The UK government wants to agree reciprocal access to fishing waters with the EU. In a joint statement, Ms Davidson and Mr Gove say: ""We believe it is vital that we regain control over our own fisheries management. ""We want to use the opportunity of Brexit to secure a sustainable marine environment for the next generation. ""As proud Scots, we feel a particular debt to fishing communities who are looking to government to deliver a better deal for them. We agree we must deliver a fairer allocation for the British fleet in our own waters. ""As we leave the EU, we want the UK to become an independent coastal state, negotiating access annually with our neighbours. And during the implementation period we will ensure that British fishermen's interests are properly safeguarded."" Sarah Smith: Having your fish and eating it too Scots fishermen slam EU call for access The politicians were on opposing sides in the EU referendum campaign in 2016, but say they are united in their determination to ensure ""Brexit delivers for Britain's fishing communities"". The statement continues: ""The Prime Minister has been clear: Britain will leave the CFP as of March 2019. We both support her wholeheartedly. ""Whatever differences we had on Brexit, we both agree that our fishing industry stands to benefit from our departure from the common fisheries policy. We are both committed to doing all we can to make those benefits real."" The intervention follows the recent publication of draft guidelines for the EU side of Brexit trade talks, which seek ""existing reciprocal access to fishing waters"". The politicians spoke out as the Scottish Fishermen's Federation (SFF) set out its ""red lines"" which the industry is warning the UK government not to cross in Brexit negotiations with the EU. The SFF is demanding an immediate exit from the CFP in March 2019, ""ensuring the EU does not have the right to grant access and set fishing opportunity and management rules within UK waters during the implementation period"". Chief executive Bertie Armstrong said: ""In herMansion House speech, the Prime Minister spoke of ensuring 'fairer shares' for our fishermen - that must mean an immediate end to the current situation in which EU vessels are entitled, gratis, to 60% of the fish in UK waters while our own vessels are allowed to catch just 40%."" The Scottish government called on UK ministers to ""urgently explain"" how their position on CFP would benefit Scottish fishermen. Fergus Ewing said: ""The UK government continues to put the future of Scotland's fishing communities at risk - no-one should be in any doubt that ministers in London are prepared to trade away our valuable fishing rights to protect sectors which are more important to them. ""The UK government's position will result in a situation where the UK could be forced to apply the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy after Brexit but would have no influence at all over fish quotas or access to Scottish waters. ""They must urgently explain how such a situation would be advantageous to Scottish fishermen in any way, shape or form."" A UK government spokesman said: ""When we leave the European Union, we will leave the common fisheries policy and regain control of access to our waters. ""As part of a new economic partnership we want to continue to work with the EU to manage shared stocks in a sustainable way and to agree reciprocal access to waters and a fairer allocation of fishing opportunities for the UK fishing industry.""

"This video can not be played How the Russian election unfolded World leaders are congratulating Vladimir Putin on his election for a new six-year term as Russian president, but Western leaders have been slow to respond amid recent tensions. Chinese President Xi Jinping said his country's partnership with Russia was at its ""best level in history"". ButEuropean observers said that while the poll was conducted efficiently there was a lack of genuine choice.,external Mr Putin got more than 76% of the vote, official results show. He said he was considering changes to his government, including the post of prime minister.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe spoke to Mr Putin about working towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said. The leaders of Iran, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Venezuela, Bolivia and Cuba were among others who sent their best wishes. Steffen Seibert, spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said she would send the Russian president a telegram ""very soon"". ""We have differences of opinion with Russia and we very clearly criticise Russia's policies on some issues - Ukraine, Syria,"" he said. But observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said in a report: ""Restrictions on the fundamental freedoms of assembly, association and expression, as well as on candidate registration, have limited the space for political engagement and resulted in a lack of genuine competition."" However, the report added that the electoral commission had administered the election efficiently. Tensions between Russia and the West have deepened in recent weeks after the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Britain. The UK government blamed the nerve agent attack on Russia. Russian spy: What we know so far What are Novichok nerve agents? The UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats from London, prompting a tit-for-tat response from Moscow.The US, which has backed the UK's condemnation of Russia, recently imposed sanctions on a group of Russiansover alleged interference in the 2016 election. The scale of victory - which had been widely predicted - appears to be a marked increase in Mr Putin's share of the vote from 2012, when he won 64%. Turnout, at more than 67%, also appears to be up. Addressing a rally in Moscow, Mr Putin said voters had ""recognised the achievements of the last few years"". His nearest competitor, millionaire communist Pavel Grudinin, received slightly less than 12%. The race also included Ksenia Sobchak, a former reality TV host, and veteran nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky - they got less than 2% and less than 6% respectively.

But Ella Pamfilova, head of the Central Electoral Commission, said there were only half as many reported violations compared to 2012, and that none had been serious. Sunday's vote was also the first in Crimea since Russia seized the region from Ukraine. Mr Putin's victory rally coincided with the anniversary of the annexation. The annexation was bitterly contested by Kiev and ratcheted up tensions between Russia and the West. Russians living in Ukraine were unable to take part in Sunday's vote because access to Russian diplomatic missions was blocked by the Kiev government. The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow says a sudden thaw with the West seems unlikely, given Mr Putin's first comments after his victory. Western governments are expecting more cyber-attacks and attempts to disrupt elections, previous cases of which have been blamed on Russia. But some analysts believe that squaring up to the West has only limited appeal, and sooner or later the Russian president will have to address domestic concerns like education, housing and health care. The question also remains about whether Mr Putin will continue as president after this term ends. According to the constitution he is required to step down in 2024, but he could change the rules to eliminate term limits. However, he does not seem willing to carry on for too long, and laughed off a question from a journalist about standing in 2030. By BBC Monitoring Germany's Bild tabloid asks ""Has the poison thriller helped Putin?"",externaland quotes Mr Putin's campaign spokesperson thanking Britain for ""unjustly accusing Russia"" and putting pressure on Moscow ""at the right time"" which led to a surge of Russian voters ""gathering around the centre of power - and that is Putin"".

"This video can not be played How the Russian election unfolded It was the victory rally he never doubted he'd join. Two hours after the last polling stations in western Russia closed, Vladimir Putin strode on stage beneath the Kremlin walls to declare his re-election. With a broad smile, he thanked the country for what he called ""a vote of confidence"" and promised to work for the future of a great nation. He then led the crowd of loyal, flag waving fans braving the freezing cold in a chant of ""Russia! Russia!"" This was an election with eight candidates but one clear winner from the very start. Russia's most popular opposition politician Alexei Navalny had been excluded and a communist candidate was vilified by state-run media. The society-girl-turned-activist Ksenia Sobchak ran her entire campaign on the basis she would lose. Ms Sobchak (right) visited Mr Navalny (left) at his office on polling day President Putin shunned the pre-election debates entirely while the other candidates made threats or burst into tears. No wonder some critics called the whole event a circus. Turnout was the only real variable. So the vast majority of election billboards were not for individual candidates but simply reminders that Russians were ""choosing a president"". On voting day itself there was music and entertainment to help pull in the crowds. At one central Moscow polling station a man on a balalaika played Western rock hits in front of a stall selling cheap pies. Life in Putin's Russia explained in 10 charts Google's most popular Putin search queries answered There was a mini-ice hockey game for children, and face-painting. Pensioners could take the chance to sign up for activities including ballroom dancing and keep fit. It was all part of the effort to secure maximum support for another six years of Vladimir Putin. A child is pictured playing at one polling booth in Moscow on Sunday The vote was held on the anniversary of Russia's annexation of Crimea, the moment when the president's rating had soared to a historic high. ""I want to see change, I am so tired of his leadership,"" Olga said, after casting her ballot for the only female candidate in the race. ""I want to see my country develop in a different way."" ""I'm not voting for Putin,"" Kirill agreed, recalling that Vladimir Putin had been in power since 2000. ""He's been president too long and should go."" Does Putin's Russia reject the West? Vladimir Putin: Russia's action man president 'Better than Trump': What young Russians think of Putin But the final result - a landslide victory - showed that the vast majority of voters disagreed. ""We have started to live much better under Putin, patriotism is spreading. It's wonderful,"" Gelena Zakharova said, one of many smartly-dressed voters emerging from a central Moscow polling station. ""Russia has become a very powerful country. We're rising from our knees. I really like it."" As Russia has ""risen"" relations with the West have sunk, most lately with furious accusations from the UK over the poisoning of a former Russian spy. Shortly after his victory speech, Mr Putin made his first extended comments on the case calling claims of Russian involvement ""utter nonsense"" and insisting his country destroyed all chemical weapons ""unlike our partners"". Most people here are baffled by the whole story. The voters' mandate gives Mr Putin another six years as the country's president To some, like Dmitry heading into another central Moscow polling station, it's a chance for their president to act tough on the world stage. ""He's one of the most powerful politicians in the world; a real tough guy and that's good."" But squaring up to the West only has limited appeal according to political analyst Ekaterina Shulman. ""The besieged fortress mentality is very useful to mobilise the incumbent. It reinforces the idea that there's no alternative,"" she says. ""But it makes the electorate anxious and tired. It wears them out."" Ultimately she argues the focus will have to shift to people's real concerns - their shrinking wealth, health care, housing and education. But judging by Vladimir Putin's first comments after victory, a sudden thaw in relations with the West looks unlikely.

"This video can not be played David Davis: Transition is about beginning life outside EU The UK and EU have agreed on a ""large part"" of the agreement that will lead to the ""orderly withdrawal"" of the UK. Negotiators Michel Barnier and David Davis saidthe deal on what the UK calls the implementation period,externalwas a ""decisive step"" in the Brexit process. But issues still to be resolved include the Northern Ireland border. And Scotland's fishing industry has reacted angrily to the deal, which will see the UK ""consulted"" on quotas and access to its waters until 2021. Brexit Secretary Mr Davis said Monday's transition agreement, which is conditional on both sides agreeing a final withdrawal treaty, would smooth the path to a future permanent relationship. Laura Kuenssberg: Done deal but work ahead EU fishing deal 'far from acceptable' Brexit: All you need to know Mr Barnier said the legal text marked a ""decisive step"" but added that it was ""not the end of the road"". The key aspects of the agreement announced in Brussels are: The transitional period will last from Brexit day on 29 March 2019 to 31 December 2020 EU citizens arriving in the UK between these two dates will enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive before Brexit. The same will apply to UK expats on the continent The UK will be able to negotiate, sign and ratify its own trade deals during the transition period The UK will still be party to existing EU trade deals with other countries The UK's share of fishing catch will be guaranteed during transition but UK will effectively remain part of the Common Fisheries Policy, yet without a direct say in its rules, until the end of 2020 Northern Ireland will effectively stay in parts of the single market and the customs union in the absence of other solutions to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland The EU says this so-called ""backstop option"" for Northern Ireland was a key part of December's phase one agreement with the UK and must continue to apply ""unless and until another solution is found"". Theresa May has suggested this outcome - which is favoured by Dublin - would be unacceptable as it would effectively shift the existing land border to the Irish Sea and compromise UK sovereignty. In a letter to the European Council President Donald Tusk, the prime minister said ""more work"" was needed on certain commitments included in December's agreement and she continued to believe safeguards for Ireland could be agreed as part of the overall future economic and security partnership. Conservative MPs have expressed disappointment at the outline fishing deal Should this not prove possible, she said she was committed to discussing ""additional specific solutions"" in parallel with the existing legal process for the UK's withdrawal. Both the UK and the EU hope the terms of an agreement on the transitional period can be signed off by Mrs May's fellow 27 leaders at the EU summit this week. The UK has said it had secured a number of improvements to the text, including an explicit reference to Gibraltar being covered by the agreement and the creation of a joint committee to oversee the process. ""We must seize the moment and carry on the momentum of the last few weeks,"" Mr Davis said. ""The deal today should give us confidence that a good deal for the UK and EU is closer than ever before."" No Brexit agreement on Irish border 'Extend transition' call divides MPs What is the Brexit 'transition' phase? Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said the agreement was ""a step in the right direction"" but Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the agreement for fishing during the implementation period was ""shaping up to be a massive sell-out of the Scottish fishing industry by the Tories"". She added: ""The promises that were made to them during #EUref and since are already being broken - as many of us warned they would be."" Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said the agreement fell ""far short of an acceptable deal"" giving the UK full control of its waters from the moment it leaves. ""We will leave the EU and leave the Common Fisheries Policy, but hand back sovereignty over our seas a few seconds later,"" he said. ""Our fishing communities' fortunes will still be subject to the whim and largesse of the EU for another two years."" Downing Street said that because fishing quotas are worked out on an annual basis, for the period from 2020 onwards, the UK would be ""negotiating fishing opportunities as an independent coastal state deciding who can access our waters and on what terms"".

Monday's document clearly states the European Court of Justice will have ""jurisdiction"" over matters relating to EU law and EU citizens during the transition - once regarded as a ""red line"" by many Brexit-supporting MPs. As well as questions about Northern Ireland, there are unresolved issues about what role, if any, the ECJ will have after the transition and other governance issues. The UK and EU hope that if a transition deal is agreed, then negotiations can focus on what sort of permanent future relationship the two sides will have - with the aim of a deal being agreed in the autumn to allow time for EU member states and the UK Parliament to ratify it before Brexit next March.

"The recruits had been posted to the Army Foundation College in Harrogate (stock image) One of the biggest investigations into the alleged abuse of teenage Army recruits in Britain has collapsed. Sixteen instructors at the Army Foundation College, Harrogate, North Yorkshire, were accused of slapping and punching 28 recruits. A judge branded the three-year Royal Military Police (RMP) probe ""seriously flawed"" as he halted the first of three courts martial. There are now calls for senior RMP officers to be investigated. More on this story and others from around Yorkshire The investigation had considered complaints from a total of 40 recruits about 30 instructors - which led to the prosecution of 16 of them, all sergeants and corporals. The allegations centred on how recruits, aged 16 and 17, were treated at training camp in Scotland in the summer of 2014. Recruits claimed they were slapped or punched in the face, spat at, grabbed by the throat, had their faces submerged in mud or were ordered to eat animal manure. However, it took two years to interview the soldiers involved under caution and another year before they were told they were being charged. In addition, handwritten accounts made by some recruits shortly after the alleged abuse have never been found and the military court heard some recruits claim they were threatened into giving statements and to appear as witnesses. The courts martial at Bulford, Wiltshire, collapsed after eight days when the prosecution offered no evidence in 24 of the 31 charges faced by the first 10 defendants. Five were cleared and Assistant Judge Advocate General Alan Large halted proceedings against the remaining five, ruling they could not get a fair trial. The prosecution indicated it would offer no evidence against a further six instructors due to go on trial next month. It emerged the RMP officer leading the investigation, Capt Teresa Spanton, did not question eyewitnesses because she thought they would lie. ""The decision not to interview, at any stage during a very long inquiry, such highly relevant eyewitnesses is a very serious breach of the duty upon police officers to investigate a case fairly and objectively,"" the judge said. He said her assumptions were ""frankly startling"". ""It reflects a totally blinkered approach to the police's duty of establishing, fairly and objectively, what happened,"" he added. On the face of it these were very serious allegations of widespread physical abuse of teenage recruits - children in the eyes of the law - but the court martial quickly unravelled. The Judge Advocate was scathing about the way the RMP handled the investigation; there were long delays in taking statements and evidence was lost or ignored. Some of the teenage recruits had ""no, or at very best vague, recollections"" of the events and key witnesses, including Army instructors, weren't even spoken to. Judge Alan Large concluded the RMP had carried out the case ""in direct breach of their duty to investigate fairly and objectively"". This isn't the first time the RMP has been accused of bungling an investigation. The human rights group Liberty said it should be a ""wake-up call"" for the Ministry of Defence and should force a rethink about the armed forces' system of justice. Lewis Cherry, a solicitor who specialises in defending soldiers at courts martial, said he was ""appalled"" by what had emerged during the trial. ""When I heard what Capt Spanton had to say even I didn't believe it could be that bad. ""When they are saying they are making a policy decision to deliberately breach the codes of practice and breach the Attorney General's guidelines, even I couldn't believe it could be that bad."" Mr Cherry said the investigation had been ""deliberately improper"". ""Here they are deliberately getting it wrong, they are looking the opposite way. They are only looking for their guilt, not their innocence."" He said those managing the RMP must be investigated. An Army spokeswoman said: ""Despite the outcome, we will consider carefully whether any internal disciplinary action is necessary. ""Given this ruling, the Service Prosecuting Authority and the Royal Military Police will be conducting a review to ensure that lessons are learned."" Human rights campaign group Liberty has said the collapse of the trial should be a ""wake-up"" call to the British Army. Emma Norton, from the group, said those serving their country deserve better that a ""shoddy second-rate"" justice system. ""When someone commits a crime on British soil - whether soldier or civilian - that crime should be investigated by civilian police,"" she said. ""As this scathing ruling shows, military police do not have the resources, expertise or impartiality to conduct proper, fair investigations - and, when they fail, soldiers and their families have no independent oversight body to turn to for help.""

"Steve Spielberg was awarded Empire's Legend Of Our Lifetime Award Steven Spielberg said the Time's Up movement is ""more important than any of us can ever really realise"". He was speaking at the Rakuten TV Empire Awards which were held in London on Sunday. The Oscar-winning director, 71, was handed the Legend Of Our Lifetime Award. He praised the campaign to fight sexual harassment and described it as a ""watershed moment"" for attitudes in the entertainment industry. On collecting his award, the Indiana Jones director said: ""It's been a rich and diverse year for film and for gender and for race, and for speaking out. ""Thank you, Time's Up. We were very much on board from the very beginning, my wife Kate and I. ""This is more important than any of us can ever really realise."" The 71-year-old spoke as he accepted the Legend Of Our Lifetime gong Actors Reese Witherspoon and Ashley Judd and producer Shonda Rhimes were among hundreds of prominent Hollywood women who launched the initiative in January. It came in the wake of sexual abuse claims by high-profile actresses against film producer Harvey Weinstein. He's denied the allegations. Allow Instagram content?

"Police have sealed the area around the scene of the blast Police in Austin, Texas, have said four explosions that have rocked the city, killing two people, are believed to be the work of a serial bomber. The latest explosion on Sunday night, which injured two white men, aged 22 and 23, may have been activated by a tripwire, police say. Three parcel bombs left on doorsteps have killed two people and injured two others since early March. Investigators say they have seen similarities in all four cases. ""We are clearly dealing with what we expect to be a serial bomber at this point,"" Austin police chief Brian Manley said at a news conference on Monday. ""We have seen similarities in the devices that exploded here last night and the other three devices."" Sunday night's victims suffered non-life threatening injuries and were taken to hospital after encountering a suspicious device on the side of a road in a residential area, police said. The latest blast came hours after officials announced a new $100,000 (Â£71,000) reward for information. The cash reward is on top of an existing $15,000 being offered by the state's governor. The two men killed earlier this month were African Americans and police have not ruled out racism as a possible motive. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Manley has said he believed the attacks were ""meant to send a message"". He said authorities could not confirm whether a specific ideology was behind the attacks, but appealed to those behind the bombings to contact authorities directly. ""We are not going to understand that [message] until the suspect or suspects reach out to us to talk to us,"" Chief Manley said. Hundreds of federal agents are helping local police, but there has been no arrest. Authorities say they have responded to 735 reports of suspicious items since last Monday. The first bomb exploded on 2 March, killing Anthony Stephan House, 29, at his home.Two more bombs exploded 10 days later, and were linked to the initial blast. Draylen William Mason, 17, was killed when he brought a package inside his home. The explosion also critically injured his mother. Hours later a 75-year-old Hispanic woman was injured by another package. Local media reports this may have been intended for someone else. The local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) president Nelson Linder told NBC news thatthe two murdered victims had links to local prominent African-American families,externaland were connected by the same Methodist church.

Investigators say the devices were being left on doorsteps overnight, not being delivered by official methods. With the city on high alert, a concert by hip-hop band the Roots was cancelled on Saturday after organisers received a bomb threat via e-mail. They were due to perform at the city's South by Southwest festival, known as SXSW. A 26-year-old was later arrested, but police have ruled out any link to the package bombs.

He was speaking at the Rakuten TV Empire Awards which were held in London on Sunday. The Oscar-winning director, 71, was handed the Legend Of Our Lifetime Award. He praised the campaign to fight sexual harassment and described it as a ""watershed moment"" for attitudes in the entertainment industry. On collecting his award, the Indiana Jones director said: ""It's been a rich and diverse year for film and for gender and for race, and for speaking out. ""Thank you, Time's Up.

The 71-year-old spoke as he accepted the Legend Of Our Lifetime gong Actors Reese Witherspoon and Ashley Judd and producer Shonda Rhimes were among hundreds of prominent Hollywood women who launched the initiative in January.

"This video can not be played David Davis: Transition is about beginning life outside EU The UK and EU have agreed on a ""large part"" of the agreement that will lead to the ""orderly withdrawal"" of the UK. Negotiators Michel Barnier and David Davis saidthe deal on what the UK calls the implementation period,externalwas a ""decisive step"" in the Brexit process. But issues still to be resolved include the Northern Ireland border. And Scotland's fishing industry has reacted angrily to the deal, which will see the UK ""consulted"" on quotas and access to its waters until 2021. Brexit Secretary Mr Davis said Monday's transition agreement, which is conditional on both sides agreeing a final withdrawal treaty, would smooth the path to a future permanent relationship. Laura Kuenssberg: Done deal but work ahead EU fishing deal 'far from acceptable' Brexit: All you need to know Mr Barnier said the legal text marked a ""decisive step"" but added that it was ""not the end of the road"". The key aspects of the agreement announced in Brussels are: The transitional period will last from Brexit day on 29 March 2019 to 31 December 2020 EU citizens arriving in the UK between these two dates will enjoy the same rights and guarantees as those who arrive before Brexit. The same will apply to UK expats on the continent The UK will be able to negotiate, sign and ratify its own trade deals during the transition period The UK will still be party to existing EU trade deals with other countries The UK's share of fishing catch will be guaranteed during transition but UK will effectively remain part of the Common Fisheries Policy, yet without a direct say in its rules, until the end of 2020 Northern Ireland will effectively stay in parts of the single market and the customs union in the absence of other solutions to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland The EU says this so-called ""backstop option"" for Northern Ireland was a key part of December's phase one agreement with the UK and must continue to apply ""unless and until another solution is found"". Theresa May has suggested this outcome - which is favoured by Dublin - would be unacceptable as it would effectively shift the existing land border to the Irish Sea and compromise UK sovereignty. In a letter to the European Council President Donald Tusk, the prime minister said ""more work"" was needed on certain commitments included in December's agreement and she continued to believe safeguards for Ireland could be agreed as part of the overall future economic and security partnership. Conservative MPs have expressed disappointment at the outline fishing deal Should this not prove possible, she said she was committed to discussing ""additional specific solutions"" in parallel with the existing legal process for the UK's withdrawal. Both the UK and the EU hope the terms of an agreement on the transitional period can be signed off by Mrs May's fellow 27 leaders at the EU summit this week. The UK has said it had secured a number of improvements to the text, including an explicit reference to Gibraltar being covered by the agreement and the creation of a joint committee to oversee the process. ""We must seize the moment and carry on the momentum of the last few weeks,"" Mr Davis said. ""The deal today should give us confidence that a good deal for the UK and EU is closer than ever before."" No Brexit agreement on Irish border 'Extend transition' call divides MPs What is the Brexit 'transition' phase? Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said the agreement was ""a step in the right direction"" but Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that the agreement for fishing during the implementation period was ""shaping up to be a massive sell-out of the Scottish fishing industry by the Tories"". She added: ""The promises that were made to them during #EUref and since are already being broken - as many of us warned they would be."" Bertie Armstrong, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen's Federation, said the agreement fell ""far short of an acceptable deal"" giving the UK full control of its waters from the moment it leaves. ""We will leave the EU and leave the Common Fisheries Policy, but hand back sovereignty over our seas a few seconds later,"" he said. ""Our fishing communities' fortunes will still be subject to the whim and largesse of the EU for another two years."" Downing Street said that because fishing quotas are worked out on an annual basis, for the period from 2020 onwards, the UK would be ""negotiating fishing opportunities as an independent coastal state deciding who can access our waters and on what terms"".

"Cardinal Keith O'Brien resigned as archbishop in February 2013 Cardinal Keith O'Brien, formerly the Catholic Church's most senior cleric in Britain, has died at the age of 80. The cardinal, whoresigned as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh in 2013after apologising for sexual misconduct, was hurt in a recent fall. He was being cared for in Newcastle and was transferred to hospital there after suffering a head injury. His successor administered the last rites on Friday, on the eve of the cardinal's 80th birthday. Cardinal Keith O'Brien - a man of conviction and controversy Commenting upon the news of his death,Archbishop Leo Cushley of St Andrews and Edinburghsaid: ""In life, Cardinal O'Brien may have divided opinion. ""In death, however, I think all can be united in praying for the repose of his soul, for comfort for his grieving family and that support and solace be given to those whom he offended, hurt and let down. May he rest in peace."" Cardinal Keith O'Brien at the Gillis Centre in Edinburgh in 2012 Cardinal O'Brien resigned in February 2013 after three priests and a former priest alleged improper conduct back in the 1980s. He initially contested the allegations but later apologised, saying his sexual conduct had ""fallen beneath the standards"" expected of him. The collapse of Cardinal Keith O'Brien's formidable reputation, though late in his career, was sudden and steep.  Up until his 75th birthday, in 2013, he was one of the most senior figures in Scottish Catholicism and a highly decorated cleric. He received several honorary doctorates, both from Scottish and overseas universities, and held the position of Bailiff Grand Cross of Honour and Devotion among the Knights of Malta, one of the ancient chivalric orders. The Observer first reported the allegations of four individuals who accused Cardinal O'Brien of inappropriate sexual behaviour, within the Diocese of St Andrews and Edinburgh.  He initially contested the allegations but took the unprecedented decision not to take part in the Papal conclave, which elected Pope Francis. The Herald, in 2015, suggested that Cardinal O'Brienhad used confession by young clerics as a device for sexual grooming,external. The charge of hypocrisy was further compounded byhis outspoken opposition to same sex marriageand apparent defence of traditional morality while allegedly engaged in predatory behaviour. Cardinal O'Brien's health had deteriorated since the fall last month in which he broke his collarbone and suffered a head injury. The Little Sisters of the Poor, who run a nursing home in Newcastle upon Tyne, were caring for him. Archbishop Cushley visited him in hospital to administer the sacrament. Cardinal O'Brien apologised to the church and to the people of Scotland Keith O'Brien was born in Ballycastle, County Antrim, in 1938. He was educated in Scotland, attending St Patrick's High School in Dumbarton and Holy Cross Academy in Edinburgh. After graduating from the University of Edinburgh, he attended St Andrew's College in Drygrange, being ordained as priest in April 1965. His first post as an assistant priest was at Holy Cross in Edinburgh. He was ordained as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburgh in 1985, and became cardinal in 2003. Cardinal O'Brien at a service at St Mary's in Edinburgh Retiring from public life, he said: ""I wish to take this opportunity to admit that there have been times that my sexual conduct has fallen below the standards expected of me as a priest, archbishop and cardinal. To those I have offended, I apologise and ask forgiveness. ""To the Catholic Church and people of Scotland, I also apologise. I will now spend the rest of my life in retirement. I will play no further part in the public life of the Catholic Church in Scotland."" Pope Francis accepted his resignation and stated Cardinal O'Brien would not take part in future papal elections, act as papal adviser, or take part in Vatican congregations and councils and would lose other roles as a cardinal. Alan Draper from In Care Abuse Survivors (INCAS), was also a former advisor to the Catholic Church. He said: ""The church continually showed a lack of compassion towards survivors, or any understanding of what they've suffered emotionally, physically and spiritually. And that is a key issue - the spiritual damage caused to abuse survivors. ""They were shocked and were concerned with a man with immense power who abused that power. ""There was this man living a double life effectively, saying homosexuality was bad and yet was leading a homosexual life himself. What we are seeing is double standards and it is not acceptable."" Catherine Deveney is the Observer journalist who broke the Cardinal O'Brien scandal. She says the issues around what happened were bigger than one man: ""He was a symptom of an organisation that had lost its way. ""Keith O'Brien was not a monster, he wasn't an ogre - he was just a weak man. ""And I hope in the last years of his life when he took off the mitre, took off the cardinal's robes, he found something more real. ""I hope he found peace at the end of his life and I think his victims would wish that for him too."" The president and vice-president of the Bishops' Conference of Scotland have also offered their condolences. Archbishop Philip Tartaglia said: ""On behalf of the Bishops' Conference of Scotland I wish to express my sincere sympathy on the death of the late Cardinal to his family and close friends. I ask for prayers for the repose of his soul. May he rest in peace."" Bishop Joseph Toal added: ""I will pray for the eternal repose of the soul of Cardinal Keith Patrick O'Brien. I extend my sympathy and prayerful support to his family, friends and all who mourn his passing. With constant hope in the Lord's goodness and mercy.""

"This video can not be played 'I lost Â£15,000 in a day gambling on FOBTs' The maximum stake for fixed odds betting terminals (FOBT) should be cut to Â£30 or less, the UK's Gambling Commission has recommended. Currently people can bet up to Â£100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games, such as roulette and blackjack. It comes after a consultation on FOBTs for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The commission says the maximum stake on ""slots games"", like traditional fruit machine games, should be Â£2. The advice has been given,externalto support the government with its review of gambling machines, with a decision expected in coming weeks. FOTBs have come under criticism for encouraging high-stakes gambling and exposing people to the risk of gambling harm.   The machines have been called the ""crack cocaine"" of gambling by campaigners who say they let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social problems. And Tim Miller, executive director of the Gambling Commission, told the BBC that its remit when considering stake recommendations had been ""to protect vulnerable people from harm"". Why the gambling industry faces an uncertain future Fixed-odds terminals were introduced in casinos and betting shops in 1999, and offer computerised games at the touch of a button. The Gambling Commission's report said the Â£30 limit for casino-type games had been recommended, because a higher limit means players could potentially ""lose large amounts of money in a short space of time"". The government now has to decide whether to accept the commission's advice on the stake limit,  or decide to impose a lower figure. The government began to look at FOBT machines in October 2016, when it made a ""call for evidence"" on the number and location of terminals and the measures in place to protect players. Now Gambling Commission chief executive Neil McArthur has said: ""We've put consumers at the heart of our advice - advice which is based on the best available evidence and is focused on reducing the risk of gambling-related harm. ""In our judgment, a stake cut for Fixed Odds Betting Terminals alone doesn't go far enough to protect vulnerable people. ""That is why we have recommended a stake cut plus a comprehensive package of other measures to protect consumers. We have proposed actions that will tackle both the risk of harm and provide solutions that are sustainable in the longer term."" These include working with the gambling industry and others on steps to make limit-setting more effective - this could include ending sessions when consumers reach time and money limits. Another recommendation is a proposed ban on machines being able to allow different - high and low stake - categories of games to be played in a single session. FOBT machines generated more than Â£1.8bn in tax revenue last year. However, Mr Miller of the Gambling Commission told the BBC that although the gambling industry had argued that any cuts in stakes would harm the sector, those arguments played no part in its recommendations to government. Earlier government estimates had suggested that a Â£2 cap could lead to a Â£5.5bn loss in tax revenues over the next 10 years. But MPs on the FOBTs All Party Parliamentary Group have said large gambling sector losses have been exaggerated. Rather, quoting the Centre for Economic and Business Research think tank, they say the cost of problem gambling in the UK is Â£1.5bn a year, ""when its impact on wider social welfare is taken into account - including areas such as employment, mental health and financial stability"". Investors appeared to welcome the recommendations, as shares in gambling firms climbed strongly after the commission's announcement, with Ladbrokes Coral closing 2.8% higher and William Hill shares ending 4% up. ""This should be a relief for the sector as the worst-case scenario looks to have been avoided. Ministers will now have to justify a cut below Â£30 on grounds of significant risk of harm,"" said analyst Neil Wilson at ETX Capital. The Association of British Bookmakers has claimed that a Â£30 maximum stake would see 2,100 betting shops closed and 10,000 jobs lost. ""We fully understand that there is public concern and that there will be a stake cut to reduce the levels of losses on machines in betting shops,"" it said after the Gambling Commission's announcement. ""In the interim, we remain committed to introducing further measures to address problem gambling and will continue to work with all interested parties."" But Grant Humphrey, Betting and Gaming lead at professional services firm EY warned: ""A Â£30 maximum stake may lead to shop closures and job losses and could lead to a wave of industry consolidation."" Tom Watson MP, Labour's Shadow Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, said: ""This is a deeply disappointing report from the Gambling Commission who appear to have caved in to industry pressure. ""These machines are at the heart of the UK's hidden epidemic of problem gambling. The Government must cut the stake to Â£2 on all FOBT machines including the highly addictive roulette style games, as well as increase the delay between each play."" Carolyn Harris, chair of the FOBTs All Party Parliamentary Group, said: ""The problem is that these machines are addictive. ""It has got to be Â£2 [maximum stake], nothing else is acceptable.  It is now for the Secretary of State to make a decision."" The Gambling Commission recommendations have been sent to Matt Hancock, Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport.  Ministers now have to decide whether to implement any of the commission's recommendations. Charity GambleAware said it welcomed the commission's ""contributions to the ongoing discussion"". ""In the meantime, we are waiting to hear what the ministers conclude in their review, and hope to hear the results soon.""

"Collisions started to cause delays on the A30 on Sunday afternoon A new severe weather warning of ice has been issued as wintry weather continues around much of the UK. All of Wales and most of Englandis covered by the yellow Met Office warning,,externalwhich is in place from Monday evening until Tuesday at 9:00 GMT. Hundreds of schools closed in south-west England and Wales because of heavy snow. Temperatures are expected to rise this week but the weather could turn colder again by the weekend, forecasters said. Over 20cm (8ins) of snow has been recorded in central and southern England as temperatures fell widely below 0C overnight with lows of -5C in Scotland. In Wales, a total of 207 schools were closed on Monday, with GCSE pupils at Brynmawr School in Blaenau Gwentbeing taught in a cinema instead. Devon County Council said nearly all of their 307 schools were shut and the others partially closed, while 97 schools in Cornwall and 163 schools in Somerset were also shut. In pictures: Snow scenes from around UK What's behind the UK's freezing weather? Weather warnings explained Meanwhile, around 80 motorists sought refuge overnight at an emergency rest centre in a college near the A30 in Devon. Among those stranded at the centrewere a bride and groom on their wedding night. Other stranded drivers camped in their vehicles at a service station on the A30 in Okehampton, which was blocked by heavy snow until it fully reopened in the morning. A 64-mile stretch of the A30 in Devon was closed but reopened on Monday morning Richard White, volunteer rest centre manager at Okehampton College - where 82 people, including children, spent the night - said: ""It's the last thing you expect to get stuck in the snow. ""One lady said she felt like a refugee. ""It was -3C and it didn't stop snowing until 06:00. It's been a really horrid night."" Newly-married couple John and Sara Lund, who were travelling to their honeymoon in Cornwall, were forced to spend their wedding night at the rest centre. The couple became stranded on the way to their honeymoon The groom, Mr Lund, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he and his new bride spent their first night sleeping on a mat on ""rock-hard floors"" in a classroom with around 20 other stranded people. ""It's probably a story which has helped keep morale high in the camp,"" Mr Lund said. A 64-mile stretch of the A30 from the M5 at Exeter to near Bodmin in Cornwall was closed by Devon and Cornwall Police to allow its officers and Highways England to clear the route. The force warned drivers to only travel if necessary and ""slow down"". The runway at Exeter Airport was closed but reopened just after 11:00 GMT, although some flights were delayed or cancelled. Temperatures dropped across many parts of the UK overnight causing partly melted snow to refreeze. In parts of England, temperatures fell to -2C and -3C and -5C in central Scotland. This video can not be played The UK could see patches of ice and frost on Tuesday, BBC Weather said. Temperatures are expected to rise into double figures this week but could become colder by the weekend bringing some frost, BBC Weather said. Met Office forecaster Craig Snell added: ""Generally we are out of the woods but anyone hoping for a spring heatwave will have to wait."" Mr Snell said the UK should now see the start of a ""gradual thaw"" - but added there is still a risk of frost and ice, including on Tuesday morning. He said the weather will become ""briefly milder then turning colder come the weekend, but not as cold and not as snowy as the weekend just gone"".

"A Turkish tank positioned on the Turkish-Syrian border near Manbij in December Turkey says it has begun a massive assault on Kurdish forces on the other side of the border with Syria - potentially putting it in direct conflict with its Nato ally, the United States. This could become a significant new development in the Syrian civil war, which is now almost seven years old. We've boiled down why it matters. You can choose to read the short, medium or long story below, either by themselves or one after the other. Why is Turkey mounting this assault? One main reason: Turkey considers the US-backed Kurdish militia that controls much of north-eastern Syria a terrorist group. Turkey says the militia is an extension of a Kurdish rebel group it has fought for decades, and wants to prevent it consolidating its hold on Syrian territory. Recent US plans to help the militia form a 30,000-strong ""border security force"" alarmed Ankara. Turkey's president said Washington was ""creating a terror army"" and vowed to ""suffocate"" it. Turkey wants to clear Kurdish forces from Afrin - where operations began on 20 January - and Manbij. Turkey has vowed to crush a Syrian Kurdish militia called the People's Protection Units (YPG), which it considers a terrorist group. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says it is an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades. The YPG denies any direct organisational links - an assertion backed by a US-led coalition whose air strikes have helped the militia and allied Arab fighters drive Islamic State militants from tens of thousands of square kilometres of Syria. Ankara has condemned the US for supporting the YPG and was alarmed when it recently emerged that the coalition was helping it form a 30,000-strong ""border security force"". While Turkey has long threatened to clear YPG fighters from the Kurdish enclave of Afrin, in north-western Syria, and Manbij, a mainly Arab town to the east, the news appears to have brought those plans forward. A day after vowing to stop the US ""creating a terror army on our border"", Mr Erdogan declared that Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels would soon destroy ""nests of terror"". Turkish tanks began building up along the border near Afrin and troops have been shelling the enclave from inside the rebel-held Syrian province of Idlib. Air strikes were launched on 20 January as Turkey announced the operation had begun. Kurdish leaders promised to defend Afrin and urged the international community to prevent Turkey targeting what they said were its 1m residents. Russia, the Syrian government's ally, says it will not interfere in the conflict. It has have moved its troops away from the area. A Turkish assault has opened a new front in a war that activists say has already cost more than 340,000 lives. The UN says it is ready to help displaced civilians if required. Why is Turkey doing this now? To understand the seemingly imminent offensives, it's important to understand Turkey's relations with the Kurds, and who some of the main players are in the Syrian conflict. Turkey had been threatening to attack the Kurdish-controlled towns of Afrin and Manbij for some time in an attempt to counter a militia called the People's Protection Units (YPG), which it considers a terrorist group. Turkey sees the militia as being an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is banned in Turkey and has fought for Kurdish autonomy there since 1984. The YPG denies any direct military or political links with the PKK. A YPG fighter monitoring the area near Afrin in June 2017 The US also rejects Turkey's portrayal of the militia, a key ally in the battle against Islamic State. The YPG is part of an alliance with a number of ethnic Arab militias called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). With the help of US air strikes, its fighters have captured tens of thousands of square kilometres from IS. Who are the Kurds? IS and the crisis in Iraq and Syria in maps Despite being part of the US-led coalition against IS, Turkey has vehemently opposed supporting the SDF and tried to stop it taking control of Syria's northern border. In 2016, the Turkish military supported a Syrian rebel offensive that drove IS militants out of the key towns of Jarablus and al-Bab and stopped SDF fighters moving towards Afrin. The US dissuaded Turkey from also attempting to take the mainly Arab town of Manbij from the SDF by force, but got the YPG to agree to withdraw east of the River Euphrates. Turkish officials say that has not yet happened. One recent development appears to have brought forward Turkey's plans to clear YPG fighters from Afrin and Manbij. News broke on 13 January that the US was helping the SDF build a new ""border security force"". US officials said the plan was to train about 30,000 personnel - half of them SDF fighters - to help prevent infiltration by IS militants across the Turkish and Iraqi borders and parts of the River Euphrates, which effectively divides SDF- and Syrian government-held regions. The announcement enraged Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that he considered the border force to be a ""terror army"". Syria's government, which has mostly avoided conflict with the Kurds, called it a ""blatant attack"" on its sovereignty. Russia, the government's ally, warned it was a step towards the partition of Syria. Mr Erdogan went on to say Turkish troops and Syrian rebels would soon destroy ""nests of terror"" along its border, ""starting with Afrin and Manbij"". It's significant for a few reasons: Afrin is separated from Manbij and other SDF-controlled areas by a pocket of territory held by Turkish-backed rebels If Afrin and Manbij were to fall, Turkish-backed forces would control a 200km (125-mile) continuous stretch of Syria's northern border west of the Euphrates The YPG has not said how many fighters it has in the two areas, but Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency estimated that there were about 8,000 to 10,000 in Afrin. It is also not clear if US military personnel are deployed around Manbij, as they were last year. It risks bringing the interests of two Nato allies into direct conflict and also have a major impact on relations between Turkey and Russia. Russia - a key military figure in the region - has said it will not interfere in the conflict. As Turkey announced it was beginning the assault on Afrin, Russia said its troops had been relocated elsewhere. Russia controls the enclave's airspace - so Turkey's air strikes that began on 20 January must have had Russian clearance. As this piece explains, a tacit Russian approval for the incursion might bring Moscow and Ankara closer together and have implications for Turkish relations with the West. A siege of Afrin could have grave humanitarian consequences. Kurdish officials say there could be 1m people living in Afrin. Leaving an enclave surrounded by territory held by the Syrian government, and mountains, would be difficult. The UN's refugee agency told the BBC it was prepared to help if needed.

"A British woman volunteer with the all-female Kurdish armed unit the YPJ has been killed in Syria, her father has told the BBC. It is understood Anna Campbell, 26, from Lewes in East Sussex, died on 15 March in Afrin, which has been under bombardment by Turkish forces. Dirk Campbell said his daughter was ""very idealistic"" and ""determined"". Turkey has been fighting Kurdish groups on Syrian territory close to its border since January. Why Turkey is targeting Kurdish enclave in Syria Kurds ousted from heart of Syrian city Ms Campbell, who was a qualified plumber in the UK, travelled to Syria in May 2017 to help the Kurds, who were battling the Islamic State group. Her father said: ""She wanted to create a better world and she would do everything in her power to do that."" He added: ""I told her of course that she was putting her life in danger, which she knew full well she was doing. ""I feel I should have done more to persuade her to come back, but she was completely adamant."" British police have repeatedly warned against travelling to Syria, and have advised that becoming involved with any armed group could lead to arrest and prosecution. Two Britons accused of fighting against Islamic State have been charged with terrorism offences and others have been arrested. The BBC understands Ms Campbell had originally been involved in the fighting with the YPJ in Deir ez-Zor, where IS have continued to hold the last of their territory. But in January, Turkish forces began a major offensive against the Kurds along the northern Syrian border. Many Kurdish fighters left the fight against IS to defend Afrin and some British volunteers are known to have joined them. Mr Campbell told the BBC he understands his daughter's Kurdish comrades tried to stop her. Ms Campbell dyed her hair black before moving on to Afrin ""With fair hair and blue eyes they knew she would stand out, but she dyed her hair black and persuaded them to let her go,"" he said. He added: ""I contacted my MP Maria Caulfield as soon as I knew she was in danger from the Turkish bombardment. ""I emailed my MP and said my daughter is in danger, you have to get on to the Foreign Office and get them to put pressure on Turkey to stop."" Turkey sees the YPJ and associated YPG as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a link that the Kurds deny. Ahmet Berat Conkar - an MP from Turkey's ruling AK Party and head of the Turkish delegation to Nato - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the YPG and PKK are ""the same organisation"" with ""the same organisational structure"" and ""the same leadership"". He described the PKK as a ""very dangerous terrorist organisation"" with ""an evil ideology"" which pushed ""young people into the frontlines"". He also accused the organisation of recruiting child soldiers. Turkish forces stepped up their offensive in Afrin in January YPJ commander in Syria, Nesrin Abdullah, said Ms Campbell had ""insisted"" on leaving for Afrin, adding: ""Although we tried to keep her far from the frontlines, the attacks from the Turkish state were very heavy."" Friends of Ms Campbell in Syria told the BBC she was killed by Turkish airstrikes, describing her as a feminist with ""sincerity and courage"" who wanted to fight for women's liberation in the Middle East. She is the first British woman to have died in Syria with the YPG or YPJ, but the eighth citizen to have been killed while assisting the groups. Mr Campbell said he was ""in pieces"", having only heard about the death on Sunday. He said his daughter had been involved in human rights activism in the UK and it was the Kurdish aim of creating a democratic society in the wake of IS that inspired her to join them. ""When she heard about the political experiment in Rojava [the Kurdish area of northern Syria] this seemed to her to be the way the world should be"" ""The social organisation at all levels, the equality.

"This video can not be played How the Russian election unfolded Vladimir Putin will lead Russia for another six years, after securing an expected victory in Sunday's presidential election. Mr Putin, who has ruled the country as either president or prime minister since 1999, got more than 76% of the vote, official results show. The main opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, was barred from the race. Addressing a rally in Moscow, Mr Putin said voters had ""recognised the achievements of the last few years"". Speaking to reporters after the results were announced, he laughed off a question about running again in another six years. ""What you are saying is a bit funny. Do you think that I will stay here until I'm 100 years old? No!"" he said. Putin basks in election he could not lose Google's most popular Putin search queries answered Vladimir Putin: Russia's action man president The scale of victory - which had been widely predicted - appears to be a marked increase in his share of the vote from 2012, when he won 64%. Mr Putin's nearest competitor, millionaire communist Pavel Grudinin, received about 12%. The race also included Ksenia Sobchak, a former reality TV host, and veteran nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky - they got less than 2% and about 6% respectively. Mr Putin's campaign team said it was an ""incredible victory"". ""The percentage that we have just seen speaks for itself. It's a mandate which Putin needs for future decisions, and he has a lot of them to make,"" a spokesman told Russia's Interfax. In some areas, free food and discounts in local shops were on offer near polling stations. Video recordings from polling stations showed irregularities in a number of towns and cities across Russia. Several showed election officials stuffing boxes with ballot papers. Mr Navalny was excluded from the election because of an embezzlement convictionthat he said was manufactured by the Kremlin. In his first reaction to the news, Mr Navalny indicated he had been unable to contain his anger. ""Now is the season of Lent. I took it upon myself never to get angry and not to raise my voice. Oh well, I'll try again next year,"" he tweeted. Life in Putin's Russia explained in 10 charts Does Putin's Russia reject the West? 'Better than Trump': What young Russians think of Putin During polling day, independent election monitoring group Golos reported hundreds of irregularities, including: Voting papers found in some ballot boxes before polls opened Observers were barred from entering some polling stations Some people were bussed in amid suspicion of forced voting Webcams at polling stations were obstructed by balloons and other obstacles Allow Twitter content?

In Dagestan, one election official said he was prevented from doing his job by a crowd of men who blocked the ballot box. But Ella Pamfilova, head of the Central Electoral Commission, said there were no serious violations. Turnout was reported to be 67% - higher than in the last vote ""We have analysed and monitored everything we could, everything that has arrived. Thank goodness, it's all rather modest so far,"" she told a commission meeting while speaking about violations. She had earlier said that anyone involved in violations would be caught. Sunday's vote was also the first in Crimea since Russia seized the region from Ukraine. Mr Putin's victory rally coincided with the anniversary of the annexation. The annexation was bitterly contested by Kiev and ratcheted up tensions between Russia and the West. Russians living in Ukraine were unable to take part in Sunday's vote because access to Russian diplomatic missions was blocked by the Kiev government.

"Nashra Balagamwala visiting Paris When Pakistani designer Nashra Balagamwala produced a board game about arranged marriage, most news reports about her wrongly assumed she was dead against it. Actually her position is far more nuanced. And one goal is to explain to people in the UK and elsewhere how it works. ""People in the West often confuse arranged marriages with forced marriages,"" Nashra Balagamwala says, on the phone from Islamabad. ""They go by a lot of what they see in the press. The acid attacks. The so-called honour killings. The complete absence of choice. My game was not meant to be part of that dialogue."" Balagamwala's board game, Arranged!, is far from an advert for arranged marriage. Its central character is a matchmaker ""auntie"" eagerly trying to chase down three girls while they attempt to outwit her and delay marriage. Players create distance from the auntie, and impending marriage, by drawing cards with commands like ""You were seen at the mall with boys. The auntie moves three spaces away from you."" Other cards that put auntie off include ""Your older sister married a white man"", or ""The auntie finds out you used tampons before marriage."" (Many in South Asia believe that a tampon is an indication of sexual activity.) Balagamwala says the game has a dual purpose. One is to start a dialogue among South Asian families on what is expected of women. ""I wanted to create an innocent platform where families could talk about some of the silly aspects of my culture, in a non-confrontational way. Like how a 'good girl' knows how to make a good cup ofchaiand doesn't have male friends. ""Secondly, I wanted to explain arranged marriage to white people, so they could better understand the nuance of South Asian traditions."" Balagamwala was at the Rhode Island School of Design in the US when she came up with the idea. ""I was about to head home to Pakistan at the end of the year, and I had some proposals waiting for me, so I started stalking the Facebook accounts of those guys to find something about them that my parents wouldn't approve of, so I could get out of meeting them. And then I thought to myself, 'Why not get rid of the problem once and for all?' So I created a list of every ridiculous thing I've done to get out of an arranged marriage and turned it into this light-hearted board game."" She tested her game out on her friends, a mixture of South Asians and white Americans. An American male friend was in fits of laughter while playing. He admitted to Balagamwala that he'd been worried the game would trivialise the subject, but said that he now had a better understanding of it. Encouraged by the reaction of her friends, and frustrated by her family's endless questions about when she would settle down, Balagamwala set up a Kickstarter page to help fund her game. ""Gaming is my therapy,"" she says. ""Making board games soothes me. I've made others too, but they are too controversial for a South Asian audience."" Balagamwala says she understands traditional South Asian families. Her own family had been reluctant for her to continue her higher education, particularly in the US, and the dean of her high school, as well as a procession of friends and cousins, had to convince them that it was a good move. The Kickstarter campaign was quickly funded, with more than 500 people placing their orders. Media attention followed, but many reporters failed to grasp her intention, she says, assuming the game was a protest against arranged marriage. ""It upset me that so many news outlets chose to hyperlink to ghoulish stories about acid attacks and honour killings. It was as if my game, which was meant to be thought-provoking but humorous, was somehow part of that narrative. It was now a blanket warning against arranged marriage. That wasn't my intention."" Balagamwala is keen to not deny the experience of women who are subjected to forced marriage. She says she's aware that happens a lot in Pakistan and India and that it deserves media scrutiny. But that, she says, is not what arranged marriage is. ""I'm not against tradition or the idea of an introduction - one that I have the option to decline - from a family member. Especially in a society as conservative as Pakistan, where men and women aren't really allowed to be friends. But only when I'm ready. ""People in the West should realise that is what a lot of people in South Asia mean when they say 'arranged marriage'. You may hear about the horror cases, those forced marriages, but that isn't the reality for millions of people. ""Also, how is an introduction any different from being set up on a blind date or arranging your own introduction via a dating app?"" Soon after Arranged! was profiled on several media outlets, including the BBC, Balagamwala and her family attended a family wedding in Karachi. While her immediate family were supportive, a wider circle were colder. This video can not be played The board game sparking debate about arranged marriage ""Some openly said, 'You're going against our values, you're going against what we taught you.' Others avoided me completely. ""My dad joked, 'Well, you didn't want to get married and now you've made sure that no-one in Pakistan will marry you!'"" The biggest critics of the game were the ""Rishta Aunties"" - a nickname in Hindi and Urdu for meddlesome older women, not necessarily blood relations, who scout for younger women at weddings to pair up with an eligible young man. They aren't doing it for monetary compensation but purely for the thrill of setting up a good match. The aunties, says Balagamwala, have a set of criteria for what makes a desirable girl. ""It's often girls who don't speak their mind. They're seen and not heard. They're good home-makers, ready to support her husband and his ambitions,"" she says. ""And after I was profiled in the press, I was now outside this frame of what makes a desirable wife - for the Rishta Aunties."" The release of the game struck a nerve with many young women. ""I had messages and support from South Asian women across the world. South Asian women often retain a lot of their traditional values and culture, even if they are born in the US or Europe, so the subject resonated with them. ""A girl in India messaged me and saying that my game gave her the courage to have an uncomfortable conversation with her family and say, 'Look not all Asian women want to get married in their 20s.'"" The reaction from young South Asian men surprised her the most. They were overwhelmingly positive. Many sent her direct messages thanking her for explaining the female perspective. Some asked her out. More than 50 strangers from the internet proposed. Some of the proposals Balagamwala received - in the background, her many Facebook friend requests ""Initially I didn't get any proposals from Pakistani men within my society because the aunties no longer wanted me,"" Balagamwala says. However, it's now been six months and they've started up again. Last week four men known to her family expressed interest in marriage. ""The sad part is that I'm a girl with light skin and light eyes, and that's the reason they're proposing again. ""I'm not kidding. These aunties, when they call my mum, actually say, 'Oh we're going to have a green-eyed daughter-in-law.'"" Balagamwala has declined all offers so far. She's still in no hurry to get married, she says.

"The home took around 48 hours to build, at a cost of $10,000 In Texas, tucked behind a house for the wealthy, perhaps lies some hope for the significantly less so. More than a billion people in the world go to sleep each night without reliable shelter. But a pair of companies working on solving that believes their model of quickly 3D-printing a one-story house could not only provide merely a roof over the head, but a genuinely great place to live. I took a walk around a demonstration house while at the South by Southwest technology festival in Austin this week. It's a proof-of-concept built by Icon, a construction firm, and New Story, a non-profit that sets up housing in the developing world. The 380-square feet (35 sq m) dwelling required about $10,000 (Â£7,000) of concrete, and took 48 hours. Eventually the goal is to build a 650 sq ft version and to bring the cost down significantly by using a mixture of economies of scale - buy concrete in bulk - and improvements to the 3D-printing machine. The goal build time is between 12 and 24 hours. The printing frame, seen here in the foreground, passes over the building site on tracks Later this year, the project will head to El Salvador to build some test homes, with the view to begin work on a community of 100 houses in 2019. ""If it does work it could literally change how shelter is created,"" said Brett Hagler, chief executive and co-founder of New Story. ""It's irresponsible for us not to try it."" Like small-scale 3D-printing, the system works by slowly adding material, layer-by-layer. In this case, that material is mortar, similar to concrete. The height and width of the house is constrained by size of an an enormous metal frame, which operates autonomously once given its instructions. ""We can print up to 11ft tall with this machine,"" explained Alex Le Roux, chief executive of Icon. The concrete-like material comes out of a hose, and is built up layer-by-layer ""It works on tracks like a train. You could build many, many homes back-to-back, or create a very long home."" The robot follows blueprints created using typical computer-aided design (CAD) software. This means homeowners would have the ability to create their own designs on site, or pick one from a library of possible configurations. As I stepped inside, I found a small but capable structure. It certainly wasn't a shack, but a building that looked like it would withstand extreme weather, and wear and tear. At the time of my visit, the work on the interior had just begun. A small army of construction workers noisily worked on a wooden roof, windows and other touches. Over the next few hours the home would be made complete, furnished and fitted with plumbing and electricity. The concrete aesthetic was still visible, which, depending on your view, either feels cold and brutal, or stylishly minimalist. I'd be inclined to say the latter - this is a home that would appeal to those living in high-rent overpopulated cities all over the globe. But the focus for now is on those who need it most. The El Salvador project will see Icon and New Story aim to build 100 homes, financed by mostly Silicon Valley-based donors. The house is fitted with electricity and plumbing The houses will not be a hand-out, however. ""The families agreed to a no-interest, no-profit mortgage that they will pay over about 10 years,"" explained Mr Hagler. That works out at about $30 a month. According to the country's economics ministry, the average monthly wage in rural El Salvador is around $360. ""That money does not come back to us,"" he added. ""It's kept in a community fund."" The fund will go on to pay for more homes in future, or maintenance on existing structures. Mr Hagler said the mortgage model will foster ""respect and dignity"" within the community. It may also have an impact on the jobs market for construction workers in the country, Mr Hagler conceded - but argued those concerns missed the bigger picture. Brett Hagler will take the concept to El Salvador later this year ""What we've seen from our past families, is that the quicker you get families into safe shelter, the quicker they're actually able to get an income. Or get a microloan, and start a business. ""By getting families into homes faster - that's actually a smarter way to find jobs than just having construction jobs."" That said, Mr Hagler believed the machines will be operated by local construction workers, and it is hoped the lower cost of each unit would in turn mean more demand for more houses to be built. As for the trendy new pad in Austin, Mr Hagler suggested there's only one thing to do. ""Put it on AirBnb.""

"Police and military officers in protective suits in Durrington The EU has offered the UK ""unqualified solidarity"" in its investigation into the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury. A statement urged Russia to address the UK's questions and called for a full disclosure of its development of Novichok, the nerve agent used. Russian President Vladimir Putin said state involvement was ""unimaginable"". Meanwhile, the Army is recovering a car used to collect Yulia Skripal from the airport, the BBC understands. It is believed the vehicle, in Durrington, Wiltshire, was used by a friend of Mr Skripal to pick up Yulia on 3 March, the day before the pair became unwell. Both Mr Skripal, 66, and Yulia Skripal, 33, remain critically ill in hospital. They were found slumped and unconscious on a bench near a shopping centre in the centre of Salisbury on March 4, having visited a pub and a restaurant. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Russian denials of involvement were ""increasingly absurd"" and welcomed the EU support. Responding to President Putin's dismissal of Russian involvement, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""I'm clear that what we have seen shows that there is no other conclusion but that the Russian state is culpable for what happened on the streets of Salisbury."" The EU statement comes as international experts arrive in the UK to assess the type of nerve agent used in the attack. Meanwhile, police investigating the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov,who was found dead in his London home on 12 March, have found no evidence of forced entry into his house. Mr Glushkov's death came in the same week Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced that a string of deaths on UK soil were to be reinvestigated by the police and MI5 after claims of Russian involvement. Police have stressed there is no evidence to link Mr Glushkov's death with the attempted murder of Mr Skripal. What are Novichok nerve agents? Russian spy: What we know so far Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? Russia spy poisoning: What happens when you expel a diplomat? Nikolai Glushkov: Police say no forced entry at Russian's home In a statement, the EU's foreign affairs council said it condemned the ""reckless and illegal act"" and said  it took the UK government's view ""extremely seriously"" that it was likely that Russia was responsible. ""The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us all,"" it said. ""The European Union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UK's efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice."" It urged Russia to provide ""immediate, full and complete"" disclosure of its Novichok programme to international body the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).

Mr Johnson, who is in Brussels seeking further support for Britain's stance, said he was ""very heartened"" by the strength of support the UK was getting over the case. ""There is scarcely a country round the table here in Brussels that has not been affected in recent years by some kind of malign or disruptive Russian behaviour and that is why I think the strength and resolve of our European friends is so striking today,"" he said. Arriving at the EU meeting in Brussels, Swedish foreign minister Margot Wallstrom told the BBC it was important that the nations were united and demonstrated solidarity with the UK Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis said it was time for an ""extended examination of all the elements involved"" and offered support to the UK. But,speaking after winning a fourth term as leader, President Putin insisted Russia had destroyed all of its chemical weapons, adding it was ""nonsense"" to implicate his  government in the attack. The Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, said Russia destroyed all of its chemical weapons in 2017. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russia's Tass news agency that the UK will have to provide evidence of its claims or apologise. ""Sooner or later they will have to be responsible for these allegations,"" he said. Mr Johnson had earlier accused Moscow of stockpiling the agent used in the attack. A team from the Netherlands-based OPCW, which polices the prohibition of chemical weapons, was invited by the UK to the military research base at Porton Down in Wiltshire to independently verify the nerve agent used. It will take at least two weeks to produce results. Experts at Porton Down say the agent is of a type first developed by the Russians. Police say their investigation will take ""weeks, if not months"" The Metropolitan Police are treating the attack in Salisbury as attempted murder. They have renewed their appealfor sightings of Mr Skripal's burgundy BMW 320D saloon car, registration HD09 WAO, on the morning of 4 March. According to sources cited in a report on ABC News in the US, Mr Skripal and his daughter may have been exposed to the nerve agent through the vehicle's ventilation system. Police say they have recovered 762 exhibits and are trawling through about 4,000 hours of CCTV footage. Officers said they were ""making good progress in what is a painstaking investigation that is likely to be ongoing for weeks, if not months"". Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs last week that the substance used in the attack had been identified as belonging to a group of military-grade nerve agents known as Novichok, developed by the Soviet Union. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Boris Johnson said: ""We actually have evidence within the last 10 years that Russia has not only been investigating the delivery of nerve agents for the purposes of assassination, but has also been creating and stockpiling Novichok.""

It also said it would close the British Council in Russia, which promotes cultural ties between the nations, and the British Consulate in St Petersburg. The prime minister has said the UK government would consider its next steps ""in the coming days, alongside our allies and partners"". Meanwhile, the shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti reiterated Labour's position that the incident was either a ""loss of control"" by the Russian state or a ""malevolent directed attack"". John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Labour had given a ""constructive critique"" in response to the incident which others ""had misread"".

"A Turkish tank positioned on the Turkish-Syrian border near Manbij in December Turkey says it has begun a massive assault on Kurdish forces on the other side of the border with Syria - potentially putting it in direct conflict with its Nato ally, the United States. This could become a significant new development in the Syrian civil war, which is now almost seven years old. We've boiled down why it matters. You can choose to read the short, medium or long story below, either by themselves or one after the other. Why is Turkey mounting this assault? One main reason: Turkey considers the US-backed Kurdish militia that controls much of north-eastern Syria a terrorist group. Turkey says the militia is an extension of a Kurdish rebel group it has fought for decades, and wants to prevent it consolidating its hold on Syrian territory. Recent US plans to help the militia form a 30,000-strong ""border security force"" alarmed Ankara. Turkey's president said Washington was ""creating a terror army"" and vowed to ""suffocate"" it. Turkey wants to clear Kurdish forces from Afrin - where operations began on 20 January - and Manbij. Turkey has vowed to crush a Syrian Kurdish militia called the People's Protection Units (YPG), which it considers a terrorist group. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says it is an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades. The YPG denies any direct organisational links - an assertion backed by a US-led coalition whose air strikes have helped the militia and allied Arab fighters drive Islamic State militants from tens of thousands of square kilometres of Syria. Ankara has condemned the US for supporting the YPG and was alarmed when it recently emerged that the coalition was helping it form a 30,000-strong ""border security force"". While Turkey has long threatened to clear YPG fighters from the Kurdish enclave of Afrin, in north-western Syria, and Manbij, a mainly Arab town to the east, the news appears to have brought those plans forward. A day after vowing to stop the US ""creating a terror army on our border"", Mr Erdogan declared that Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels would soon destroy ""nests of terror"". Turkish tanks began building up along the border near Afrin and troops have been shelling the enclave from inside the rebel-held Syrian province of Idlib. Air strikes were launched on 20 January as Turkey announced the operation had begun. Kurdish leaders promised to defend Afrin and urged the international community to prevent Turkey targeting what they said were its 1m residents. Russia, the Syrian government's ally, says it will not interfere in the conflict. It has have moved its troops away from the area. A Turkish assault has opened a new front in a war that activists say has already cost more than 340,000 lives. The UN says it is ready to help displaced civilians if required. Why is Turkey doing this now? To understand the seemingly imminent offensives, it's important to understand Turkey's relations with the Kurds, and who some of the main players are in the Syrian conflict. Turkey had been threatening to attack the Kurdish-controlled towns of Afrin and Manbij for some time in an attempt to counter a militia called the People's Protection Units (YPG), which it considers a terrorist group. Turkey sees the militia as being an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is banned in Turkey and has fought for Kurdish autonomy there since 1984. The YPG denies any direct military or political links with the PKK. A YPG fighter monitoring the area near Afrin in June 2017 The US also rejects Turkey's portrayal of the militia, a key ally in the battle against Islamic State. The YPG is part of an alliance with a number of ethnic Arab militias called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). With the help of US air strikes, its fighters have captured tens of thousands of square kilometres from IS. Who are the Kurds? IS and the crisis in Iraq and Syria in maps Despite being part of the US-led coalition against IS, Turkey has vehemently opposed supporting the SDF and tried to stop it taking control of Syria's northern border. In 2016, the Turkish military supported a Syrian rebel offensive that drove IS militants out of the key towns of Jarablus and al-Bab and stopped SDF fighters moving towards Afrin. The US dissuaded Turkey from also attempting to take the mainly Arab town of Manbij from the SDF by force, but got the YPG to agree to withdraw east of the River Euphrates. Turkish officials say that has not yet happened. One recent development appears to have brought forward Turkey's plans to clear YPG fighters from Afrin and Manbij. News broke on 13 January that the US was helping the SDF build a new ""border security force"". US officials said the plan was to train about 30,000 personnel - half of them SDF fighters - to help prevent infiltration by IS militants across the Turkish and Iraqi borders and parts of the River Euphrates, which effectively divides SDF- and Syrian government-held regions. The announcement enraged Turkey. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that he considered the border force to be a ""terror army"". Syria's government, which has mostly avoided conflict with the Kurds, called it a ""blatant attack"" on its sovereignty. Russia, the government's ally, warned it was a step towards the partition of Syria. Mr Erdogan went on to say Turkish troops and Syrian rebels would soon destroy ""nests of terror"" along its border, ""starting with Afrin and Manbij"". It's significant for a few reasons: Afrin is separated from Manbij and other SDF-controlled areas by a pocket of territory held by Turkish-backed rebels If Afrin and Manbij were to fall, Turkish-backed forces would control a 200km (125-mile) continuous stretch of Syria's northern border west of the Euphrates The YPG has not said how many fighters it has in the two areas, but Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency estimated that there were about 8,000 to 10,000 in Afrin. It is also not clear if US military personnel are deployed around Manbij, as they were last year. It risks bringing the interests of two Nato allies into direct conflict and also have a major impact on relations between Turkey and Russia. Russia - a key military figure in the region - has said it will not interfere in the conflict. As Turkey announced it was beginning the assault on Afrin, Russia said its troops had been relocated elsewhere. Russia controls the enclave's airspace - so Turkey's air strikes that began on 20 January must have had Russian clearance. As this piece explains, a tacit Russian approval for the incursion might bring Moscow and Ankara closer together and have implications for Turkish relations with the West. A siege of Afrin could have grave humanitarian consequences. Kurdish officials say there could be 1m people living in Afrin. Leaving an enclave surrounded by territory held by the Syrian government, and mountains, would be difficult. The UN's refugee agency told the BBC it was prepared to help if needed.

"Police and military officers in protective suits in Durrington The EU has offered the UK ""unqualified solidarity"" in its investigation into the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury. A statement urged Russia to address the UK's questions and called for a full disclosure of its development of Novichok, the nerve agent used. Russian President Vladimir Putin said state involvement was ""unimaginable"". Meanwhile, the Army is recovering a car used to collect Yulia Skripal from the airport, the BBC understands. It is believed the vehicle, in Durrington, Wiltshire, was used by a friend of Mr Skripal to pick up Yulia on 3 March, the day before the pair became unwell. Both Mr Skripal, 66, and Yulia Skripal, 33, remain critically ill in hospital. They were found slumped and unconscious on a bench near a shopping centre in the centre of Salisbury on March 4, having visited a pub and a restaurant. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, are in a critical condition in hospital Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Russian denials of involvement were ""increasingly absurd"" and welcomed the EU support. Responding to President Putin's dismissal of Russian involvement, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""I'm clear that what we have seen shows that there is no other conclusion but that the Russian state is culpable for what happened on the streets of Salisbury."" The EU statement comes as international experts arrive in the UK to assess the type of nerve agent used in the attack. Meanwhile, police investigating the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov,who was found dead in his London home on 12 March, have found no evidence of forced entry into his house. Mr Glushkov's death came in the same week Home Secretary Amber Rudd announced that a string of deaths on UK soil were to be reinvestigated by the police and MI5 after claims of Russian involvement. Police have stressed there is no evidence to link Mr Glushkov's death with the attempted murder of Mr Skripal. What are Novichok nerve agents? Russian spy: What we know so far Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? Russia spy poisoning: What happens when you expel a diplomat? Nikolai Glushkov: Police say no forced entry at Russian's home In a statement, the EU's foreign affairs council said it condemned the ""reckless and illegal act"" and said  it took the UK government's view ""extremely seriously"" that it was likely that Russia was responsible. ""The use of chemical weapons by anyone under any circumstances is completely unacceptable and constitutes a security threat to us all,"" it said. ""The European Union expresses its unqualified solidarity with the UK and its support, including for the UK's efforts to bring those responsible for this crime to justice."" It urged Russia to provide ""immediate, full and complete"" disclosure of its Novichok programme to international body the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).

Mr Johnson, who is in Brussels seeking further support for Britain's stance, said he was ""very heartened"" by the strength of support the UK was getting over the case. ""There is scarcely a country round the table here in Brussels that has not been affected in recent years by some kind of malign or disruptive Russian behaviour and that is why I think the strength and resolve of our European friends is so striking today,"" he said. Arriving at the EU meeting in Brussels, Swedish foreign minister Margot Wallstrom told the BBC it was important that the nations were united and demonstrated solidarity with the UK Spanish foreign minister Alfonso Dastis said it was time for an ""extended examination of all the elements involved"" and offered support to the UK. But,speaking after winning a fourth term as leader, President Putin insisted Russia had destroyed all of its chemical weapons, adding it was ""nonsense"" to implicate his  government in the attack. The Russian ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, said Russia destroyed all of its chemical weapons in 2017. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russia's Tass news agency that the UK will have to provide evidence of its claims or apologise. ""Sooner or later they will have to be responsible for these allegations,"" he said. Mr Johnson had earlier accused Moscow of stockpiling the agent used in the attack. A team from the Netherlands-based OPCW, which polices the prohibition of chemical weapons, was invited by the UK to the military research base at Porton Down in Wiltshire to independently verify the nerve agent used. It will take at least two weeks to produce results. Experts at Porton Down say the agent is of a type first developed by the Russians. Police say their investigation will take ""weeks, if not months"" The Metropolitan Police are treating the attack in Salisbury as attempted murder. They have renewed their appealfor sightings of Mr Skripal's burgundy BMW 320D saloon car, registration HD09 WAO, on the morning of 4 March. According to sources cited in a report on ABC News in the US, Mr Skripal and his daughter may have been exposed to the nerve agent through the vehicle's ventilation system. Police say they have recovered 762 exhibits and are trawling through about 4,000 hours of CCTV footage. Officers said they were ""making good progress in what is a painstaking investigation that is likely to be ongoing for weeks, if not months"". Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs last week that the substance used in the attack had been identified as belonging to a group of military-grade nerve agents known as Novichok, developed by the Soviet Union. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Boris Johnson said: ""We actually have evidence within the last 10 years that Russia has not only been investigating the delivery of nerve agents for the purposes of assassination, but has also been creating and stockpiling Novichok.""

It also said it would close the British Council in Russia, which promotes cultural ties between the nations, and the British Consulate in St Petersburg. The prime minister has said the UK government would consider its next steps ""in the coming days, alongside our allies and partners"". Meanwhile, the shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti reiterated Labour's position that the incident was either a ""loss of control"" by the Russian state or a ""malevolent directed attack"". John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, said Labour had given a ""constructive critique"" in response to the incident which others ""had misread"".

"Donald Trump's use of Twitter to attack opponents is unprecedented Donald Trump has attacked special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the US presidential election he won in 2016. He tweeted that the inquiry was unfair - and reiterated there had been ""no collusion"" between his election campaign and Russia. He added that it was dominated by ""hardened Democrats"" and supporters of his defeated opponent Hillary Clinton. Mr Mueller, a highly regarded former head of the FBI, is a Republican. The president's comments came a day after his lawyer, John Dowd, said it was time for the special counsel's investigation to end. Initially Mr Dowd said he was speaking for the president but later clarified he was ""speaking for myself"". Who's who in Russia-Trump inquiry? Trump Russia: Key questions answered What is a special counsel? Mr Trump's latest tweet drew warnings from fellow Republicans about interfering with the investigation. Allow Twitter content?

In earlier tweets, the president also berated former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, who was fired by Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Friday just two days before he was due to retire, and former FBI director James Comey, whom Mr Trump sacked last year. The latter firing led to the Mueller investigation being set up. Mr Trump accused Mr Comey of lying under oath before Congress, and described the contemporaneous notes that Mr McCabe and Mr Comey took following discussions with him as ""fake memos"". Mr McCabe has given memos about conversations he had with President Trump to the Mueller inquiry, US media say. The memos could support claims that Mr Trump sought to obstruct justice. Mr Mueller has so far indicted 19 people. Robert Mueller has admirers on all sides of US politics But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said Mr Mueller should be allowed to proceed without interference, and that many Republicans shared his view. He also warned Mr Trump against any attempt to dismiss Mr Mueller. ""If he tried to do that, that would be the beginning of the end of his presidency, because we're a rule of law nation,"" Mr Graham said. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, a frequent Trump critic, said it appeared the president's latest comments seemed to be preparing the ground for the firing of Mr Mueller. ""I don't know what the designs are on Mueller, but it seems to be building toward that, and I just hope it doesn't go there, because it can't. We can't in Congress accept that,"" he told CNN. ""I'm just puzzled by why the White House is going so hard at this, other than that they're very afraid of what might come out."" Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer accused Mr Trump of ""floating trial balloons about derailing"" the investigation. ""Our Republican colleagues, particularly the leadership, have an obligation to our country to stand up now and make it clear that firing Mueller is a red line for our democracy that cannot be crossed,"" the Democrat said in a statement. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter With a weekend free of scheduled presidential obligations, Donald Trump has ratcheted up the rhetoric directed toward independent counsel Robert Mueller. Perhaps it is because the president feels emboldened by the one-two punch of the Republican intelligence committee conclusion that there was no ""collusion"" between the Trump camp and Russia, and his attorney general's decision to fire former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe. Or maybe it is because Mr Trump is on edge following reports that Mr Mueller is now looking into the Trump Organization's business dealings with Russia. Whatever the reason, the president spent the weekend swinging at ""hardened Democrats"" on Mr Mueller's team and ""sanctimonious"" former FBI Director James Comey, and celebrating Mr McCabe's unceremonious exit. And so the president's strategy comes into shape. Paint his critics and investigators as anti-Trump, deep-state establishment forces and the entire inquiry as based on a biased and corrupt premise. The next step would be to claim any evidence of wrongdoing unearthed by Mr Mueller is irretrievably tainted. That, of course, isn't much of a legal defence. In a war for public opinion, however, it's a place where his side could dig in. Mr McCabe had been under internal investigation by the FBI and had already stepped down from his deputy post in January pending the review. He was sacked just two days short of his 50th birthday on Sunday, when he was expected to retire with a federal pension. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said the ""extensive and fair investigation""had concluded that Mr McCabe ""made an unauthorised disclosure to the news media and lacked candour - including under oath - on multiple occasions"". The White House said it left the decision to fire Mr McCabe (right) to Mr Sessions (left) Although the decision to fire Mr McCabe was made by Mr Sessions, Mr Trump had criticised him for months. He has publicly pointed to donations that Mr McCabe's wife, a Democrat, received from a Clinton ally when she ran unsuccessfully for the state Senate in 2015 as evidence that Mr McCabe was politically biased. He welcomed the news of his dismissal almost immediately after Mr Sessions announced it, calling the move a ""great day for democracy"". News that Mr McCabe had kept records of his conversations with Mr Trump at the time he was acting FBI director emerged on Saturday. US media say the memos will support Mr Comey's account of the circumstances of his dismissal last May. This video can not be played Comey's most revealing moments Mr Comey has testified that Mr Trump had asked him for his ""loyalty"" and requested he drop an inquiry into his disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. He, too, has said he kept contemporaneous notes of his dealings with the president. In a statement responding to his firing on Friday, Mr McCabe vehemently denied wrongdoing,external. ""I am being singled out and treated this way because of the role I played, the actions I took, and the events I witnessed in the aftermath of the firing of James Comey,"" his response said. Republican memo accuses FBI of abusing power Trump renews attack on 'disgraceful' FBI The statement alleges that the justice department report recommending his firing was ""accelerated"" after he indicated that he would corroborate Mr Comey's version of events. On Saturday Mr Comey - who is due to release a book - said Americans would soon be able to judge for themselves ""who is honourable or not"". Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played An Australian town's residents flee via the beach as a bushfire sweeps in More than 70 homes and buildings are feared to have been destroyed in a bushfire in Australia, authorities say. The fast-moving fire engulfed the New South Wales (NSW) coastal town of Tathra late on Sunday local time. Authorities said locals were evacuated to a nearby town and there were no reports of anyone missing. Earlier, separate blazes in Victoria destroyed up to 18 properties. Authorities described the bushfires as the worst of Australia's summer season. In Tathra, about 450km (280 miles) south of Sydney, four people were treated for smoke inhalation and one firefighter was injured, authorities said. Many residents left the town by walking along the beach on Sunday as temperatures reached up to 38C (101F). ""The smoke was thick and black. You could see the rescue helicopter with the water and you know it was all so real,"" one local, Simone Ward, told the BBC. She said that most people had left with only a few belongings. The town has about 1,600 residents. Tathra residents walk along a beach to seek shelter in a neighbouring town The bushfire in Tathra, New South Wales, following hot and windy conditions The fire had not been contained after burning through more than 1,000 hectares, the NSW Rural Fire Service said on Monday.

How Australia's extreme heat might be here to stay The deadly threat of hot weather and bushfires He said weather conditions on Monday would make it easier to battle the fire. The bushfires in Victoria destroyed up to 18 properties and killed livestock in rural areas north of the town of Warrnambool, authorities said. The fires affected at least 40,000 hectares and were probably sparked by lightning on Saturday, according to officials. In September, Australians were warned to prepare for a dangerous bushfire season after one of the driest winters on record.

"Vladimir Putin has been in power since 2000, longer than any Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. Now into his fifth term as president, aged 71, all semblance of opposition to his rule is gone and there is little to stop him staying on, if he wants, until 2036. And yet, it was almost by accident that this little-known, former KGB man was hand-picked for the Kremlin. A case of being in the right place at the right time in predecessor Boris Yeltsin's inner circle. Vladimir Putin was a street-fighting boy whose early years were spent in a communal flat, orkommunalka, in communist Leningrad. Although he appeared to embrace liberal, democratic Russia, he later described the chaotic collapse of the Soviet Union as ""the biggest geopolitical catastrophe of the [20th] Century"". Determined to prevent Ukraine from leaving Russia's orbit, he unleashed Europe's biggest war since World War Two, with a full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022. He often justifies his actions with an outlandish perception of history and a keen resentment of Nato. Before the invasion, and since, he falsely claimed that Ukraine was an artificial state populated by neo-Nazis. And he sought to stop Ukraine getting closer to Nato. The Western leader who arguably knew him best was Germany's former chancellor Angela Merkel, who is once reputed to have described him as out of touch with reality and ""in another world"". She repeatedly tried to negotiate with Vladimir Putin, but after he sent troops to invade Kyiv she came to the conclusion ""he wants to destroy Europe"". Rosenberg: Russia's stage-managed election Occupied Ukraine forced to vote in Putin's election Ukrainecast on BBC Sounds: Putin claims victory - what next for Russia? Vladimir Putin was born seven years after the end of World War Two - following the siege of Leningrad which killed his elder brother and which his parents barely survived. He had a tough childhood that would affect the rest of his life. In an interview in 2000, he remembered cornering a large rat on the staircase of his communal apartment block. It had nowhere to run. Putin described the rat lashing out and throwing itself at him: ""There, on the landing, I got a quick and lasting lesson in the meaning of the word cornered."" In 2000, a 10-year-old Japanese girl floored Mr Putin in Tokyo The young Putin got into fights with local boys who were often bigger and stronger. Later, he would look back on that time and describe himself as a ""hooligan"". He took up judo, which he continued as a black belt during his presidency, and the Russian martial art of sambo, and stayed close to his childhood partners, Arkady and Boris Rotenberg. In 2015, he reflected on his early experiences on the streets of what is now St Petersburg: ""Fifty years ago the Leningrad street taught me a rule: if a fight is inevitable, you have to throw the first punch."" After studying at Leningrad State University, in 1975 he went straight into the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB. It was a natural step for a law graduate, and it suited him perfectly. It was also a dream job for a young man brought up on Soviet TV shows such as The Sword and the Shield, which recounted the derring-do of an undercover Russian spy in Nazi Germany. ""I was a pure and utterly successful product of Soviet patriotic education,"" he reflected. By now, he spoke good German and he was posted to the East German city of Dresden in 1985 where he saw first-hand the collapse of a communist state in 1989. Vladimir Putin's formative German years From the KGB headquarters across the road, he watched as crowds stormed the headquarters of the East German secret police, the Stasi. When a small group approached his building, he warned them off. But when he called a Red Army tank unit for protection, he realised Russia was of no help: ""We cannot do anything without orders from Moscow. And Moscow is silent."" The next year, he returned to a political system in free fall. He was given the rank of lieutenant-colonel, but never excelled at the KGB. One of his superiors, Nikolai Leonov, considered him a ""mediocre agent"". To this day, he retains a small circle of KGB colleagues from Leningrad as his closest confidants - long-standing allies such as Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia's Security Council. It was not because of their ""pretty eyes"" he recruited them, his old judo coach Anatoly Rakhlin once recalled, ""but because he trusts people who've proved themselves"". Those he trusts, he often enriches. He handed childhood friend Arkady Rotenberg a $3.5bn (Â£2.7bn) contract to build a bridge from Russia to occupied Crimea. He is intensely private about his personal life, and divorced his wife Lyudmila in 2013 after 30 years of marriage. They had two daughters, widely named as Maria Vorontsova, an academic and businesswoman, and Katerina Tikhonova, head of a research foundation. Vladimir Putin's younger daughter, Katerina Tikhonova, is known to love acrobatic rock 'n' roll From 1991, Vladimir Putin became deputy to the new mayor of Leningrad, Anatoly Sobchak, and a highly valued adviser. When Sobchak was voted out, his deputy was headhunted to work in the presidential administration in Moscow. These were the dying years of the Boris Yeltsin administration and Putin's rise was meteoric. He spent a short time as head of the Federal Security Service, which replaced the KGB, and was then asked to report to the president as secretary of the Security Council. On 9 August 1999, an ailing Yeltsin sacked his prime minister, replacing him with a little-known 46-year-old protege who would see through reforms ahead of presidential elections in 2000. Yeltsin was by now in need of a successor. ""Putin had shown himself to be a liberal and a democrat, who wanted to continue market reforms,"" said Valentin Yumashev, who told Yeltsin he would make a ""superb candidate"". The man who helped put Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin As Yeltsin's presidency faded away, Moscow was hit by a series of deadly but unexplained bombings. Vladimir Putin responded with a full-scale land offensive to recapture the mainly Muslim Russian republic of Chechnya from separatist rebels. His popularity soared and on 31 December 1999 he was appointed acting president, winning his first presidential term three months later. Thousands of civilians died in the Chechen campaign and, as he often does, Vladimir Putin used crude language to describe how he would wipe out the rebels ""even in the toilet"". The capital Grozny was devastated; Russia's leader had his victory. His first domestic challenge came in 2000, when the nuclear submarine Kursk sank in an accident in the Barents Sea, with the loss of all 118 crew. President Putin remained on holiday and initially refused offers of international help. Many of the crew died waiting to be rescued. TV viewers watched as grieving women screamed at their president. Russia marks Kursk anniversary Four years later, Chechen rebels took 1,000 hostages, most of them children, at a school in Beslan, North Ossetia. When Russian special forces stormed the building, 330 people died. It later emerged that Russia had intelligence of a planned attack but had failed to act. The first years of the Putin presidency were both bloody and turbulent, but the Russian economy was doing well, buoyed by high oil prices. He won public support for taking on the billionaire oligarchs who had run rife in Russia in the 1990s. Summoning them to the Kremlin, he said they could keep their money as long as they kept out of politics and backed him. He acted fast against those who didn't, such as Russia's then-wealthiest man Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was arrested at gunpoint and jailed in Siberia. Russia's president had something of a honeymoon with the West. He was one of the first foreign leaders to ring President George W Bush after the 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks on the US. He even helped the US launch its ensuing campaign in Afghanistan. ""I looked the man in the eye. I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy,"" said President Bush. But Vladimir Putin soon became disillusioned with the US and its allies. Relations with the UK soured when a former KGB agent and Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko was murdered in London using radioactive polonium-210. A UK inquiry found later that the Russian leader had ""probably approved"" the KGB attack. On a visit to the Munich Security Conference in 2007, Putin made his feelings towards the US clear. ""One state, the United States, has overstepped its national borders in every way,"" he complained. It was an icy reminder of the old Cold War and an expression of Russia's anger that the US was continuing to plan for a missile defence system in Central Europe. ""The stones of the Berlin Wall have long been distributed as souvenirsâ¦ and now they are trying to impose new dividing lines and walls on us,"" said Putin. It did not take him long to show he was prepared to use military power to undermine pro-Western leaders in former Soviet states. In 2008, Russian forces routed the Georgian army and took over two of its breakaway regions - Abkhazia and South Ossetia. It was a very personal clash with Georgia's then pro-Nato President, Mikheil Saakashvili. Vladimir Putin was by now prime minister, as the constitution barred him serving a third consecutive term as president, but it was clear he still held the levers of power. Vladimir Putin, seen here in 2015 with Dmitry Medvedev Today that problem no longer exists. He steered through a law in 2021 that reset his limit to zero, which means he can head straight into a fifth term, and even a sixth. Russia in 2024 is very different from the restive country in the run-up to the third Putin term. In 2011, the biggest mass protests since the collapse of the Soviet Union erupted in Russia's major cities in response to widespread allegations of fraud in parliamentary elections. Among the protest leaders was Boris Nemtsov, a liberal, former deputy prime minister in the 1990s. Another rising figure was anti-corruption blogger Alexei Navalny, who labelled Mr Putin's United Russia ""the party of crooks and thieves"". Now, genuine opposition has all but vanished. Nemtsov was shot dead on a bridge, in view of the Kremlin, in 2015. Navalny survived a nerve agent poison attack in 2020, before he was thrown in jail in January 2021 and died three years later. His widow has accused Vladimir Putin of murder. Putin has secured the support of the Orthodox Church and he has built a National Guard, or Rosgvardiya, that reports direct to him. Acts of public defiance are few and far between, and newly created offences targeting those who discredit the military and disseminate fake news are widely used to silence dissent. Russia's media is largely pliant and controlled by the Kremlin, which has become consumed by an all-out war in Ukraine. Yevgeny Prigozhin thrived for years under Vladimir Putin until he led an armed rebellion in 2023 Putin faced a short, armed rebellion in June 2023, when the formerly loyal mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin sent his forces on the road to Moscow. But it was snuffed out and Prigozhin was later killed in a mysterious plane crash. Some 40% of budget spending in 2024 will go on defence and security, as President Putin diverts much of the economy to the war. Putin's war in Ukraine started, not in February 2022, but with the seizure of Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014. Putin reveals secret Crimea plot The night that Ukraine's pro-Moscow leader fled violent protests in Kyiv and was effectively ousted, the Russian president said he held an all-night meeting and told his colleagues it was time to ""bring Crimea back into Russia"". Pro-Russian agitators then seized swathes of Ukraine's Donbas region and war took hold in the east for eight years - until Putin decided he would invade from the north, south and east in a bid to overthrow Ukraine's elected government and seize Kyiv, with the invasion in 2022 . He has repeatedly sought to justify the war. He writes long historical essays, gives speeches and lectures the few foreign visitors that come. But it is a distorted, selective history that brooks no dissent. Civil rights group Memorial, which has devoted decades to remembering the victims of Soviet repression, has been banned. Its veteran co-president Oleg Orlov was jailed for this description of the Putin era: ""They wanted fascism, and they got it."" Will Putin rule Russia forever?

"This video can not be played Meet three young Russians born when Putin came to power. Will they vote for him when their get their chance? Nikita Pavlov is six days too young to vote in Russia's presidential election on 18 March. ""It doesn't matter, I wouldn't have voted anyway,"" he says. ""This is the election with no choice."" Nikita lives in Nizhny Novgorod, a central Russian city of one million inhabitants. He wants to study in Moscow and in a few months he will find out if his grades are good enough. ""There's no prospect for me here,"" he says. Nikita Pavlov would not have voted even if he could ""A job in an office for 50,000 roubles (Â£633; $880) a month is the best I can hope for in this town."" After finishing school, many young Russians head to Moscow or St Petersburg. That is where the jobs and the money are. Nikita's dream is to become an entertainer. He wants to be like Ivan Urgant, a Russian late-night talk show host similar to Stephen Colbert or Jimmy Kimmel. ""But you can't speak freely on TV,"" he says. And censorship is not the only problem. ""We live in a feudal state here in Russia,"" Nikita says. ""If I look for a good position after graduation, all the nice posts will be taken by well-connected sons."" Many young Russians took part in anti-corruption rallies in 2017 The idea of boycotting the ""election with no choice"" is Alexei Navalny's. The opposition leader is barred from standing as a presidential candidate because of a corruption conviction that he says is politically motivated. Life in Putin's Russia explained in 10 charts Strawberry tycoon among Putin challengers Vladimir Putin: Russia's action man president Russian state TV anchor warns 'traitors' Navalny has been campaigning against corruption since 2008, but he became popular among teenagers in the spring of 2017. Youngsters like Nikita turned out to Navalny's anti-corruption rallies all over the country, unafraid of the police who detained many protesters. In March, when the rallies spread to 82 Russian cities, teachers and university professors started berating their students for attending the protests. But the teachers proved out of touch with their digital-savvy students. All over the country, pupils recorded teachers trying to humiliate them and uploaded the films on the internet. Election after election, fewer and fewer voters go to the polling stations. Many want to rid their lives of politics altogether. ""I would be fine with a monarchy,"" Ivan Sourvillo shrugs. ""I guess Stalin is not OK, but I can live with any government that doesn't touch me personally."" Eighteen-year-old Ivan has a successful blog. He interviews well-known Russians and writes about his travels and the lectures he has attended. With about 20,000 subscribers, he can make about $150 a month. Ivan Sourvillo was born the year Vladimir Putin first became president Ivan lives just off the Arbat, a prosperous part of central Moscow filled with souvenir shops and artists waiting for tourists. ""Is this where you used to run around when you were younger?"" I ask. ""I didn't run around, I read books,"" he answers earnestly. Ivan was born in 1999, shortly before Vladimir Putin came to power. He can vote for the president, but he has not yet decided if he will. ""Putin has never done anything wrong to me - he does many right things,"" he says. ""He is definitely better than Trump, for example. Sure, the same people shouldn't rule forever. On the other hand, Russia's traditional form of government is monarchy."" ""You would walk out into the street and someone would steal your trainers from you,"" Alya Bazarova says of Russia in the 90s, a time before she was born. ""Putin practically restored the state. Compared to [former President Boris] Yeltsin, he was a reformer."" Alya, 18, is in her first year at a Moscow university. She calls herself a provincial girl - three years ago, her family moved to Moscow from Kursk, a city of fewer than 500,000 people. Alya Bazarova accepts Vladimir Putin will become president for a fourth time ""Everyone thinks it's impossible to live in the provinces,"" she says. ""But I see Kursk developing. Shopping malls are being built. We even have traffic jams now - that means people are buying cars. ""And all this with a governor who has been there for, like, 20 years."" She sometimes discusses politics with her boyfriend. ""He says: 'Any government which is there for too long becomes bad',"" Alya explains. ""And my dad says: 'If not Putin, then who else?"" When Alya was growing up, her family saw the same presidential candidates over and over, looking older every time. This time, things are slightly different. The communists have put up the successful businessman and Stalinist Pavel Grudinin. And TV star Ksenia Sobchak is standing as a liberal opposition candidate. But Alya isn't convinced. Alya has decided to vote on 18 March. But only out of curiosity - she has never been to a polling station before. ""I don't really believe in democracy,"" she says, lowering her voice a little. ""Everything is decided for us. Let's say the vote [has an unexpected outcome]. Don't you think they'll just swap the votes? Come onâ¦"" Everyone in Russia knows who is going to be the next president. But they probably will not need to stuff the ballot boxes to win. ""Who are you going to vote for?"" I ask. She laughs awkwardly. ""Well, who can you vote for? All the candidates are chosen specially so it's obvious who you should pick.""

"These rebranded recycling bins were removed after being placed on a supermarket car park without permission. Charities have lost hundreds of thousands of pounds after 750 clothing banks were taken from car parks, says the Textile Recycling Association. Recycling companies working with them say sometimes up to 20 a week have gone missing in the last year across England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Some have been rebranded with a different charity logo and placed at sites without permission, the TRA says. The Charity Commission has launched an investigation. There are around 15,000 clothing banks throughout the whole of the UK, often placed at supermarket car parks and recycling sites. Some are run by charities such as The Salvation Army, Oxfam and the British Heart Foundation  themselves, but others are operated by private recycling companies who give a donation to charities - on average Â£250 for every tonne of clothes collected. Around Â£75m was given to charities and local authorities last year. The TRA, which represents the sector, says the clothing banks have been taken from across the country - including in England's North West, the Midlands and East. It says charities receive on average Â£70 worth of donations a week from each bank. Because it can take between six to eight weeks to replace a bank, it is estimated charities could have lost nearly Â£370,000. In some cases, the recycling companies are not replacing the banks so the charities will lose out permanently. Recycling Solutions North West, based in Heywood in Greater Manchester, donates between Â£5,000 and Â£6,000 a month to a charity which helps critically ill babies and children. James Cook and his baby son Dexter, who died from an undiagnosed heart condition. Last month, 12 of its clothing banks were taken from sites across Greater Manchester. One of the directors, James Cook, is passionate about the charity after his son Dexter, who had an undiagnosed heart condition, died when he was only 13 months old. He said: ""I just can't understand why any individual would go out and take the clothing banks. ""The families, they're relying on that charity to carry out a service for their child. It is a lifesaving service. ""I do like to see the target go up every month, I like to see the money climb and I'm going to see it drop next month and that will hurt."" Another charity which is counting the cost is Reuben's Retreat in Glossop, which provides support to families who have lost a child or have children with life-limiting illnesses. The Reuben's Retreat charity is named after Reuben Graham who died from a brain tumour. It receives donations from a recycling company, but the amount it receives has now been reduced after a number of clothing banks were taken. Nicola Graham - who founded the charity after the death of her son Reuben - said: ""It will have a significant impact on our funding stream. ""Reuben's little photograph is on that bin, and all our details. ""It just beggars belief that somebody can think that it's OK to take from charity and actually take something with his little face on it."" The TRA say the cost of replacing a bank can be up to Â£1,500 and the total bill to its members could be as much as Â£1m. President Ian Woods said the loss of the banks was ""depriving members of the public from a service intended for them to recycle textiles and, more importantly, depriving charities and local authorities nationwide of revenue streams which are vitally important for the services they deliver"". He added: ""We are appealing to the police and other government agencies to join us in the campaign to clamp down on all forms of illegal activity connected to textile recycling."" Investigators working for the TRA have removed around 200 banks which they say have been rebranded with the logo of a registered charity called Helping Our Future and placed on supermarket car parks without authorisation. The charity, which is based in Wolverhampton, says it raised nearly Â£19,000 last year and works to promote recycling and relieve financial hardship. BBC 5 live Investigates has discovered Helping our Future is under investigation by the Charity Commission. A spokesperson said: ""The commission is examining the charity Helping Our Future as part of a regulatory compliance case. ""We have serious concerns about its management and activities, and are examining trustees' oversight of the charity, its relationship with third parties, including commercial fundraising companies, and whether the charity's management and operations have given rise to inappropriate benefit on the part of private individuals or companies."" The charity, which the BBC understands leases its banks from a third party, denies any wrongdoing. A company which says it acts for Helping Our Future told the BBC:  ""We are an associated contractor to HOF Trading Limited which is the logistical partner to Helping our Future Charity. ""We are contracted to abide by a written protocol which prevents us from carrying out any criminal activity and bringing any holistic partner into disrepute."" The company added that some of the charity's own banks had been taken and that this had been reported to the police. 5 live Investigates is onBBC Radio 5 live, 18 March at 11:00 GMT - catch up onBBC iPlayer Radio.
