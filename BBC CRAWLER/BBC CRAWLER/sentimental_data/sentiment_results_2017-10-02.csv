"This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes At least 59 people have been killed and another 527 injured in a mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert. A gunman, named as 64-year-old Nevada resident Stephen Paddock, opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards an open-air music festival attended by 22,000. He killed himself as police stormed the room where 10 guns were found. Investigators have found no link to international terrorism, despite a claim from so-called Islamic State. In an address from the White House, President Donald Trump described the attack as ""pure evil"". He praised the efforts of the emergency services, saying their ""miraculous"" speed saved lives, and announced he would be visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday. With First Lady Melania by his side, he later observed a moment of silence on the White House lawn. This video can not be played A police scanner captures the moment police burst into gunman's room The final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck. Thousands were enjoying a performance by top-billing singer Jason Aldean when the first of several bursts of automatic gunfire rang out - hundreds of shots, witnesses say. That was late on Sunday night - 22:08 local time (05:08 GMT on Monday). Hundreds of concert-goers scrambled for cover, flattening themselves against the ground, rushing for the exits or helping others to escape as Paddock sprayed the site from his high vantage point. What the witnesses saw In pictures: Vegas shooting Hundreds of concert-goers fled the scene or ducked for cover amid heavy gunfire ""One man had blood all over him and that's when I knew something was seriously wrong,"" Mike Thompson from London, told the BBC. ""People were running and there was chaos."" Concert-goer Mike McGarry, who survived, told Reuters he lay on top of his children when the shots rang out. ""They're 20, I'm 53. I lived a good life,"" he said. Many hotels on the Las Vegas strip close to the scene were placed on police lockdown and parts of Las Vegas Boulevard were shut. Aldean, who was rushed off-stage, shared his reactionon Instagram,external. ""Tonight has been beyond horrific,"" he wrote. Las Vegas police say the number of people injured stands at 515. Las Vegas shooting - what we know The fake photos shared after tragedies Suspected gunman Stephen Paddock - undated image Stephen Paddock, from a community of senior citizens in the small town of Mesquite north-east of Las Vegas, booked into the hotel on 28 September, police say. His motives for carrying out the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history remain a mystery. Some investigators have suggested psychological issues, but there is no confirmation of this. His brother, Eric, is dumbfounded that he acted this way. This video can not be played Eric Paddock says he is in total shock after police named his brother, Stephen, as the shooter Las Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardo described the shooting as a ""lone wolf"" attack. ""We have no idea what his belief system was,"" he said. So-called Islamic State (IS) has claimed to be behind the attack, saying that Paddock had converted to Islam some months ago. But the group provided no evidence for this and has made unsubstantiated claims in the past. FBI Special Agent Aaron Rouse told a news conference: ""We have determined at this point no connection to an international terrorist organisation."" IS's claim of responsibility for the Las Vegas attack is very unusual in that the perpetrator's profile does not fit that of supporters or ""soldiers"" that the group has claimed in the past, writes Mina al-Lami, who monitors jihadist groups for the BBC. If true, his suicide would be deemed wholly ""un-Islamic"", she adds. Jihadist suicides involve the assailant blowing himself up in order to kill those around him. What we know about the gunman A couple at the concert take cover after gunfire was heard at country music festival The investigation continues to gather pace, with searches at Paddock's Mesquite home, where more weapons were found, and a second property. Paddock lived in Mesquite with Marilou Danley. Police have interviewed her but say she does not appear to have been involved as she was out of the country. They are hoping to speak to her again. Police say he used some of her identity documents to check in to the Mandalay Bay. The authorities have yet to confirm the identities of any of the 58 killed. Jordan McIldoon, 23, from British Columbia in Canada, has been identified as a victim of the attack byCBC News,external. 'We helped three victims' A nurse, Sonny Melton, of Big Sandy, Tennessee, has been named as another victim byThe Jackson Sun,externalnewspaper. In a Facebook post, his wife, Dr Heather Gulish Melton, said she ""lost my true love and knight in shining armor. I appreciate the prayers but I just need some time."" An off-duty Las Vegas police officer was another of those who died. More on the victims By the BBC's James Cook in Las Vegas The scenes which played out in this stunned city were at once frantically urgent and wearily familiar. When gunfire rings out, Americans know the drill. Run. They fled from a gunman who left a city in chaos. For a time, Las Vegas looked and felt like a war zone. Hospitals were overwhelmed. There were not enough ambulances. A plea for blood donations echoed across the airwaves. And now the mourning, the relief, the tears, the elation, the grief and a hundred other emotions are barely beginning. Doctors are still battling to save lives. For a Western democracy, the United States has seen an astonishing amount of horror like this. But even for this country what happened here is carnage on a different scale. America's mass shooting disease now feels like a plague. Nevada has some of the least stringent gun laws in the United States. People are allowed to carry weapons and do not have to register themselves as a gun-owner. Background checks are done when people buy guns, but they are also allowed to sell them privately. Former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a shooting six years ago, called for political leaders in Washington to introduce tougher gun laws following the Las Vegas attack. Her husband Mark Kelly read out a joint statement on the steps of the Capitol saying thoughts and prayers from the White House were not enough to stop the next shooting.

"""It was like living next to nothing,"" said a former neighbour of Paddock Las Vegas concert gunman Stephen Paddock was a wealthy former accountant and high-stakes gambler who appeared to be living in quiet retirement with his girlfriend in a desert community. The 64-year-old, of Mesquite, Nevada, had pilot's and hunting licences and no criminal record, said authorities. One former neighbour said twice-divorced Paddock was ""weird"". But his brother described him as a regular guy who liked playing video poker, live music and eating burritos. Is the gunman a terrorist? What we know so far Who are the victims? Paddock has been identified by police as the man behind the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, with the death toll surpassing the 49 killed at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016. He opened fire from the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino on Sunday night, killing 58 people and wounding almost 500 others, before turning the gun on himself as police closed in, said officials. Police shared this updated timeline of events on Wednesday Stephen Paddock had a troubled childhood, with a bank robber for a father, who regularly beat him, and a mother who struggled to bring him and his three brothers up, according to reports. One of the gunman's brothers, Eric Paddock, told reporters the family were stunned. ""He liked to play video poker,"" he said. ""He went on cruises. He sent his mother cookies."" Their father was once on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. This video can not be played What gunfire tells us about weapons used Twenty-three weapons were found in the 32nd-floor hotel room that Paddock checked into last Thursday. Police found ""in excess of"" 19 firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition in his Mesquite home, within a quiet retirement community 80 miles (130km) north-east of Las Vegas. They also found several pounds of an explosive called tannerite, and ammonium nitrate, a type of fertiliser used as an explosive, in his car. From 1976 to 1985 worked as a postman, an Internal Revenue Service agent and an auditor for the Defense Contract Audit Agency Worked for the predecessor company of Lockheed Martin in the 80s Maintained relations with his younger brother Eric but estranged from older brothers Bruce and Patrick Grew up in Sun Valley, California, and attended California State University in Northridge He was married twice and had no children Sources: US media reports Police said no manifesto or anything else had been discovered to explain Paddock's actions. ""I can't get into the mind of a psychopath at this point,"" Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said. The FBI said its agents had established no connection between Paddock and any overseas terrorist group, despite so-called Islamic State describing him as a ""soldier of the caliphate"". Paddock only previous known brush with the law was a routine traffic violation. This video can not be played How the horror unfolded David Famiglietti, of the New Frontier Armory, told the BBC that Paddock had purchased firearms at his store in north Las Vegas last spring, meeting all state and federal requirements, including an FBI background check. However, the shotgun and rifle Paddock bought would not have been ""capable of what we've seen and heard in the video without modification"", Mr Famiglietti said. Country music stars react Five reasons US gun control won't happen Two gun stocks were found in the hotel room, AP news agency reported, which can enable a weapon to fire hundreds of shots per minute. This video can not be played Eric Paddock says he is in total shock after police named his brother, Stephen, as the shooter According to NBC News,external, Paddock recently made several gambling transactions in the tens of thousands of dollars, but it was unclear if those bets were wins or losses. Bruce Paddock told NBC his brother was a multi-millionaire property investor. This video can not be played Trump on Las Vegas shooting: 'It was an act of pure evil' He had shown no sign of financial problems and reports said he owned a number of properties that he rented out. Separately, Eric Paddock said that Stephen came up with the cash to ensure that family members - including their elderly mother - were provided for. ""Steve took care of the people he loved. He helped make me and my family wealthy. He's the reason I was able to retire. This is the Steve we know, we knew. The people he loved and took care of,""Eric Paddock said in a news conference, according to CBS News,external. He described his brother as ""intelligent"" and ""successful."" This video can not be played Witnesses say people were being trampled Stephen Paddock moved to his two-storey house in Mesquite from Reno, Nevada, in June 2016. He lived in the property in Babbling Brook Court with his girlfriendMarilou Danley, 62. What do we know about Marilou Danley? Police have ruled out any involvement by Ms Danley, who was overseas at the time of the massacre but has nowreturned to the US, where she is facing questioning. She is an Australian citizen who moved to Nevada 20 years ago, the government in Canberra said. Marilou Danley, initially described as a person of interest, was located by police outside of the US A former neighbour, Diane McKay, 79,told the Washington Post,externalthe couple always kept the blinds closed at home. ""He was weird,"" she said. ""Kept to himself. It was like living next to nothing. ""You can at least be grumpy, something. He was just nothing, quiet."" Elsewhere the newspaper quoted neighbours in ""several states"" where Paddock owned retirement homes, describing him as ""surly, unfriendly and standoffish"". But those who lived close to a house he owned in Melbourne, Florida, have described him as ""very friendly"". According to US media, Paddock had a licence to fly small planes and owned two aircraft. In 2012, he filed a negligence lawsuit against The Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas, after a fall he said was caused by an ""obstruction"" on the floor, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported. The legal action was reportedly dropped in 2014. The relative lack of red flags in Paddock's personal history has only heightened the sense of bewilderment as a shocked nation asks: Why?

"The captain of the submarine HMS Vigilant is at the centre of the investigation, the BBC understands A nuclear submarine captain has been relieved of his command after an alleged ""inappropriate relationship"" with a member of his crew. The Royal Navy captain is being investigated following the allegations, which involve a female member of crew. The BBC understands the captain of the submarine HMS Vigilant is at the centre of the investigation. HMS Vigilant is a Vanguard class submarine based at HMNB Clyde at Faslane in Argyll and Bute. It is one of four British submarines armed with the Trident ballistic missile system. The Royal Navy has confirmed an investigation is ongoing but said it had not had an impact on current operations. A ban on women serving on board submarines was only lifted in 2011. Since then, a few dozen women have undergone specialist training to serve on board Royal Navy submarines. All Royal Navy vessels have a ""no touching rule"" that prohibits intimate relationships on board, but the Navy takes a particularly harsh view when it might affect the chain of command. In 2014, the first female captain of a Navy warship - HMS Portland -was removed from command after she was found to have breached strict rules on relations with a member of her crew.

Commuters became scared when the man also began saying ""death is not the end"", a passenger said. Rail power lines were cut as passengers ""self-evacuated"", police said. Trains on the route were disrupted for nearly 12 hours, but are now running normally. Ian, who was on the train, said the man's Bible-reading led to a ""commotion"" and a ""crush"". He said someone then asked the man to stop speaking ""as he was scaring people"" and ""the guy stopped and stood there with his head down"".

"Officers opened fire on a car on the A369 Portbury Hundred near junction 19 of the M5 on Wednesday A man who was shot dead by police near Bristol last week has been named. He was 29-year-old Spencer Ashworth, whose last known address was in Portishead, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said. Officers opened fire on a car on the A369 Portbury Hundred near junction 19 of the M5 on Wednesday morning. The IPCC said information indicated officers had responded to a report of a man travelling on the M5 with a handgun who had threatened another motorist. A commission spokesman said it had also been informed of an earlier incident in which a similar report was received by West Mercia Police. Authorised firearms officers from Avon and Somerset Police were involved, and a number of shots were fired by four officers. A non-police issue firearm found at the scene was undergoing ballistics and forensic tests. A post-mortem examination showed Mr Ashworth died from gunshot injuries. The IPCC said it would not now be investigating Gloucestershire Police or West Mercia Police after the forcesreferred themselves to the organisation over how they dealt with information receivedfrom a member of the public before the incident.

"The collapse of Monarch Airlines has affected hundreds of thousands of customers and cast doubt over the future of its 2,100 staff. The carrier's been around for 50 years and was once one of the leading airlines to fly people on their package holidays around Europe. ""It's a sad day really for chartered airlines, obviously a lot of history there. People will have some fond memories of flying with Monarch over the years,"" says Oliver Clark, senior reporter with Flight Global. We look at four reasons why the airline collapsed. Monarch's problems can be summed up very succinctly: Falling revenues and rising costs, says Blair Nimmo of the airline's administrator, KPMG. Many of the big costs of running Monarch, such as fuel and handling charges, are denominated in dollars. But the pound has fallen by about 10% against the dollar since the Brexit vote, meaning the airline is having to pay more to buy its fuel. At the same time, Monarch's sales have fallen due to increased competition. ""Prices have been depressed for some time,"" says Mr Nimmo. Monarch's revenues fell Â£100m last year, he added. One of the key problems besetting Monarch was the sheer amount of competition it faced in the low-cost market. ""They were trying to be a low-cost carrier - a bit like EasyJet or Wizz - but there just isn't enough room for all of these airlines in the same market,"" says Flight Global's Mr Clark. ""There's just too much competition... and Monarch wasn't really offering anything new."" Put another way Monarch's demise is a ""symptom of over-capacity and overly-aggressive pricing"", according to Neil Wilson, senior market analyst at ETX Capital. Greybull, which took control of Monarch in 2014, decided it would move away from long-haul holiday flights for some of its package holidays. ""[It could] become a low-cost airline of the model that is used by say Ryanair and EasyJet, but therein lies a challenge,"" said John Strickland of JLS Consulting. ""These are big established airlines, real giants. This is a relative minnow in its size compared to these airlines. ""Just recently it said it wanted to go back into that (long-haul) market. Now it all looked a little bit late, a little bit uncertain in terms of management planning."" Mr Clark points out that rivals such as Norwegian have moved faster. ""They've experimented with long-haul, low-cost flights on the transatlantic and that's something that Monarch perhaps might have looked to have done instead of concentrating on those traditional short-haul markets."" Terror attacks in Egypt, Turkey and Tunisia have seen travel firms and airlines concentrating their efforts on Monarch's traditional stamping grounds - Spain and Portugal - upping the pressure on the airline still further. ""Airlines have seen terror attacks dry up demand for markets like Egypt and Turkey,"" says Mr Strickland. He says this has meant that Monarch has had to reduce prices for travel to its key markets. ""That's meant with overcapacity prices have come down, which has only worsened the situation in terms of Monarch's own revenues,"" says Mr Strickland.

"A Christian girl said to have been fostered by a Muslim family had a ""warm and appropriate"" relationship with the carers, a family court has heard. The five-year-old, who is now living with her grandmother, was placed into the family's care in March by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. The judge, Khatun Sapnara, said the girl expressed ""she misses the foster carer and wants to see her again"". She said the council was happy the family care was ""warm and appropriate"". Judge Sapnara said Tower Hamlets produced an ""interesting and robust defence"" to the media's reporting of the case - following claimsreported in the Times,externalthat the family did not speak English and that the girl had not been allowed to wear a crucifix. She said: ""The local authority has satisfied itself that the foster carer has not behaved in any way which is inconsistent with their provision of warm and appropriate care for the child."" The council will be allowed to publish an ""agreed narrative of events"" in the coming days, Judge Sapnara added. The court also heard that the child,who was taken from her mother after police became concerned for her welfare, would be taken to her maternal grandmother's country of origin if a permanent order was made to grant her care of the girl. The girl holds dual nationality of both the UK and that country, which cannot be named to protect the child's identity. The judge said allowing Tower Hamlets to make a statement about the child would quell ""frenzied speculation"" around the case and allow the child a degree of privacy. She said the court would not make a finding about newspaper reporting of the case, adding: ""It is simply about providing balanced information in the public domain."" Judge Sapnara disclosed in August that the child had been removed from her mother, who has problems with substance abuse. The case will conclude in a final hearing in December.

"This video can not be played Natasha Slessor had worked as cabin crew for Monarch for nearly four years Flights returning 110,000 passengers from overseas after Monarch's collapse will cost about Â£60m, according to the UK airline regulator. More than 11,800 were flown home to the UK during Monday on 61 flights, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said. The government called it the biggest repatriation exercise in peacetime. Monarch Airlines ceased trading early on Monday, leading to nearly 1,900 job losses and the cancellation of all its flights and holidays. The collapse of the 50-year-old company is the largest ever for a UK airline. What are your rights? 'Shock and anger' among passengers Four reasons Monarch failed Monarch collapse is 'heartbreaking' The government is set to pick up the tab for flying Monarch passengers home, but is talking to credit card companies about sharing some of the cost. The repatriation comes as it also emerged: About 56,000 Monarch passengers are due to be flown back this week More than half are in mainland Spain or on Spanish islands, according to the CAA BBC business editor Simon Jack said Monarch had been looking at potential tie-ups with several interested parties before its collapse Those talks were partly derailed by uncertainty surrounding the future regulation of the UK aviation industry after the Brexit vote, he said Monarch's administrators said the airline's pension holders should see no impact from the firm's collapse The UK's fifth biggest airline was placed in administration at 04:00 BST on Monday - a time when the airline had no planes in the air. Passengers were then sent text messages informing them flights had been cancelled, but some customers were already at airports. Monarch had employed about 2,100 people. About 250 staff have been retained to help with repatriation efforts. Terror attacks in Tunisia and Egypt, increased competition and the weak pound have been blamed for Monarch's demise. Customers in the UKyet to travel:Don't go to the airport, the CAA says Customers abroad:Everyone due to fly in the next fortnight will be brought back to the UK at no cost to them. There is no need to cut short a stay. Those with flight-only bookings after 16 October are unlikely to have Atol scheme protection, so will need to make their own arrangements Customers currently overseasshould checkmonarch.caa.co.uk,externalfor confirmation of their new flight details - which will be available a minimum of 48 hours in advance of their original departure time All affected customersshould keep checkingmonarch.caa.co.uk,externalfor more information The CAA also has a 24-hour helpline: 0300 303 2800 from the UK and Ireland and +44 1753 330330 from overseas Alan Jee was due to get married in Gran Canaria on Saturday and arrived at Gatwick airport with 30 members of his family.

This video can not be played What happened when passengers turned up at Manchester airport for their flights? John Shepherd, from Tamworth, had been due to fly to Cyprus on Tuesday with his 92-year-old father. He said they had already managed to book flights on another airline - costing a ""fair bit of money"", but he added: ""I'm worried we've lost all the money on the flights."" Holidaymakers and staff 'devastated' by airline collapse Monarch reported a loss of Â£291m for the year to October 2016, compared with a profit of Â£27m for the previous 12 months, after revenues slumped. It had beenin last-ditch talkswith the CAA about renewing its licence to sell package holidays, but failed to reach a deal. Blair Nimmo, from administrator KPMG, said its collapse was a result of ""depressed prices"" in the short-haul travel market, alongside increased fuel costs and handling charges as a result of a weak pound. Departure boards at Luton airport showed cancelled Monarch flights Monarch's owner, Greybull Capital, had been trying to sell part or all of its short-haul operation so it could focus on more profitable long-haul routes, and said it was ""very sorry"" it had not been able to turn around its fortunes. The CAA has organised 34 chartered planes from 16 different airlines - Easyjet and Qatar Airways among them - to return passengers to the UK over the next fortnight. Chief executive Andrew Haines said passengers would not be charged for the repatriation flights, which would match Monarch's original schedule ""as closely as possible"", adding: ""There will undoubtedly be some disruption."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling described it as the ""biggest ever peacetime repatriation"". Mr Grayling said the Department for Work and Pensions would give support to those affected and that airlines had already told him they may seek to employ Monarch staff. Easyjet said it would be ""really pleased"" to hire former Monarch employees, saying it had 400 cabin crew vacancies at Gatwick Airport and 100 at Luton, as well as job openings for pilots and head office staff.

"This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes At least 59 people have been killed and another 527 injured in a mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert. A gunman, named as 64-year-old Nevada resident Stephen Paddock, opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards an open-air music festival attended by 22,000. He killed himself as police stormed the room where 10 guns were found. Investigators have found no link to international terrorism, despite a claim from so-called Islamic State. In an address from the White House, President Donald Trump described the attack as ""pure evil"". He praised the efforts of the emergency services, saying their ""miraculous"" speed saved lives, and announced he would be visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday. With First Lady Melania by his side, he later observed a moment of silence on the White House lawn. This video can not be played A police scanner captures the moment police burst into gunman's room The final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck. Thousands were enjoying a performance by top-billing singer Jason Aldean when the first of several bursts of automatic gunfire rang out - hundreds of shots, witnesses say. That was late on Sunday night - 22:08 local time (05:08 GMT on Monday). Hundreds of concert-goers scrambled for cover, flattening themselves against the ground, rushing for the exits or helping others to escape as Paddock sprayed the site from his high vantage point. What the witnesses saw In pictures: Vegas shooting Hundreds of concert-goers fled the scene or ducked for cover amid heavy gunfire ""One man had blood all over him and that's when I knew something was seriously wrong,"" Mike Thompson from London, told the BBC. ""People were running and there was chaos."" Concert-goer Mike McGarry, who survived, told Reuters he lay on top of his children when the shots rang out. ""They're 20, I'm 53. I lived a good life,"" he said. Many hotels on the Las Vegas strip close to the scene were placed on police lockdown and parts of Las Vegas Boulevard were shut. Aldean, who was rushed off-stage, shared his reactionon Instagram,external. ""Tonight has been beyond horrific,"" he wrote. Las Vegas police say the number of people injured stands at 515. Las Vegas shooting - what we know The fake photos shared after tragedies Suspected gunman Stephen Paddock - undated image Stephen Paddock, from a community of senior citizens in the small town of Mesquite north-east of Las Vegas, booked into the hotel on 28 September, police say. His motives for carrying out the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history remain a mystery. Some investigators have suggested psychological issues, but there is no confirmation of this. His brother, Eric, is dumbfounded that he acted this way. This video can not be played Eric Paddock says he is in total shock after police named his brother, Stephen, as the shooter Las Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardo described the shooting as a ""lone wolf"" attack. ""We have no idea what his belief system was,"" he said. So-called Islamic State (IS) has claimed to be behind the attack, saying that Paddock had converted to Islam some months ago. But the group provided no evidence for this and has made unsubstantiated claims in the past. FBI Special Agent Aaron Rouse told a news conference: ""We have determined at this point no connection to an international terrorist organisation."" IS's claim of responsibility for the Las Vegas attack is very unusual in that the perpetrator's profile does not fit that of supporters or ""soldiers"" that the group has claimed in the past, writes Mina al-Lami, who monitors jihadist groups for the BBC. If true, his suicide would be deemed wholly ""un-Islamic"", she adds. Jihadist suicides involve the assailant blowing himself up in order to kill those around him. What we know about the gunman A couple at the concert take cover after gunfire was heard at country music festival The investigation continues to gather pace, with searches at Paddock's Mesquite home, where more weapons were found, and a second property. Paddock lived in Mesquite with Marilou Danley. Police have interviewed her but say she does not appear to have been involved as she was out of the country. They are hoping to speak to her again. Police say he used some of her identity documents to check in to the Mandalay Bay. The authorities have yet to confirm the identities of any of the 58 killed. Jordan McIldoon, 23, from British Columbia in Canada, has been identified as a victim of the attack byCBC News,external. 'We helped three victims' A nurse, Sonny Melton, of Big Sandy, Tennessee, has been named as another victim byThe Jackson Sun,externalnewspaper. In a Facebook post, his wife, Dr Heather Gulish Melton, said she ""lost my true love and knight in shining armor. I appreciate the prayers but I just need some time."" An off-duty Las Vegas police officer was another of those who died. More on the victims By the BBC's James Cook in Las Vegas The scenes which played out in this stunned city were at once frantically urgent and wearily familiar. When gunfire rings out, Americans know the drill. Run. They fled from a gunman who left a city in chaos. For a time, Las Vegas looked and felt like a war zone. Hospitals were overwhelmed. There were not enough ambulances. A plea for blood donations echoed across the airwaves. And now the mourning, the relief, the tears, the elation, the grief and a hundred other emotions are barely beginning. Doctors are still battling to save lives. For a Western democracy, the United States has seen an astonishing amount of horror like this. But even for this country what happened here is carnage on a different scale. America's mass shooting disease now feels like a plague. Nevada has some of the least stringent gun laws in the United States. People are allowed to carry weapons and do not have to register themselves as a gun-owner. Background checks are done when people buy guns, but they are also allowed to sell them privately. Former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a shooting six years ago, called for political leaders in Washington to introduce tougher gun laws following the Las Vegas attack. Her husband Mark Kelly read out a joint statement on the steps of the Capitol saying thoughts and prayers from the White House were not enough to stop the next shooting.

"Spain is gripped by the duel between Prime Minister Rajoy (L) and Catalan leader Puigdemont Emotions are running high in Catalonia today. Of course they are. ""The Spanish government is like an abusive husband,"" one activist raged at me today. ""He says he loves you, that he can't live without you. Then, he beats you to stop you from leaving."" Sunday's scenes during the Catalan referendum were awful and played over and over again across social media. Barca football idol and Catalan-born Gerard Pique wept openly on Spanish television when questioned about the violence. But it would be wrong to interpret the anger and anguish so palpable in Catalonia right now as an expression of political unity. Catalans are as divided as ever on the question of independence. What unites them today is a seething fury and resentment at the heavy-handedness of the Spanish government, represented by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, with what Catalans perceive as his Madrid-centric arrogance, brutishness and disregard for the rights of individuals. This video can not be played Spanish police clashed with people trying to get to polling stations to vote This is far less about separatism than populism. Anti-establishment, nationalist sentimenta la Catalana. While the majority of Catalans say they don't actually want to leave Spain, they demand the right to choose. Legally and with dignity, in contrast to the chaos and intimidation on show at the weekend. They are frustrated that their region pays more in taxes to Madrid than it gets back in investment, such as new infrastructure. They are irritated that pledges of increased autonomy for Catalonia (already one of Europe's most autonomous regions) were then watered down, and still smarting that ordinary people in Catalonia - as across Spain - suffered so much in the 2008 economic crisis, while their tax contributions were used to bail out the banks. To give you an idea - Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest regions. Youth unemployment is far lower here than across the rest of Spain. But it's still a shocking 35%. Catalans want change, but that does not amount to a common call for independence. So what now? Before this weekend, Mariano Rajoy - nicknamed by opponents as ""The Robot"", as he could never be accused of having the common touch - had all the cards: the legal argument (Spain's constitutional court deemed this weekend's referendum illegal) public opinion (most Spaniards opposed the vote) EU support and a fractious, disunited front (until this weekend) of Catalan independence parties. But he's thrown those cards away. He and the Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, have walked if not arm-in-arm then at least back-to-back, duel-like, to the cliff's edge. A cynic might point out that both men benefit personally from this constitutional crisis - arguably Spain's most severe in the 40 years since the transition to democracy. Mr Rajoy heads a minority government, so short of support that it recently withdrew plans for the 2018 budget, for fear it wouldn't make it through the Spanish parliament. Meanwhile, Mr Puigdemont presides over one of the largest regional debts in Spain. Both men are tainted by allegations of corruption, which swirl persistently around their governments. The Catalan question is a very public distraction from unwelcome financial questions. Both men score political points from standing their ground now, as opinions in Catalonia and across Spain harden. As for the EU, some analysts have painted a picture of Eurocrats quaking in their blue and yellow boots. Refusing to condemn Sunday's violence, as they fear the flames of separatism will now spread from Catalonia to Corsica, northern Italy, Flanders and beyond. But that was the early 2000s, when Basque separatist violence raged too. Now Basque separatists support Prime Minister Rajoy in the Spanish parliament. Regional separatism is not a 2017 problem for the EU. Populism is.

Within two years, her mother had remarried and the family had moved from Australia to Wellington, New Zealand, where her life was miserable. ""I was very unhappy,"" says Valisce. ""My stepfather was violent, and there was no-one to talk to."" She dreamed of becoming a professional dancer and set up a lunchtime ballet class at her school, which proved so popular that a well-known dance group, Limbs, came to run lessons. But within months she found herself on the streets, selling sex to survive. Walking through the park on her way home from school, a man offered her $100 for sex. ""I was in school uniform so there was no mistaking my age,"" she says. Valisce used the money to run away to Auckland, where she checked into the YMCA. ""I tried ringing someone to ask for help in the phone booth which was outside the hostel, but it was engaged, so I waited,"" she says. ""The police stopped and asked what I was doing. I said, 'Waiting to use the phone'."" The officers pointed out that no-one was using the phone, so there was no need to wait. They thought they were being ""terribly clever"" Valisce says - but didn't seem to understand when she explained that it was the telephone she was calling that was engaged. ""They searched me for condoms thinking I was a prostitute because the YMCA was behind Karangahape Road, the infamous prostitution area. ""Ironically, that was what gave me the idea to go get some money. The police scared me but I knew I was going to be on the streets if I didn't get cash, and the act of leaning against a wall was all it took to be searched and threatened anyway, so I figured it made no difference if I was or wasn't."" Karangahape Road pictured in 2003, shortly after the law legalising prostitution was passed Valisce walked over to Karangahape Road and asked one of the women working there for advice. She pointed out two alleyways where Valisce could work. ""She also gave me a condom, told me basic charges and advised me to make them fight for services I was prepared to do, to avoid fighting against services I wasn't prepared to do. She was very nice. Samoan, too young to be there, and clearly been there for too long already."" In 1989, after two years working on the streets, Valisce visited the New Zealand Prostitutes Collective (NZPC) in Christchurch. ""I was looking for some support, perhaps to exit prostitution, but all I was offered was condoms,"" she says. She was also invited to the collective's regular wine and cheese social on Friday nights. ""They started talking about how stigma against 'sex workers' was the worst thing about it, and that prostitution is just a job like any other,"" Valisce remembers. It somehow made what she was doing seem more palatable. She became the collective's massage parlour co-ordinator and an enthusiastic supporter of its campaign for the full decriminalisation of all aspects of the sex trade, including pimps. ""It felt like there was a revolution coming. I was so excited about how decriminalisation would make things better for the women,"" she says. Decriminalisation arrived in 2003, and Valisce attended the celebration party held by the prostitutes' collective. When prostitution was legalised in 2003, job adverts appeared in the New Zealand press But she soon became disillusioned. The Prostitution Reform Act allowed brothels to operate as legitimate businesses, a model often hailed as the safest option for women in the sex trade. In the UK, the Home Affairs Select Committee has been considering a number of different approaches towards the sex trade, including full decriminalisation. But Valisce says that in New Zealand it was a disaster, and only benefited the pimps and punters. ""I thought it would give more power and rights to the women,"" she says. ""But I soon realised the opposite was true."" One problem was that it allowed brothel owners to offer punters an ""all-inclusive"" deal, whereby they would pay a set amount to do anything they wanted with a woman. ""One thing we were promised would not happen was the 'all-inclusive',"" says Valisce. ""Because that would mean the women wouldn't be able to set the price or determine which sexual services they offered or refused - which was the mainstay of decriminalisation and its supposed benefits."" Aged 40, Valisce approached a brothel in Wellington for a job, and was shocked by what she saw. ""During my first shift, I saw a girl come back from an escort job who was having a panic attack, shaking and crying, and unable to speak. The receptionist was yelling at her, telling her to get back to work. I grabbed my belongings and left,"" she says. Shortly afterwards, she told the prostitutes' collective in Wellington what she had witnessed. ""What are we doing about this?"" she asked. ""Are we working on any services to help get out?"" She was ""absolutely ignored"", she says, and finally left the prostitutes' collective. Until then, the organisation had been her only source of support, a place to go where no-one judged her for working in the sex trade. The English Collective of Prostitutes also campaigns for decriminalisation It was while volunteering there, though, that she had begun her journey towards becoming an ""abolitionist"". ""One of my jobs at NZPC was to find all of the media clippings. There was one thing I read: it was somebody talking about being in tears and not knowing why, and it wasn't until they were out [of the sex trade] that they understood what those feelings were. ""I had been through that for years [thinking], 'I don't know what's going on, why am I feeling like this?' and realised when I read that: 'Oh God, that's me.'"" For Valisce, there was no turning back. She left prostitution in early 2011 and moved to the Gold Coast in Queensland, Australia, seeking a new direction in life, but was confused and depressed. When her neighbour tried to recruit her into webcam prostitution, she politely declined. ""I felt like I had 'whore' stamped on my forehead. How did she know to ask me? I now know being female was the only reason"", says Valisce. Afterwards the neighbour hurled insults at Valisce whenever she saw her. Valisce began to meet women online, feminists who were against decriminalisation and described themselves as abolitionists - the abolitionist model, also currently being considered by the UK's Home Affairs Select Committee, criminalises the pimps and punters while decriminalising the prostituted person. Valisce set up a group called Australian Radical Feminists and was soon invited to a conference. Held at the University of Melbourne last year, it was the first abolitionist event ever to be held in Australia, where many states have legalised the brothel trade. Melbourne itself has had legal brothels since the mid-1980s, and although there is a lot of vocal support for the system, there is also a growing movement against it. One Melbourne bordello floated on the stock exchange in 2002 She describes this period, when she became a feminist activist against the sex trade and began to feel free of her past, as ""the start of my new life"". ""I exited first emotionally, then physically and lastly intellectually,"" she says. After the conference Valisce went to a doctor and was diagnosed with PTSD. ""It was as a result of my time in prostitution - it had affected me badly, but I was good at covering up the effects,"" she says. ""It takes a long while to feel whole again."" For Valisce, the best therapy is working with women who understand what it's like to go through the sex trade, and those who also campaign to expose the harm prostitution brings. She is also determined to ensure that the women who are usually silenced by their abusers have a voice. ""It's not my goal to trap people in the industry or tell anyone to go get out,"" she says. ""But I do want to make a difference, and that means speaking out as much as I can, in order to help other women.""

"Demi Lovato: ""I know I have a platform and I want to make the biggest change in the world that I can"" ""Five, four, three, two, one!"" Pop star Demi Lovato is doing her best impression of Nasa's mission control as she records an insert for a forthcoming TV show. Standing in an alcove of BBC Broadcasting House, as staff mill around with laptops and coffee cups, she's really giving it some welly - which is impressive considering she has literally no idea what she is counting down from, or to. ""Yeah, I don't know what that was for,"" laughs Lovato as she sidles into a seat to chat about her new album, Tell Me You Love Me. It's the 25-year-old's sixth record since she began her career as a child actress on the TV show Barney and Friends. Since then, she's starred in Camp Rock alongside the Jonas Brothers, appeared as a judge on The X Factor USA, and become a fierce advocate for anti-bullying and mental health campaigns. That's partly because she's had to face her own problems - including cocaine use, bulimia, self-harm, and bipolar disorder - culminating, in 2012, with a year-long stay in a sober living facility. The star was going to take 2017 off, but was inspired to go back into the studio after a Grammy nomination for her last album, Confident She addresses some of those issues for the first time on her new record, in particular onYou Don't Do It For Me Anymore,external, which describes giving up drugs in the form of a break-up ballad. The album also dwells on the end of her six-year relationship with actor Wilmer Valderrama (Lonely); and the lasting effects of her birth father's absence (Daddy Issues,external). But there's also space for a few of her trademark party anthems and, on thetitle track,external, the vocal performance of her career. With the countdown out of the way, Demi spills the beans on the stories behind the songs - and the time she almost killed a Beatle. I know it's a cliche, but this feels like your most personal album yet. Was that the goal? It just came out in the writing. I would go into the studio with an idea based off of a personal experienceâ¦ Like one of the songs,Games,external, I went on a bad date and I wrote a song about it. What happened? Oh! I'd rather not say. But just being disrespected. This guy just treated me really poorly, and was playing games the whole time. Is it harder to date when you're in the public eye? It's easy and it's difficult, too. But it's kind of nice because if you find somebody attractive, you can just hit them up or, like, slide into their DMs [direct messages] and be like, ""Hey, what's going on?"" The star's hits include Sorry Not Sorry, Cool For The Summer and Heart Attack One of the songs on the album,Ruin The Friendship,external, is about making a move on a close friend. It's almost a comedy of errors... A lot of people read the title and think it's about animosity - but it's a very sexy song. Have you ever been tempted to hook up with a friend? Yes! That's what I wrote the song about! A certain friendship that I have with someone - and I want to ruin that with them. How long have you kept it secret? I think it's been a long time coming. I actually ended up sending this song to the person. And it turned out they had a song they wrote about me! So we, like, exchanged songs, which was funny. So did that lead to something romantic, or did you just laugh about it together? Ummmâ¦ Let's move on! OK... OnConcentrate,external, you sing about listening to Coldplay while you're in bed with someone. I can't imagine a less sexy band... Oh really? I think his voice is sexy! But also - I didn't write the song. So what would be your baby-making music? Probably The Weeknd. I once asked Usher if he knew of any babies that been conceived to his music, and he said ""yes, my son"". Oh. Wow. That's creepy. I can't say I listen to my own music while I'mâ¦ I'm doing it! The singer says she is looking forward to performing her new album live You employ a huge range of vocal colours and tones across the album. What's your favourite? My favourite is to sing very soulfully. I think Tell Me You Love Me is my ideal, because Ireallyget to sing in it. Demi Lovato to release tell-all documentary Demi Lovato doesn't care about photo leak I didn't write that one - but when I recorded it I was going through a break-up, and it said exactly what I was wanting to tell that person. I wanted to hear them tell me that they loved me. So I really related to that song when I recorded it. Does Lonely refer to the same relationship? Yeah. I didn't write on that one either, but I definitely related to it. Daddy Issues has one of the most cutting lyrics I've heard this year: ""You're the man of my dreams because you know how to leave."" That was a lyric that I came up with. When you grow up with an absent father, you have relationship issues - and sometimes you go for the type of person who feels familiar. So that lyric was about something that felt familiar. It's about anticipating disappointment and almost thriving off it. Yes, feeling comfortable with it. Sometimes it's more comfortable to feel pain when that's all you've known in certain situations. Lovato has remained close friends with her Camp Rock co-star Nick Jonas, and toured with him last year You've just been named a mental health ambassador by Global Citizen. What does that involve? I partnered with Save The Children and Global Citizen, for the HEART programme [Healing andEducation through theArts], which is going to help displaced children and refugees in Iraq. It started when I went over there last year, just see how I could help - and I talked to a bunch of Isis victims. I asked one girl, ""What is it that you want?"" and she said, ""I want to be happy again."" I realised there was so much PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] that they deal with - so we're starting a pilot programme to try to help, using art therapy. You've spoken quite candidly about your own mental health issues in the past. How do you keep on top of that when you're in the middle of promoting and touring a record? I maintain a very healthy lifestyle, so I eat very clean, I get a lot of sleep and I set aside some time to myself every day. What do you do in that time? Meditation? I make sure that I work out. And that's like an hour-and-a-half of me devoting to myself. An hour-and-a-half a day? That's tough. I manage to run about half an hour a week. Oh I don't like to run. What do you do? Mixed Martial Arts. [She has a blue belt in Jiu-Jitsu] So don't get on the wrong side of Demi Lovato. Yes - don't mess with me! The singer shows her fun side in the video for Sorry Not Sorry Speaking of which, is it true you once nearly ran over Paul McCartney? Yes, but it's not as dramatic as I made it sound! He was standing in a parking space I was trying to get into and I honked the horn because someone was in my way. Then he turned around and it was Paul McCartney! Did he give you the thumbs-up? He turned around and said, ""Oh, I'm so sorry"" and I was like, ""Don't worry about it! You're a Beatle!"" You realise no-one's honked their horn at Paul McCartney in yearsâ¦ You know, I don't remember if I honked the horn, or if I just kept inching up so he would moveâ¦ Oh God, you could have crushed a Beatle! Yes, it would have been a very bad headline! And the headline's bad enough already. Demi Lovato's album, Tell Me You Love Me, is out now on Polydor records.

"""Why would anybody, let alone a normal person, want to become a member of the Conservative Party?"" ""I'm beginning to lose the will to live."" ""An utter, total disgrace."" This was some distance from the slick choreography you can become inured to at party conferences. This was a public post-mortem in a marquee. A brutally honest dissection of humiliating failure at the general election. The Conservative Home website hosted a discussion for party members to say it as they saw it - and the room festered with irritation, anger and a forest of raised hands. For more than an hour, the criticisms came. The outspoken John Strafford, from the Campaign for Conservative Democracy, predicted Armageddon for the Tories. Party membership, he said, had been allowed to decline below 100,000 nationally and 300 constituency associations had no more than 100 members - and no more than 10 of them were up for doing stuff or were activists. It was Mr Strafford who said this was ""an utter, total disgrace"". ""Eventually there will be no members left, and that will be the end, goodbye,"" he claimed. A visibly angry Sir Eric Pickles, who has written a report on the party's failure at the election, sarcastically congratulated him on ""getting tomorrow's headlines"". The room by now crackled with irritation - as members set out what they saw as a range of structural, organisational and practical reasons that contributed to the party's failure to win an overall majority. The party's losing candidate in Halifax in West Yorkshire, the marginal seat where the party published its now widely derided manifesto, was highly critical of the national party. Labour's Holly Lynch increased her majority in Halifax following June's general election Chris Pearson said his team had been threatened with disciplinary action if they didn't follow central dictat about the areas of the constituency they targeted, despite what he saw as their superior local knowledge. ""Everything does seem to be quite predominantly London,"" he added, about the party's organisation and staffing. It was a party member from Cambridge who questioned why anyone would want to sign up to join the party right now. Sir Eric Pickles said: ""We can't have the manifesto being written quietly in a corner,"" and insisted ""someone should be unambiguously in charge of the election"". His report, complete with 126 recommendations, suggested there was ""a clear campaigning deficiency"" and a need for more young people and members of ethnic minorities to join and support the Conservatives. Paul Goodman, the editor of Conservative Home, fretted that unless someone was charged with ensuring Sir Eric's ideas were implemented over the next 10 years, many could fall by the wayside. ""We will be in such a mess if we don't push this through,"" Sir Eric said. Two contributors from the floor said the Tories could learn from Momentum, the grassroots movement inspired by the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. The Tory MP Nusrat Ghani agreed: ""One of the ways it recruits is pinpointing local campaigns. A local school, a local hospital, to nudge people along to get involved. A bottom-up approach is absolutely key."" Graham Brady says the Tories must work harder to ensure more public sector workers would vote for party The former minister Edwina Currie, reflecting on everything she had heard, said the meeting left her ""losing the will to live"". But she was furious that ""blithering idiots"" from party headquarters had sent her and fellow canvassers to addresses in Derbyshire which had been picked out to target because the occupiers earned relatively high salaries. What Central Office hadn't realised, she said, was that in her patch many of the best paid were public sector workers with Labour posters in the windows. Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative MPs, said it was time the party ""tried to convince primary school teachers of the benefit of the free market"" and work harder to ensure more public sector workers would consider voting Tory. But when Mrs Currie complained about the number of white men in senior roles within the party, Mr Brady joked: ""There is nothing I can do about being white or being a man. Nothing I'd wish to do anyway!"" As this public inquest rolled into its second hour, hands were still popping up: passionate activists with questions, observations and irritations about an election that went badly wrong.

"Around 200 people attended the Conservative Ideas Festival The Conservatives have a problem. More young people are voting than at any time in the last quarter of a century, but largely not for them - so what can the party do to change that? It's been labelled - perhaps unfairly - the ""Tory Glastonbury"". Around 200 activists, MPs, sympathetic thinkers and business people meet in the low September sunshine to discuss how the party can attract young voters. Just two years ago, the split in support between Labour and the Conservatives among 18 to 29-year-olds was fairly even, 36% to 32%. Fast forward to this June's general election and that small gap had become a chasm - according to pollsters YouGov - with Labour now on 64% to the Tories' 21%. In fact, unless you were touching 50, you were in a minority if you voted Conservative. Addressing worried-looking party figures at the Big Tent Ideas festival in Berkshire, Lord Cooper - one-time director of strategy for ex-Prime Minister David Cameron - puts it starkly. Older Conservative voters, he says, are dying. And younger, more ""open"" voters are not going to decide when they hit 50 that ""feminism and the internet and the green movement are a bad thing after all"". Unless the party responds, he adds, ""it is going to die"". So what should they do? Bim Afolami says the party ""realises that there is a problem"" in not attracting enough young voters ""Somebody famous and clever said the Conservative Party only knows two modes - complacency or panic,"" says one of the Tories' youngest MPs. ""And we're definitely in panic mode."" Bim Afolami, an old Etonian and former banker, is 31 and has only been an MP for a few months, but his thoughts have already turned to this question. ""The party generally, collectively, realises that this is a problem,"" he says. With the Budget less than two months away, he says Chancellor Philip Hammond recently told a meeting of Conservative backbenchers that the party must address two of the key issues for younger voters - housing and student debt. Victoria Borwick - who represented the safe seat of Kensington until she became one of the 33 Conservative MPs swept away by Labour's better-than-expected showing in June - echoes the message. ""Every single MP should go back to their own area and see how they can build more housing for the next generation."" It might be only 100 miles away, but the Big Tent Ideas Festival couldn't be further from Glastonbury. The music is Bach - perfectly rendered by a violinist. The buffet is delicate and refined. And there are more MPs in attendance than the young voters whom the ideas are intended to reach. ""This is not Glastonbury,"" Mr Afolami points out. ""It's more akin to (literature festival) Hay-on-Wye."" The comparison is clearly unfair, but does it matter? The story goes that the brains behind the event, Conservative MP George Freeman, saw Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn cheered by thousands at Glastonbury over the summer and asked, ""Why is it just the left who have all the fun in politics?"" MP James Cleverly says young people were offered an ""electoral bribe"" by Jeremy Corbyn Conservative MP James Cleverly is unimpressed. ""Wow, a left-wing leader getting a good reception at a rock festival,"" he says, ironically. ""What kind of crazy world is it we live in that that kind of thing happens? ""It's a bunch of young people who've just been given a massive electoral bribe."" Mr Corbyn - who said before the election he would ""deal"" with student debt - will be punished for taking ""younger voters for fools"", Cleverly says. ""Being hip, being popular, being cool, that's really easy,"" says Cleverly. ""Until you have to make tough decisions. And when you have to make tough decisions, that veneer of coolness comes off real quick. ""So the better thing to do is to be right and be doing the right things for the right reasons rather than trying to be cool and popular and saying whatever thing is going to get good headlines or a big cheer at Glastonbury."" What, then, can the party learn? Labour's general election campaign was praised for its use of social media and for reaching young people previously unmoved by party politics. Tobi Alabi - a south Londoner who was invited to attend the ideas festival, and was courted by Conservatives there, but isn't a supporter - says the party was an irrelevance for most of his friends. Labour, he says, related and appealed to young people. Tobi Alabi says the Conservative Party did not display diversity ""That's something the Conservative Party didn't do. They didn't display diversity. They didn't display an appeal to young people. You have to tap into young people's interests."" So - if they do that - could those young people won over by Jeremy Corbyn's Labour one day support the Tories? ""Those people can be won back,"" says a hopeful Bim Afolami. ""Those are not people who have decided forever to vote for one person or one party. ""I think if we show them that we've got the right policies - but, more importantly, the right values - those are people that we can at least compete for in the future.""

"Humans are used to being outdone by computers when it comes to recalling facts, but they still have the upper hand in an argument. For now. It has long been the case that machines can beat us in games of strategy like chess. And we have come to accept that artificial intelligence is best at analysing huge amounts of data - sifting through the supermarket receipts of millions of shoppers to work out who might be tempted by some vouchers for washing powder. But what if AI were able to handle the most human of tasks - navigating the minefield of subtle nuance, rhetoric and even emotions to take us on in an argument? It is a possibility that could help humans make better decisions and one which growing numbers of researchers are working on. Until very recently, the creation of machines that can argue was an unattainable goal. The aim is not, of course, to teach computers how to up the pressure in a feisty exchange over a parking space, or to resolve whose turn it is to take out the bins. Instead, machines that can argue would inform debate - helping humans challenge the evidence, look at alternatives and robustly draw conclusions. It is a possibility which could advance decision making on everything from how a business should invest its money, to tackling crime and improving public health. But teaching a computer how people communicate - and what an argument actually is - is extraordinarily complex. World Chess champion Garry Kasparov lost to the computer Deep Blue in 1997 Think about a courtroom as an example of where arguments are central. Giving evidence is certainly a part of the process, but social rules, legal requirements, emotional sensitivities, and practical constraints all influence how advocates, jury members and judges formulate and express their reasoning. Over the past couple of years, however, researchers have started to think that it might be possible to model some aspects of human arguments. Work is now under way to capture how such exchanges work and turn them into AI algorithms. This is a field known as argument technology. The advances have been made possible by a rapid increase in the amount of data available to train computers in the art of debate. Some of the data is coming from domains likeintelligence analysis,external; some fromspecialised online sources,externaland some from broadcasts such as theBBC's Moral Maze. New methods to teach computers how arguments work have also been developed. Researchers in the area draw on philosophy, linguistics, computer science and even law and politics in order to get a handle on how debates fit together. At theUniversity of Dundee,externalwe have recently even been using 2,000-year-old theories of rhetoric as a way of spotting the structures of real-life arguments. The rapid advances in the field have led to dozens of research labs around the world applying themselves to the problem, and the explosion in this area of research is like nothing else I have witnessed in 20 years in academia. Does this mean that computers will soon be fluent orators on the verge of taking over the world? No. Let me give you a mundane example. Until very recentlyeven the most sophisticated AI techniqueswould have been completely flummoxed by pronouns. So if you say to your smartphone's personal assistant: ""I like Amy Winehouse. Play something by her,"" the software would be unable to work out that by ""her"" you mean ""Amy Winehouse"". Hardly the stuff of robot-apocalypse nightmares. Computers could learn to master the kind of 'why?' questions beloved of toddlers If such simple things can be too difficult for AI, what chance is there that computers could argue? Narrowing our focus down, there are at least two ways in which computers could argue that are tantalisingly close. The first is in justifying and explaining. It's one thing to look up online how video game violence affects children, but it's quite another to have a system automatically harvest reasons for and against censorship of such violence -  an areabeing explored by IBM,external, with whom we collaborate. The system that results is like an assistant, making sense of the conflicting views around and allowing us to dig into the justifications for different standpoints. The second is to develop artificial intelligence that can play dialogue games - following the rules of interaction that can be found everywhere from courtrooms to auction houses. These games have been a mainstay of philosophical investigation from Plato to Wittgenstein, but they are starting to be used to help computers contribute to discussions between humans. Two special programmes using argument technology to assess debates marking the 50th anniversary of the Abortion Act will be broadcast by the BBC in October. An episode of theMoral Mazewill be aired on BBC Radio 4 at 20:00 BST on Wednesday 11 October, with analysis by the Centre for Argument Technology available immediately afterwards. A BBC Two documentary called Abortion On Trial will be broadcast at 21:00 BST on Monday 16 October and followed by argument technology analysis that joins up the debate across the two programmes. Anyone who's met a toddler will be familiar with one of these games. The rules are very simple. The adult says something. The toddler asks, ""Why?"" The adult answers. The toddler asks, ""Why?"" again. And repeat. Usually these conversations end when the adult makes a desperate attempt to change the subject. But most of us who've played this game in the role of the adult will know that, actually, after a couple of moves, it can become rather difficult to give good answers: we have to think pretty hard. Thinking pretty hard - while not terribly important if trying to explain to a three-year-old why the sky is blue - becomes much more important if the discussion is about a business decision affecting hundreds of jobs, or intelligence on whether a group poses a terrorist threat. So if even the simplest possible dialogue game might be able to improve thinking around important decisions, what about more sophisticated models? The robot that could tell you how to vote Eight ways intelligent machines are in your life Artificial intelligence 'as good as cancer doctors' Will AI kill or save humankind? That's what we're working on. If computers can learn the techniques to identify the types of argument humans are using to make group decisions, they can also assess the evidence used and put forward suggestions, or even possible answers. Helping a team to avoid unconscious biases, weak evidence and poorly thought-through arguments can improve the quality of debate. Artificial intelligence could help to inform anti-terrorism strategies So, for example, we are building software that recognises when people use arguments based on witness testimony, and can then critique them, pointing out the ways in which witnesses may be biased or unreliable. From corporate boardrooms, to couples' mediation and from intelligence analysis to interior design, AI could soon be helping to nudge us towards better decisions. The term ""artificial intelligence"" was first used in the late 1950s and leading researchers at the time confidently predicted that full AI was about 20 years away. It still is - and probably much farther away than that. In the meantime, argument technology offers the potential to contribute to the decisions made by humans. This type of artificial intelligence would not usurp human team members, but work with them as partners to tackle difficult challenges. And it might even offer help explaining to three-year-olds why the sky is blue. This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation. Prof Chris Reed is the director of theCentre for Argument Technology,externalat the University of Dundee. The centre has received more than Â£5m in funding, with backers including the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council, Innovate UK, the Leverhulme Trust, the Volkswagen Foundation and the Joint Information Systems Committee. It focuses on translational argumentation research from philosophy and linguistics to AI and software engineering.

"It is thought that between 1-3% of the population is asexual, meaning they do not feel any sexual attraction to other people. For years Stacey was puzzled about why she never wanted to sleep with anyone, even her husband. As she explains here, it was her doctor that told her the truth. For a really long time I thought I was broken mentally or physically in some way, I thought it wasn't normal to not want to have sex with people. Friends of mine would be talking about boyfriends they'd had or celebrities they'd like to bed, and I just didn't think about anybody in that very specific, sexual sense. When I was in my early twenties I really started noticing it, but I didn't talk to anybody about it because I just thought, ""They're going to think I'm well strange,"" so I just kept quiet. Asexuality has quite a spectrum so although I might not be sexually attracted to people I do get very romantically attracted to people. I'd met my boyfriend - who is now my husband - when I was 19, and I didn't know what asexuality was then, so I just thought I was bonkers or really behind the curve or something. I was thinking, ""I absolutely love this man, and if he proposes to me I will 100% say yes because I know I want to spend the rest of my life with him, so why don't I want to sleep with him? That's crazy."" Stacey spoke to BBC Radio 4'siPM, the programme which starts with its listeners. If you want to contact the programme, pleasesend an email.,external You canlisten to Stacey's interviewor hear Jordandescribing the problems he faced at universityon the iPM podcast We sort of went on a bit of journey of discovery together, me and the hubby. He was very much, ""I am in love with you. I will wait as long as it takes, if it ever happens."" He was really supportive and never tried to make me do anything I wasn't comfortable with. Societal norms suggest that sex and children are the way forward in a relationship and all my friends were going off and getting married and having babies. I thought, ""Oh God, there's this expectation that I should be sleeping with my husband and having children."" I started having a recurring nightmare that my husband was going to leave me for somebody who looked exactly like me but who would actually sleep with him, and I got to a point where my own anxieties were making me almost unbearable. I thought, ""Do you know what? I've got to sort this out, I've got to find out what's going on."" By this point I was probably 27 or 28. I made the massive mistake of searching the internet for medical reasons that might cause low sex drive. That was a mistake, an absolute mistake. There were lots of little things that were easily fixable like dodgy hormone levels, but the one that caught my eye was brain tumours. I was like, ""Oh no, I'm dying of a brain tumour."" I went to my doctor and I said, ""Look, is it serious? Am I going to die?"" She was like, ""Calm down, you're probably just asexual."" I was like, ""What's that? What?"" So she pointed me towards some websites - and it was like I'd found my people, it was so exciting. I'd never heard the term ""asexual"" before. I did some more research and I started feeling a lot more comfortable in myself, so I spoke to my husband about it and I said, ""This label does kind of take things off the table permanently."" And he pretty much just said, ""Well, I'd kind of assumed that anyway, so it's fine."" He's been absolutely great, he's been so understanding. I like to think it's because of my shining personality that he thinks, ""I've got to hold on to that one."" I've never felt what most people would describe as horny and if I ever do feel any slight inkling of that it's very, very small, like an itch that I need to scratch. It's a very biological process for me rather than an arousal kind of thing, if that makes sense, and I don't want to involve other people, not even my husband. It's like, ""Yeuch, here's this feeling, I'll go deal with that."" I almost disassociate from it. ""I'm 60 years old and have never knowingly met another person who is asexual. I had never even heard it publicly acknowledged."" -Lucy ""When I first discovered that I was asexual, I tried to come out to a few people, and while some were very open to it, I've had some very negative reactions. A group of team mates from my university sports team decided to arrange a night out for me to 'help' me get laid, when they discovered that I hadn't had sex, not caring that it was due to my asexuality."" -Scott ""I have been met with scorn, disbelief and disgusted looks when I have shared my asexuality with other people. People have told me that 'it's not a real thing' and that 'I'm making it up for attention.' I have only now begun to think of myself as a whole human being, with no 'missing pieces'."" -Anonymous, 14 years old ""I don't have a problem with physical contact. It's just I don't see any others as sexual preyâ¦ Even though I have never discussed this with my wonderful mum, she is not blind to the fact that I live happily alone, child-free and have no interest in dating.  She has even been on the brink of tears, concerned that - and I quote - 'It might be something I did that made you... not normal.'"" -Dani Listen again Asexuality is a spectrum and there are a lot of asexual people who, once they've built up a relationship with a person, feel comfortable having sex with them. But for me, any time I've ever got close, my whole body's been like, ""No, no thank you, stop that now, not having it."" It's just the kids thing - people that I tell almost always immediately say, ""Oh my god, but how are you going to have kids, though?"" Well, there are a lot of ways that I could have kids if I wanted them, it's not completely out of the realms of possibility. I've only been aware about asexuality for about three or four years. I like the label ACE [short for ""asexual""]. I find it almost comforting, and it has really helped me understand who I am, how I behave and how my mind works. I do celebrate being ACE, I'm quite proud of it, and I do like to talk about it because I would like more people to understand it and not judge people for not wanting to have sex. I think if I'd known what asexuality was back when I was 18 or 19 my mental health could have been a whole lot better for most of my twenties. Funnily enough, before I discovered asexuality my husband used to call me Stace Ace. For more information on sex and relationships you can visitBBC Advice.

"Carles Puigdemont appealed for international mediation to help solve the growing crisis Catalan President Carles Puigdemont has said he is not planning a ""traumatic"" split with Spain, after a disputed independence referendum on Sunday. He said he wanted a new understanding with the central government in Madrid. Catalan officials say voters overwhelmingly backed secession. Madrid has warned it could suspend autonomy of the wealthy north-eastern region. Spain's top court banned the vote and almost 900 people were hurt as Spanish police tried to stop it going ahead. Officers from the national police and paramilitary Civil Guard seized ballot papers and boxes at a number of polling stations. Catalonia - victim of populist tug-of-war? Thirty-three police officers were injured on Sunday, Catalan medical officials said. This video can not be played Catalans sing their anthem 'Els Segadors', or 'The Reapers' More than 2.2 million people were reported to have voted, according to Catalan authorities, out of 5.3 million registered voters. Just under 90% of those who voted backed independence, they said. A Catalan spokesman said more than 750,000 votes could not be counted because polling stations were closed and urns were confiscated. Turnout was put at 42.3%. Given the chaotic nature of the vote, the turnout and voting figures should be taken with a pinch of salt, says the BBC's Tom Burridge in Barcelona. The reasons for the referendum How Barcelona and Madrid viewed the vote The most powerful images of Catalan clashes More than 40 trade unions and Catalan associations called a region-wide strike on Tuesday due to ""the grave violation of rights and freedoms"". At a news conference on Monday, Mr Puigdemont said: ""We don't want a traumatic break... We want a new understanding with the Spanish state"". Mr Puigdemont, who earlier said Catalonia had won the right to statehood and the door was now open to a unilateral declaration of independence, said he had had no contact with the government in Madrid led by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. The Catalan leader also announced that he was setting up a commission to investigate Sunday's violence and was taking legal action against national police. This video can not be played Riot police were seen using batons and kicking people to block voting And Mr Puigdemont appealed for international mediation to help solve the growing crisis. Mr Rajoy spoke of a ""mockery"" of democracy, saying that Catalans had been fooled into taking part in the illegal vote. ""At this hour I can tell you in the strongest terms what you already know and what we have seen throughout this day. There has not been a referendum on self-determination in Catalonia,"" he said on Sunday. The prime minister is now expected to hold urgent talks with Pedro Sanchez, the leader of the main opposition Socialist party, as well as Albert Rivera, the head of the centrist Ciudadanos party. Meanwhile, Spain's justice minister warned that any declaration of independence could lead to article 155 of the country's constitution being invoked, which allows the national government to intervene in the running of an autonomous region. ""We are not here to divide Spaniards... but if someone tries to declare independence on behalf of a part of Spain's territory, that cannot be done because it is beyond their powers,"" said Rafael CatalÃ¡. Analysis: Tom Burridge, BBC News, Barcelona Spain's complicated relationship with the region of Catalonia is headed for the unknown. After violence by Spanish police, a declaration of independence by Catalonia's regional government seems more likely than ever before. Given the chaotic nature of the vote, turnout and voting figures should be taken with a pinch of salt. On Monday the government in Madrid will hold talks with Spanish parties to discuss a response to the biggest political crisis this country has seen in decades. Read more from Tom Meanwhile, the European Commission described the crisis as ""an internal matter"" for Spain, that has to be dealt with in line with the constitutional order. ""We trust the leadership of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to manage this difficult process,"" it said in a statement, urging all relevant players to move from confrontation to dialogue. TV images showed Spanish police kicking would-be voters and pulling women out of polling stations by their hair. Officials said 893 people had been hurt in clashes, including 33 police. The majority had minor injuries or had suffered from anxiety attacks. In Girona, riot police smashed their way into a polling station where Mr Puigdemont was due to vote, and forcibly removed those inside. He voted at another station. The BBC's Tom Burridge witnessed policebeing chased away,externalfrom one polling booth in Barcelona after they had raided it. TV footage showed riot police using batons to beat a group of firefighters who were protecting crowds in Girona. This woman suffered a head injury in Barcelona The national police and Guardia Civil - a military force charged with police duties - were sent into Catalonia in large numbers to prevent the vote. The Catalan police - the Mossos d'Esquadra - have been placed under Madrid's control. However, witnesses said they showed little inclination to use force on protesters. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau, who voted blank on Sunday, condemned police actions against the region's ""defenceless"" population, but Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said police had ""acted with professionalism and in a proportionate way"". The Mossos d'Esquadra are held in high esteem by Catalans Large crowds of independence supporters gathered in the centre of the regional capital Barcelona on Sunday evening, waving flags and singing the Catalan anthem. Anti-independence protesters have also held rallies in Barcelona and other Spanish cities. Catalan authorities said 319 of about 2,300 polling stations across the region had been closed by police while the Spanish government said 92 stations had been sealed off. Since Friday, thousands of people have occupied schools and other buildings designated as polling stations in order to keep them open. This video can not be played Voters attempt to stop police seizing ballots. Some shouted: ""We will vote! We are peaceful people"" Many of those inside were parents and their children, who remained in the buildings after the end of lessons on Friday and bedded down in sleeping bags on gym mats. The anti-independence Societat Civil said there were voting irregularities, including the same people voting twice. Catalonia, a region of 7.5 million people, has its own language and culture. It also has a high degree of autonomy, but is not recognised as a separate nation under the Spanish constitution. Who will move next in Catalan crisis?

"Spain is gripped by the duel between Prime Minister Rajoy (L) and Catalan leader Puigdemont Emotions are running high in Catalonia today. Of course they are. ""The Spanish government is like an abusive husband,"" one activist raged at me today. ""He says he loves you, that he can't live without you. Then, he beats you to stop you from leaving."" Sunday's scenes during the Catalan referendum were awful and played over and over again across social media. Barca football idol and Catalan-born Gerard Pique wept openly on Spanish television when questioned about the violence. But it would be wrong to interpret the anger and anguish so palpable in Catalonia right now as an expression of political unity. Catalans are as divided as ever on the question of independence. What unites them today is a seething fury and resentment at the heavy-handedness of the Spanish government, represented by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, with what Catalans perceive as his Madrid-centric arrogance, brutishness and disregard for the rights of individuals. This video can not be played Spanish police clashed with people trying to get to polling stations to vote This is far less about separatism than populism. Anti-establishment, nationalist sentimenta la Catalana. While the majority of Catalans say they don't actually want to leave Spain, they demand the right to choose. Legally and with dignity, in contrast to the chaos and intimidation on show at the weekend. They are frustrated that their region pays more in taxes to Madrid than it gets back in investment, such as new infrastructure. They are irritated that pledges of increased autonomy for Catalonia (already one of Europe's most autonomous regions) were then watered down, and still smarting that ordinary people in Catalonia - as across Spain - suffered so much in the 2008 economic crisis, while their tax contributions were used to bail out the banks. To give you an idea - Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest regions. Youth unemployment is far lower here than across the rest of Spain. But it's still a shocking 35%. Catalans want change, but that does not amount to a common call for independence. So what now? Before this weekend, Mariano Rajoy - nicknamed by opponents as ""The Robot"", as he could never be accused of having the common touch - had all the cards: the legal argument (Spain's constitutional court deemed this weekend's referendum illegal) public opinion (most Spaniards opposed the vote) EU support and a fractious, disunited front (until this weekend) of Catalan independence parties. But he's thrown those cards away. He and the Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, have walked if not arm-in-arm then at least back-to-back, duel-like, to the cliff's edge. A cynic might point out that both men benefit personally from this constitutional crisis - arguably Spain's most severe in the 40 years since the transition to democracy. Mr Rajoy heads a minority government, so short of support that it recently withdrew plans for the 2018 budget, for fear it wouldn't make it through the Spanish parliament. Meanwhile, Mr Puigdemont presides over one of the largest regional debts in Spain. Both men are tainted by allegations of corruption, which swirl persistently around their governments. The Catalan question is a very public distraction from unwelcome financial questions. Both men score political points from standing their ground now, as opinions in Catalonia and across Spain harden. As for the EU, some analysts have painted a picture of Eurocrats quaking in their blue and yellow boots. Refusing to condemn Sunday's violence, as they fear the flames of separatism will now spread from Catalonia to Corsica, northern Italy, Flanders and beyond. But that was the early 2000s, when Basque separatist violence raged too. Now Basque separatists support Prime Minister Rajoy in the Spanish parliament. Regional separatism is not a 2017 problem for the EU. Populism is.

"Police are trying to work out what drove a wealthy former accountant to open fire on concertgoers in Las Vegas, killing at least 58 people and injuring almost 500. The gunman, Stephen Paddock, 64, set up a firing point in a hotel overlooking an open-air music festival, and shot himself dead as police stormed his suite. Some 22,000 people were attending a country music festival late on Sunday, 1 October,  in the open air by the Las Vegas strip. The first shots rang out at around 22:05 local time (05:05 GMT) and continued at a rapid rate in sustained bursts for 10 minutes. Paddock was firing from a suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel. He had some 23 weapons with him and had set up cameras both inside and outside the suite to see anyone approaching the room, police said.  Witnesses described hundreds of shots being fired. What sounded like automatic gunfire can be heard on videos from the scene. There are reports that Paddock was using a ""bump stock"" - a modification to a weapon that can enable it to fire hundreds of rounds a minute. There was panic as people ran from the venue and tried to take cover. Amid the chaos there were reports of other incidents at different locations along the Las Vegas strip, but police later said they were false. This video can not be played How the horror unfolded At 22:15, the last shot was fired. Three minutes earlier, an officer on the 31st floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel identified the gunman's location on the 32nd floor. Officers reached the 32nd floor at 22:17, finding an injured security guard, another of Paddock's victims. Police later revealed that the security guard had been shot at 21:59, six minutes prior to Paddock opening fire on concert goers. Paddock's suite was stormed at around 23:20. Earlier reports said police killed the gunman, but it was later confirmed he had shot himself dead. ""It was like living next to nothing,"" said a former neighbour of Paddock Paddock lived in a retirement community in Mesquite, Nevada. Police have not yet said anything about what drove the 64-year-old to commit mass murder. The authorities said he had pilot's and hunting licences, and no criminal record. One former neighbour said Paddock was a professional gambler and ""weird"". Police found ""in excess of"" 19 firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition in his Mesquite home, while explosives were found in the property and his car. This video can not be played A police scanner captures the moment police burst into gunman's room Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said: ""We have no investigative information or background associated with this individual that is derogatory. ""The only thing we can tell is that he received a citation several years ago, and that citation was handled as a matter of normal practice in the court system."" Officers believe Paddock had been living in the hotel since 28 September. Broken windows on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel His brother Eric Paddock told Reuters news agency: ""We have no idea (about a motive). We're horrified. We're bewildered and our condolences go out to the victims."" The so-called Islamic State group said it was behind the attack and that the attacker had converted to Islam several months ago, although they offered no evidence. The FBI said it had found ""no connection"" with international terrorism. There was an appeal to find another ""person of interest"" named Marilou Danley, 62, who officials said was travelling with the gunman before the shooting. She returned to Los Angeles from the Philippines on Tuesday night and was met by federal agents. Reports said Paddock had transferred US$100,000 (Â£75,400) to her in the Philippines before Sunday's shooting. Meanwhile, Paddock's brother Eric said their father was a bank robber who was once on the FBI's Most Wanted list. What we know about the gunman Were Las Vegas guns altered to fire more? 'I'm no hero, but I had to go back in' Paddock killed 58 concert-goers and injured nearly 500 others. Initially, police released slightly higher figures for both dead and injured. The attack is the worst mass shooting in the United States since Omar Mateen opened fire at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, killing 49 in June 2016. At a White House news conference on Monday, President Donald Trump called the shooting ""an act of pure evil"". He also praised Las Vegas police for preventing further deaths, saying they acted with ""miraculous"" speed, but has refused to be drawn on America's controversial gun laws. On Tuesday, he described the shooter as a ""sick man, a demented man"". He will visit the city on Wednesday.

"""It was like living next to nothing,"" said a former neighbour of Paddock Las Vegas concert gunman Stephen Paddock was a wealthy former accountant and high-stakes gambler who appeared to be living in quiet retirement with his girlfriend in a desert community. The 64-year-old, of Mesquite, Nevada, had pilot's and hunting licences and no criminal record, said authorities. One former neighbour said twice-divorced Paddock was ""weird"". But his brother described him as a regular guy who liked playing video poker, live music and eating burritos. Is the gunman a terrorist? What we know so far Who are the victims? Paddock has been identified by police as the man behind the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, with the death toll surpassing the 49 killed at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016. He opened fire from the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino on Sunday night, killing 58 people and wounding almost 500 others, before turning the gun on himself as police closed in, said officials. Police shared this updated timeline of events on Wednesday Stephen Paddock had a troubled childhood, with a bank robber for a father, who regularly beat him, and a mother who struggled to bring him and his three brothers up, according to reports. One of the gunman's brothers, Eric Paddock, told reporters the family were stunned. ""He liked to play video poker,"" he said. ""He went on cruises. He sent his mother cookies."" Their father was once on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. This video can not be played What gunfire tells us about weapons used Twenty-three weapons were found in the 32nd-floor hotel room that Paddock checked into last Thursday. Police found ""in excess of"" 19 firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition in his Mesquite home, within a quiet retirement community 80 miles (130km) north-east of Las Vegas. They also found several pounds of an explosive called tannerite, and ammonium nitrate, a type of fertiliser used as an explosive, in his car. From 1976 to 1985 worked as a postman, an Internal Revenue Service agent and an auditor for the Defense Contract Audit Agency Worked for the predecessor company of Lockheed Martin in the 80s Maintained relations with his younger brother Eric but estranged from older brothers Bruce and Patrick Grew up in Sun Valley, California, and attended California State University in Northridge He was married twice and had no children Sources: US media reports Police said no manifesto or anything else had been discovered to explain Paddock's actions. ""I can't get into the mind of a psychopath at this point,"" Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said. The FBI said its agents had established no connection between Paddock and any overseas terrorist group, despite so-called Islamic State describing him as a ""soldier of the caliphate"". Paddock only previous known brush with the law was a routine traffic violation. This video can not be played How the horror unfolded David Famiglietti, of the New Frontier Armory, told the BBC that Paddock had purchased firearms at his store in north Las Vegas last spring, meeting all state and federal requirements, including an FBI background check. However, the shotgun and rifle Paddock bought would not have been ""capable of what we've seen and heard in the video without modification"", Mr Famiglietti said. Country music stars react Five reasons US gun control won't happen Two gun stocks were found in the hotel room, AP news agency reported, which can enable a weapon to fire hundreds of shots per minute. This video can not be played Eric Paddock says he is in total shock after police named his brother, Stephen, as the shooter According to NBC News,external, Paddock recently made several gambling transactions in the tens of thousands of dollars, but it was unclear if those bets were wins or losses. Bruce Paddock told NBC his brother was a multi-millionaire property investor. This video can not be played Trump on Las Vegas shooting: 'It was an act of pure evil' He had shown no sign of financial problems and reports said he owned a number of properties that he rented out. Separately, Eric Paddock said that Stephen came up with the cash to ensure that family members - including their elderly mother - were provided for. ""Steve took care of the people he loved. He helped make me and my family wealthy. He's the reason I was able to retire. This is the Steve we know, we knew. The people he loved and took care of,""Eric Paddock said in a news conference, according to CBS News,external. He described his brother as ""intelligent"" and ""successful."" This video can not be played Witnesses say people were being trampled Stephen Paddock moved to his two-storey house in Mesquite from Reno, Nevada, in June 2016. He lived in the property in Babbling Brook Court with his girlfriendMarilou Danley, 62. What do we know about Marilou Danley? Police have ruled out any involvement by Ms Danley, who was overseas at the time of the massacre but has nowreturned to the US, where she is facing questioning. She is an Australian citizen who moved to Nevada 20 years ago, the government in Canberra said. Marilou Danley, initially described as a person of interest, was located by police outside of the US A former neighbour, Diane McKay, 79,told the Washington Post,externalthe couple always kept the blinds closed at home. ""He was weird,"" she said. ""Kept to himself. It was like living next to nothing. ""You can at least be grumpy, something. He was just nothing, quiet."" Elsewhere the newspaper quoted neighbours in ""several states"" where Paddock owned retirement homes, describing him as ""surly, unfriendly and standoffish"". But those who lived close to a house he owned in Melbourne, Florida, have described him as ""very friendly"". According to US media, Paddock had a licence to fly small planes and owned two aircraft. In 2012, he filed a negligence lawsuit against The Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas, after a fall he said was caused by an ""obstruction"" on the floor, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported. The legal action was reportedly dropped in 2014. The relative lack of red flags in Paddock's personal history has only heightened the sense of bewilderment as a shocked nation asks: Why?

"Clare Balding was the cover star of Saga Magazine Clare Balding has denied claims that she demanded changes were made to a magazine interview and replaced quotes with her own ""self-promoting words"".

But the BBC presentertweeted,externalthat she ""did not have copy approval"". She said it was the editor of Saga that had asked for changes. Saga magazine issued a statement saying that Dougary was ""mistaken in thinking that copy approval was given. It was not."" It said it had edited the interview ""with the full involvement of the writer"". Dougary said she had asked for her byline to be removed from the article after a number of changes were made to her copy, claiming these were due to requests from the BBC presenter and her agent. The journalist also said Balding had added quotes about hosting the women's European football championships as well as a ""shameless puff"" for her own children's book. Allow Twitter content?

Saga said it was the magazine editor's view that the ""original article did not cover the wide range of issues that Clare holds dear"" and the writer ""suggested we add lines ourselves"". It said it was the editor's decision alone to edit any article that is ""not exactly right"" for the magazine and that they do ""not defer that decision to PRs or interviewees"". It's not at all clear what changes or approval - if any - the broadcaster Clare Balding (or those around her) sought for her interview in Saga. I don't know the specifics of the case, and therefore couldn't pass judgement. But in general, copy approval transgresses a fundamental principle of journalism. By in effect granting the interviewee final say in what is published, it gives them the right to shape what enters the public domain. No journalist should be willing to cede control in that manner. When setting up interviews, it is reasonable for journalists to give a general outline of the subject matter to be discussed. But it is foolhardy to give final say to the interviewee. In general, it is the most powerful people who have most to gain from copy approval. Given the basic job of journalists is to scrutinise power, that is all the more reason for journalists to resist such a move. ""Saga Magazine does not offer copy control, and interviews that require it are declined. In this case, quotes were checked for accuracy alone. New quotes were sourced to rebalance the article against deadline,"" they said. The Guardian article was widely shared on social media with a number of journalists tweeting their agreement with Dougary. Balding did not comment until after Saga's statement was published, revealing she had to stop herself from responding earlier in the day. ""Re the Saga saga, today has been an exercise in self-restraint,"" she said. Among Dougary's claims was that she had been asked to say how ""lovely"" Balding was. ""I would certainly never ask anyone to call me 'lovely'. Gorgeous maybe - but never lovely!"", Baldingtweeted,externalin response.

"""It was like living next to nothing,"" said a former neighbour of Paddock Las Vegas concert gunman Stephen Paddock was a wealthy former accountant and high-stakes gambler who appeared to be living in quiet retirement with his girlfriend in a desert community. The 64-year-old, of Mesquite, Nevada, had pilot's and hunting licences and no criminal record, said authorities. One former neighbour said twice-divorced Paddock was ""weird"". But his brother described him as a regular guy who liked playing video poker, live music and eating burritos. Is the gunman a terrorist? What we know so far Who are the victims? Paddock has been identified by police as the man behind the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, with the death toll surpassing the 49 killed at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016. He opened fire from the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino on Sunday night, killing 58 people and wounding almost 500 others, before turning the gun on himself as police closed in, said officials. Police shared this updated timeline of events on Wednesday Stephen Paddock had a troubled childhood, with a bank robber for a father, who regularly beat him, and a mother who struggled to bring him and his three brothers up, according to reports. One of the gunman's brothers, Eric Paddock, told reporters the family were stunned. ""He liked to play video poker,"" he said. ""He went on cruises. He sent his mother cookies."" Their father was once on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. This video can not be played What gunfire tells us about weapons used Twenty-three weapons were found in the 32nd-floor hotel room that Paddock checked into last Thursday. Police found ""in excess of"" 19 firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition in his Mesquite home, within a quiet retirement community 80 miles (130km) north-east of Las Vegas. They also found several pounds of an explosive called tannerite, and ammonium nitrate, a type of fertiliser used as an explosive, in his car. From 1976 to 1985 worked as a postman, an Internal Revenue Service agent and an auditor for the Defense Contract Audit Agency Worked for the predecessor company of Lockheed Martin in the 80s Maintained relations with his younger brother Eric but estranged from older brothers Bruce and Patrick Grew up in Sun Valley, California, and attended California State University in Northridge He was married twice and had no children Sources: US media reports Police said no manifesto or anything else had been discovered to explain Paddock's actions. ""I can't get into the mind of a psychopath at this point,"" Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said. The FBI said its agents had established no connection between Paddock and any overseas terrorist group, despite so-called Islamic State describing him as a ""soldier of the caliphate"". Paddock only previous known brush with the law was a routine traffic violation. This video can not be played How the horror unfolded David Famiglietti, of the New Frontier Armory, told the BBC that Paddock had purchased firearms at his store in north Las Vegas last spring, meeting all state and federal requirements, including an FBI background check. However, the shotgun and rifle Paddock bought would not have been ""capable of what we've seen and heard in the video without modification"", Mr Famiglietti said. Country music stars react Five reasons US gun control won't happen Two gun stocks were found in the hotel room, AP news agency reported, which can enable a weapon to fire hundreds of shots per minute. This video can not be played Eric Paddock says he is in total shock after police named his brother, Stephen, as the shooter According to NBC News,external, Paddock recently made several gambling transactions in the tens of thousands of dollars, but it was unclear if those bets were wins or losses. Bruce Paddock told NBC his brother was a multi-millionaire property investor. This video can not be played Trump on Las Vegas shooting: 'It was an act of pure evil' He had shown no sign of financial problems and reports said he owned a number of properties that he rented out. Separately, Eric Paddock said that Stephen came up with the cash to ensure that family members - including their elderly mother - were provided for. ""Steve took care of the people he loved. He helped make me and my family wealthy. He's the reason I was able to retire. This is the Steve we know, we knew. The people he loved and took care of,""Eric Paddock said in a news conference, according to CBS News,external. He described his brother as ""intelligent"" and ""successful."" This video can not be played Witnesses say people were being trampled Stephen Paddock moved to his two-storey house in Mesquite from Reno, Nevada, in June 2016. He lived in the property in Babbling Brook Court with his girlfriendMarilou Danley, 62. What do we know about Marilou Danley? Police have ruled out any involvement by Ms Danley, who was overseas at the time of the massacre but has nowreturned to the US, where she is facing questioning. She is an Australian citizen who moved to Nevada 20 years ago, the government in Canberra said. Marilou Danley, initially described as a person of interest, was located by police outside of the US A former neighbour, Diane McKay, 79,told the Washington Post,externalthe couple always kept the blinds closed at home. ""He was weird,"" she said. ""Kept to himself. It was like living next to nothing. ""You can at least be grumpy, something. He was just nothing, quiet."" Elsewhere the newspaper quoted neighbours in ""several states"" where Paddock owned retirement homes, describing him as ""surly, unfriendly and standoffish"". But those who lived close to a house he owned in Melbourne, Florida, have described him as ""very friendly"". According to US media, Paddock had a licence to fly small planes and owned two aircraft. In 2012, he filed a negligence lawsuit against The Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas, after a fall he said was caused by an ""obstruction"" on the floor, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported. The legal action was reportedly dropped in 2014. The relative lack of red flags in Paddock's personal history has only heightened the sense of bewilderment as a shocked nation asks: Why?

"In the early years of the 20th Century, US carmakers had it good. As quickly as they could manufacture cars, people bought them. By 1914, that was changing. In higher price brackets especially, purchasers and dealerships were becoming choosier. One commentator warned that the retailer ""could no longer sell what his own judgement dictated"". Instead, ""he must sell what the consumer wanted"". That commentator was Charles Coolidge Parlin, widely recognised as the world's first professional market researcher and, indeed, the man who invented the very idea of market research. A century later, the market research profession is huge: in the United States alone, it employs about 500,000 people. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Parlin was tasked with taking the pulse of the US automobile market. He travelled tens of thousands of miles, and interviewed hundreds of car dealers. After months of work, he presented his employer with what he modestly described as ""2,500 typewritten sheets, charts, maps, statistics, tables etc"". You might wonder which carmaker employed Parlin to conduct this research. Was it, perhaps, Henry Ford, who at the time was busy gaining an edge on his rivals with another innovation - the assembly line? But no: Ford didn't have a market research department to gauge what customers wanted. Perhaps that's no surprise. Henry Ford is widely supposed to have quipped that people could have a Model T in ""any colour they like, as long as it's black"". In fact, no carmakers employed market researchers. Charles Parlin was charged with investigating markets to facilitate more effective advertising Parlin had been hired by a magazine publisher. The Curtis Publishing Company  was responsible for some of the most widely read periodicals of the time: the Saturday Evening Post, The Ladies' Home Journal, The Country Gentleman. The magazines depended on advertising revenue. The company's founder thought he'd be able to sell more advertising space if advertising were perceived as more effective, and wondered if researching markets might make it possible to devise better adverts. In 1911, he set up a new division of his company to explore this vaguely conceived idea, headed by Charles Parlin. It wasn't an obvious career move for a 39-year-old high school principal from Wisconsin - but then, being the world's first market researcher wouldn't have been an obvious career move for anyone. Parlin started by immersing himself in agricultural machinery, then tackled department stores. Not everyone saw value in his activities, at first. Department stores such as Selfridges also had a massive influence on the way people shopped Even as he introduced his pamphlet The Merchandising of Automobiles: An Address to Retailers, he still felt the need to include a diffident justification of his job's existence. He hoped to be ""of constructive service to the industry as a whole,"" he wrote, explaining that carmakers spent heavily on advertising, and his employers wanted to ""ascertain whether this important source of business was one which would continue"".  They needn't have worried. The invention of market research marks an early step in a broader shift from a ""producer-led"" to ""consumer-led"" approach to business - from making something then trying to persuade people to buy it, to trying to find out what people might buy, and then making it. The producer-led mindset is exemplified by Henry Ford's ""any colour, as long as it's black"". From 1914 to 1926, only black Model Ts rolled off Ford's production line: it was simpler to assemble cars of a single colour, and black paint was cheap and durable. Henry Ford famously began by selling one type of car available in one colour All that remained was to persuade customers that what they really wanted was a black Model T. To be fair, Ford excelled at this. Few companies today would simply produce what's convenient, then hope to sell it. A panoply of market research techniques helps determine what might sell: surveys, focus groups, beta testing. If metallic paint and go-faster stripes will sell more cars, that's what will get made. Where Parlin led, others eventually followed. By the late 1910s, not long after Parlin's report on automobiles, companies had started setting up their own market research departments. Over the next decade, US advertising budgets almost doubled. George Gallup pioneered opinion polls in the 1930s Approaches to market research became more scientific. In the 1930s, George Gallup pioneered opinion polls. The first focus group was conducted in 1941 by an academic sociologist, Robert K Merton. He later wished he could have patented the idea and collected royalties. But systematically investigating consumer preferences was only part of the story. Marketers also realised it was possible systematically to change them. How department stores changed the way we shop TV dinners: The hidden cost of the processed food revolution How the barcode changed the retail world How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff Robert K Merton coined a phrase to describe the kind of successful, cool or savvy individual who routinely features in marketing campaigns: the ""role model"". The nature of advertising was changing: no longer merely providing information, but trying to manufacture desire. Sigmund Freud's nephew Edward Bernays pioneered the fields of public relations and propaganda. In 1929, he helped the American Tobacco Company to persuade women that smoking in public was an act of female liberation. Cigarettes, he said, were ""torches of freedom"". Adverts began to portray smoking and smokers as liberated and modern Today, attempts to discern and direct public preferences shape every corner of the economy. Any viral marketer will tell you that creating buzz remains more of an art than a science, but with ever more data available, investigations of consumer psychology can get ever more detailed. Where Ford offered cars in a single shade of black, Google famously tested the effect on click-through rates of 41 slightly different shades of blue. Google carried out exhaustive tests on which precise shade of blue performed best Should we worry about the reach and sophistication of corporate efforts to probe and manipulate our consumer psyches? The evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller takes a more optimistic view. ""Like chivalrous lovers,"" Miller writes, ""the best marketing-oriented companies help us discover desires we never knew we had, and ways of fulfilling them we never imagined."" Perhaps. Miller sees humans showing off through our consumer purchases much as peacocks impress peahens with their tails. Such ideas hark back to an economist and sociologist named Thorstein Veblen, who invented the concept of conspicuous consumption back in 1899. Charles Coolidge Parlin had read his Veblen. He understood the signalling power of consumer purchases. ""The pleasure car,"" he wrote in his address to retailers, ""is the travelling representative of a man's taste or refinement."" ""A dilapidated pleasure car,"" he added, ""like a decrepit horse, advertises that the driver is lacking in funds, or lacking in pride.""

In other words, perhaps not someone you should trust as a business associate - or a husband. Signalling these days is much more complex than merely displaying wealth: we might choose a Prius if we want to display our green credentials, or a Volvo if we want to be seen as safety-conscious. These signals carry meaning only because brands have spent decades consciously trying to understand and respond to consumer desires - and to shape them. By contrast with today's adverts, those of 1914 were delightfully unsophisticated. The tagline of one, for a Model T, said: ""Buy it because it's a better car.""  Isn't that advertisement, in its own way, perfect? But it couldn't last. Charles Coolidge Parlin was in the process of ushering us towards a very different world.

""I think that there will be certainly a time for that policy discussion to take place,"" Sanders said when asked if the president had reconsidered US gun control measures. But now is not that time, she added. During testimony to Congress last week, FBI Director Christopher Wray said there are about 1,000 ongoing, active investigations into potential domestic terrorists. Speaking to the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday, he described the list as a ""very serious"" issue that the agency spends ""a lot of our time focused on"". He noted in his testimony that the threat of domestic terror is much greater than ""the threat from ISIS influence"", referring to so-called Islamic State. Police have said that the attack in Las Vegas was not terror-related, but so far have not released a motive.   Advocates for increased gun control are calling attention to a Republican draft bill which would make it easier for Americans to purchase ""silencers"" - also known as ""suppressors"" - which are affixed to the end of gun barrels and are designed to dampen the sound of gunfire. Thebill,external, known as the Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act, includes provisions that would deregulate gun silencers. ""This legislation is about safety â plain and simple"", said South Carolina Congressman Jeff Duncan when he introduced the bill, noting that his own hearing ""has been damaged because of gun noise"". Debate over the bill was meant to begin next week in Congress after it was delayed over the summer following a gun attack against US congressmen while they practiced for a softball game. Former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton noted on Twitter that the bill is a policy goal of the NRA (National Rifle Association). Allow Twitter content?

"Bags for life pose a food poisoning risk if they are used to carry raw foods such as meat and fish, a consumer watchdog is warning. The Food Standards Agency says even if there is no leakage, packaging can harbour traces of harmful bacteria that can cause stomach bugs. Shoppers should have separate bags for raw foods, ready-to-eat foods and household items such as detergent. Reusable bags could be colour coded or labelled to avoid any mix-up, it says. If there has been visible spillage, soiling or damage, plastic bags for life should be replaced, while fabric ones could be washed or cleaned. ""Even if there are no obvious spillages or staining after several uses, we would recommend that cotton/fabric bags for life be machine-washed regularly if they have been used for carrying raw items,"" the FSA website recommends in an updated post. Although instances are rare, shop-bought chicken is a potential source of infection. Tests by the FSA have shown chicken packaging can carry a bug called campylobacter - the most common cause of food poisoning in the UK. Campylobacter poisoning usually develops a few days after eating contaminated food and leads to symptoms that include abdominal pain, severe diarrhoea and, sometimes, vomiting. Eggs, fish and loose vegetables with soil on can also pose a food poisoning risk, says the FSA website. How to avoid food poisoning,external What is food poisoning,external Large shops in England have been charging 5p for single-use plastic carrier bags for nearly two years. However, they are not required to charge for plastic bags for certain products - including uncooked fish, meat or poultry products.

"This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes At least 59 people have been killed and another 527 injured in a mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert. A gunman, named as 64-year-old Nevada resident Stephen Paddock, opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards an open-air music festival attended by 22,000. He killed himself as police stormed the room where 10 guns were found. Investigators have found no link to international terrorism, despite a claim from so-called Islamic State. In an address from the White House, President Donald Trump described the attack as ""pure evil"". He praised the efforts of the emergency services, saying their ""miraculous"" speed saved lives, and announced he would be visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday. With First Lady Melania by his side, he later observed a moment of silence on the White House lawn. This video can not be played A police scanner captures the moment police burst into gunman's room The final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck. Thousands were enjoying a performance by top-billing singer Jason Aldean when the first of several bursts of automatic gunfire rang out - hundreds of shots, witnesses say. That was late on Sunday night - 22:08 local time (05:08 GMT on Monday). Hundreds of concert-goers scrambled for cover, flattening themselves against the ground, rushing for the exits or helping others to escape as Paddock sprayed the site from his high vantage point.

Las Vegas shooting - what we know The fake photos shared after tragedies Suspected gunman Stephen Paddock - undated image Stephen Paddock, from a community of senior citizens in the small town of Mesquite north-east of Las Vegas, booked into the hotel on 28 September, police say. His motives for carrying out the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history remain a mystery. Some investigators have suggested psychological issues, but there is no confirmation of this. His brother, Eric, is dumbfounded that he acted this way. This video can not be played Eric Paddock says he is in total shock after police named his brother, Stephen, as the shooter Las Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardo described the shooting as a ""lone wolf"" attack. ""We have no idea what his belief system was,"" he said. So-called Islamic State (IS) has claimed to be behind the attack, saying that Paddock had converted to Islam some months ago. But the group provided no evidence for this and has made unsubstantiated claims in the past. FBI Special Agent Aaron Rouse told a news conference: ""We have determined at this point no connection to an international terrorist organisation."" IS's claim of responsibility for the Las Vegas attack is very unusual in that the perpetrator's profile does not fit that of supporters or ""soldiers"" that the group has claimed in the past, writes Mina al-Lami, who monitors jihadist groups for the BBC. If true, his suicide would be deemed wholly ""un-Islamic"", she adds. Jihadist suicides involve the assailant blowing himself up in order to kill those around him. What we know about the gunman A couple at the concert take cover after gunfire was heard at country music festival The investigation continues to gather pace, with searches at Paddock's Mesquite home, where more weapons were found, and a second property. Paddock lived in Mesquite with Marilou Danley. Police have interviewed her but say she does not appear to have been involved as she was out of the country. They are hoping to speak to her again. Police say he used some of her identity documents to check in to the Mandalay Bay. The authorities have yet to confirm the identities of any of the 58 killed.

In a Facebook post, his wife, Dr Heather Gulish Melton, said she ""lost my true love and knight in shining armor. I appreciate the prayers but I just need some time."" An off-duty Las Vegas police officer was another of those who died. More on the victims By the BBC's James Cook in Las Vegas The scenes which played out in this stunned city were at once frantically urgent and wearily familiar. When gunfire rings out, Americans know the drill. Run. They fled from a gunman who left a city in chaos. For a time, Las Vegas looked and felt like a war zone. Hospitals were overwhelmed. There were not enough ambulances. A plea for blood donations echoed across the airwaves. And now the mourning, the relief, the tears, the elation, the grief and a hundred other emotions are barely beginning. Doctors are still battling to save lives. For a Western democracy, the United States has seen an astonishing amount of horror like this. But even for this country what happened here is carnage on a different scale. America's mass shooting disease now feels like a plague. Nevada has some of the least stringent gun laws in the United States. People are allowed to carry weapons and do not have to register themselves as a gun-owner. Background checks are done when people buy guns, but they are also allowed to sell them privately. Former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a shooting six years ago, called for political leaders in Washington to introduce tougher gun laws following the Las Vegas attack. Her husband Mark Kelly read out a joint statement on the steps of the Capitol saying thoughts and prayers from the White House were not enough to stop the next shooting.

"This video can not be played Catalans sing their anthem 'Els Segadors', or 'The Reapers' Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont says the Spanish region has won the right to statehood following a contentious referendum that was marred by violence. He said the door was open to a unilateral declaration of independence after Catalan officials said voters had backed secession with a 42.3% turnout. Spain's government has warned it could suspend Catalan autonomy. The constitutional court banned the vote and almost 900 people were hurt as police tried to stop it going ahead. Officers from the national police and paramilitary Civil Guard seized ballot papers and boxes at polling stations. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said Catalans had been fooled into taking part in an illegal vote. More than 2.2 million people were reported to have voted, according to Catalan authorities, out of 5.3 million registered voters. Just under 90% of those who voted backed independence, they said. A Catalan spokesman said more than 750,000 votes could not be counted because polling stations were closed and urns were confiscated. Given the chaotic nature of the vote, the turnout and voting figures should be taken with a pinch of salt, says the BBC's Tom Burridge in Barcelona. ""With this day of hope and suffering, the citizens of Catalonia have won the right to an independent state in the form of a republic,"" Mr Puigdemont said in a televised address. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont was flanked by members of his government as he made his statement ""My government in the next few days will send the results of today's vote to the Catalan parliament, where the sovereignty of our people lies, so that it can act in accordance with the law of the referendum."" He said theEuropean Union could no longer ""continue to look the other way"". This video can not be played Riot police were seen using batons and kicking people to block voting The Spanish prime minister spoke of a ""mockery"" of democracy. ""At this hour I can tell you in the strongest terms what you already know and what we have seen throughout this day. There has not been a referendum on self-determination in Catalonia,"" Mr Rajoy said. Spain's justice minister warned that any declaration of independence could lead to article 155 of the country's constitution being invoked which allows the national government to intervene in the running of an autonomous region. ""We are not here to divide Spaniards... but if someone tries to declare independence on behalf of a part of Spain's territory, that cannot be done because it is beyond their powers,"" said Rafael CatalÃ¡. Analysis: Tom Burridge, BBC News, Barcelona Spain's complicated relationship with the region of Catalonia is headed for the unknown. After violence by Spanish police, a declaration of independence by Catalonia's regional government seems more likely than ever before. On Monday the government in Madrid will hold talks with Spanish parties to discuss a response to the biggest political crisis this country has seen in decades. Read more from Tom More than 40 trade unions and Catalan associations called a region-wide strike on Tuesday due to ""the grave violation of rights and freedoms"". TV images showed Spanish police kicking would-be voters and pulling women out of polling stations by their hair. Catalan medical officials said 844 people had been hurt in clashes, including 33 police. The majority had minor injuries or had suffered from anxiety attacks. How Barcelona and Madrid viewed the vote The most powerful images of Catalan clashes The reasons for the referendum In Girona, riot police smashed their way into a polling station where Mr Puigdemont was due to vote, and forcibly removed those inside. He voted at another station. The BBC's Tom Burridge in Barcelona witnessed policebeing chased away,externalfrom one polling booth after they had raided it. TV footage showed riot police using batons to beat a group of firefighters who were protecting crowds in Girona. This woman suffered a head injury in Barcelona The national police and Guardia Civil - a military force charged with police duties - were sent into Catalonia in large numbers to prevent the vote. The Catalan police - the Mossos d'Esquadra - have been placed under Madrid's control, however witnesses said they showed little inclination to use force on protesters. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau, who voted blank on Sunday, condemned police actions against the region's ""defenceless"" population, but Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said police had ""acted with professionalism and in a proportionate way"". The Mossos d'Esquadra are held in high esteem by Catalans Large crowds of independence supporters gathered in the centre of the regional capital Barcelona on Sunday evening, waving flags and singing the Catalan anthem. Anti-independence protesters have also held rallies in Barcelona and other Spanish cities. Catalan authorities said 319 of about 2,300 polling stations across the region had been closed by police while the Spanish government said 92 stations had been sealed off. Since Friday, thousands of people have occupied schools and other buildings designated as polling stations in order to keep them open. This video can not be played Voters attempt to stop police seizing ballots. Some shouted: ""We will vote! We are peaceful people"" Many of those inside were parents and their children, who remained in the buildings after the end of lessons on Friday and bedded down in sleeping bags on gym mats. The anti-independence Societat Civil said there were voting irregularities, including the same people voting twice. Catalonia, a wealthy region of 7.5 million people in north-eastern Spain, has its own language and culture. It also has a high degree of autonomy, but is not recognised as a separate nation under the Spanish constitution. Who will move next in Catalan crisis?

"This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes At least 59 people have been killed and another 527 injured in a mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert. A gunman, named as 64-year-old Nevada resident Stephen Paddock, opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards an open-air music festival attended by 22,000. He killed himself as police stormed the room where 10 guns were found. Investigators have found no link to international terrorism, despite a claim from so-called Islamic State. In an address from the White House, President Donald Trump described the attack as ""pure evil"". He praised the efforts of the emergency services, saying their ""miraculous"" speed saved lives, and announced he would be visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday. With First Lady Melania by his side, he later observed a moment of silence on the White House lawn. This video can not be played A police scanner captures the moment police burst into gunman's room The final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck. Thousands were enjoying a performance by top-billing singer Jason Aldean when the first of several bursts of automatic gunfire rang out - hundreds of shots, witnesses say. That was late on Sunday night - 22:08 local time (05:08 GMT on Monday). Hundreds of concert-goers scrambled for cover, flattening themselves against the ground, rushing for the exits or helping others to escape as Paddock sprayed the site from his high vantage point.

And on Wall Street - US stock markets have finished at fresh records following strong economic data and hopes of another strong 
quarter of corporate earnings reports. All three major indices ended at all-time highs. The Dow Jones 
Industrial Average jumped 0.7% to 22,557.
      The broader S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 2,529, while the tech-rich 
Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.3% to 6,517. Away from the Monarch collapse - there's been an update in the US over the giant Equifax data breach. The credit agency's security team failed to 
patch a vulnerability in March after getting a warning about the flaw, opening 
up the firm to a breach affecting 143 million people, the former chief 
executive says. Richard Smith, in a statement to a congressional committee 
released on Monday, offered a timeline of the huge cyber attack. He said in the prepared remarks that the company disseminated an internal memo on 9 March warning about a software flaw identified by the 
government's Computer Emergency Response Team. He added that Equifax policy would have required a patch to be applied 
within 48 hours, but this was not done. Mr Smith could not explain why. And here's some more reaction to Monarch going out of business in the UK's biggest ever airline collapse. Here's how customers at Birmingham airport reacted... This video can not be played Monarch passengers left 'gutted' at Birmingham Airport Business live has been flooded with tales of woe from Monarch travellers, but let's not forgot the staff who have lost their jobs. A reader writes: ""Today, my 20-year-old brother came off his night flight
and woke up to an email about a meeting. In this meeting staff were told they
were no longer Monarch employees and were being made redundant. No 'thank you' or your service, no apology, just - ""we advise you to go to the job centre and
sign on"". ""My brother is devastated to lose a job
he worked so hard for and served his second summer season this year with the
company. He has friends that were taken on just a few months ago for the summer
season, moving to Birmingham from as far as Scotland only to be let down and
left without redundancy money. ""For the company to keep this a secret
from the staff and for them to wake up with no job this morning is disgusting.
Even if they had been given a warning, some may have been able to look for new
jobs or at least get a head start on it. ""I feel so sorry for all the staff,
they have been mistreated and deceived and are now left with nothing. Summer
season is over now, so other airlines may not have vacancies until next sumner.
What are they supposed to do in the meantime?""  Let's check in with the US stock markets... It's turning into another record day on Wall Street with the three main indexes hitting fresh highs. Stronger US manufacturing data was behind the increase. With about 30 minutes to go before the closing bell, the Dow Jones was up 0.6% at 22,541 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.23% to 6,511, and S&P was 0.3% ahead at 2,527.  The personal information of
two individuals was compromised in a recently uncovered hack of
a Securities and Exchange Commission database, according to the financial regulator's chairman. Jay Clayton (above) said in a statement on Monday that
additional forensic analysis has found that the Social Security
numbers, dates of birth, and names of two individuals were made
available to the hackers after they breached the SEC's corporate
filing system known as EDGAR. He had previously said no personally identifiable
information had been accessed in the breach, which occurred in
2016. US Homeland Security has found critical breaches in the SEC's computer security, sparking suggestions that hackers could have had access to corporate announcements before they were formally released. Radio 4 PM This video can not be played The Civil Aviation Authority has begun flying Monarch passengers back to the UK, after the airline collapsed in the early hours of Monday morning. About 860 thousand people have lost bookings with 110 thousand of them currently overseas. Between 2004 and 2011 Tim Jeans was Managing Director of Monarch airlines. He told Radio 4's PM programme that Monarch realised ""a little bit too late"" about the competition from EasyJet and Ryanair. He added ""people wanted the lowest fare - they might have loved the meals, loved the glass of wine, but the reality was they would not pay for it."" Emma SimpsonBusiness correspondent, BBC News Southwark Crown Court
has heard of the ""frenetic"" last weeks in August 2014 when it was
widely known there was a gap in Tesco's accounts which was spiralling out of
control. Tesco's former UK managing director, Chris Bush, its former finance director, Carl Rogberg, and
its ex-UK commercial food director, John Scouler, are all charged with fraud
and false accounting in connection with the retailer's Â£250m accounting
scandal. The prosecution
counsel, Sasha Wass, QC, has been outlining the timeline leading up to Tesco's
dramatic announcement that it had overstated its profits in September 2014. The court heard that
although it was known that ""aggressive"" targets were not going to be
met, the accused carried on "" conniving and manipulating the figures""
by incorrectly encouraging others to ""pull forward"" income and that
they must have been fully aware of the damaging effects this practice was
having on the financial health of the company. The prosecution said
that the attempts to plug the financial hole were like a ""hamster running
around on the wheel"". The court heard that
the accused continually refused to deal with the growing problem and that Mr
Rogberg, allegedly told a ""bare faced lie"" to a senior colleague,
when questioned about a potential shortfall. And the court heard
the lead up to every half year deadline was known as ""diving for the
line"". It emerged that the
former Tesco chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, will be a witness for the
prosecution. The three defendants
deny the charges. The prosecution is expected to finish its opening statement
tomorrow. The demise of Monarch will mean 1,858 job losses, the administrators have confirmed. KMPG said that of these, 1,760 were employees of Monarch Airlines, while 98 were employed by
Monarch Travel Group. Between
them the companies employed about 2,100 people. The remainder have been kept on to help with the repatriation process and other admin issues. KPMG said in a statement this evening: âRegrettably,
with the business no longer able to fly, a significant number of redundancies
were made. âOver
the coming days, my team will be doing all it can to assist the employees in
submitting claims to the Redundancy Payments Office for monies owed."" Aviation regulator the CAA estimates the
repatriation of Monarch customers to the UK will cost about Â£60m. That will come from
government funding, it says. About 12,000 Monarch customers flew back to the UK today. The CAA has also listed by country the likely number of travellers to be repatriated by the end of this week. The vast majority, 32,503 people, will be brought back from Spain and the Canary Islands. From Portugal, it is 9,553, from Italy 3,661, and Croatia 2,086. In all 56,120 Monarch customers from 11 countries are expected to by repatriated by the end of the week, the CAA says.   Investors know how to spot a silver lining, and on the FTSE 100 today it was EasyJet. The airline's shares closed more than 5% up on expectation it would be a beneficiary of Monarch's demise. British Airways' owner IAG rose 2.36%, while in Dublin Ryanair closed 3.87% ahead. Elsewhere on the FTSE 100, which finished up 0.9% up at 7,438.8 points, housebuilders Barratt and Persimmon each rose more than 4% after the government announced more money for its Help to Buy scheme. Simon JackBBC Business Editor One thing that
Monarch lacked was scale. Its fleet of thirty or so aircraft was dwarfed by competitors like EasyJet and Ryanair which have 200 and 300 respectively. When terror
attacks in Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey saw the industry refocus on the Western
Mediterranean, competiton became intense and prices fell. Monarch could not
achieve the economies of scale the big players could. Management
realised this and made progress on tie ups with several interested parties.
Company sources tell me that those talks were derailed by uncertainty
surrounding the future regulation of the UK aviation industry thrown up by the
Brexit vote. The fall in the
value of the pound after the vote also pushed up the cost of fuel and aircraft
leases which were priced in dollars adding Â£50m per year to their costs. It was operating
in a viciously competitive market, it was too small to absorb any additional
costs and potential partners wanted to wait for more clarity on post-Brexit
airline regulation. Brexit didnât
kill Monarch on its own, but it added cost and helped shut off some of its
potential escape routes. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has dismissed suggestions Monarch's crisis is part of wider problems with Britain's aviation sector. Far from it, he told the Tory party conference, Monarch was a casualty of the success of its rivals. He says: ""As soon as
it became apparent that the airline was struggling we acted quickly. We
are today mounting the biggest civilian repatriation exercise this country has
seen in peacetime and we will bringing back 100,000 people who are stranded
overseas. ""And weâve
spoken to all the other airlines and asked them to do what they can to make
sure people affected can rebook their trips elsewhere as quickly as possible. ""But let
nobody think this is a sign of general problems in our aviation sector. Monarch
has been a victim of the success of other airlines, like Easyjet and Jet 2.
This summer most of our airports carried more passengers than ever
before. ""And
they did so because of the success of our economy. We have a great record to
build on.""   For everyone still tearing their hair out about their rights following the Monarch crisis,here's a link to our feature. Consumer champion Martin Lewis has also tweeted some usual advice, below. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has asked airlines not to exploit the Monarch crisis by raising prices, according to his PR team. A Department for Transport spokesman says he has ""asked all airlines to keep their prices reasonable for passengers
affected"". The spokesman added: ""We expect airlines, irrespective of whether they are members, to honour the
International Air Transport Association agreement to make their best efforts to
help passengers stranded away from home. ""These passengers should be provided access to discounted 'rescue fares',
subject to available capacity, for up to two weeks after the event to anywhere
within Europe."" BBC Newsbeat reporter tweets: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Away from Monarch for a moment, here's our usual update on the start of trading on Wall Street. The week has begun well, with the three major US share indexes hitting record highs at the open on hopes of progress on President Donald Trump's

"This video can not be played What happened when passengers turned up at Manchester airport for their flights? Monarch Airlines has ceased trading and all its future flights and holidays have been cancelled, affecting hundreds of thousands of customers. About 860,000 people have lost bookings and more than 30 planes will be sent by the Civil Aviation Authority to return 110,000 holidaymakers who are overseas. Monarch employs about 2,100 people and reported a Â£291m loss last year. Terror attacks in Tunisia and Egypt, increased competition, and the weak pound have been blamed for its demise. Theresa May's official spokesman said the prime minister ""feels hugely sorry"" for those affected by a ""very distressing situation"". Latest updates What are your rights? 'Shock and anger' among passengers Four reasons Monarch failed 'Crisis' coming for budget airlines, says union Monarch - the UK's fifth biggest and the country's largest ever to collapse - was placed in administration at 04:00 BST - a time when the airline had no planes in the air. Passengers were then sent text messages informing them flights had been cancelled - but some customers were already at airports. Alan Jee was due to get married in Gran Canaria on Saturday and arrived at Gatwick airport with 30 members of his family.

It had beenin last-ditch talkswith the CAA about renewing its licence to sell package holidays, but failed to reach a deal. Blair Nimmo, from administrator KPMG, said its collapse was a result of ""depressed prices"" in the short-haul travel market, alongside increased fuel costs and handling charges as a result of a weak pound. However, Monarch chief executive Andrew Swaffield said the ""root cause"" was terrorism in Egypt and Tunisia, as well as the collapse of the market in Turkey. Departure boards at Luton airport showed cancelled Monarch flights He said it had been carrying 14% more passengers than last year - but for Â£100m less revenue. Mr Swaffield said employees could ""hold your heads up high and be proud of what you achieved"". Monarch's owner, Greybull Capital, had been trying to sell part or all of its short-haul operation so it could focus on more profitable long-haul routes, and said it was ""very sorry"" it had not been able to turn around its fortunes. The CAA has organised 34 chartered planes from 16 different airlines - EasyJet and Qatar Airways among them - to return passengers to the UK over the next fortnight. Chief executive Andrew Haines said passengers would not be charged for the repatriation flights, which would match Monarch's original schedule ""as closely as possible"", adding: ""There will undoubtedly be some disruption"". He said ""the nature of administration"" meant Monarch's fleet was not immediately available for use.

Mr Grayling said the Department for Work and Pensions would give support to those affected and that airlines had already told him they may seek to employ Monarch staff. EasyJet said it would be ""really pleased"" to hire former Monarch employees, saying it had 400 cabin crew vacancies at Gatwick Airport and 100 at Luton, as well as job openings for pilots and head office staff.

"""It was like living next to nothing,"" said a former neighbour of Paddock Las Vegas concert gunman Stephen Paddock was a wealthy former accountant and high-stakes gambler who appeared to be living in quiet retirement with his girlfriend in a desert community. The 64-year-old, of Mesquite, Nevada, had pilot's and hunting licences and no criminal record, said authorities. One former neighbour said twice-divorced Paddock was ""weird"". But his brother described him as a regular guy who liked playing video poker, live music and eating burritos. Is the gunman a terrorist? What we know so far Who are the victims? Paddock has been identified by police as the man behind the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history, with the death toll surpassing the 49 killed at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June 2016. He opened fire from the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino on Sunday night, killing 58 people and wounding almost 500 others, before turning the gun on himself as police closed in, said officials. Police shared this updated timeline of events on Wednesday Stephen Paddock had a troubled childhood, with a bank robber for a father, who regularly beat him, and a mother who struggled to bring him and his three brothers up, according to reports. One of the gunman's brothers, Eric Paddock, told reporters the family were stunned. ""He liked to play video poker,"" he said. ""He went on cruises. He sent his mother cookies."" Their father was once on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list. This video can not be played What gunfire tells us about weapons used Twenty-three weapons were found in the 32nd-floor hotel room that Paddock checked into last Thursday. Police found ""in excess of"" 19 firearms and thousands of rounds of ammunition in his Mesquite home, within a quiet retirement community 80 miles (130km) north-east of Las Vegas. They also found several pounds of an explosive called tannerite, and ammonium nitrate, a type of fertiliser used as an explosive, in his car. From 1976 to 1985 worked as a postman, an Internal Revenue Service agent and an auditor for the Defense Contract Audit Agency Worked for the predecessor company of Lockheed Martin in the 80s Maintained relations with his younger brother Eric but estranged from older brothers Bruce and Patrick Grew up in Sun Valley, California, and attended California State University in Northridge He was married twice and had no children Sources: US media reports Police said no manifesto or anything else had been discovered to explain Paddock's actions. ""I can't get into the mind of a psychopath at this point,"" Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said. The FBI said its agents had established no connection between Paddock and any overseas terrorist group, despite so-called Islamic State describing him as a ""soldier of the caliphate"". Paddock only previous known brush with the law was a routine traffic violation. This video can not be played How the horror unfolded David Famiglietti, of the New Frontier Armory, told the BBC that Paddock had purchased firearms at his store in north Las Vegas last spring, meeting all state and federal requirements, including an FBI background check. However, the shotgun and rifle Paddock bought would not have been ""capable of what we've seen and heard in the video without modification"", Mr Famiglietti said. Country music stars react Five reasons US gun control won't happen Two gun stocks were found in the hotel room, AP news agency reported, which can enable a weapon to fire hundreds of shots per minute. This video can not be played Eric Paddock says he is in total shock after police named his brother, Stephen, as the shooter According to NBC News,external, Paddock recently made several gambling transactions in the tens of thousands of dollars, but it was unclear if those bets were wins or losses. Bruce Paddock told NBC his brother was a multi-millionaire property investor. This video can not be played Trump on Las Vegas shooting: 'It was an act of pure evil' He had shown no sign of financial problems and reports said he owned a number of properties that he rented out. Separately, Eric Paddock said that Stephen came up with the cash to ensure that family members - including their elderly mother - were provided for. ""Steve took care of the people he loved. He helped make me and my family wealthy. He's the reason I was able to retire. This is the Steve we know, we knew. The people he loved and took care of,""Eric Paddock said in a news conference, according to CBS News,external. He described his brother as ""intelligent"" and ""successful."" This video can not be played Witnesses say people were being trampled Stephen Paddock moved to his two-storey house in Mesquite from Reno, Nevada, in June 2016. He lived in the property in Babbling Brook Court with his girlfriendMarilou Danley, 62. What do we know about Marilou Danley? Police have ruled out any involvement by Ms Danley, who was overseas at the time of the massacre but has nowreturned to the US, where she is facing questioning. She is an Australian citizen who moved to Nevada 20 years ago, the government in Canberra said. Marilou Danley, initially described as a person of interest, was located by police outside of the US A former neighbour, Diane McKay, 79,told the Washington Post,externalthe couple always kept the blinds closed at home. ""He was weird,"" she said. ""Kept to himself. It was like living next to nothing. ""You can at least be grumpy, something. He was just nothing, quiet."" Elsewhere the newspaper quoted neighbours in ""several states"" where Paddock owned retirement homes, describing him as ""surly, unfriendly and standoffish"". But those who lived close to a house he owned in Melbourne, Florida, have described him as ""very friendly"". According to US media, Paddock had a licence to fly small planes and owned two aircraft. In 2012, he filed a negligence lawsuit against The Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas, after a fall he said was caused by an ""obstruction"" on the floor, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported. The legal action was reportedly dropped in 2014. The relative lack of red flags in Paddock's personal history has only heightened the sense of bewilderment as a shocked nation asks: Why?

"Three scientists who unravelled how our bodies tell time have won the 2017 Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine. The body clock - or circadian rhythm - is the reason we want to sleep at night, but it also drives huge changes in behaviour and body function. The US scientists Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young will share the prize. The Nobel prize committee said their findings had ""vast implications for our health and wellbeing"". A clock ticks in nearly every cell of the human body, as well as in plants, animals and fungi. Our mood, hormone levels, body temperature and metabolism all fluctuate in a daily rhythm. Even our risk of a heart attack soars every morning as our body gets the engine running to start a new day. The body clock so precisely controls our body to match day and night that disrupting it can have profound implications. The ghastly experience of jet lag is caused by the body being out of sync with the world around it. In the short term, body clock disruption affects memory formation, but in the long term it increases the risk of diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cancer and heart disease. ""If we screw that system up we have a big impact on our metabolism,"" said Prof Russell Foster, a body clock scientist at the University of Oxford. He told the BBC he was ""very delighted"" that the US trio had won, saying they deserved the prize for being the first to explain how the system worked. He added: ""They have shown us how molecular clocks are built across all the animal kingdom."" Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash and Michael Young have won the highest accolade in science. The trio's breakthroughs were on fruit flies, but their findings explain how ""molecular feedback loops"" keep time in all animals. Jeffrey Hall and Michael Rosbash isolated a section of DNA called theperiodgene, which had been implicated in the circadian rhythm. Theperiodgene contained instructions for making a protein called PER. As levels of PER increased, it turned off its own genetic instructions. As a result, levels of the PER protein oscillate over a 24-hour cycle - rising during the night and falling during the day. Michael Young discovered a gene calledtimelessand another one calleddoubletime. They both affect the stability of PER. If PER is more stable then the clock ticks more slowly, if it is less stable then it runs too fast. The stability of PER is one reason some of us are morning larks and others are night owls. Together, they had uncovered the workings of the molecular clock inside the fly's cells. Dr Michael Hastings, who researches circadian timing at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, told the BBC: ""Before this work in fruit flies we really didn't have any ideas of the genetic mechanism - body clocks were viewed as a black box on a par with astrology."" He said the award was a ""fantastic"" decision. He added: ""We encounter the body clock when we experience jet lag and we appreciate it's debilitating for a short time, but the real public health issue is rotational shift work - it's a constant state of jet lag.""

"This video can not be played Eyewitness Anthony Biscardi recalls the moment a prop collapsed on US rockstar Manson Rock star Marilyn Manson is recuperating at home after a stage accident in which he was crushed by a prop, his spokesman has told the BBC. The prop - apparently two large guns held together with metal scaffolding - fell as he was performing at New York's Hammerstein Ballroom. An eyewitness said Manson lay on stage for up to 15 minutes before he was taken to hospital on a stretcher. The singer has cancelled nine dates of his US tour after Saturday's incident.

""Towards the middle of the song it seemed as though he tried climbing onto a prop. ""The first touch of weight on those poles and it came crashing down onto him."" In videos of the incident posted online, stage crew and band members can be seen lifting the prop off the singer but he does not get back up. ""He was pretty limp, almost as though he was unconscious,"" Mr Biscardi said.

And on Wall Street - US stock markets have finished at fresh records following strong economic data and hopes of another strong 
quarter of corporate earnings reports. All three major indices ended at all-time highs. The Dow Jones 
Industrial Average jumped 0.7% to 22,557.
      The broader S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 2,529, while the tech-rich 
Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.3% to 6,517. Away from the Monarch collapse - there's been an update in the US over the giant Equifax data breach. The credit agency's security team failed to 
patch a vulnerability in March after getting a warning about the flaw, opening 
up the firm to a breach affecting 143 million people, the former chief 
executive says. Richard Smith, in a statement to a congressional committee 
released on Monday, offered a timeline of the huge cyber attack. He said in the prepared remarks that the company disseminated an internal memo on 9 March warning about a software flaw identified by the 
government's Computer Emergency Response Team. He added that Equifax policy would have required a patch to be applied 
within 48 hours, but this was not done. Mr Smith could not explain why. And here's some more reaction to Monarch going out of business in the UK's biggest ever airline collapse. Here's how customers at Birmingham airport reacted... This video can not be played Monarch passengers left 'gutted' at Birmingham Airport Business live has been flooded with tales of woe from Monarch travellers, but let's not forgot the staff who have lost their jobs. A reader writes: ""Today, my 20-year-old brother came off his night flight
and woke up to an email about a meeting. In this meeting staff were told they
were no longer Monarch employees and were being made redundant. No 'thank you' or your service, no apology, just - ""we advise you to go to the job centre and
sign on"". ""My brother is devastated to lose a job
he worked so hard for and served his second summer season this year with the
company. He has friends that were taken on just a few months ago for the summer
season, moving to Birmingham from as far as Scotland only to be let down and
left without redundancy money. ""For the company to keep this a secret
from the staff and for them to wake up with no job this morning is disgusting.
Even if they had been given a warning, some may have been able to look for new
jobs or at least get a head start on it. ""I feel so sorry for all the staff,
they have been mistreated and deceived and are now left with nothing. Summer
season is over now, so other airlines may not have vacancies until next sumner.
What are they supposed to do in the meantime?""  Let's check in with the US stock markets... It's turning into another record day on Wall Street with the three main indexes hitting fresh highs. Stronger US manufacturing data was behind the increase. With about 30 minutes to go before the closing bell, the Dow Jones was up 0.6% at 22,541 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.23% to 6,511, and S&P was 0.3% ahead at 2,527.  The personal information of
two individuals was compromised in a recently uncovered hack of
a Securities and Exchange Commission database, according to the financial regulator's chairman. Jay Clayton (above) said in a statement on Monday that
additional forensic analysis has found that the Social Security
numbers, dates of birth, and names of two individuals were made
available to the hackers after they breached the SEC's corporate
filing system known as EDGAR. He had previously said no personally identifiable
information had been accessed in the breach, which occurred in
2016. US Homeland Security has found critical breaches in the SEC's computer security, sparking suggestions that hackers could have had access to corporate announcements before they were formally released. Radio 4 PM This video can not be played The Civil Aviation Authority has begun flying Monarch passengers back to the UK, after the airline collapsed in the early hours of Monday morning. About 860 thousand people have lost bookings with 110 thousand of them currently overseas. Between 2004 and 2011 Tim Jeans was Managing Director of Monarch airlines. He told Radio 4's PM programme that Monarch realised ""a little bit too late"" about the competition from EasyJet and Ryanair. He added ""people wanted the lowest fare - they might have loved the meals, loved the glass of wine, but the reality was they would not pay for it."" Emma SimpsonBusiness correspondent, BBC News Southwark Crown Court
has heard of the ""frenetic"" last weeks in August 2014 when it was
widely known there was a gap in Tesco's accounts which was spiralling out of
control. Tesco's former UK managing director, Chris Bush, its former finance director, Carl Rogberg, and
its ex-UK commercial food director, John Scouler, are all charged with fraud
and false accounting in connection with the retailer's Â£250m accounting
scandal. The prosecution
counsel, Sasha Wass, QC, has been outlining the timeline leading up to Tesco's
dramatic announcement that it had overstated its profits in September 2014. The court heard that
although it was known that ""aggressive"" targets were not going to be
met, the accused carried on "" conniving and manipulating the figures""
by incorrectly encouraging others to ""pull forward"" income and that
they must have been fully aware of the damaging effects this practice was
having on the financial health of the company. The prosecution said
that the attempts to plug the financial hole were like a ""hamster running
around on the wheel"". The court heard that
the accused continually refused to deal with the growing problem and that Mr
Rogberg, allegedly told a ""bare faced lie"" to a senior colleague,
when questioned about a potential shortfall. And the court heard
the lead up to every half year deadline was known as ""diving for the
line"". It emerged that the
former Tesco chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, will be a witness for the
prosecution. The three defendants
deny the charges. The prosecution is expected to finish its opening statement
tomorrow. The demise of Monarch will mean 1,858 job losses, the administrators have confirmed. KMPG said that of these, 1,760 were employees of Monarch Airlines, while 98 were employed by
Monarch Travel Group. Between
them the companies employed about 2,100 people. The remainder have been kept on to help with the repatriation process and other admin issues. KPMG said in a statement this evening: âRegrettably,
with the business no longer able to fly, a significant number of redundancies
were made. âOver
the coming days, my team will be doing all it can to assist the employees in
submitting claims to the Redundancy Payments Office for monies owed."" Aviation regulator the CAA estimates the
repatriation of Monarch customers to the UK will cost about Â£60m. That will come from
government funding, it says. About 12,000 Monarch customers flew back to the UK today. The CAA has also listed by country the likely number of travellers to be repatriated by the end of this week. The vast majority, 32,503 people, will be brought back from Spain and the Canary Islands. From Portugal, it is 9,553, from Italy 3,661, and Croatia 2,086. In all 56,120 Monarch customers from 11 countries are expected to by repatriated by the end of the week, the CAA says.   Investors know how to spot a silver lining, and on the FTSE 100 today it was EasyJet. The airline's shares closed more than 5% up on expectation it would be a beneficiary of Monarch's demise. British Airways' owner IAG rose 2.36%, while in Dublin Ryanair closed 3.87% ahead. Elsewhere on the FTSE 100, which finished up 0.9% up at 7,438.8 points, housebuilders Barratt and Persimmon each rose more than 4% after the government announced more money for its Help to Buy scheme. Simon JackBBC Business Editor One thing that
Monarch lacked was scale. Its fleet of thirty or so aircraft was dwarfed by competitors like EasyJet and Ryanair which have 200 and 300 respectively. When terror
attacks in Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey saw the industry refocus on the Western
Mediterranean, competiton became intense and prices fell. Monarch could not
achieve the economies of scale the big players could. Management
realised this and made progress on tie ups with several interested parties.
Company sources tell me that those talks were derailed by uncertainty
surrounding the future regulation of the UK aviation industry thrown up by the
Brexit vote. The fall in the
value of the pound after the vote also pushed up the cost of fuel and aircraft
leases which were priced in dollars adding Â£50m per year to their costs. It was operating
in a viciously competitive market, it was too small to absorb any additional
costs and potential partners wanted to wait for more clarity on post-Brexit
airline regulation. Brexit didnât
kill Monarch on its own, but it added cost and helped shut off some of its
potential escape routes. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has dismissed suggestions Monarch's crisis is part of wider problems with Britain's aviation sector. Far from it, he told the Tory party conference, Monarch was a casualty of the success of its rivals. He says: ""As soon as
it became apparent that the airline was struggling we acted quickly. We
are today mounting the biggest civilian repatriation exercise this country has
seen in peacetime and we will bringing back 100,000 people who are stranded
overseas. ""And weâve
spoken to all the other airlines and asked them to do what they can to make
sure people affected can rebook their trips elsewhere as quickly as possible. ""But let
nobody think this is a sign of general problems in our aviation sector. Monarch
has been a victim of the success of other airlines, like Easyjet and Jet 2.
This summer most of our airports carried more passengers than ever
before. ""And
they did so because of the success of our economy. We have a great record to
build on.""   For everyone still tearing their hair out about their rights following the Monarch crisis,here's a link to our feature. Consumer champion Martin Lewis has also tweeted some usual advice, below. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has asked airlines not to exploit the Monarch crisis by raising prices, according to his PR team. A Department for Transport spokesman says he has ""asked all airlines to keep their prices reasonable for passengers
affected"". The spokesman added: ""We expect airlines, irrespective of whether they are members, to honour the
International Air Transport Association agreement to make their best efforts to
help passengers stranded away from home. ""These passengers should be provided access to discounted 'rescue fares',
subject to available capacity, for up to two weeks after the event to anywhere
within Europe."" BBC Newsbeat reporter tweets: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Away from Monarch for a moment, here's our usual update on the start of trading on Wall Street. The week has begun well, with the three major US share indexes hitting record highs at the open on hopes of progress on President Donald Trump's
tax reform plan. The Dow Jones was up 15.59 points,
or 0.07%, at 22,420.6, the S&P 500 was up 1.53
points, or 0.06%, at 2,520.89, and the Nasdaq was up 10.21 points, or 0.16%, at 6,506.17. Alan Jee and his fiancee - and 30 friends and family - were about to board a Monarch plane bound for the Canaries for their wedding on Saturday. ""We went past passport
control, then five minutes before we were due to go on the plane they just put
an (announcement) out saying everything's been cancelled and if we want to get
flights anywhere else we have to pay for them ourselves,"" says Mr Jee, from Dorset. There were plenty of tears, he tells the Press Association. ""They (Monarch) are doing absolutely nothing about it whatsoever, they've
palmed us off. No-one's told us anything about it; we've tried speaking to Monarch."" They've found alternative flights on Wednesday, but at up to Â£400 each. ""I've spent nearly Â£20,000 on the wedding as it is. I don't know
how they can treat people like that. We've got wedding planners to see, hair and make-up, bits and pieces - we
can't get out there to do them.""   Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.99737763

"British airline Monarch has collapsed, leaving 110,000 passengers abroad and around 750,000 people with flights they have paid for, but will not be able to take. Monarch's administrators, KPMG, said that the ""vast majority"" of people should get their money back in one way or another. Full details of customers' rights are available on the dedicated website:monarch.caa.co.uk,external However here are some of the answers to the most common questions. TheAtol scheme,externalrefunds customers if a travel firm collapses and ensures those holidaymakers are not stranded. However, while Monarch package holidays are protected by the Atol scheme, those who booked flights only are NOT protected. This is because Monarch withdrew from flight-only protection last year. Monarch ceases trading Passengers'anger However most of those who booked a flight only will still be flown home by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), along with those who are fully Atol-protected. The CAA is the UK aviation regulator, and administers the Air Travel Organisers Licence (Atol) scheme. The CAA says customers currently overseas should check monarch.caa.co.uk for confirmation of their new flight details - which will be available a minimum of 48 hours in advance of their original departure time. You will be covered by the CAA rescue scheme, provided your return flight to the UK is on or before 15 October. If you were on a Monarch package holiday, your booking is Atol-protected, and therefore you will be flown home free of charge. If you had booked a flight only, you are not entitled to that, so you will have to make your own arrangements to fly home. You will then need to try and reclaim your money, using one of the methods listed below. Holidaymakers who bought a package holiday through Monarch will be Atol-protected, and will get their tickets refunded. The CAA says that roughly half of those with future bookings are in this position, with the other half having booked flights only. Most of those on flight-only bookings will need to seek a refund themselves - see below. The only exception to this is if you booked your flight before 16 December 2016. In that case your flight is likely to be Atol-protected and you could receive a refund. In most cases, the Atol protection on package deals will be provided by a company other than Monarch - usually the firm providing the holiday element of the package. But passengers due a refund may have to wait for some time. ""Experience suggests this will take weeks or months rather than days,"" according to the Independent's travel editor, Simon Calder. ""They will get the money back, but in the meantime the cost of their holiday will have increased."" Under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, anyone who booked flights costing more than Â£100 will get their money back automatically from their credit card provider. However, each single flight needs to cost more than Â£100. So if you booked five flights, each of which cost Â£99, you would not be covered under the act. If you paid less than Â£100 per seat, you can still use the Chargeback process, described below. In many cases debit cards, such as those issued by Visa, Mastercard or American Express, will also cover the loss, under what is known as theChargeback,externalscheme. But, unlike with credit cards, you do not have a legal right to a refund. There is a 120 day limit on Chargeback claims - from the day you found out your flight was cancelled. UK Finance is advising those who paid in this way to contact their bank. The bank will then apply to the administrators, KPMG, for a refund, but may give you your money back anyway. While some airlines still charge extra for using a credit card, Monarch abandoned that policy last year, meaning a higher proportion of its customers may have booked with a credit card, giving them extra protection. Paypal has its own buyer protection programme, to cover consumers when they do not receive the goods or services they have paid for. However in normal circumstances there is a 180-day deadline from the payment date to claim for this. This suggests that anyone who bought their tickets more than six months ago may not be able to get a refund. However Paypal said it would take the specific circumstances of Monarch's collapse into account. It expects most people to get their money back. Anyone who bought their tickets through Paypal Credit - a separate product - has section 75 protection anyway. This will depend very much on the terms and conditions of the insurance. Most policies do not cover airline failure as a standard part of the cover. Blair Nimmo an administrator with KPMG told the BBC: ""The Atol scheme protects the package holidays. If you're on a flight only then you will tend to more rely on your credit or debit card provider or perhaps travel insurance."" The rules are ""relatively complicated depending on your specific circumstances, he added, but ""we would very much hope that the vast majority, if not everyone would get their money back"". Passengers unable to claim any money back will remain as creditors of the collapsed company, but they will be well down the queue for compensation.

"This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes At least 59 people have been killed and another 527 injured in a mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert. A gunman, named as 64-year-old Nevada resident Stephen Paddock, opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel towards an open-air music festival attended by 22,000. He killed himself as police stormed the room where 10 guns were found. Investigators have found no link to international terrorism, despite a claim from so-called Islamic State. In an address from the White House, President Donald Trump described the attack as ""pure evil"". He praised the efforts of the emergency services, saying their ""miraculous"" speed saved lives, and announced he would be visiting Las Vegas on Wednesday. With First Lady Melania by his side, he later observed a moment of silence on the White House lawn. This video can not be played A police scanner captures the moment police burst into gunman's room The final shows of the three-day Route 91 country music festival were in full swing when the gunman struck. Thousands were enjoying a performance by top-billing singer Jason Aldean when the first of several bursts of automatic gunfire rang out - hundreds of shots, witnesses say. That was late on Sunday night - 22:08 local time (05:08 GMT on Monday). Hundreds of concert-goers scrambled for cover, flattening themselves against the ground, rushing for the exits or helping others to escape as Paddock sprayed the site from his high vantage point. What the witnesses saw In pictures: Vegas shooting Hundreds of concert-goers fled the scene or ducked for cover amid heavy gunfire ""One man had blood all over him and that's when I knew something was seriously wrong,"" Mike Thompson from London, told the BBC. ""People were running and there was chaos."" Concert-goer Mike McGarry, who survived, told Reuters he lay on top of his children when the shots rang out. ""They're 20, I'm 53. I lived a good life,"" he said. Many hotels on the Las Vegas strip close to the scene were placed on police lockdown and parts of Las Vegas Boulevard were shut. Aldean, who was rushed off-stage, shared his reactionon Instagram,external. ""Tonight has been beyond horrific,"" he wrote. Las Vegas police say the number of people injured stands at 515. Las Vegas shooting - what we know The fake photos shared after tragedies Suspected gunman Stephen Paddock - undated image Stephen Paddock, from a community of senior citizens in the small town of Mesquite north-east of Las Vegas, booked into the hotel on 28 September, police say. His motives for carrying out the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history remain a mystery. Some investigators have suggested psychological issues, but there is no confirmation of this. His brother, Eric, is dumbfounded that he acted this way. This video can not be played Eric Paddock says he is in total shock after police named his brother, Stephen, as the shooter Las Vegas Sheriff Joe Lombardo described the shooting as a ""lone wolf"" attack. ""We have no idea what his belief system was,"" he said. So-called Islamic State (IS) has claimed to be behind the attack, saying that Paddock had converted to Islam some months ago. But the group provided no evidence for this and has made unsubstantiated claims in the past. FBI Special Agent Aaron Rouse told a news conference: ""We have determined at this point no connection to an international terrorist organisation."" IS's claim of responsibility for the Las Vegas attack is very unusual in that the perpetrator's profile does not fit that of supporters or ""soldiers"" that the group has claimed in the past, writes Mina al-Lami, who monitors jihadist groups for the BBC. If true, his suicide would be deemed wholly ""un-Islamic"", she adds. Jihadist suicides involve the assailant blowing himself up in order to kill those around him. What we know about the gunman A couple at the concert take cover after gunfire was heard at country music festival The investigation continues to gather pace, with searches at Paddock's Mesquite home, where more weapons were found, and a second property. Paddock lived in Mesquite with Marilou Danley. Police have interviewed her but say she does not appear to have been involved as she was out of the country. They are hoping to speak to her again. Police say he used some of her identity documents to check in to the Mandalay Bay. The authorities have yet to confirm the identities of any of the 58 killed. Jordan McIldoon, 23, from British Columbia in Canada, has been identified as a victim of the attack byCBC News,external. 'We helped three victims' A nurse, Sonny Melton, of Big Sandy, Tennessee, has been named as another victim byThe Jackson Sun,externalnewspaper. In a Facebook post, his wife, Dr Heather Gulish Melton, said she ""lost my true love and knight in shining armor. I appreciate the prayers but I just need some time."" An off-duty Las Vegas police officer was another of those who died. More on the victims By the BBC's James Cook in Las Vegas The scenes which played out in this stunned city were at once frantically urgent and wearily familiar. When gunfire rings out, Americans know the drill. Run. They fled from a gunman who left a city in chaos. For a time, Las Vegas looked and felt like a war zone. Hospitals were overwhelmed. There were not enough ambulances. A plea for blood donations echoed across the airwaves. And now the mourning, the relief, the tears, the elation, the grief and a hundred other emotions are barely beginning. Doctors are still battling to save lives. For a Western democracy, the United States has seen an astonishing amount of horror like this. But even for this country what happened here is carnage on a different scale. America's mass shooting disease now feels like a plague. Nevada has some of the least stringent gun laws in the United States. People are allowed to carry weapons and do not have to register themselves as a gun-owner. Background checks are done when people buy guns, but they are also allowed to sell them privately. Former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a shooting six years ago, called for political leaders in Washington to introduce tougher gun laws following the Las Vegas attack. Her husband Mark Kelly read out a joint statement on the steps of the Capitol saying thoughts and prayers from the White House were not enough to stop the next shooting.

"British airline Monarch has collapsed, leaving 110,000 passengers abroad and around 750,000 people with flights they have paid for, but will not be able to take. Monarch's administrators, KPMG, said that the ""vast majority"" of people should get their money back in one way or another. Full details of customers' rights are available on the dedicated website:monarch.caa.co.uk,external However here are some of the answers to the most common questions. TheAtol scheme,externalrefunds customers if a travel firm collapses and ensures those holidaymakers are not stranded. However, while Monarch package holidays are protected by the Atol scheme, those who booked flights only are NOT protected. This is because Monarch withdrew from flight-only protection last year. Monarch ceases trading Passengers'anger However most of those who booked a flight only will still be flown home by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), along with those who are fully Atol-protected. The CAA is the UK aviation regulator, and administers the Air Travel Organisers Licence (Atol) scheme. The CAA says customers currently overseas should check monarch.caa.co.uk for confirmation of their new flight details - which will be available a minimum of 48 hours in advance of their original departure time. You will be covered by the CAA rescue scheme, provided your return flight to the UK is on or before 15 October. If you were on a Monarch package holiday, your booking is Atol-protected, and therefore you will be flown home free of charge. If you had booked a flight only, you are not entitled to that, so you will have to make your own arrangements to fly home. You will then need to try and reclaim your money, using one of the methods listed below. Holidaymakers who bought a package holiday through Monarch will be Atol-protected, and will get their tickets refunded. The CAA says that roughly half of those with future bookings are in this position, with the other half having booked flights only. Most of those on flight-only bookings will need to seek a refund themselves - see below. The only exception to this is if you booked your flight before 16 December 2016. In that case your flight is likely to be Atol-protected and you could receive a refund. In most cases, the Atol protection on package deals will be provided by a company other than Monarch - usually the firm providing the holiday element of the package. But passengers due a refund may have to wait for some time. ""Experience suggests this will take weeks or months rather than days,"" according to the Independent's travel editor, Simon Calder. ""They will get the money back, but in the meantime the cost of their holiday will have increased."" Under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act, anyone who booked flights costing more than Â£100 will get their money back automatically from their credit card provider. However, each single flight needs to cost more than Â£100. So if you booked five flights, each of which cost Â£99, you would not be covered under the act. If you paid less than Â£100 per seat, you can still use the Chargeback process, described below. In many cases debit cards, such as those issued by Visa, Mastercard or American Express, will also cover the loss, under what is known as theChargeback,externalscheme. But, unlike with credit cards, you do not have a legal right to a refund. There is a 120 day limit on Chargeback claims - from the day you found out your flight was cancelled. UK Finance is advising those who paid in this way to contact their bank. The bank will then apply to the administrators, KPMG, for a refund, but may give you your money back anyway. While some airlines still charge extra for using a credit card, Monarch abandoned that policy last year, meaning a higher proportion of its customers may have booked with a credit card, giving them extra protection. Paypal has its own buyer protection programme, to cover consumers when they do not receive the goods or services they have paid for. However in normal circumstances there is a 180-day deadline from the payment date to claim for this. This suggests that anyone who bought their tickets more than six months ago may not be able to get a refund. However Paypal said it would take the specific circumstances of Monarch's collapse into account. It expects most people to get their money back. Anyone who bought their tickets through Paypal Credit - a separate product - has section 75 protection anyway. This will depend very much on the terms and conditions of the insurance. Most policies do not cover airline failure as a standard part of the cover. Blair Nimmo an administrator with KPMG told the BBC: ""The Atol scheme protects the package holidays. If you're on a flight only then you will tend to more rely on your credit or debit card provider or perhaps travel insurance."" The rules are ""relatively complicated depending on your specific circumstances, he added, but ""we would very much hope that the vast majority, if not everyone would get their money back"". Passengers unable to claim any money back will remain as creditors of the collapsed company, but they will be well down the queue for compensation.

And on Wall Street - US stock markets have finished at fresh records following strong economic data and hopes of another strong 
quarter of corporate earnings reports. All three major indices ended at all-time highs. The Dow Jones 
Industrial Average jumped 0.7% to 22,557.
      The broader S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 2,529, while the tech-rich 
Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.3% to 6,517. Away from the Monarch collapse - there's been an update in the US over the giant Equifax data breach. The credit agency's security team failed to 
patch a vulnerability in March after getting a warning about the flaw, opening 
up the firm to a breach affecting 143 million people, the former chief 
executive says. Richard Smith, in a statement to a congressional committee 
released on Monday, offered a timeline of the huge cyber attack. He said in the prepared remarks that the company disseminated an internal memo on 9 March warning about a software flaw identified by the 
government's Computer Emergency Response Team. He added that Equifax policy would have required a patch to be applied 
within 48 hours, but this was not done. Mr Smith could not explain why. And here's some more reaction to Monarch going out of business in the UK's biggest ever airline collapse. Here's how customers at Birmingham airport reacted... This video can not be played Monarch passengers left 'gutted' at Birmingham Airport Business live has been flooded with tales of woe from Monarch travellers, but let's not forgot the staff who have lost their jobs. A reader writes: ""Today, my 20-year-old brother came off his night flight
and woke up to an email about a meeting. In this meeting staff were told they
were no longer Monarch employees and were being made redundant. No 'thank you' or your service, no apology, just - ""we advise you to go to the job centre and
sign on"". ""My brother is devastated to lose a job
he worked so hard for and served his second summer season this year with the
company. He has friends that were taken on just a few months ago for the summer
season, moving to Birmingham from as far as Scotland only to be let down and
left without redundancy money. ""For the company to keep this a secret
from the staff and for them to wake up with no job this morning is disgusting.
Even if they had been given a warning, some may have been able to look for new
jobs or at least get a head start on it. ""I feel so sorry for all the staff,
they have been mistreated and deceived and are now left with nothing. Summer
season is over now, so other airlines may not have vacancies until next sumner.
What are they supposed to do in the meantime?""  Let's check in with the US stock markets... It's turning into another record day on Wall Street with the three main indexes hitting fresh highs. Stronger US manufacturing data was behind the increase. With about 30 minutes to go before the closing bell, the Dow Jones was up 0.6% at 22,541 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.23% to 6,511, and S&P was 0.3% ahead at 2,527.  The personal information of
two individuals was compromised in a recently uncovered hack of
a Securities and Exchange Commission database, according to the financial regulator's chairman. Jay Clayton (above) said in a statement on Monday that
additional forensic analysis has found that the Social Security
numbers, dates of birth, and names of two individuals were made
available to the hackers after they breached the SEC's corporate
filing system known as EDGAR. He had previously said no personally identifiable
information had been accessed in the breach, which occurred in
2016. US Homeland Security has found critical breaches in the SEC's computer security, sparking suggestions that hackers could have had access to corporate announcements before they were formally released. Radio 4 PM This video can not be played The Civil Aviation Authority has begun flying Monarch passengers back to the UK, after the airline collapsed in the early hours of Monday morning. About 860 thousand people have lost bookings with 110 thousand of them currently overseas. Between 2004 and 2011 Tim Jeans was Managing Director of Monarch airlines. He told Radio 4's PM programme that Monarch realised ""a little bit too late"" about the competition from EasyJet and Ryanair. He added ""people wanted the lowest fare - they might have loved the meals, loved the glass of wine, but the reality was they would not pay for it."" Emma SimpsonBusiness correspondent, BBC News Southwark Crown Court
has heard of the ""frenetic"" last weeks in August 2014 when it was
widely known there was a gap in Tesco's accounts which was spiralling out of
control. Tesco's former UK managing director, Chris Bush, its former finance director, Carl Rogberg, and
its ex-UK commercial food director, John Scouler, are all charged with fraud
and false accounting in connection with the retailer's Â£250m accounting
scandal. The prosecution
counsel, Sasha Wass, QC, has been outlining the timeline leading up to Tesco's
dramatic announcement that it had overstated its profits in September 2014. The court heard that
although it was known that ""aggressive"" targets were not going to be
met, the accused carried on "" conniving and manipulating the figures""
by incorrectly encouraging others to ""pull forward"" income and that
they must have been fully aware of the damaging effects this practice was
having on the financial health of the company. The prosecution said
that the attempts to plug the financial hole were like a ""hamster running
around on the wheel"". The court heard that
the accused continually refused to deal with the growing problem and that Mr
Rogberg, allegedly told a ""bare faced lie"" to a senior colleague,
when questioned about a potential shortfall. And the court heard
the lead up to every half year deadline was known as ""diving for the
line"". It emerged that the
former Tesco chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, will be a witness for the
prosecution. The three defendants
deny the charges. The prosecution is expected to finish its opening statement
tomorrow. The demise of Monarch will mean 1,858 job losses, the administrators have confirmed. KMPG said that of these, 1,760 were employees of Monarch Airlines, while 98 were employed by
Monarch Travel Group. Between
them the companies employed about 2,100 people. The remainder have been kept on to help with the repatriation process and other admin issues. KPMG said in a statement this evening: âRegrettably,
with the business no longer able to fly, a significant number of redundancies
were made. âOver
the coming days, my team will be doing all it can to assist the employees in
submitting claims to the Redundancy Payments Office for monies owed."" Aviation regulator the CAA estimates the
repatriation of Monarch customers to the UK will cost about Â£60m. That will come from
government funding, it says. About 12,000 Monarch customers flew back to the UK today. The CAA has also listed by country the likely number of travellers to be repatriated by the end of this week. The vast majority, 32,503 people, will be brought back from Spain and the Canary Islands. From Portugal, it is 9,553, from Italy 3,661, and Croatia 2,086. In all 56,120 Monarch customers from 11 countries are expected to by repatriated by the end of the week, the CAA says.   Investors know how to spot a silver lining, and on the FTSE 100 today it was EasyJet. The airline's shares closed more than 5% up on expectation it would be a beneficiary of Monarch's demise. British Airways' owner IAG rose 2.36%, while in Dublin Ryanair closed 3.87% ahead. Elsewhere on the FTSE 100, which finished up 0.9% up at 7,438.8 points, housebuilders Barratt and Persimmon each rose more than 4% after the government announced more money for its Help to Buy scheme. Simon JackBBC Business Editor One thing that
Monarch lacked was scale. Its fleet of thirty or so aircraft was dwarfed by competitors like EasyJet and Ryanair which have 200 and 300 respectively. When terror
attacks in Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey saw the industry refocus on the Western
Mediterranean, competiton became intense and prices fell. Monarch could not
achieve the economies of scale the big players could. Management
realised this and made progress on tie ups with several interested parties.
Company sources tell me that those talks were derailed by uncertainty
surrounding the future regulation of the UK aviation industry thrown up by the
Brexit vote. The fall in the
value of the pound after the vote also pushed up the cost of fuel and aircraft
leases which were priced in dollars adding Â£50m per year to their costs. It was operating
in a viciously competitive market, it was too small to absorb any additional
costs and potential partners wanted to wait for more clarity on post-Brexit
airline regulation. Brexit didnât
kill Monarch on its own, but it added cost and helped shut off some of its
potential escape routes. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has dismissed suggestions Monarch's crisis is part of wider problems with Britain's aviation sector. Far from it, he told the Tory party conference, Monarch was a casualty of the success of its rivals. He says: ""As soon as
it became apparent that the airline was struggling we acted quickly. We
are today mounting the biggest civilian repatriation exercise this country has
seen in peacetime and we will bringing back 100,000 people who are stranded
overseas. ""And weâve
spoken to all the other airlines and asked them to do what they can to make
sure people affected can rebook their trips elsewhere as quickly as possible. ""But let
nobody think this is a sign of general problems in our aviation sector. Monarch
has been a victim of the success of other airlines, like Easyjet and Jet 2.
This summer most of our airports carried more passengers than ever
before. ""And
they did so because of the success of our economy. We have a great record to
build on.""   For everyone still tearing their hair out about their rights following the Monarch crisis,here's a link to our feature. Consumer champion Martin Lewis has also tweeted some usual advice, below. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has asked airlines not to exploit the Monarch crisis by raising prices, according to his PR team. A Department for Transport spokesman says he has ""asked all airlines to keep their prices reasonable for passengers
affected"". The spokesman added: ""We expect airlines, irrespective of whether they are members, to honour the
International Air Transport Association agreement to make their best efforts to
help passengers stranded away from home. ""These passengers should be provided access to discounted 'rescue fares',
subject to available capacity, for up to two weeks after the event to anywhere
within Europe."" BBC Newsbeat reporter tweets: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Away from Monarch for a moment, here's our usual update on the start of trading on Wall Street. The week has begun well, with the three major US share indexes hitting record highs at the open on hopes of progress on President Donald Trump's
tax reform plan. The Dow Jones was up 15.59 points,
or 0.07%, at 22,420.6, the S&P 500 was up 1.53
points, or 0.06%, at 2,520.89, and the Nasdaq was up 10.21 points, or 0.16%, at 6,506.17. Alan Jee and his fiancee - and 30 friends and family - were about to board a Monarch plane bound for the Canaries for their wedding on Saturday. ""We went past passport
control, then five minutes before we were due to go on the plane they just put
an (announcement) out saying everything's been cancelled and if we want to get
flights anywhere else we have to pay for them ourselves,"" says Mr Jee, from Dorset. There were plenty of tears, he tells the Press Association. ""They (Monarch) are doing absolutely nothing about it whatsoever, they've
palmed us off. No-one's told us anything about it; we've tried speaking to Monarch."" They've found alternative flights on Wednesday, but at up to Â£400 each. ""I've spent nearly Â£20,000 on the wedding as it is. I don't know
how they can treat people like that. We've got wedding planners to see, hair and make-up, bits and pieces - we
can't get out there to do them.""   Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,1.4769345e-08
"Several locations in the Canadian city were cordoned off by police during the manhunt A Somali-born refugee has been arrested in connection with attacks in Edmonton, Alberta in which five people were injured, officials say. The unnamed 30-year-old man is suspected of stabbing a policeman and injuring four pedestrians on Saturday. The officer was controlling traffic at a Canadian Football League game when he was struck by a car at high speed and then attacked with a knife. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called it a ""terrorist attack"". Edmonton officials say the suspect could face terror and murder-related charges. They add that he had been known to police for believing in extremist ideology. According to broadcasters CBC and CTV, a flag belonging to so-called Islamic State was found inside the vehicle that hit the police officer. The officer and his vehicle were rammed by a car outside Alberta's Commonwealth Stadium on Saturday evening. The driver then stabbed the uniformed officer several times, before fleeing on foot. The van overturned during a police chase Shortly before midnight, a man driving a rented van was pulled over at a checkpoint. His name on documents was said to be ""very similar"" to that of the man police were searching for. The truck then fled the scene, and was pursued by officers. Four pedestrians were struck during the chase in what police say appeared to be a deliberate action. Two injured pedestrians have since been released from hospital and the police officer is recovering from his wounds. Mr Trudeau said he was both ""deeply concerned and outraged"" by ""this senseless act of violence"". Edmonton Mayor Don Iveson urged calm. ""Terrorism is about creating panic and sowing divide about disrupting people's lives,"" he said. ""We can succumb to that or rise above it."" Jessica Murphy, BBC News, Toronto Canada is not immune to the forces of extremism and has dealt with attacks before.  In January, a gunman entered a mosque in Quebec City and fired on worshippers, killing six. In 2014, gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau killed a soldier guarding a war memorial in Ottawa before driving to parliament, where he was eventually killed. A few days before, two soldiers were rammed by a car in Quebec province. The suspect was later killed by police. But one soldier was killed and another injured in what was described as an apparent act of home-grown terrorism. Canadians are again shaken by a suspected terror incident that is reminiscent of recent vehicle attacks in European cities like Barcelona, London, and Berlin.

"Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong (left) and Indonesian Siti Aisyah (right) are accused of killing Mr Kim Two women have pleaded not guilty to murdering Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korea's leader, as their trial in Malaysia got under way. The brazen nature of his killing, usingthe highly toxic VX nerve agentas he waited for a flight at Kuala Lumpur airport in February, shocked the world. Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, 29, and Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, are accused of rubbing the chemical on his face. The pair say it was a TV prank and they were tricked by North Korean agents. Pyongyang has denied any involvement in the killing, but in court prosecutors said that four men - believed to be four North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the day of murder - were also charged in the case. The incident led to a bitter diplomatic row andstrained the once cordial tiesbetween North Korea and Malaysia, which expelled each other's ambassadors. The BBC investigates the stories of those accused of killing Kim Jong-nam As it happened: Unravelling the mystery Death in a dynasty: What led to Kim Jong-nam's death? The trial has been eight months in the making and the two women are the only suspects actually charged so far with the murder of Kim Jong-nam. Police cars believed to be carrying the two women are seen leaving court in Shah Alam, Malaysia With their heads bowed and wearing handcuffs and bullet-proof vests, the women walked past a horde of journalists gathered outside the court in Shah Alam, outside  Kuala Lumpur. After the charges were read to them in court in Indonesian and Vietnamese, the two women entered their pleas through interpreters. If found guilty, the women face the death penalty. Their defence lawyers are likely to argue that the real culprits are North Korean agents, who left Malaysia. This video can not be played Why was North Korea's Kim Jong-nam killed? But in his opening remarks, the prosecutor said he aims to prove that the women, along with four people still at large, had the ""common intention"" to kill Mr Kim. He said the women had carried out practice runs in Kuala Lumpur shopping malls before the attack, under the ""supervision"" of the four people, who were not named in court. Dozens of witnesses, including airport staff who came into contact with Mr Kim, are expected to take the stand in the trial which will run for weeks. The murder is notable for its sheer audacity, taking place as it did mid-morning in full view of security cameras at Kuala Lumpur's airport. On 13 February the two women were seen threading through crowds of people and accosting Mr Kim, before rubbing their hands on his face. This video can not be played The CCTV footage shows a woman in white lunging at a man Then there was the speed with which Mr Kim died. Immediately after the attack he sought help from airport staff, who led him to a clinic, but he collapsed and died just minutes later. After a post-mortem examination, Malaysian authorities announced he had been killed by VX, a toxin so lethal that it is classified as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations. Who in North Korea could organise a VX murder? The two women, who were arrested days after the killing, have insisted that they were tricked by North Koreans into taking part in what they thought was a TV prank. Four North Korean men who fled Malaysia shortly after the incident are believed to suspects.Interpol issued ""red notices"" for their arrest in March. Malaysia has named and questioned other North Koreans in relation to the case. But authorities also allowed three of them to leave the country in late March, in return for North Korea releasing nine Malaysian diplomats and their families. All the main players in the mysterious killing Mr Kim, who was in his mid-40s, was the estranged older half-brother of  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. At the time of his death, he was believed to have been living in self-imposed exile in Macau and was thought to have had some links to China. Some believe he was killed because he was seen as a potential leader-in-waiting, and therefore a threat to his younger brother, but many analysts have dismissed this. As with much concerning North Korea, the real motivations behind Mr Kim's murder are likely to remain unclear. Who in North Korea could organise a VX murder?

And on Wall Street - US stock markets have finished at fresh records following strong economic data and hopes of another strong 
quarter of corporate earnings reports. All three major indices ended at all-time highs. The Dow Jones 
Industrial Average jumped 0.7% to 22,557.
      The broader S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 2,529, while the tech-rich 
Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.3% to 6,517. Away from the Monarch collapse - there's been an update in the US over the giant Equifax data breach. The credit agency's security team failed to 
patch a vulnerability in March after getting a warning about the flaw, opening 
up the firm to a breach affecting 143 million people, the former chief 
executive says. Richard Smith, in a statement to a congressional committee 
released on Monday, offered a timeline of the huge cyber attack. He said in the prepared remarks that the company disseminated an internal memo on 9 March warning about a software flaw identified by the 
government's Computer Emergency Response Team. He added that Equifax policy would have required a patch to be applied 
within 48 hours, but this was not done. Mr Smith could not explain why. And here's some more reaction to Monarch going out of business in the UK's biggest ever airline collapse. Here's how customers at Birmingham airport reacted... This video can not be played Monarch passengers left 'gutted' at Birmingham Airport Business live has been flooded with tales of woe from Monarch travellers, but let's not forgot the staff who have lost their jobs. A reader writes: ""Today, my 20-year-old brother came off his night flight
and woke up to an email about a meeting. In this meeting staff were told they
were no longer Monarch employees and were being made redundant. No 'thank you' or your service, no apology, just - ""we advise you to go to the job centre and
sign on"". ""My brother is devastated to lose a job
he worked so hard for and served his second summer season this year with the
company. He has friends that were taken on just a few months ago for the summer
season, moving to Birmingham from as far as Scotland only to be let down and
left without redundancy money. ""For the company to keep this a secret
from the staff and for them to wake up with no job this morning is disgusting.
Even if they had been given a warning, some may have been able to look for new
jobs or at least get a head start on it. ""I feel so sorry for all the staff,
they have been mistreated and deceived and are now left with nothing. Summer
season is over now, so other airlines may not have vacancies until next sumner.
What are they supposed to do in the meantime?""  Let's check in with the US stock markets... It's turning into another record day on Wall Street with the three main indexes hitting fresh highs. Stronger US manufacturing data was behind the increase. With about 30 minutes to go before the closing bell, the Dow Jones was up 0.6% at 22,541 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.23% to 6,511, and S&P was 0.3% ahead at 2,527.  The personal information of
two individuals was compromised in a recently uncovered hack of
a Securities and Exchange Commission database, according to the financial regulator's chairman. Jay Clayton (above) said in a statement on Monday that
additional forensic analysis has found that the Social Security
numbers, dates of birth, and names of two individuals were made
available to the hackers after they breached the SEC's corporate
filing system known as EDGAR. He had previously said no personally identifiable
information had been accessed in the breach, which occurred in
2016. US Homeland Security has found critical breaches in the SEC's computer security, sparking suggestions that hackers could have had access to corporate announcements before they were formally released. Radio 4 PM This video can not be played The Civil Aviation Authority has begun flying Monarch passengers back to the UK, after the airline collapsed in the early hours of Monday morning. About 860 thousand people have lost bookings with 110 thousand of them currently overseas. Between 2004 and 2011 Tim Jeans was Managing Director of Monarch airlines. He told Radio 4's PM programme that Monarch realised ""a little bit too late"" about the competition from EasyJet and Ryanair. He added ""people wanted the lowest fare - they might have loved the meals, loved the glass of wine, but the reality was they would not pay for it."" Emma SimpsonBusiness correspondent, BBC News Southwark Crown Court
has heard of the ""frenetic"" last weeks in August 2014 when it was
widely known there was a gap in Tesco's accounts which was spiralling out of
control. Tesco's former UK managing director, Chris Bush, its former finance director, Carl Rogberg, and
its ex-UK commercial food director, John Scouler, are all charged with fraud
and false accounting in connection with the retailer's Â£250m accounting
scandal. The prosecution
counsel, Sasha Wass, QC, has been outlining the timeline leading up to Tesco's
dramatic announcement that it had overstated its profits in September 2014. The court heard that
although it was known that ""aggressive"" targets were not going to be
met, the accused carried on "" conniving and manipulating the figures""
by incorrectly encouraging others to ""pull forward"" income and that
they must have been fully aware of the damaging effects this practice was
having on the financial health of the company. The prosecution said
that the attempts to plug the financial hole were like a ""hamster running
around on the wheel"". The court heard that
the accused continually refused to deal with the growing problem and that Mr
Rogberg, allegedly told a ""bare faced lie"" to a senior colleague,
when questioned about a potential shortfall. And the court heard
the lead up to every half year deadline was known as ""diving for the
line"". It emerged that the
former Tesco chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, will be a witness for the
prosecution. The three defendants
deny the charges. The prosecution is expected to finish its opening statement
tomorrow. The demise of Monarch will mean 1,858 job losses, the administrators have confirmed. KMPG said that of these, 1,760 were employees of Monarch Airlines, while 98 were employed by
Monarch Travel Group. Between
them the companies employed about 2,100 people. The remainder have been kept on to help with the repatriation process and other admin issues. KPMG said in a statement this evening: âRegrettably,
with the business no longer able to fly, a significant number of redundancies
were made. âOver
the coming days, my team will be doing all it can to assist the employees in
submitting claims to the Redundancy Payments Office for monies owed."" Aviation regulator the CAA estimates the
repatriation of Monarch customers to the UK will cost about Â£60m. That will come from
government funding, it says. About 12,000 Monarch customers flew back to the UK today. The CAA has also listed by country the likely number of travellers to be repatriated by the end of this week. The vast majority, 32,503 people, will be brought back from Spain and the Canary Islands. From Portugal, it is 9,553, from Italy 3,661, and Croatia 2,086. In all 56,120 Monarch customers from 11 countries are expected to by repatriated by the end of the week, the CAA says.   Investors know how to spot a silver lining, and on the FTSE 100 today it was EasyJet. The airline's shares closed more than 5% up on expectation it would be a beneficiary of Monarch's demise. British Airways' owner IAG rose 2.36%, while in Dublin Ryanair closed 3.87% ahead. Elsewhere on the FTSE 100, which finished up 0.9% up at 7,438.8 points, housebuilders Barratt and Persimmon each rose more than 4% after the government announced more money for its Help to Buy scheme. Simon JackBBC Business Editor One thing that
Monarch lacked was scale. Its fleet of thirty or so aircraft was dwarfed by competitors like EasyJet and Ryanair which have 200 and 300 respectively. When terror
attacks in Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey saw the industry refocus on the Western
Mediterranean, competiton became intense and prices fell. Monarch could not
achieve the economies of scale the big players could. Management
realised this and made progress on tie ups with several interested parties.
Company sources tell me that those talks were derailed by uncertainty
surrounding the future regulation of the UK aviation industry thrown up by the
Brexit vote. The fall in the
value of the pound after the vote also pushed up the cost of fuel and aircraft
leases which were priced in dollars adding Â£50m per year to their costs. It was operating
in a viciously competitive market, it was too small to absorb any additional
costs and potential partners wanted to wait for more clarity on post-Brexit
airline regulation. Brexit didnât
kill Monarch on its own, but it added cost and helped shut off some of its
potential escape routes. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has dismissed suggestions Monarch's crisis is part of wider problems with Britain's aviation sector. Far from it, he told the Tory party conference, Monarch was a casualty of the success of its rivals. He says: ""As soon as
it became apparent that the airline was struggling we acted quickly. We
are today mounting the biggest civilian repatriation exercise this country has
seen in peacetime and we will bringing back 100,000 people who are stranded
overseas. ""And weâve
spoken to all the other airlines and asked them to do what they can to make
sure people affected can rebook their trips elsewhere as quickly as possible. ""But let
nobody think this is a sign of general problems in our aviation sector. Monarch
has been a victim of the success of other airlines, like Easyjet and Jet 2.
This summer most of our airports carried more passengers than ever
before. ""And
they did so because of the success of our economy. We have a great record to
build on.""   For everyone still tearing their hair out about their rights following the Monarch crisis,here's a link to our feature. Consumer champion Martin Lewis has also tweeted some usual advice, below. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has asked airlines not to exploit the Monarch crisis by raising prices, according to his PR team. A Department for Transport spokesman says he has ""asked all airlines to keep their prices reasonable for passengers
affected"". The spokesman added: ""We expect airlines, irrespective of whether they are members, to honour the
International Air Transport Association agreement to make their best efforts to
help passengers stranded away from home. ""These passengers should be provided access to discounted 'rescue fares',
subject to available capacity, for up to two weeks after the event to anywhere
within Europe."" BBC Newsbeat reporter tweets: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Away from Monarch for a moment, here's our usual update on the start of trading on Wall Street. The week has begun well, with the three major US share indexes hitting record highs at the open on hopes of progress on President Donald Trump's
tax reform plan. The Dow Jones was up 15.59 points,
or 0.07%, at 22,420.6, the S&P 500 was up 1.53
points, or 0.06%, at 2,520.89, and the Nasdaq was up 10.21 points, or 0.16%, at 6,506.17. Alan Jee and his fiancee - and 30 friends and family - were about to board a Monarch plane bound for the Canaries for their wedding on Saturday. ""We went past passport
control, then five minutes before we were due to go on the plane they just put
an (announcement) out saying everything's been cancelled and if we want to get
flights anywhere else we have to pay for them ourselves,"" says Mr Jee, from Dorset. There were plenty of tears, he tells the Press Association. ""They (Monarch) are doing absolutely nothing about it whatsoever, they've
palmed us off. No-one's told us anything about it; we've tried speaking to Monarch."" They've found alternative flights on Wednesday, but at up to Â£400 each. ""I've spent nearly Â£20,000 on the wedding as it is. I don't know
how they can treat people like that. We've got wedding planners to see, hair and make-up, bits and pieces - we
can't get out there to do them.""   Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.0053778784

With about 30 minutes to go before the closing bell, the Dow Jones was up 0.6% at 22,541 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.23% to 6,511, and S&P was 0.3% ahead at 2,527.  The personal information of
two individuals was compromised in a recently uncovered hack of
a Securities and Exchange Commission database, according to the financial regulator's chairman. Jay Clayton (above) said in a statement on Monday that
additional forensic analysis has found that the Social Security
numbers, dates of birth, and names of two individuals were made
available to the hackers after they breached the SEC's corporate
filing system known as EDGAR. He had previously said no personally identifiable
information had been accessed in the breach, which occurred in
2016. US Homeland Security has found critical breaches in the SEC's computer security, sparking suggestions that hackers could have had access to corporate announcements before they were formally released. Radio 4 PM This video can not be played The Civil Aviation Authority has begun flying Monarch passengers back to the UK, after the airline collapsed in the early hours of Monday morning. About 860 thousand people have lost bookings with 110 thousand of them currently overseas. Between 2004 and 2011 Tim Jeans was Managing Director of Monarch airlines. He told Radio 4's PM programme that Monarch realised ""a little bit too late"" about the competition from EasyJet and Ryanair. He added ""people wanted the lowest fare - they might have loved the meals, loved the glass of wine, but the reality was they would not pay for it."" Emma SimpsonBusiness correspondent, BBC News Southwark Crown Court
has heard of the ""frenetic"" last weeks in August 2014 when it was
widely known there was a gap in Tesco's accounts which was spiralling out of
control. Tesco's former UK managing director, Chris Bush, its former finance director, Carl Rogberg, and
its ex-UK commercial food director, John Scouler, are all charged with fraud
and false accounting in connection with the retailer's Â£250m accounting
scandal. The prosecution
counsel, Sasha Wass, QC, has been outlining the timeline leading up to Tesco's
dramatic announcement that it had overstated its profits in September 2014. The court heard that
although it was known that ""aggressive"" targets were not going to be
met, the accused carried on "" conniving and manipulating the figures""
by incorrectly encouraging others to ""pull forward"" income and that
they must have been fully aware of the damaging effects this practice was
having on the financial health of the company. The prosecution said
that the attempts to plug the financial hole were like a ""hamster running
around on the wheel"". The court heard that
the accused continually refused to deal with the growing problem and that Mr
Rogberg, allegedly told a ""bare faced lie"" to a senior colleague,
when questioned about a potential shortfall. And the court heard
the lead up to every half year deadline was known as ""diving for the
line"". It emerged that the
former Tesco chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, will be a witness for the
prosecution. The three defendants
deny the charges. The prosecution is expected to finish its opening statement
tomorrow. The demise of Monarch will mean 1,858 job losses, the administrators have confirmed. KMPG said that of these, 1,760 were employees of Monarch Airlines, while 98 were employed by
Monarch Travel Group. Between
them the companies employed about 2,100 people. The remainder have been kept on to help with the repatriation process and other admin issues. KPMG said in a statement this evening: âRegrettably,
with the business no longer able to fly, a significant number of redundancies
were made. âOver
the coming days, my team will be doing all it can to assist the employees in
submitting claims to the Redundancy Payments Office for monies owed."" Aviation regulator the CAA estimates the
repatriation of Monarch customers to the UK will cost about Â£60m. That will come from
government funding, it says. About 12,000 Monarch customers flew back to the UK today. The CAA has also listed by country the likely number of travellers to be repatriated by the end of this week. The vast majority, 32,503 people, will be brought back from Spain and the Canary Islands. From Portugal, it is 9,553, from Italy 3,661, and Croatia 2,086. In all 56,120 Monarch customers from 11 countries are expected to by repatriated by the end of the week, the CAA says.   Investors know how to spot a silver lining, and on the FTSE 100 today it was EasyJet. The airline's shares closed more than 5% up on expectation it would be a beneficiary of Monarch's demise. British Airways' owner IAG rose 2.36%, while in Dublin Ryanair closed 3.87% ahead. Elsewhere on the FTSE 100, which finished up 0.9% up at 7,438.8 points, housebuilders Barratt and Persimmon each rose more than 4% after the government announced more money for its Help to Buy scheme. Simon JackBBC Business Editor One thing that
Monarch lacked was scale. Its fleet of thirty or so aircraft was dwarfed by competitors like EasyJet and Ryanair which have 200 and 300 respectively. When terror
attacks in Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey saw the industry refocus on the Western
Mediterranean, competiton became intense and prices fell. Monarch could not
achieve the economies of scale the big players could. Management
realised this and made progress on tie ups with several interested parties.
Company sources tell me that those talks were derailed by uncertainty
surrounding the future regulation of the UK aviation industry thrown up by the
Brexit vote. The fall in the
value of the pound after the vote also pushed up the cost of fuel and aircraft
leases which were priced in dollars adding Â£50m per year to their costs. It was operating
in a viciously competitive market, it was too small to absorb any additional
costs and potential partners wanted to wait for more clarity on post-Brexit
airline regulation. Brexit didnât
kill Monarch on its own, but it added cost and helped shut off some of its
potential escape routes. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has dismissed suggestions Monarch's crisis is part of wider problems with Britain's aviation sector. Far from it, he told the Tory party conference, Monarch was a casualty of the success of its rivals. He says: ""As soon as
it became apparent that the airline was struggling we acted quickly. We
are today mounting the biggest civilian repatriation exercise this country has
seen in peacetime and we will bringing back 100,000 people who are stranded
overseas. ""And weâve
spoken to all the other airlines and asked them to do what they can to make
sure people affected can rebook their trips elsewhere as quickly as possible. ""But let
nobody think this is a sign of general problems in our aviation sector. Monarch
has been a victim of the success of other airlines, like Easyjet and Jet 2.
This summer most of our airports carried more passengers than ever
before. ""And
they did so because of the success of our economy. We have a great record to
build on.""   For everyone still tearing their hair out about their rights following the Monarch crisis,here's a link to our feature. Consumer champion Martin Lewis has also tweeted some usual advice, below. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has asked airlines not to exploit the Monarch crisis by raising prices, according to his PR team. A Department for Transport spokesman says he has ""asked all airlines to keep their prices reasonable for passengers
affected"". The spokesman added: ""We expect airlines, irrespective of whether they are members, to honour the
International Air Transport Association agreement to make their best efforts to
help passengers stranded away from home. ""These passengers should be provided access to discounted 'rescue fares',
subject to available capacity, for up to two weeks after the event to anywhere
within Europe."" BBC Newsbeat reporter tweets: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Away from Monarch for a moment, here's our usual update on the start of trading on Wall Street. The week has begun well, with the three major US share indexes hitting record highs at the open on hopes of progress on President Donald Trump's
tax reform plan. The Dow Jones was up 15.59 points,
or 0.07%, at 22,420.6, the S&P 500 was up 1.53
points, or 0.06%, at 2,520.89, and the Nasdaq was up 10.21 points, or 0.16%, at 6,506.17. Alan Jee and his fiancee - and 30 friends and family - were about to board a Monarch plane bound for the Canaries for their wedding on Saturday. ""We went past passport
control, then five minutes before we were due to go on the plane they just put
an (announcement) out saying everything's been cancelled and if we want to get
flights anywhere else we have to pay for them ourselves,"" says Mr Jee, from Dorset. There were plenty of tears, he tells the Press Association. ""They (Monarch) are doing absolutely nothing about it whatsoever, they've
palmed us off. No-one's told us anything about it; we've tried speaking to Monarch."" They've found alternative flights on Wednesday, but at up to Â£400 each. ""I've spent nearly Â£20,000 on the wedding as it is. I don't know
how they can treat people like that. We've got wedding planners to see, hair and make-up, bits and pieces - we
can't get out there to do them.""   Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,2.3914995e-07
"This video can not be played How the horror unfolded - in two minutes At least 59 people have been killed and another 527 injured in a mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert.

He killed himself as police stormed the room where 10 guns were found. Investigators have found no link to international terrorism, despite a claim from so-called Islamic State. In an address from the White House, President Donald Trump described the attack as ""pure evil"".

Thousands were enjoying a performance by top-billing singer Jason Aldean when the first of several bursts of automatic gunfire rang out - hundreds of shots, witnesses say. That was late on Sunday night - 22:08 local time (05:08 GMT on Monday).

But the group provided no evidence for this and has made unsubstantiated claims in the past. FBI Special Agent Aaron Rouse told a news conference: ""We have determined at this point no connection to an international terrorist organisation.""

An off-duty Las Vegas police officer was another of those who died. More on the victims By the BBC's James Cook in Las Vegas The scenes which played out in this stunned city were at once frantically urgent and wearily familiar. When gunfire rings out, Americans know the drill. Run. They fled from a gunman who left a city in chaos. For a time, Las Vegas looked and felt like a war zone. Hospitals were overwhelmed. There were not enough ambulances. A plea for blood donations echoed across the airwaves. And now the mourning, the relief, the tears, the elation, the grief and a hundred other emotions are barely beginning. Doctors are still battling to save lives. For a Western democracy, the United States has seen an astonishing amount of horror like this. But even for this country what happened here is carnage on a different scale. America's mass shooting disease now feels like a plague. Nevada has some of the least stringent gun laws in the United States. People are allowed to carry weapons and do not have to register themselves as a gun-owner. Background checks are done when people buy guns, but they are also allowed to sell them privately. Former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a shooting six years ago, called for political leaders in Washington to introduce tougher gun laws following the Las Vegas attack. Her husband Mark Kelly read out a joint statement on the steps of the Capitol saying thoughts and prayers from the White House were not enough to stop the next shooting.

But now is not that time, she added. During testimony to Congress last week, FBI Director Christopher Wray said there are about 1,000 ongoing, active investigations into potential domestic terrorists. Speaking to the Senate Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday, he described the list as a ""very serious"" issue that the agency spends ""a lot of our time focused on"". He noted in his testimony that the threat of domestic terror is much greater than ""the threat from ISIS influence"", referring to so-called Islamic State. Police have said that the attack in Las Vegas was not terror-related, but so far have not released a motive.   Advocates for increased gun control are calling attention to a Republican draft bill which would make it easier for Americans to purchase ""silencers"" - also known as ""suppressors"" - which are affixed to the end of gun barrels and are designed to dampen the sound of gunfire. Thebill,external, known as the Sportsmen's Heritage and Recreational Enhancement Act, includes provisions that would deregulate gun silencers. ""This legislation is about safety â plain and simple"", said South Carolina Congressman Jeff Duncan when he introduced the bill, noting that his own hearing ""has been damaged because of gun noise"". Debate over the bill was meant to begin next week in Congress after it was delayed over the summer following a gun attack against US congressmen while they practiced for a softball game.

America's mass shooting disease now feels like a plague. Nevada has some of the least stringent gun laws in the United States. People are allowed to carry weapons and do not have to register themselves as a gun-owner. Background checks are done when people buy guns, but they are also allowed to sell them privately. Former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a shooting six years ago, called for political leaders in Washington to introduce tougher gun laws following the Las Vegas attack. Her husband Mark Kelly read out a joint statement on the steps of the Capitol saying thoughts and prayers from the White House were not enough to stop the next shooting.

"The Archbishop of Canterbury has said he hopes he does not have to carry out the Queen's funeral. The Most Rev Justin Welby said it would be an ""enormous"" public event and ""the most extraordinary historic moment"". In an interview for British GQ, he described the Queen as ""one of the most extraordinary people I have ever met"". The archbishop also told the magazine he was unable to ""give a straight answer"" to the question on whether gay sex is sinful. Interviewed by former Labour communications director Alistair Campbell, Mr Welby - who took up his current post in 2012 - was asked whether he loses sleep thinking he might have to preside over the Queen's funeral. ""I don't lose sleep and I do hope I don't have to do that,"" he said. ""It's enormous, whoever does it - God willing someone else - because it is an enormous public event. But as a parish priest, at every funeral you think about the enormity of it."" He added: ""I don't want to get into details because it is not something I want to talk about, but the Queen is the most extraordinary person, one of the most extraordinary people I have ever met, in every possible way."" As the Queen is the supreme governor of the Church of England, it might be expected that the church's most senior clergyman would carry out the duty of leading her funeral when that time comes. But her 65-year reign has already outlasted Mr Welby's six previous incumbents in the post. During the interview, for the November issue of the magazine, the archbishop is also asked if gay sex is sinful. ""Do you know, we have done religion, we have done politics, why am I surprised we are on to gay sex?"" he said. ""You know very well that is a question I can't give a straight answer to. Sorry, badly phrased there. I should have thought that one through."" When asked why, he went on: ""Because I don't do blanket condemnation and I haven't got a good answer to the question. ""I'll be really honest about that. I know I haven't got a good answer to the question. ""Inherently, within myself, the things that seem to me to be absolutely central are around faithfulness, stability of relationships and loving relationships."" The Church of England's stance on sexuality was in the spotlight earlier this year, when the church's ruling bodyvoted against a controversial reportthat said marriage in church should only be between a man and a woman. Current rules ban the marriage of same-sex couples in the Church. Services of blessing for civil partnerships are also prohibited, but informal prayers are allowed. In July, the archbishop said the Church of Englandwould spend three years on a documentoutlining a new stance on sexuality.

This follows the failure of last-ditch talks with the Civil Aviation Authority about renewing its licence to sell package holidays. The company employs 2,500 people and carried 6.3 million passengers last year from Gatwick, Luton, Birmingham, Leeds-Bradford and Manchester airports. It reported a loss of Â£291m in the year to last October.

Spain's government sent in riot police, but this failed to stop the referendum, which it has declared illegal. Some 800 people were injured in clashes. In a televised address, Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont refused to back down, urging the European Union to take notice of the result.

"Suzie Imber will now get a recommendation to join the European Space Agency A Leicester scientist has said she is ""excited"" she could ""end up in space"" after winning a BBC Two show. Suzie Imber, 33, was revealed as the best candidate for space on ""Astronauts: Do you have what it takes?"" on Sunday. The University of Leicester associate professor said the experience was ""incredible"" but ""really tough"". Dr Imber, who triumphed over 11 other people, will now get a recommendation to join the European Space Agency. Former astronaut Chris Hadfield (r) was the first Canadian to walk in space Former astronaut Chris Hadfield and his team put the candidates through a series of gruelling tests as part of the show, to find out who had the qualities to be an astronaut. Dr Imber, associate professor of planetary science at the university, said: ""Staying focused and being able to cope with the degree of testing over a time period was hard. ""It was really hard to prepare for tests, like the ability to take my own blood. ""And being strapped into a capsule and lowered into water, so it fills up, and then spun around so you have to hold your breath and feel disorientated."" Dr Imber beat 11 other candidates, including engineers and pilots The scientist has been interested in space from a young age and her current research looks at Mercury's magnetosphere. Dr Imber said she was ""utterly shocked and surprised"" when her name was announced. ""The process has taught me that you don't have to be the best at everything,"" she said. ""You have to be consistently good over a broad range of skills and perhaps that's why I might have got a slight edge on the others. ""[Winning] has made me more excited and enthusiastic to apply, and who knows, it's possible that I could one day end up in space."" Dr Imber added she made ""incredibly valuable life-long friendships"" with those she met on the six-week programme. Suzie Imber is also a good climber as can be seen here on Denali, the highest mountain in North America Professor Paul Boyle, president of the university, said: ""For an intrepid explorer, who is used to scaling mountains, she has surpassed herself by achieving new heights of success. ""She has done herself, her family and loved ones and the university very proud indeed. ""We hope she continues to go from strength to strength in her application to become an astronaut.""

And on Wall Street - US stock markets have finished at fresh records following strong economic data and hopes of another strong 
quarter of corporate earnings reports. All three major indices ended at all-time highs. The Dow Jones 
Industrial Average jumped 0.7% to 22,557.
      The broader S&P 500 rose 0.4% to 2,529, while the tech-rich 
Nasdaq Composite Index gained 0.3% to 6,517. Away from the Monarch collapse - there's been an update in the US over the giant Equifax data breach. The credit agency's security team failed to 
patch a vulnerability in March after getting a warning about the flaw, opening 
up the firm to a breach affecting 143 million people, the former chief 
executive says. Richard Smith, in a statement to a congressional committee 
released on Monday, offered a timeline of the huge cyber attack. He said in the prepared remarks that the company disseminated an internal memo on 9 March warning about a software flaw identified by the 
government's Computer Emergency Response Team. He added that Equifax policy would have required a patch to be applied 
within 48 hours, but this was not done. Mr Smith could not explain why. And here's some more reaction to Monarch going out of business in the UK's biggest ever airline collapse. Here's how customers at Birmingham airport reacted... This video can not be played Monarch passengers left 'gutted' at Birmingham Airport Business live has been flooded with tales of woe from Monarch travellers, but let's not forgot the staff who have lost their jobs. A reader writes: ""Today, my 20-year-old brother came off his night flight
and woke up to an email about a meeting. In this meeting staff were told they
were no longer Monarch employees and were being made redundant. No 'thank you' or your service, no apology, just - ""we advise you to go to the job centre and
sign on"". ""My brother is devastated to lose a job
he worked so hard for and served his second summer season this year with the
company. He has friends that were taken on just a few months ago for the summer
season, moving to Birmingham from as far as Scotland only to be let down and
left without redundancy money. ""For the company to keep this a secret
from the staff and for them to wake up with no job this morning is disgusting.
Even if they had been given a warning, some may have been able to look for new
jobs or at least get a head start on it. ""I feel so sorry for all the staff,
they have been mistreated and deceived and are now left with nothing. Summer
season is over now, so other airlines may not have vacancies until next sumner.
What are they supposed to do in the meantime?""  Let's check in with the US stock markets... It's turning into another record day on Wall Street with the three main indexes hitting fresh highs. Stronger US manufacturing data was behind the increase. With about 30 minutes to go before the closing bell, the Dow Jones was up 0.6% at 22,541 points, the Nasdaq was up 0.23% to 6,511, and S&P was 0.3% ahead at 2,527.  The personal information of
two individuals was compromised in a recently uncovered hack of
a Securities and Exchange Commission database, according to the financial regulator's chairman. Jay Clayton (above) said in a statement on Monday that
additional forensic analysis has found that the Social Security
numbers, dates of birth, and names of two individuals were made
available to the hackers after they breached the SEC's corporate
filing system known as EDGAR. He had previously said no personally identifiable
information had been accessed in the breach, which occurred in
2016. US Homeland Security has found critical breaches in the SEC's computer security, sparking suggestions that hackers could have had access to corporate announcements before they were formally released. Radio 4 PM This video can not be played The Civil Aviation Authority has begun flying Monarch passengers back to the UK, after the airline collapsed in the early hours of Monday morning. About 860 thousand people have lost bookings with 110 thousand of them currently overseas. Between 2004 and 2011 Tim Jeans was Managing Director of Monarch airlines. He told Radio 4's PM programme that Monarch realised ""a little bit too late"" about the competition from EasyJet and Ryanair. He added ""people wanted the lowest fare - they might have loved the meals, loved the glass of wine, but the reality was they would not pay for it."" Emma SimpsonBusiness correspondent, BBC News Southwark Crown Court
has heard of the ""frenetic"" last weeks in August 2014 when it was
widely known there was a gap in Tesco's accounts which was spiralling out of
control. Tesco's former UK managing director, Chris Bush, its former finance director, Carl Rogberg, and
its ex-UK commercial food director, John Scouler, are all charged with fraud
and false accounting in connection with the retailer's Â£250m accounting
scandal. The prosecution
counsel, Sasha Wass, QC, has been outlining the timeline leading up to Tesco's
dramatic announcement that it had overstated its profits in September 2014. The court heard that
although it was known that ""aggressive"" targets were not going to be
met, the accused carried on "" conniving and manipulating the figures""
by incorrectly encouraging others to ""pull forward"" income and that
they must have been fully aware of the damaging effects this practice was
having on the financial health of the company. The prosecution said
that the attempts to plug the financial hole were like a ""hamster running
around on the wheel"". The court heard that
the accused continually refused to deal with the growing problem and that Mr
Rogberg, allegedly told a ""bare faced lie"" to a senior colleague,
when questioned about a potential shortfall. And the court heard
the lead up to every half year deadline was known as ""diving for the
line"". It emerged that the
former Tesco chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent, will be a witness for the
prosecution. The three defendants
deny the charges. The prosecution is expected to finish its opening statement
tomorrow. The demise of Monarch will mean 1,858 job losses, the administrators have confirmed. KMPG said that of these, 1,760 were employees of Monarch Airlines, while 98 were employed by
Monarch Travel Group. Between
them the companies employed about 2,100 people. The remainder have been kept on to help with the repatriation process and other admin issues. KPMG said in a statement this evening: âRegrettably,
with the business no longer able to fly, a significant number of redundancies
were made. âOver
the coming days, my team will be doing all it can to assist the employees in
submitting claims to the Redundancy Payments Office for monies owed."" Aviation regulator the CAA estimates the
repatriation of Monarch customers to the UK will cost about Â£60m. That will come from
government funding, it says. About 12,000 Monarch customers flew back to the UK today. The CAA has also listed by country the likely number of travellers to be repatriated by the end of this week. The vast majority, 32,503 people, will be brought back from Spain and the Canary Islands. From Portugal, it is 9,553, from Italy 3,661, and Croatia 2,086. In all 56,120 Monarch customers from 11 countries are expected to by repatriated by the end of the week, the CAA says.   Investors know how to spot a silver lining, and on the FTSE 100 today it was EasyJet. The airline's shares closed more than 5% up on expectation it would be a beneficiary of Monarch's demise. British Airways' owner IAG rose 2.36%, while in Dublin Ryanair closed 3.87% ahead. Elsewhere on the FTSE 100, which finished up 0.9% up at 7,438.8 points, housebuilders Barratt and Persimmon each rose more than 4% after the government announced more money for its Help to Buy scheme. Simon JackBBC Business Editor One thing that
Monarch lacked was scale. Its fleet of thirty or so aircraft was dwarfed by competitors like EasyJet and Ryanair which have 200 and 300 respectively. When terror
attacks in Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey saw the industry refocus on the Western
Mediterranean, competiton became intense and prices fell. Monarch could not
achieve the economies of scale the big players could. Management
realised this and made progress on tie ups with several interested parties.
Company sources tell me that those talks were derailed by uncertainty
surrounding the future regulation of the UK aviation industry thrown up by the
Brexit vote. The fall in the
value of the pound after the vote also pushed up the cost of fuel and aircraft
leases which were priced in dollars adding Â£50m per year to their costs. It was operating
in a viciously competitive market, it was too small to absorb any additional
costs and potential partners wanted to wait for more clarity on post-Brexit
airline regulation. Brexit didnât
kill Monarch on its own, but it added cost and helped shut off some of its
potential escape routes. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has dismissed suggestions Monarch's crisis is part of wider problems with Britain's aviation sector. Far from it, he told the Tory party conference, Monarch was a casualty of the success of its rivals. He says: ""As soon as
it became apparent that the airline was struggling we acted quickly. We
are today mounting the biggest civilian repatriation exercise this country has
seen in peacetime and we will bringing back 100,000 people who are stranded
overseas. ""And weâve
spoken to all the other airlines and asked them to do what they can to make
sure people affected can rebook their trips elsewhere as quickly as possible. ""But let
nobody think this is a sign of general problems in our aviation sector. Monarch
has been a victim of the success of other airlines, like Easyjet and Jet 2.
This summer most of our airports carried more passengers than ever
before. ""And
they did so because of the success of our economy. We have a great record to
build on.""   For everyone still tearing their hair out about their rights following the Monarch crisis,here's a link to our feature. Consumer champion Martin Lewis has also tweeted some usual advice, below. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has asked airlines not to exploit the Monarch crisis by raising prices, according to his PR team. A Department for Transport spokesman says he has ""asked all airlines to keep their prices reasonable for passengers
affected"". The spokesman added: ""We expect airlines, irrespective of whether they are members, to honour the
International Air Transport Association agreement to make their best efforts to
help passengers stranded away from home. ""These passengers should be provided access to discounted 'rescue fares',
subject to available capacity, for up to two weeks after the event to anywhere
within Europe."" BBC Newsbeat reporter tweets: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Away from Monarch for a moment, here's our usual update on the start of trading on Wall Street. The week has begun well, with the three major US share indexes hitting record highs at the open on hopes of progress on President Donald Trump's
tax reform plan. The Dow Jones was up 15.59 points,
or 0.07%, at 22,420.6, the S&P 500 was up 1.53
points, or 0.06%, at 2,520.89, and the Nasdaq was up 10.21 points, or 0.16%, at 6,506.17. Alan Jee and his fiancee - and 30 friends and family - were about to board a Monarch plane bound for the Canaries for their wedding on Saturday. ""We went past passport
control, then five minutes before we were due to go on the plane they just put
an (announcement) out saying everything's been cancelled and if we want to get
flights anywhere else we have to pay for them ourselves,"" says Mr Jee, from Dorset. There were plenty of tears, he tells the Press Association. ""They (Monarch) are doing absolutely nothing about it whatsoever, they've
palmed us off. No-one's told us anything about it; we've tried speaking to Monarch."" They've found alternative flights on Wednesday, but at up to Â£400 each. ""I've spent nearly Â£20,000 on the wedding as it is. I don't know
how they can treat people like that. We've got wedding planners to see, hair and make-up, bits and pieces - we
can't get out there to do them.""   Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.58630484
"Greg Steltenpohl was a pioneer of the whole foods movement Greg Steltenpohl was a pioneer of the ""whole foods"" movement in the 1980s. But he almost lost everything after his first company faced a major corporate crisis. After creating not one but two highly successful natural drinks companies, Greg Steltenpohl is ""not one for regrets"". However, the former jazz musician does rank the sale of his first business, Odwalla, to Coca-Cola back in 2001 as a ""pretty big disappointment"". He co-founded the firm, now one of America's best-known juice and smoothie brands, with some friends back in 1980, simply as a way to support his career as a musician. It became an early pioneer of the ""whole foods"" movement, priding itself on its all natural ingredients, quirky branding and independent ethos. But after an outbreak of E. coli was associated with one of its juices in 1996, sales dried up. Mr Steltenpohl co-founded Odwalla, one of America's best-known smoothie brands The founders had to take on new investment to stay afloat and lost control of the board. Within five years Mr Steltenpohl had quit, and Odwalla was sold to Coke for $181m (Â£134m). ""I'm not evangelising against 'evil corporate empires',"" the genial Californian says over coffee in London. ""But these big firms tend to target smaller ones like Odwalla because they can't innovate those ideas internally. ""The problem is they end up destroying what make those brands unique."" The 62-year-old is trying to set the record straight with his latest venture, the plant-based food company Califia Farms. Launched in 2010, its main line is in almond and coconut milks, which come either plain, or in flavours like matcha green tea, or ginger and turmeric. Mr Steltenpohl's new firm, Califia Farms, makes plant-based milks and cold coffees The Los Angeles-based firm also sells bottled coffees and natural juices, with all its products low in sugar, dairy free and ethically sourced. Whereas Mr Steltenpohl's first company was launched at time when natural and organic foods were a novelty, the sector is now well established, with industry-wide sales of $69bnin the US alone last year,external. Large food companies are alsolosing market share to smaller ones,externalthat offer more artisanal, niche products. Califia already has sales of more than $100m a year, and is the number one premium bottled coffee brand in the US. However, Mr Steltenpohl says big corporations have been ""jumping into"" the whole foods market, and smaller companies like his face competition. ""They have much better supply chains, distribution and marketing. At the moment we're just a fly on the back of an elephant."" Califia Farms makes more than $100m in sales annually Mr Steltenpohl fell into the drinks business by chance after studying at the Creative Music Studio, a renowned music school in upstate New York, in the late 1970s. He and two friends moved to Santa Cruz, California to seek fame and fortune with their ""avant garde jazz"" band The Stance. But they quickly ran out of money. ""We were broke and we weren't that good! So I came up with this idea that we could squeeze fresh orange juice every morning, sleep during the day, and play music all night."" The juice company took off, and the music tapered out. Under the brand Odwalla - named aftera song by experimental jazz group Art Ensemble of Chicago,external- the trio started selling to restaurants and health food shops, but were soon stocking grocery stores across the US. By 1996 Odwalla was listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange and sales were approaching $100m a year. Califia's cold coffees include a nitrogen-infused variety Then disaster struck. A child died and scores were sickened after drinking a batch of the firm's apple juice; Odwalla had to issue a huge product recall, and its sales dived by 90%. Jeffery Kline, editor of drinks industry website Bevnet, says Mr Steltenpohl has been ""very open about how painful the experience was"". Mr Kline adds: ""People in the industry believe Greg acted respectably throughout the crisis. And he never talks about it in terms of what he went through, but in fact what an incredibly devastating impact it had on others."" Within two years Odwalla had rebuilt its reputation, thanks in part to its loyal customer base. The problem, says Mr Steltenpohl, was the new backers wanted a ""quick return"" on their investment by selling the firm.

The A-level failure who became a multi-millionaire ""In hindsight I think we could have found investors who shared our values and stayed independent. But we had to move fast to protect people's jobs."" Not long after Coca-Cola swooped, and Odwalla soon ""lost its ethos"", he says. ""We were a local brand, but Coke shut our plant and shifted the main staff to Atlanta. It also replaced the key managers with their internal people who all had two year rotations, and you can't run a passion brand that way."" A spokeswoman for Coca-Cola says it is keen to nurture new brands, and Odwalla remains an ""important part"" of its natural health drinks portfolio. Mr Steltenpohl says he has learnt from the experience, as well as from several other unsuccessful ventures he launched after leaving Odwalla. Califia's plant in Bakersfield, California He now wants to keep Califia Farms ""independent"" for as long as possible. But is that realistic? Phil Howard, an associate professor at the Department of Community Sustainability at Michigan State University, says that only a ""small number"" of values-driven firms manage to stay independent and be successful. ""As big distributors and retailers consolidate it becomes difficult to compete, so many smaller firms sell up to multinationals,"" he explains. ""And a lot depends on the small firm's ownership structure, for instance whether they need to repay investors."" Califia Farms has already sold a minority stake to a private equity firm, but Mr Steltenpohl says the investor fully shares its values. Califia is also majority owned by the farm that produces its oranges, while Mr Steltenpohl is its boss and a founding shareholder. Tellingly, he has hired people with experience of working in bigger firms to help guide the business. These include a plant manager who trained at Danone, and a head of human resources who worked for Virgin boss Richard Branson. Mr Steltenpohl says he is determined to strike a better balance between keeping the firm on track, and upholding his ""starry eyed"" ideals than he did at Odwalla. That said, he hopes business culture is changing to accommodate different notions of success. ""It is partly the fault of the business media and business schools,"" he says, ""but we tend to celebrate a firm's growth and quarterly reports above all else. ""But wouldn't it be great if we were saying, 'Wow, they managed to stay independent for 20 years, stayed true to their values, and they grew their sales too.'"" Does selling up mean selling out?

"Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong (left) and Indonesian Siti Aisyah (right) are accused of killing Mr Kim Two women have pleaded not guilty to murdering Kim Jong-nam, the half-brother of North Korea's leader, as their trial in Malaysia got under way. The brazen nature of his killing, usingthe highly toxic VX nerve agentas he waited for a flight at Kuala Lumpur airport in February, shocked the world. Vietnamese Doan Thi Huong, 29, and Indonesian Siti Aisyah, 25, are accused of rubbing the chemical on his face. The pair say it was a TV prank and they were tricked by North Korean agents. Pyongyang has denied any involvement in the killing, but in court prosecutors said that four men - believed to be four North Koreans who fled Malaysia on the day of murder - were also charged in the case. The incident led to a bitter diplomatic row andstrained the once cordial tiesbetween North Korea and Malaysia, which expelled each other's ambassadors. The BBC investigates the stories of those accused of killing Kim Jong-nam As it happened: Unravelling the mystery Death in a dynasty: What led to Kim Jong-nam's death? The trial has been eight months in the making and the two women are the only suspects actually charged so far with the murder of Kim Jong-nam. Police cars believed to be carrying the two women are seen leaving court in Shah Alam, Malaysia With their heads bowed and wearing handcuffs and bullet-proof vests, the women walked past a horde of journalists gathered outside the court in Shah Alam, outside  Kuala Lumpur. After the charges were read to them in court in Indonesian and Vietnamese, the two women entered their pleas through interpreters. If found guilty, the women face the death penalty. Their defence lawyers are likely to argue that the real culprits are North Korean agents, who left Malaysia. This video can not be played Why was North Korea's Kim Jong-nam killed? But in his opening remarks, the prosecutor said he aims to prove that the women, along with four people still at large, had the ""common intention"" to kill Mr Kim. He said the women had carried out practice runs in Kuala Lumpur shopping malls before the attack, under the ""supervision"" of the four people, who were not named in court. Dozens of witnesses, including airport staff who came into contact with Mr Kim, are expected to take the stand in the trial which will run for weeks. The murder is notable for its sheer audacity, taking place as it did mid-morning in full view of security cameras at Kuala Lumpur's airport. On 13 February the two women were seen threading through crowds of people and accosting Mr Kim, before rubbing their hands on his face. This video can not be played The CCTV footage shows a woman in white lunging at a man Then there was the speed with which Mr Kim died. Immediately after the attack he sought help from airport staff, who led him to a clinic, but he collapsed and died just minutes later. After a post-mortem examination, Malaysian authorities announced he had been killed by VX, a toxin so lethal that it is classified as a weapon of mass destruction by the United Nations. Who in North Korea could organise a VX murder? The two women, who were arrested days after the killing, have insisted that they were tricked by North Koreans into taking part in what they thought was a TV prank. Four North Korean men who fled Malaysia shortly after the incident are believed to suspects.Interpol issued ""red notices"" for their arrest in March. Malaysia has named and questioned other North Koreans in relation to the case. But authorities also allowed three of them to leave the country in late March, in return for North Korea releasing nine Malaysian diplomats and their families. All the main players in the mysterious killing Mr Kim, who was in his mid-40s, was the estranged older half-brother of  North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. At the time of his death, he was believed to have been living in self-imposed exile in Macau and was thought to have had some links to China. Some believe he was killed because he was seen as a potential leader-in-waiting, and therefore a threat to his younger brother, but many analysts have dismissed this. As with much concerning North Korea, the real motivations behind Mr Kim's murder are likely to remain unclear. Who in North Korea could organise a VX murder?

"This video can not be played Eyewitness Anthony Biscardi recalls the moment a prop collapsed on US rockstar Manson Rock star Marilyn Manson was injured during a concert in New York when a large piece of stage scenery fell on him on stage. The prop - apparently two large guns held together with metal scaffolding - fell as he was performing at the Hammerstein Ballroom on Saturday. An eyewitness told the BBC that the singer lay on stage for up to 15 minutes covered by a sheet before he was carried out on a stretcher and taken to hospital. He has cancelled nine tour dates following the injury, according toBillboard magazine,external. Eyewitness Anthony Biscardi told the BBC that fans at the concert ""instantly freaked out"". ""He was performing the song Sweet Dreams. Towards the middle of the song it seemed as though he tried climbing onto a prop. ""The first touch of weight on those poles and it came crashing down onto him."" The 48-year-old 'shock rock' star has been nominated for four Grammy awards In videos of the incident posted online, stage crew and band members can be seen lifting the prop off the singer but he does not get back up. ""He was pretty limp, almost as though he was unconscious,"" Mr Biscardi said. Mr Biscardi said a black sheet was put around him until he could be taken off stage, when an announcement was made that the show was cancelled ""due to injury"". A representative toldRolling Stone,externalmagazine that: ""Manson suffered an injury towards the end of his incredible NYC show. He is being treated at a local hospital."" The 48-year-old artist was three dates into his The Heaven Upside Down Tour. He was due to perform in Boston on Monday night.

"The chancellor said a 35-year political consensus over the free market was now at an end The Conservatives must take on and defeat Labour ""dinosaurs"" in a great ""clash of ideas"" over the future of capitalism, Philip Hammond has said. He told activists they must expose Jeremy Corbyn's ""back to the future socialist fantasy"" which he said was leading people ""down a dangerous path"". The chancellor also said his party must address concerns over pressure on living standards and housing costs. And he announced Â£300m for rail improvements in the north of England. The new money will be used to ensure HS2 will link to faster trains between Liverpool and Manchester, Sheffield, Leeds and York - so-called Northern Powerhouse rail. Tories' election post-mortem in a marquee May promises Â£10bn Help to Buy boost May: Election result 'saved the union' All ministers 'sackable', says Hammond The chancellor used his keynote party conference speech in Manchester to mount a defence of free market economics, which he claimed was coming under assault from Jeremy Corbyn. Describing the Labour leader and his shadow chancellor John McDonnell as ""dinosaurs who had broken out of their glass cases"", he said Labour's harking back to the ""ideological experiments"" of the 1970s presented a ""clear and present"" danger to the UK's future prosperity. ""They say politics is about the clash of ideas. So we say to Corbyn 'bring it on',"" he said. ""Let them put their arguments, let them make their case. We will take them on. And we will defeat them. I promise you this: we will defeat them by the power of argument; by our logic; by the experience of history."" Mr Hammond insisted the British economy was ""fundamentally strong"", with employment at a record high and income inequality at its lowest level for decades. While the UK faced a number of challenges, including Brexit-related uncertainty, sluggish productivity and a housing sector which many people young people thought was ""rigged"" against them, he said free markets were the only, not merely the best, way to improve living standards and underpin free societies. The prime minister was among those in the audience ""While no-one suggests a market economy is perfect, it is the best system yet designed for making people steadily better off over time and underpinning strong and sustainable public services for everyone. ""As this model comes under renewed assault, we must not be afraid to defend it."" The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said Mr Hammond's speech offered a glimpse into an internal Conservative debate about how to take on Mr Corbyn, with some wanting to tack a little left but others saying they should stick to a full-throated defence of the free, albeit regulated, market. For Labour, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said: ""After seven wasted years of Tory economic failure... he is continuing down the path of his predecessor and clinging to an old economic model that fails the many. ""It was a speech that contained more baseless smears on Labour than Tory policy announcements. But it betrays how fearful the Tories are of the challenge posed by Jeremy Corbyn."" Carolyn Fairbairn, the director general of the CBI business group, said: ""The chancellor has given a passionate defence of free markets and the importance of business and government working to tackle inequality. That is necessary, but not sufficient. ""The UK is facing a generation defining-challenge. A potent cocktail of Brexit uncertainty and dogma-driven politics on both left and right threatens jobs, investment and living standards. Now is not the time for half measures."" The Conservatives kicked off their week in Manchesterby announcing plans to freeze student feesand pledge an extra Â£10bn for the Help to Buy scheme as part of an effort to win over younger voters. Mr Hammond said the Conservatives must ""make a clear commitment to the next generation - that they will be better off than us; and that their children will be better off again than them"". The chancellor said new funding would improve the connectivity of HS2 On rail funding, the chancellor said cities in the East Midlands, such as Leicester, would also benefit from the Â£300m modernisation and connectivity package designed to help the north reach its ""full potential"". The Northern Powerhouse rail scheme is being drawn up by local authorities and business leaders to create connections between HS2 and cities not directly on its route. On Europe, Mr Hammond said Britain could be freer and more prosperous after Brexit but people should not take such a ""prize"" outcome for granted. Earlier, he told the BBC that he operates on the basis ""everyone is sackable"", after Boris Johnson's repeated Brexit interventions prompted calls from some in the party for him to be replaced. Mr Hammond said the foreign secretary's recent interventions were a ""rhetorical flourish"" but the cabinet was agreed on a transition period of ""around two years"" to give businesses ""certainty and comfort"" to plan ahead. On the second day of the conference, Work and Pensions Secretary David Gauke alsoannounced new guidanceto job centres for giving cash advances to benefit claimants. The government has been under pressure to pause the national roll-out of Universal Credit amid mounting concern families forced to wait six weeks for their first payment will be left destitute and homeless. Mr Gauke said he wanted to help those struggling to make ends meet but would not halt the programme, saying it was helping people to find work and progress to better-paid jobs.

"Businesses need more clarity on Brexit, the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, has acknowledged. He told the BBC's Today programme the sooner the government gave businesses more certainty about the process, the sooner the economy would pick up. His comments follow warnings from the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) that public disagreements between ministers were undermining business confidence. Theresa May has said the cabinet is united on the UK's Brexit position. The prime minister said on Sunday that the cabinet, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, had agreed to the Brexit plans set out in her speech in Italy last month. Mr Johnson wrote an article for the Sun at the weekend in which he said Mrs May's planned transition phase must not last ""a second more"" than two years. It is the second time in a fortnight he has set out his own vision for Brexit. All you need to know about Brexit May urged to sack Boris Johnson Brexit 'hampered by Tory division' Speaking to the BBC, Mr Hammond said: ""There are short-term challenges and the uncertainty created by the Brexit negotiation process is one of them. ""We're already seeing some decisions being made. What we're hearing from business is a plea, 'Don't put us in a position where we have to assume the worst, give us a horizon so we can plan the future with confidence.' ""The sooner we can get some clarity, the sooner we can move forward, give businesses and investors more certainty about the future, the quicker this economy will start growing again."" He hinted there may be some room for help to business in the next Budget: ""What I've said in previous fiscal events is we have the flexibility to respond to support the economy through what is a very difficult period as we negotiate our exit from the European Union. ""We will have to be prepared to support the economy as necessary throughout this period."" Mr Hammond is expected to announce an extra Â£300m to improve rail links in the north of England in his speech to the Tory conference. The BCC, which is made up of business leaders who employ nearly six million people between them, flagged continuing business concerns about splits within government. It said business was ""growing impatient with division"" at the heart of the government, particularly around the Brexit process, and called for ministers attending the Conservative party conference to show ""competence and coherence"". The organisation's director general, Adam Marshall, said: ""Public disagreements between cabinet ministers in recent weeks have only served to undermine business confidence, not just on Brexit negotiations."" Firms also want clear action on cutting business costs, building key infrastructure, helping firms plug skills gaps, and support for investment. Another major business lobby group, the Institute of Directors (IoD), has called for the chancellor to boost private-sector investment. IoD director general Stephen Martin pointed to a survey it has carried out that suggests business optimism has declined since the start of the year. He said it showed ""that businesses are not immune to their political surroundings and confidence cannot be taken for granted"".

"Indian movie star Kamal Haasan, 62, has said he wants to enter politics. The stage seems set to witness the arrival of a new political leader in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu - Kamal Haasan. And unsurprisingly, he's a film star. Three of Tamil Nadu's chief ministers until the recent past have been actors. Haasan, 62, whom his fans call ""Ulaga Nayagan"" or ""hero of the world"", has said that he will enter politics and work towards becoming chief minister to right the wrongs of corruption and communalism in public life in Tamil Nadu. He has also said that the people of Tamil Nadu must change and become more socially and politically aware. That's a tall order given that Tamil Nadu has been wracked by political uncertainty since the death of its previous chief minister Jayaram Jayalalitha in December 2016. Tamil Nadu has been wracked by political uncertainty since the death of its previous chief minister J Jayalalithaa in December 2016. Hassan's announcement that he will enter politics has led to intense speculation that he will float his own party and rejuvenate the moribund politics of Tamil Nadu. If the state held assembly elections in ""the next 100 days I will be there"", said Haasan, who has been meeting politicians across the country in the last month. In interviews following meetings with Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal of the Aam Aadmi Party, he has indicated that he is talking to politicians from different political parties for possible coalitions in the future. Unlike his friend and rival, reigning Tamil superstar Rajnikanth, Haasan has, through the years, openly spoken of his affiliation for liberal politics. Rajnikanth said he would enter politics in May. Haasan, however, has said that the two are friendly rivals who would behave like gentlemen in politics, and not resort to personal attacks like Tamil politicians have done in the past. Rajnikanth is the reigning star of Tamil films Haasan's public persona has been that of a right-thinking individual in a state rife with corruption, and sectarian and caste hostilities. His profile as a liberal who challenges caste orthodoxies on public platforms and in his movies, and his call for humanism over religion in his films, marked a cultural shift from the cult of hero worship that stars such as Rajinikanth and MG Ramachandran (who later became the Tamil Nadu chief minister) enjoy. Given the current vacuum in political leadership, Haasan's foray into politics has not been unwelcome despite what sceptics say. Unlike Rajnikanth, who has more than 50,000 fan clubs, and a larger fan base that also constitutes a vote bank, Hassan's fan base of about 500,000 is seen as a lesser but well-organized, community-minded task force. Haasan's fan clubs, known as Narpani Iyyakam or ""movement for good deeds"", have been associated with social welfare measures, and are not prone to the frenzy and cult-style worship that Rajnikanth commands. A recent statement from the fan clubs read, ""Kamal is not like the average politician who pretends before people, but has done a lot for society through the Iyyakkam"". Tamil film stars enjoy a special kind of adulation among the population. Three chief ministers came from the film industry. His interviews in support of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign) and currency ban raised eyebrows. ""While he tends to be articulate, he has always been known to make obfuscating statements that rarely appeal to common folk"", says a senior journalist in Chennai, the southern Indian city where Haasan lives. ""He's clever and articulate unlike Rajinkanth but his habit of speaking in riddles often sends mixed signals (which are) difficult to read by the average voter"", says one political commentator. Experts familiar with politics in Tamil Nadu point out that Haasan is also known to be a blunt speaker, often lacking the diplomacy that the tricky world of politics demands. He is yet to list his ideas about how he would work on education, economics and employment in the state, or even clarify his plans to float a party of his own. Haasan has been meeting politicians across the country, including state chief ministers Haasan hails from an upper class Tamil Brahmin family of lawyers which has already thrown up two other National Award winning actors - Hassan's elder brother, Charuhasan, and his niece, Suhasini Maniratnam. His accomplishments in the last 50 years are proof of his extraordinary talent.  He made his first movie appearance as a child in 1960 and has since acted in more than 200 movies in many Indian languages, winning several prestigious national and international awards. He has alternately been called a genius and an obsessive maverick. Where only film stars win elections India Jayalalitha death: Masses mourn 'iron lady' Will Indian superstar Rajinikanth go into politics? He's skilled in Indian classical dance (Bharatanatyam) and music (Carnatic), and has sung in his own movies as well. A poet and a writer, he has also produced, acted, directed and written scripts for films. Haasan's films have often courted controversy. He has explored themes from the war against terror (Vishwaroopam) to Muslim identity (Hey Ram) to humanism and the question of faith (Anbe Sivam, Dashavataram). Can his appeal as an actor-turned-saviour bring him votes? Will the creative genius work his magic on the politics of the state?  He certainly has confidence enough to announce his intentions, no small feat in an expectant state.
